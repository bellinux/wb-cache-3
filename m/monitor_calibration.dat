50|$|<b>Monitor</b> <b>calibration</b> on a {{computer}} is done preferably with a colorimeter and software that supports it. In most cases, a monitor profile created by the calibration software (whether it relies on a hardware device or on user input) includes both an accurate description of monitor output and instructions to the video card to change the colors it displays. Video card lookup table (LUT) adjustments are usually required to help the display reach the white point and gamma desired by the user.|$|E

40|$|Changing {{technology}} and evolving systems components, such as scanners or digitizers, printers, and film continue to become unique and dissimilar. When {{making an effort}} to be precise in studies, it is important to set and maintain standards, and align all devices along the image processing workflow. System calibration, the act of checking or adjusting one device to another, is designed to do exactly this. A system is calibrated when an image appears identical at all points through the work stream. An image should look identical, and possess identical characteristics (tone, shade, contrast) each time it is scanned, and wherever it is viewed. <b>Monitor</b> <b>calibration</b> procedures have been developed to ensure what is visible on screen is representative of scanned analog imagery. Described within this document are background information needed, and <b>monitor</b> <b>calibration</b> procedures designed by Eastman Kodak Company technical staff. 1...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a specialised Partial Least Squares (PLS) algorithm for on-line <b>calibration</b> <b>monitoring.</b> At first, the basic scheme and philosophy of PEANO (Process Evaluation and Analysis by Neural Operators), an on-line <b>calibration</b> <b>monitoring</b> system, is briefly discussed.

40|$|We present {{relative}} elemental abundances for six elements (Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe) in {{the surface}} layer of 433 Eros, derived from a new analysis of the solar induced fluorescence measured by the NEARShoemaker X ray Spectrometer (XRS). XRS derived elemental abundances have been presented before. However, calibration of XRS data depends critically on knowledge of the incident solar spectrum, which varies greatly on time scales of seconds to minutes. Unfortunately, the gas solar monitor carried by NEAR was inadequately calibrated prior to launch. The previously published XRS results were based partly on broadband measurements by the Earthorbiting GOES 8 (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) Xray detectors and partly on a preliminary solar <b>monitor</b> <b>calibration</b> {{carried out by the}} present authors. The new solar <b>monitor</b> <b>calibration</b> is based on a more recent set of physical models of the solar spectrum at various temperatures, an improved fitting procedure, analysis {{of a large number of}} flight spectra, and comparison with concurrent data from the GOES Xray detectors. In addition, the new analysis includes data from three solar flares not considered in earlier papers...|$|E

50|$|Accuracy of {{the system}} is {{demonstrated}} in several ways. An internal quality assurance check is achieved by daily introduction of a certified concentration of gas to the sample probe. The EPA also allows for the use of Continuous Emissions <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Calibration</b> Systems which dilute gases to generate calibration standards. The analyzer reading must be accurate to a certain percentage. The percent accuracy can vary, but most fall between 2.5% and 5%. In power stations affected by the Acid Rain Program, annual (or bi-annual) certification {{of the system}} must be performed by an independent firm. The firm will have an independent CEM system temporarily in place to collect emissions data in parallel with the plant CEMS. This testing is referred to as a Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA).|$|R

40|$|Remotely sensed {{satellite}} data can provide {{spatial and temporal}} coverage for global environmental <b>monitoring.</b> <b>Calibration</b> and validation are very important for more accurate satellite products and {{can contribute to the}} detection of climate changes on earth.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{tutorial}} level review covering {{a wide range}} of aspects related to charged particle beam current measurement. The tutorial begins {{with a look at the}} characteristics of the beam as a signal source, the associated electromagnetic fields, the influence of the typical accelerator environment on those fields, and the usual means of modifying and controlling that environment to facilitate beam current measurement. Short descriptions of three quite different types of current monitors are presented and a quantitative review of the classical transformer circuit is given. Recognizing that environmental noise pick-up may present a large source of error in quantitative measurements, signal handling considerations are given considerable attention using real-life examples. An example of a successful transport line beam current monitor implementation is presented and the tutorial concludes with a few comments about signal processing and current <b>monitor</b> <b>calibration</b> issues...|$|E
