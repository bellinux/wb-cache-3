5|$|In Proto-Indo-European religion, the <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> personified as {{the male}} god *Meh1not. The ancient Sumerians {{believed}} that the <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> the god Nanna, who {{was the father of}} Inanna, the goddess of the planet Venus, and Utu, the god of the sun. Nanna was later known as Sîn, and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery. In Greco-Roman mythology, the Sun and the Moon are represented as male and female, respectively (Helios/Sol and Selene/Luna); this is a development unique to the eastern Mediterranean and traces of an earlier male moon god in the Greek tradition are preserved in the figure of Menelaus.|$|E
5000|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, if {{the left}} side of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> dark then the light part is growing, and the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{referred}} to as [...] (moving toward a full moon). If the right side of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> dark then the light part is shrinking, and the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> referred to as waning (past full and moving toward a new moon). Assuming that the viewer is in the northern hemisphere, the right portion of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> the part that is always growing (i.e., if the right side <b>is</b> dark, the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> growing darker; if the right side <b>is</b> lit, the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> growing lighter).|$|R
25|$|The Moon's {{elongation}} is its {{angular distance}} {{east of the}} Sun at any time. At new <b>moon,</b> it <b>is</b> zero and the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be in}} conjunction. At full <b>moon,</b> the elongation <b>is</b> 180° and it is said to be in opposition. In both cases, the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> in syzygy, that <b>is,</b> the Sun, <b>Moon</b> and Earth <b>are</b> nearly aligned. When elongation is either 90° or 270°, the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> said to be in quadrature.|$|R
5000|$|The phrase the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> made {{of green}} cheese {{refers to the}} {{similarity}} in appearance of a typical round, green cheese and the full <b>Moon.</b> It <b>is</b> commonly misinterpreted to mean that the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> green in colour, which isn't the case. (The surface of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> quite dark and {{could be described as}} having the color of old, weathered black asphalt.) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} simulation {{shows the}} approximate {{appearance of the}} Moon passing through the Earth's shadow. The Moon's brightness is exaggerated within the umbral shadow.

As it happened, during this period the invaders would have encountered a major storm lasting four days, between 19 and 22 June, that would have made the initial landings impossible.|$|E
