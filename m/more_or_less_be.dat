Although Kathakali is a dance drama and its literary form should <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>be</b> modeled after the drama, there is nothing more in common between an Attakkatha and Sanskrit drama.|$|E

The {{habit of}} {{constantly}} carrying everything {{up to the}} utmost point of completion deadens the Pre-Raphaelites in general to the merits of men who, with an equal love of truth {{up to a certain}} point, yet express themselves habitually with speed and power, rather than with finish, and give abstracts of truth rather than total truth. Probably to the end of time artists will <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>be</b> divided into these classes, and it will be impossible to make men like Millais understand the merits of men like Tintoret; but this is the more to be regretted because the Pre-Raphaelites have enormous powers of imagination, as well as of realization, and do not yet themselves know of how much they would be capable, if they sometimes worked on a larger scale, and with a less laborious finish.|$|E
6000|$|Who the Perpetrator of this Parisian maleficence was, {{remained}} dark;--and {{would not}} be worth inquiring into at all, except for two reasons intrinsically trifling, but not quite without interest to readers of our time. First, that Voltaire, whom some suspected (some, never much Friedrich, that I hear of), {{appears to have been}} perfectly innocent;--and indeed had been incapacitated for guilt, by Schmidt and Freytag, and their dreadful Frankfurt procedures! This is reason FIRST; poor Voltaire mutely asking us, Not to load him with more sins than his own. Reason SECOND is, that, by a singular opportunity, there has, in these very months, [Spring, 1863.] a glimmering of light risen on it to this Editor; illustrating two other points as well, which readers here are acquainted with, some time ago, as riddles of the insignificant sort. The DEMON NEWSWRITER, with his [...] "IDEA" [...] of Friedrich, and the [...] "MATINEES DU ROI DE PRUSSE:" [...] readers recollect both those Productions; both enigmatic as to authorship;--but both now become riddles which can <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>be</b> read.|$|E
60|$|But if this {{be true of}} {{that simple}} case, which I put before you, where there is nothing but the rivalry of one member of a species with others, what must be the {{operation}} of selective conditions, when you recollect {{as a matter of}} fact, that for every species of animal or plant there are fifty or a hundred species which might all, <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less,</b> <b>be</b> comprehended in the same climate, food, and station;--that every plant has multitudinous animals which prey upon it, and which are its direct opponents; and that these have other animals preying upon them,--that every plant has its indirect helpers in the birds that scatter abroad its seed, and the animals that manure it with their dung;--I say, when these things are considered, it seems impossible that any variation which may arise in a species in nature should not tend in some way or other either to be a little better or worse than the previous stock; if it is a little better it will have an advantage over and tend to extirpate the latter in this crush and struggle; and if it is a little worse it will itself be extirpated.|$|E

The {{evidence}} {{collected in}} the following pages, in support of their pleading, is so complete, and the summary of his cause given with so temperate mastery by Mr. Somervell, that I find nothing to add in circumstance, and little to re-enforce in argument. And I have less heart to the writing even of what brief preface so good work might by its author's courtesy be permitted to receive from me, occupied as I so long have been in efforts tending in the same direction, because, on that very account, I am far less interested than my friend in this local and limited resistance to the elsewhere fatally victorious current of modern folly, cruelty, and ruin. When the frenzy of avarice is daily drowning our sailors, suffocating our miners, poisoning our children, and blasting the cultivable surface of England into a treeless waste of ashes,[20] what {{does it really matter}} whether a flock of sheep, <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less,</b> <b>be</b> driven from the slopes of Helvellyn, or the little pool of Thirlmere filled with shale, or a few wild blossoms of St. John's vale lost to the coronal of English spring? Little to anyone; and--let me say this, at least, in the outset of all saying--nothing to me. No one need charge me with selfishness in any word or action for defense of these mossy hills. I do not move, with such small activity as I have yet shown in the business, because I live at Coniston (where no sound of the iron wheels by Dunmail Raise can reach me), nor because I can find no other place to remember Wordsworth by, than the daffodil margin of his little Rydal marsh. What thoughts and work are yet before me, such as he taught, must be independent of any narrow associations. All my own dear mountain grounds and treasure-cities, Chamouni, Interlachen, Lucerne, Geneva, Venice, are long ago destroyed by the European populace; and now, for my own part, I don't care what more they do; they may drain Loch Katrine, drink Loch Lomond, and blow all Wales and Cumberland into a heap of slate shingle; the world is wide enough yet to find me some refuge during the days appointed for me to stay in it. But it is no less my duty, in the cause of those to whom the sweet landscapes of England are yet precious, and to whom they may yet teach what they taught me, in early boyhood, and would still if I had it now to learn,--it is my duty to plead with what earnestness I may, that these sacred sibylline books may be redeemed from perishing.|$|E

5000|$|The CPU {{simulator}} {{is often}} the most complicated part of an emulator. Many emulators are written using [...] "pre-packaged" [...] CPU simulators, in order to concentrate on good and efficient emulation of a specific machine. The simplest form of a CPU simulator is an interpreter, which is a computer program that follows the execution flow of the emulated program code and, for every machine code instruction encountered, executes operations on the host processor that are semantically equivalent to the original instructions. This is made possible by assigning a variable to each register and flag of the simulated CPU. The logic of the simulated CPU can then <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>be</b> directly translated into software algorithms, creating a software re-implementation that basically mirrors the original hardware implementation.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid 70's, {{just prior}} to the dawn of live {{syndicated}} broadcasting via satellite link, a new form of syndicated all-day programming had been introduced.

This System operated by using an early form of computerized automation system to control four large 10.5" [...] 2-track open reel to reel tape decks, two commercial holding rotating carousels for carts, a voice tape/music tape synchronizer and an early computer system to control the entire system. The hardware system itself was marketed by SMC, or the Sono-Mag Corporation.

5000|$|Sticky buns are {{a dessert}} or breakfast sweet roll that {{generally}} consist of rolled pieces of leavened dough — sometimes containing brown sugar or cinnamon — {{which are then}} compressed {{together to form a}} kind of flat loaf corresponding {{to the size of the}} baking pan. Before the dough is placed in the pan, the latter is lined with the [...] "sticky" [...] ingredients like maple syrup, honey (or both), as well as nuts and perhaps more sugar and sometimes butter. After the buns are baked, they are inverted so that the pan lining then becomes a topping. Commercially produced sticky buns, however, are usually just baked in an aluminum loaf tin, which allows the topping to suffuse the buns, making them sticky throughout. The way the buns were baked allows them to <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>be</b> pulled off as individual servings, although it is often a futile effort.|$|E
50|$|According to Wright, {{employees}} with sought-after and reward-inelastically supplied skills (due to natural scarcities or socially constructed and imposed restrictions on supply, such as licensing, {{barriers to entry}} into training programs, etc.) are in a 'privileged surplus appropriation location within exploitation relations' because, while they are not capitalists, {{they are able to}} obtain more privileges through their relation to the owner of the means of production than less skilled workers and harder to monitor and evaluate in terms of labor effort. The owner(s) of the means of production or their employer in general therefore has to pay them a 'scarcity' or 'skill/credential' rent (thus raising their compensation above the actual cost of producing and reproducing their labor power) and tries to 'buy' their loyalty by giving them ownership stakes, endowing them with delegated authority over their fellow workers and/or allowing them to <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>be</b> autonomous in determining the pace and direction of their work. Thus, experts, managers of experts, and executive managers tend to be closer to the interests of the 'bosses' than to other workers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{yellow press}} also blamed the {{minister}} of war, for keeping the arrest a secret, {{in the hope of}} being able to hush up the affair; he was said to be in league with [...] "the Jews". General Mercier now understood that the condemnation of Dreyfus was a question of his own political life or death; convinced or not, he determined to establish the man's guilt. On November 28, he declared in an interview with Le Figaro that Dreyfus' guilt was [...] "absolutely certain." [...] Then, aware of the defects of the evidence, he ordered that a secret dossier should be prepared by collecting from the drawers of the Intelligence Department whatever documents concerning spies could <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>be</b> ascribed to Dreyfus. This dossier, revised and put into a sealed envelope by Mercier himself, with the cooperation of Boisdeffre and of Sandherr, was to be communicated only to the judges in the room where they held their deliberations, without either the accused or his counsel having been able to see it.|$|E
