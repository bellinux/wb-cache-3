5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other <b>man-made</b> <b>objects.</b>|$|E

Such targets include natural {{objects such as}} ground, sea, and when not being tasked for meteorological purposes, precipitation (such as rain, snow or hail), sand storms, animals (especially birds), atmospheric turbulence, and other atmospheric effects, such as ionosphere reflections, meteor trails, and Hail spike.

Sexual maturity is reached after one year of age. Blue jays have been recorded to live for more than 26 years in captivity and one wild jay {{was found to have}} been around 17 and a half years old. A more common lifespan for wild birds that survive to adulthood is around 7 years. Beyond predation and the occasional collision with <b>man-made</b> <b>objects,</b> a common cause of mortality in recent decades has been the West Nile Virus, which corvids as a whole seem especially susceptible to.

25|$|However, the Industrial Revolution continued. Influential {{innovations}} included steam-powered industrialization, {{and especially}} the development of railways, starting in Britain in the 1830s, and the subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture associated with this. A major 19th-century engineering achievement was The Crystal Palace, the huge cast-iron and plate glass exhibition hall built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. Glass and iron were used in a similar monumental style {{in the construction of}} major railway terminals in London, such as Paddington Station (1854) and King's Cross station (1852). These technological advances led to the building of later structures like the Brooklyn Bridge (1883) and the Eiffel Tower (1889). The latter broke all previous limitations on how tall <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> could be. These engineering marvels radically altered the 19th-century urban environment and the daily lives of people. The human experience of time itself was altered, with the development of the electric telegraph from 1837, and the adoption of standard time by British railway companies from 1845, and {{in the rest of the}} world over the next fifty years.|$|E

500|$|The {{tiger shark}} is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter. It is notable {{for having the}} widest food {{spectrum}} of all sharks, {{with a range of}} prey that includes crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, sea snakes, dolphins, and even other smaller sharks. It also has a reputation as a [...] "garbage eater", consuming a variety of inedible, <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> that linger in its stomach. [...] Though apex predators, tiger sharks are sometimes taken by groups of killer whales. It is considered a near threatened species due to finning and fishing by humans.|$|E
500|$|The uneven {{solar heating}} (the {{formation}} of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) {{can also be}} due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. [...] Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or <b>man-made</b> <b>objects)</b> have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.|$|E
500|$|In the 2nd and 1st century BC (late La Tène period) they {{followed}} {{the lead of the}} more advanced Celts, who had established population enclaves in southern and middle Poland. The Przeworsk culture developed {{as a result of the}} local populations' adoption of the La Tène culture models. The passage of the Bastarnae and Scirii and the associated unrest likely functioned as the outside catalyzing agent: Jastorf culture archeological material has been found in pre-Przeworsk artifact assemblages and in some of the early Przeworsk range. The Przeworsk people mastered and implemented the various achievements of the Celts, most importantly developing large scale production of iron. Local bog ores were used for that purpose. They sometimes formed mixed groups and cooperated within common settlements [...] with the Celts, of which the Tyniec group in the Kraków region and another one in Kujawy are the known examples. Arms, clothes and ornaments were patterned after the Celtic products. In the early stages the Przeworsk people displayed no social distinction, their graves were alike and flat, and ashes together with funeral gifts buried usually without urns. Religious practices of pagan Germanic people included offering ceremonies performed in swamp areas, involving <b>man-made</b> <b>objects,</b> produce, farm animals, or even human sacrifice, as was the case at a site near Słowikowo in Słupca County; another such investigated site is in Otalążka, Grójec County. Dog burials within or around a homestead were another form of protective offerings.|$|E

2500|$|Another type {{of still}} life, known as ontbijtjes or [...] "breakfast paintings", {{represent}} both a literal presentation of delicacies that {{the upper class}} might enjoy and a religious reminder to avoid gluttony.
