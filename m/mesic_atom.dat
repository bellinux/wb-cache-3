40|$|Angular {{distribution}} of neutrinos (recoil nucleus) in muon capture for an allowed Gamov-Teller transition {{is considered by}} taking account of hyperfine effects. This angular distribution is shown to include a correlation of the form ∼ P 2 (cos θ), where θ is the angle between the neutrino momentum and the axis specifying {{the orientation of the}} initial <b>mesic</b> <b>atom</b> This correlation, which arises only if the initial <b>mesic</b> <b>atom</b> is aligned, proves highly sensitive to the form factor gP of induced pseudoscalar interaction. The proposed method for determinating gP may be realized for the transition 1 + → 2 + from the ground state of the 6 Li nucleus to the narrow resonance of the 6 He nucleus in continuum, {{as well as in the}} processes like 10 B(3 +) → 10 Be(2 +), 11 B(3 / 2 −) → 11 Be(1 / 2 −), 23 Na(3 / 2 +) ...|$|E

Introduction and Motivation In the contemporary hadron physics, the light pseudoscalar mesons (π, K, η) are recognized as the Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the QCD chiral symmetry.

40|$|The hyperfine {{effect in}} muon capture rate is {{analyzed}} with {{taking into account}} of the second-order terms in 1 /M in the non-relativistic Hamiltonian. It is shown that in {{the situation of the}} dominance of the squared first-order terms the interference of zero-order and second-order terms has no significant influence. General expression for neutrino (recoil nucleus) angular distribution in muon capture by nucleus with non-zero spin is proposed. High sensitivity to $g_P$ of the term related with alignment of the initial <b>mesic</b> <b>atom</b> is discussed in the approximation of dominating Gamow [...] Teller matrix element.

40|$|The T-noninvariant {{transverse}} {{polarization of}} neutrons is considered for muon capture by a 6 -Li nucleus with decay into a quasistationary 2 + {{state of the}} three particle alpha+n+n continuum. This polarization is orthogonal to the plane spanned by the polarization axis of the initial <b>mesic</b> <b>atom</b> and the neutron momentum. The situation in which neutrons that are emitted in the plane orthogonal to the axis of the mesic-atom polarization and which have oppositely directed momenta equal in magnitude are selected is analyzed. The wave function of the final state is constructed by using the method of hyperspherical harmonics. In the approximation of the allowed Gamow-Teller transition 1 + to 2 +, this neutron polarization is {{expressed in terms of}} the T-noninvariant relative phase of reduced matrix elements for transitions from the 6 -Li ground state to various final-state configurations.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that new spin-orbit-like terms {{appear in the}} {{effective}} nonrelativistic weak Hamiltonian for nucleon provided that nuclear potential is taken into account. Arguments for their considerable enhancement, in particular, in relativistic nuclear model of Walecka are advanced. PACS. 23. 40. -s beta decay; double beta decay; electron and muon capture, 25. 30. Pt Neutrino scattering Effective weak Hamiltonian for nucleon is given by covariant product of lepton current Jλ and nucleon current operator Γλ. To use nonrelativistic nucleon wave functions one puts effective Hamiltonian to nonrelativistic form by Foldy–Wouthuysen (FW) transformation (see, e. g., [1]). Nonrelativistic Hamiltonian is a power series in kλ/M, where kλ is the 4 -vector of transferred momentum, and M is the nucleon mass. To describe β-decay, where an energy release is about 10 − 3 M, one uses only zero order terms. Whereas first order terms are of importance for muon capture, where an energy release is about 10 − 1 M, {{as well as for}} neutrino-induced reactions involving transferred momenta of the same order of magnitude. For the sake of definiteness we shall consider muon capture. Before capture a muon is in the 1 s state of <b>mesic</b> <b>atom</b> and is described by the 4 -component wave function ψµ(rµ,t), Eµ is the total energy of muon. A final neutrino with momentum kν and energy Eν = kν is described by the 4 -component wave function ψν(rν,t). Assuming that the weak nucleon-lepton interaction is pointlike one obtains for the lepton current Jλ = iψ + ν (r,t) γ 4 γλ(1 + γ 5) ψµ(r,t).

40|$|The anti-D meson self-energy is {{evaluated}} self-consistently, using unitarized coupled-channel theory, {{by computing}} the in-medium meson-baryon T-matrix in the C=- 1,S= 0 sector.

40|$|K^-$ mesons offer {{a unique}} setting where <b>mesic</b> <b>atoms</b> {{have been studied}} both {{experimentally}} and theoretically, thereby placing constraints on the possible existence and properties of meson-nuclear quasibound states. Here we review progress in this field made recently by the Jerusalem [...] Prague Collaboration using near-threshold $K^-N$ scattering amplitudes generated in several meson [...] baryon coupled channels models inspired by a chiral EFT approach. Our own procedure of handling subthreshold kinematics self consistently is used to transform these free-space energy dependent amplitudes to in-medium density dependent amplitudes from which $K^-$ optical potentials are derived. To fit the world data of kaonic atoms, these single-nucleon optical potentials are augmented by multi-nucleon terms. It is found that {{only two of the}} studied models reproduce also the single-nucleon absorption fractions available from old bubble chamber experiments. These two models are then checked for possible $K^-$ nuclear quasibound states, despite realizing that $K^-$ optical potentials are not constrained by kaonic atom data at densities exceeding half nuclear-matter density. We find that when such states exist, their widths are invariably above 100 MeV, forbiddingly large to allow observation. Multi-nucleon absorption is found to be substantial in this respect. This suggests that observable strongly bound $K^-$ mesons are limited to the very light systems, such as $K^-pp$. Comment: presented by A. Gal at Hadron 2017, Sept. 2017, Salamanca, Spain; prepared for Proceedings of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of a recent {{experiment}} involving the stopping of negative K mesons in a 10 -inch liquid hydrogen bubble chamber, an interesting new reaction was observed to take place. The chamber is traversed by many more negative {mu} mesons than K mesons, so that in the last 75, 000 photographs, approximately 2500 {mu}{sup -} decays at rest have been observed. In the same pictures, several hundred {pi}{sup -} mesons have been observed to disappear at rest, presumably by one of the ''Panofsky reactions''. For tracks longer than 10 cm, it is possible to distinguish a stopping {mu} meson from a stopping {pi} meson by comparing its curved path (in a field of 11, 000 gauss) with that of a calculated template. In addition to the normal {pi}{sup -} and {mu}{sup -} stoppings, we have observed 15 cases in which what appears (from curvature measurement) to be a {mu}{sup -} meson comes to rest in the hydrogen, and then gives rise to a secondary negative particle of 1. 7 cm range, which in turn decays by emitting an electron. (A 4. 1 -Mev {mu} meson from {pi} - {mu} decay has a range of 1. 0 cm.) The energy spectrum of the electrons from these 15 secondary particles looks remarkably like that of the {mu} meson. There are four electrons in the energy range 50 to 55 Mev, and none higher; the other electrons have energies varying from 50 Mev to 13 Mev. The most convincing proof that the primary particle actually comes to rest, and does not [...] for example [...] have a large resonant cross section for scattering at a residual range of 1. 7 cm, is the following: In five of the 15 special events, there is a large gap between the last bubble of the primary track and the first bubble of the secondary track. This gap is a real effect, and not merely a statistical fluctuation in the spacing of the bubbles, since in some cases the tracks form a letter X, and in another case the secondary track is parallel to the primary, but displaced transversely by about 1 mm {{at the end of the}} primary. These real gaps appear also (although perhaps less frequently) between some otherwise normal-looking {mu}{sup -} endings and the subsequent decay electron; they are thought to be the distance traveled by the small neutral <b>mesic</b> <b>atom...</b>|$|E
