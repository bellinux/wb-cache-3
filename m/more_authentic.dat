5|$|By {{the time}} Warde's article was {{published}} some revivals {{had been released}} that were <b>more</b> <b>authentic</b> revivals of Garamond's work, based on period books and printing specimens. The German company Stempel brought out a crisp revival of the original Garamond typefaces in the 1920s, inspired by a rediscovered specimen from the Egenolff-Berner foundry in Frankfurt, as did Linotype in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Season mode was {{replaced}} with Road to WrestleMania in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, and remained in the games until WWE '12. In this mode, players could choose from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player storylines. The difference is that each storyline is tailor made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode is a <b>more</b> <b>authentic</b> experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a <b>more</b> <b>authentic</b> and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{essentially}} African American {{nature of}} ragtime, {{it is most}} commonly considered the first style of American popular music to be truly black music; ragtime brought syncopation and a <b>more</b> <b>authentic</b> black sound to popular music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet music, but the general style was played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more free-flowing form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on jazz.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} quality and craft {{that went into the}} compilation's design. Jaz Rignall (USgamer) was {{impressed}} by the compilation's presentation and balance between frills and efficiency, and Dan Whitehead (Eurogamer) felt that the theatrical theme fit Rare's character. Reviewers considered Rare Replay a high-water mark for video game compilations—Kotaku called it the best since Valve's The Orange Box. On the other hand, Jeremy Parish (USgamer) found the contemporaneous Mega Man Legacy Collection Criterion Collection-style presentation to be a <b>more</b> <b>authentic</b> appreciation of its original material. Chris Plante (The Verge) saw Rare Replay slight hardware improvements and added touches as a viable model for putting retrogames back on the market and slowing the tide of unlicensed downloads.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Strike is set {{after the}} {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, and takes place in a fictionalised Russia, Eastern Europe and around the Caspian Sea. The player pilots an Apache helicopter and battles with the forces of Shadowman, a renegade ex-Communist figure. Like its predecessors, the game features shooting action mixed with strategic management of fuel and ammunition, but has <b>more</b> <b>authentic</b> 3D graphics, as well as a modified overhead - as opposed to isometric - perspective. The game also features a more realistic enemy artificial intelligence and environment. Critics received the game positively, praising the graphics and full motion video, while commentary on the gameplay and difficulty was more mixed.|$|E

50|$|In the United States (and elsewhere), renewed {{interest}} in Western martial arts (beginning in the 1990s) has led some groups—often peer-led—to attempt to study classical fencing (e.g. from books or instructional videos) without the guidance of a classically trained instructor, creating further variation in the classical fencing community. These groups, {{in an effort to}} become <b>more</b> historically <b>authentic,</b> sometimes shift their focus to older, pre-19th-century weapons and techniques—i.e. historical fencing.|$|R
5|$|In the 17th century, George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie wrote {{a history}} of the Mackenzies, which {{included}} a genealogy of the MacLeods of Lewis (from whom he was also descended). Cromartie's genealogy listed Leod as a son of Harald, son of Godred Donn. Later genealogies, however, made Leod a son of Olaf the Black—genealogies found in Sir Robert Douglas of Glenbervie's Baronage of Scotland, of 1798; and the Bannatyne manuscript, which dates to about 1830. In the Baronage of Scotland, Glenbervie stated that he had obtained information from the MacLeods of Dunvegan which was allegedly based upon information found within the mediaeval Chronicles of Mann and William Camden's 17th century Britannia—however, neither of these two works make any mention of Leod at all. In 1977, historian William Matheson rejected the traditional descent from Olaf the Black on the basis that it is unsupported by any facts whatsoever, and that it is also contradicted by earlier Gaelic-language genealogies which may be <b>more</b> <b>authentic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} of the musical score of L'incoronazione exist, both from the 1650s. The first was rediscovered in Venice in 1888, the second in Naples in 1930. The Naples score {{is linked to the}} revival of the opera in that city in 1651. Both scores contain essentially the same music, though each differs from the printed libretto and has unique additions and omissions. In each score the vocal lines are shown with basso continuo accompaniment; the instrumental sections are written in three parts in the Venice score, four parts in the Naples version, without in either case specifying the instruments. Conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, a leading Monteverdi interpreter, refers to the contemporary practice of leaving much of a score open, to allow for differing local performance conditions. Another convention made it unnecessary to write down detail that performers would take for granted. Neither Venice nor Naples score can be linked to the original performance; although the Venice version is generally regarded as the <b>more</b> <b>authentic,</b> modern productions tend to use material from both.|$|E

2500|$|The prefix paleo {{derives from}} the Greek root [...] meaning [...] "ancient" [...] or [...] "old".

50|$|Biblical {{scholars}} {{doubt the}} authenticity of the text.

In account of the martyrs themselves, Gurya, Shmona, and Habbib's names are present in a Syriac martyrology calendar manuscript dated to 411 AD as the names Sharbel, Barsamya and Addai are not.|$|R

50|$|Free jazz, {{especially}} during its inception, contains themes of both progressive musical language and gathering {{inspiration from the}} past. The rejection of the bop aesthetic was combined with an increased fascination with earlier styles of jazz such as Dixieland jazz with its collective improvisation, as well as African music. This interest in older and <b>more</b> culturally <b>authentic</b> forms of music resulted in the incorporation of instruments {{from a variety of}} global cultures by many free jazz musicians. This includes Ed Blackwell's use of the West African talking drum, and Leon Thomas's interpretation of pygmy yodeling.|$|R

Subjects were then interviewed to assess their affective responses to each text. Results indicated that all students comprehended significantly <b>more</b> from the <b>authentic</b> passage than from the- edited ones.

40|$|The {{cultural}} work of {{the western}} and its generic forebears has been, in part, to support policies of colonial domination, such as Indian Removal and Land Allotment Acts, and this cultural work has been remediated in Red Dead Redemption, in which players are rewarded for performing acts of colonial domination. Because “actual Indigenous people are judged as <b>more</b> or less <b>authentic,</b> <b>more</b> or less real, {{to the extent that}} they live up or down to a fictitious representation” (Joanne DiNova Spiraling Webs of Relation 24), it is vital that we understand the genealogy of the genres that underpin Eurocentric thought and inscribe fantastical, pervasive, and durable narratives of Indigenous identity. By countering and refuting such representations, we can envision remedies for this ludo-colonization and even reclaim and “re”-vision how video games can operate to decolonize rather than continually reenact modes of colonization...|$|R
