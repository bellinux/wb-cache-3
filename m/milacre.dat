40|$|The {{quantity}} and quality of eucalypt regeneration in all the important forest types on Surrey Hills and adjacent areas has been evaluated in the period between October 1969 and August 1971. The rate of stocking was determined by estimating numbers and distribution of seedlings. Growth was estimated by determining height increment with age. Both stocking and growth were related to a) the site quality evaluated from past forest growth, and b) by the logging and regeneration practice used on the area. The survey was conducted by sampling on a grid pattern using <b>milacre</b> plots at a spacing of 4 x 1 chains as described by Mount (1961). A total of 1, 800 plots were sampled...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1961 A {{survey of}} natural {{regeneration}} of Doug 1 as-fir and associated species {{was made on}} 15 staggered-setting cuttings four and five years after logging. These areas were on the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest which {{is located in the}} McKenzie River area of western Oregon. Five types of cuttings were represented: (1) four north-south oriented strip clear cuts varying from 50 to 330 feet in width; (2) three east-west orientated strip clear-cut varying from 100 to 300 feet in width; (3) six patch or group clear-cuts varying from one fourth to four acres in size; (4) a shade-seed-tree cutting on which residual trees were left to provide shade and seed; and (5) a typical staggered-setting clear-cut. The modified cuttings were designed to utilize shade from the residual stand to favor regeneration by reducing high surface, soil temperatures, a major deterrent to the establishment of tree seedlings in this area. Results of the survey showed that all of the modified cutting units were better stocked than the typical staggered-setting clearcut and with two exceptions had at least 500 we 11 -spaced trees per acre. The east-west orientated strips regenerated best with 69 to 89 percent of <b>milacre</b> plots stocked. The small group clearcuts also regenerated well; stocking varied from 8 to 72 percent of <b>milacre</b> plots stocked. The north-south orientated strips were the most poorly stocked group of small cuttings with from 35 to 61 percent of <b>milacre</b> plots stocked. The shade-seed-tree cutting had 61 percent of plots stocked and the staggered-setting clearcut 28 percent of plots stocked. The statistical analysis indicated that the parameter of shade hours per plot was consistently related to regeneration of all species together and of Douglas-fir alone. The degree of this relationship varied considerably between types of units {{and to a lesser extent}} among units of a particular type. In addition there was some evidence that intermittent shading was more effective in favoring regeneration than a similar amount of shade received in a single period of time. Distance from seed source was not found to be related to stocking on the small cutting units studied. This author concludes that consideration should be given to the use of special cutting methods such as east-west orientated strip clearcuts, small patch clearcuts, and shade-seed-tree cuttings, to aid in natural regeneration of Douglas fir, especially on severe sites. These cuttings should be laid out primarily to provide shade rather than from the standpoint of seed dispersal...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Six, recent {{clear cut}} areas were {{selected}} in the Douglas-fir zone of the Western Cascade Range of Oregon to determine the environmental and nutritional effects that snowbrush has on the establishment and growth of Douglas-fir seedlings. One thousand eighty <b>milacre</b> sample plots on the six clear cuts {{were used to determine}} the survival, total height growth and browsing damage of Douglas-fir seedlings. The nutrient status of the seedlings growing in association with snowbrush and in the open was also determined on the six clear cuts. Needles on the current year's growth were analyzed at three times during the year, for nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus. The nutrient levels of the seedlings were then related to their position relative to snowbrush. The percent total nitrogen and the exchangeable calcium, magnesium and potassium in the soil under snowbrush and in the open were analyzed. Three of the six clear cuts were selected and soil moisture in the open, along the edge and under snowbrush was measured with Colman fiberglas moisture blocks and gravimetrically, In all, 33 moisture stations were used. Moisture was measured at 2, 6 and 24 inches. At each moisture station, the maximum soil surface temperature was determined with a maximum reading mercury thermometer. In addition to the mercury thermometers, six continuous recording thermometers were used to determine the number of consecutive days on which high soil temperature occurred. Precipitation through the growing season, both in the open and under snowbrush, was determined with home-made rain gauges. Survival and growth of planted Douglas-fir seedlings were better under snowbrush than in the open. The <b>milacre</b> stocking under snowbrush was 48...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Eight-year {{reproduction}} was inventoried {{in permanent}} plots in 10 small patch cuts in a mixed bottomland forest by the Tombigbee River in western Alabama. Overall, there was adequate reproduction of commercial tree species (1174 stems per acre), {{but there were}} some scattered unstacked areas. The overall reproduction of oaks was relatively poor (an average of 340 per acre and less than 20 percent <b>milacre</b> plot stocking) and cherrybark, Shumard, and swamp chestnut oak reproduction was probably not sufficient to recover their proportions that existed in the preharvest overstory. Water/willow oaks were more successful than the other oaks and may attain equal or higher levels in the future stand compared to the preharvest overstory. Understocked areas in the patches resulted primarily from development of heavy woody vine and shrub cover, with grapevine the most important problem. The eight-year stocking of oaks originated primarily from advance reproduction less than one foot tall and from post harvest germination of acorns. The contribution of large advance oak reproduction was very small, due to the very low numbers present before harvest...|$|E
