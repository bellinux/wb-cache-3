500|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} July 2011 over {{the raising of}} the federal debt limit, which was needed to prevent a default by the United States government. [...] Republicans in Congress demanded spending cuts in the budgets for 2012 and subsequent years in return for raising the debt limit. [...] On July 19, 2011, the Republican-led House passed a bill, the Cut, Cap and Balance Act, {{by a margin of}} 234–190 which would require $111 billion in cuts in 2012 spending levels, exempting defense, <b>Medicare,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> from these cuts, and would limit subsequent federal spending to about 20% of the gross national product as compared to the current 24%. [...] It did not immediately increase the debt limit, but would have required Congress to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution before increasing the debt limit. [...] The bill was tabled by a vote of 51–46 in the Senate on July 22, and thus defeated. [...] An alternate plan proposed by the bipartisan Gang of Six senators and favored by the Obama administration would contain about $3.7 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade, including both new revenue and large spending cuts, including in entitlement healthcare and defense, failed to gain traction.|$|E
500|$|Throughout April, {{the draft}} efforts continued, and Perot {{appeared}} on talk shows, discussing his plans and positions on political issues. During {{an appearance on}} Larry King Live, Perot stated that he was closer to a decision on a potential campaign, {{and that he was}} willing to spend $100 million of his own money to finance it. On the Today Show he was interviewed by Katie Couric, and proposed to cut <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> for [...] "people who don't need it". He appeared on Face the Nation later in the month, and argued that wealthy Americans should spend more than average Americans to eliminate the budget deficit. His budget numbers were contested by Tim Russert on Meet the Press, during a heated interview, after which, a frustrated Perot considered dropping out of the race. [...] C-SPAN ran a speech by Perot, where he announced that he hoped to run a campaign without [...] "political pros" [...] to avoid the [...] "dirty tricks" [...] of past campaigns. After this appearance, campaign consultant Raymond Strother explained to Perot that professionals such as pollster Mark Penn were essential to a successful campaign. In late April, Perot hired former Chicago Tribune editor James Squires as press spokesman to handle the large volume of interview requests from the media. At the end of the month, Perot realized that he had spent too much time visiting talk shows, and announced that he would spend his next few weeks focusing on the issues.|$|E

2500|$|Political realities {{make major}} {{budgetary}} deals difficult to achieve. While Republicans argue conceptually for reductions in <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security,</b> they {{are hesitant to}} actually vote to reduce the benefits from these popular programs. Democrats {{on the other hand}} argue conceptually for tax increases on the wealthy, yet may be hesitant to vote for them because of the effect on campaign donations from the wealthy. The so-called budgetary [...] "grand bargain" [...] of tax hikes on the rich and removal of some popular tax deductions in exchange for reductions to <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> is therefore elusive.|$|E

2500|$|One of Turner's {{campaign}} themes was fiscal recovery through cuts {{in federal}} spending. He {{said that the}} federal budget needed to be cut {{by as much as}} a third, that capital gains taxes should be eliminated, and corporate and individual income taxes reduced. He opposed what Democrats said were Republican plans to privatize <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> and turn Medicaid into a block-grant program, reportedly at the request of former New York mayor Ed Koch, who supported him. In endorsing Turner's opponent, The New York Times said that Turner's economic plan to reduce taxes without reducing benefits for current <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> recipients was unrealistic. [...] "That would take a magician, not a businessman", said the Times. One month before the election, Turner admitted that an op-ed he written for the National Review calling for a one third reduction in federal spending and [...] "an end to government dependencies" [...] was [...] "blatant pandering" [...] to [...] "a particular audience".|$|E

First, the fiscal stimulus effectively mitigates the recession. Second, debt as a percentage of GDP is only slightly greater with the fiscal stimulus than it would be without the stimulus. ...|$|R

2500|$|Donald Trump's {{campaign}} drew {{heavily on}} his personal image, enhanced by his previous media exposure. The primary slogan of the Trump campaign, extensively used on campaign merchandise, was Make America Great Again. The red baseball cap with the slogan emblazoned on the front {{became a symbol of}} the campaign, and has been frequently donned by Trump and his supporters. Trump's right-wing populist positions—reported by The New Yorker to be nativist, protectionist, and semi-isolationist—differ in many ways from traditional conservatism. He opposed many free trade deals and military interventionist policies that conservatives generally support, and opposed cuts in <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits. Moreover, he has insisted that Washington is [...] "broken" [...] and can only be fixed by an outsider.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, a protester {{affiliated}} with the Occupy Wall Street movement shouted during Turner's ceremonial swearing-in. Turner then criticized the OWS demonstrators as socialist and praised America's capitalist system as a [...] "beacon to the world". Turner voted for Paul Ryan's revised budget plan in 2012, despite reluctance that it would privatize <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security.</b> Turner promised during his campaign to protect Social Security, and explicitly said he would vote no to the Ryan plan. Turner's spokesman defended his vote for the bill, saying Turner was opposed to many of its provisions, but believed {{it was a good}} starting point for negotiations because it would not be finalized without compromise with the Democratic-controlled Senate. However, Turner did suggest raising the minimum age from 65.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Anderson Cooper on November 3, 2010, when discussing cuts in government spending for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> suggested by Congressman Paul Ryan, Bachmann was asked what cuts in government spending she would make to reduce the deficit. She cited President Obama's then-upcoming visit to Asia as an example, saying it [...] "is expected to cost the taxpayers $200million a day. He's taking two thousand people with him. He'll be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are 5-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. This {{is the kind of}} over-the-top spending, it's a very small example, Anderson." [...] Bachmann was apparently referring to information in a story from the Press Trust of India, attributed to [...] "a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit", information that was also published in U.S.-based media such as The Drudge Report. In response to the news report's claim that 34 warships were accompanying the President, a Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, dismissed the account as [...] "comical". The White House said that the press report figures were [...] "wildly inflated" [...] and had [...] "no basis in reality". While stating that they could not give the actual projected figures for security reasons, staffers maintained costs were in line with the official travel costs of previous presidents Bush and Clinton.|$|E
