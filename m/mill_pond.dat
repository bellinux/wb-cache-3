5|$|Most of the CCC-built park {{facilities}} {{are still in}} use today, including log cabins, picnic pavilions, a food concession stand, and miles of trails. Early on, the CCC constructed a dam at Black Moshannon Lake, {{on the site of}} the former <b>mill</b> <b>pond</b> dam. CCC Camp S-71closed in January 1937and Black Moshannon State Park officially re-opened that same year.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{surviving}} documentation for {{the creation}} of Van Cortlandt Lake. In 1699, Jacobus Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook to power a sawmill, creating a <b>mill</b> <b>pond</b> at the site where the lake is. Later, he also added a gristmill. The sawmill was relocated around 1823 and stayed in operation until 1889. The gristmill was destroyed by lightning in 1901.|$|E

50|$|Pelican Pete {{is located}} in {{downtown}} Pelican Rapids, {{at the base of}} the Pelican Rapids (or <b>Mill</b> <b>Ponds)</b> dam. It can be seen from the Highway 59 bridge, near the Pelican Rapids Chamber of Commerce. The city of Pelican Rapids is located on the Pelican River, in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, and was named for the rapids which existed before the creation of the <b>Mill</b> <b>Ponds</b> dam.|$|R
5|$|Between 1631 and 1890, {{the city}} tripled its area through land {{reclamation}} by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront. The largest reclamation efforts {{took place during}} the 19th century; beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-acre (20ha) <b>mill</b> <b>pond</b> that later became the Haymarket Square area. The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects {{in the middle of the}} century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.|$|E
5|$|NY73 {{begins at}} {{a traffic light}} along NY86 near {{the eastern end of}} the village of Lake Placid in the town of North Elba. The highway heads towards the southwest, passing homes as Sentinel Road. At the {{intersection}} with <b>Mill</b> <b>Pond</b> Road, NY73 passes a small pond, crossing over an associated creek. For that short time, the highway takes on a more southerly direction, mainly to the southeast. The surroundings of the highway remain the same as NY73 leaves Lake Placid via Cascade Road.|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} of the house is the former <b>mill</b> <b>pond.</b> From the south side a lawn slopes down to another pond beyond which is a small ravine with a stone bridge, this area being known as Killtime. To {{the west of}} the lawn is the sunken Dutch Garden, which was created by William Legh. It {{consists}} of formal flower beds with a central fountain. To the west, south and east of the orangery are further formal flower gardens, including rose gardens.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} several mills in the valley. In several locations, The Moss has been dammed to create {{reservoirs}} and <b>mill</b> <b>ponds.</b>|$|R

5|$|Floyd's {{rainfall}} {{resulted in}} deadly and extensive flooding that killed {{two people in}} New York. Heavy flooding was reported along numerous creeks, including the Esopus, Catskill, and Schoharie. In the Albany area, the Normanskill rose to extremely high levels, and the resultant flood waters damaged nearby buildings. The Coeymans Creek in Selkirk overflowed and forced 20 families to leave their homes. The main rivers typically remained within their banks. Many roads, including U.S. Route 20 in Guilderland, were flooded or washed out, and seven families had to be evacuated along NY 32 in Menands. Further south, the Saw Mill and Bronx rivers both overflowed, and caused urban flooding. A dam on a <b>mill</b> <b>pond</b> broke near Lake Placid, leading to flooding along the Chubb River.|$|E
5|$|M-40 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US12 in rural Cass County. Running north through farm fields, the highway rounds Bar Lake {{and into the}} community of Jones. The area around Jones has a few more lakes in a wooded setting. As the trunkline continues north, it passes back into farm lands. The road curves around to the northwest as it passes between Bogart Lake and Streeters <b>Mill</b> <b>Pond</b> near Dutch Settlement Road. M-40 follows Centre Street into Marcellus. When the highway meets {{the western end of}} M-216 in town, M-40 turns west along Main Street and runs out of town. The roadway returns to a northerly course, and later it curves northwesterly again near Cedar Lake near the Van Buren County line.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} Golden Avenue, I-194 curves to {{the northwest}} to meet the M-96 (Columbia Avenue) interchange. The freeway runs underneath the Columbia Avenue overpass before running parallel {{to the west bank}} of the Kalamazoo River. The freeway crosses the river at the southern end of Lower <b>Mill</b> <b>Pond.</b> Curving back around to the northeast, I-194 meets Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94, Dickman Road). Here the AADT counts average 24,400vehicles a day. The freeway ends at an at-grade intersection with Hamblin Avenue, and continuing north of the intersection, the highway becomes just M-66. BLI-94 runs east of the freeway end on Hamblin Avenue to connect to Michigan Avenue. All of I-194 is listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways, and it is concurrent with M-66 for the length of the freeway.|$|E
40|$|The North American {{landscape}} changed tremendously {{following the}} arrival of European settlers. Before European arrival, New England’s landscape was primarily forested. As Europeans moved inland from the eastern seaboard, they cleared the forest for settlement and agricultural use. Eventually the Industrial Revolution made {{a different kind of}} mark on the landscape. Starting in the late 1790 s, the textile mill industry developed throughout the region. Mills were located along swift moving rivers, which later produced power when dams were created along them. Following the early 1900 s mill production decreased, leading to the abandonment of many mills and their adjacent dammed <b>mill</b> <b>ponds.</b> However, the environmental changes wrought by the <b>mill</b> <b>ponds</b> still exist in New England’s landscape. Large volumes of fine sediment have since built up in some of these former <b>mill</b> <b>ponds</b> and concerns about the sediment and water quality have become widespread. Today many former textile mill rivers throughout the U. S and Europe have been tested in an attempt to determine current contamination levels and to apply appropriate strategies if necessary to reduce pollutants to acceptable levels. Little is known about water and sediment quality of the former <b>mill</b> <b>ponds</b> in Scituate, Rhode Island. This research sought to address this problem by conducting trace metal testing of two <b>mill</b> <b>ponds</b> in the Scituate River Watershed: Peabody Pond and Jordon Pond. Results revealed that both ponds contain pollutants from present and past sources, but that contemporary land use practices may be the most harmful to water and sediment quality. Existing mill metal piping left on the landscape and present-day motorways and urban runoff contain large quantities of suspended solids such as copper, lead and zinc with lead showing the highest concentration levels of all metals tested. This research demonstrates that our past landscape activities, specifically New England’s historic textile production, still influences present environmental conditions, and that as human activities on the landscape change, so do threats to environmental quality...|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} steam {{power in the}} 1850s freed {{industries}} from dependence on water power and proximity to <b>mill</b> <b>ponds.</b> This allowed new industries to locate {{on the north side}} of the Thames and other hitherto neglected places.|$|R
25|$|<b>Mill</b> <b>ponds</b> {{are created}} by a weir that impounds water that then flows over the structure. The energy created by the change in height of the water can then be used to power waterwheels and power sawmills, {{grinding}} wheels and other equipment.|$|R
5|$|In {{large part}} due to the rapid {{population}} growth, cholera became a significant problem. In 1849, a major cholera epidemic killed nearly 5,000 people, leading to a new sewer system and the draining of a <b>mill</b> <b>pond.</b> Cemeteries were removed to the outskirts to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater contamination. In the same year, a large fire broke out on a steamboat on the levee, spread to 23 other boats, and destroyed {{a large portion of the}} center city. The St. Louis landing was significantly improved during the 1850s. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri to eliminate sand bars that threatened the landing. Another infrastructure improvement was the city's water system, which was begun in the early 1830s and was continually improved and expanded in the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The third {{crossing}} of the Dowagiac is {{at the mouth of}} <b>Mill</b> <b>Pond</b> in eastern Dowagiac, where M-62 follows Division Street through downtown. This section of the highway had the highest traffic count with 9,088vehicles in 2009. At Front Street, M-51 merges with M-62, and the two run concurrently to the west through town. M-62 continues westerly after M-51 separates and turns southwesterly near the Dowagiac Municipal Airport. The highway crosses into Berrien County south of Indian Lake and continues west through more scattered farms and woodland to a junction with M-140. At this intersection, M-140 turns west along the roadway, and M-62 ends. No section of M-62 has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads considered important to the country's defense, economy or mobility.|$|E
5|$|Shopham Lock {{was another}} where the lock cut was built across a large meander to the north. The bridge {{at the tail}} of the lock is built from red and grey brick, and has a single, round-headed arch. It dates from the {{construction}} of the navigation, and is virtually unaltered. Nearby, the Petworth Canal headed northwards to Haslingbourne Bridge. Below the end of the cut, the river is joined by the stream from Burton <b>Mill</b> <b>Pond,</b> which supplied an iron forge built in 1789. It is crossed by Shopham Bridge, built in the nineteenth century from red brick with grey headers and a parapet in stone, with three segmental arches. At Lower Fittleworth, there is another mill building, although it is unused and in poor condition. It was built in 1628 and enlarged in 1742. It stands in the grounds of the mill house, which was rebuilt in 1913. The lock cut ran along the south-western edge of the site. Fittleworth Bridge consists of a southern section, originally built in the sixteenth century, which was rebuilt between 1717 and 1739, and modified when the navigation was built, to enable boats to pass through the centre arch. A north section, adjacent to the millpond, dates from 1811-12.|$|E
50|$|A {{penstock}} (fr. conduite forcée) is a sluice or gate or {{intake structure}} that controls water flow, or an enclosed pipe that delivers water to hydro turbines and sewerage systems. The term is {{inherited from the}} earlier technology of <b>mill</b> <b>ponds</b> and watermills.|$|R

5|$|The Maryland Geological Survey {{was formed}} in 1896 to study the state's natural resources. Within two years, the agency {{determined}} that road building was an area that required extensive study and promotion, so the agency requested and received authorization from the Maryland General Assembly to create a Highway Division to study the state of highways in Maryland and propose engineering and legislative solutions to the state's transportation problems. One of those solutions passed by the General Assembly was the 1904 State Aid Highway Law, {{also known as the}} Shoemaker Law, which offered the counties and municipalities expert advice and technical assistance from the Maryland Geological Survey and funding for one half of the cost of macadam roads constructed by the county. The first improved highways along what became US113 in Worcester County were constructed under the provisions of the 1904 law. Worcester County constructed three mile-long macadam roads that became US113 with state aid: from the south town limit of Berlin to Hayes Landing Road in 1907, from the east town limit of Snow Hill to Purnells <b>Mill</b> <b>Pond</b> in 1907 and 1908, and from the north town limit of Berlin toward Showell in 1909 and 1910.|$|E

40|$|The {{conservation}} {{value of}} aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in old industrial <b>mill</b> <b>ponds</b> was examined within the urban environment. Of the 60 pond sites identified, 18 (31 %) have been drained and/or redeveloped since 1985. Canonical correspondence analysis identified {{differences between the}} invertebrate communities of managed and unmanaged ponds. Community composition was strongly influenced by the percentage of vegetation cover {{and the presence of}} stocked fish for recreational angling. Managed/stocked ponds have communities dominated by burrowing Oligochaeta and Chironomidae. Unmanaged sites had higher macroinvertebrate diversity compared to managed/stocked ponds and were typified by larval Trichoptera, Coleoptera and Zygoptera. However, unmanaged and ‘derelict’ sites are at greater risk of drainage and redevelopment in the urban environment. The potential conflict between active management of old industrial <b>mill</b> <b>ponds</b> for recreational angling and the conservation of macroinvertebrate biodiversity is explore...|$|R
