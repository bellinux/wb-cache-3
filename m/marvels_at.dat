5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and <b>marvels</b> <b>at</b> how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

[...] Both are pre-medical students and soon become close friends. [...] The friendship helps both; Joe gains entrance to Charlie's fraternity and social circles, while Charlie is allowed to copy Joe's conscientious schoolwork.|$|E
500|$|In a cinema in Buenos Aires on July 26, 1952, a film is {{interrupted}} when news breaks {{of the death}} of Eva Perón, Argentina's First Lady, at the age of 33. As the nation goes into public mourning, Ché, a member of the public, <b>marvels</b> <b>at</b> the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did [...] "nothing, for years". The rest of the film follows Eva (born Eva Duarte) from her beginnings as an illegitimate child of a lower-class family to her rise to become First Lady and Spiritual Leader of the Nation of Argentina; Ché assumes many different guises throughout Eva's story.|$|E
500|$|The second scene {{opens in}} Elysium. The brief ballet of 1762 became the four-movement [...] "Dance of the Blessed Spirits" [...] (with a {{prominent}} part for solo flute) in 1774. This is followed (1774 only) by a solo which celebrates happiness in eternal bliss ("Cet asile"), sung by either an unnamed Spirit or Euridice, and repeated by the chorus. Orfeo arrives and <b>marvels</b> <b>at</b> {{the purity of}} the air in an arioso ("Che puro ciel"/"Quel nouveau ciel"). But he finds no solace in the beauty of the surroundings, for Euridice is not yet with him. He implores the spirits to bring her to him, which they do (Chorus: [...] "Torna, o bella"/"Près du tendre objet").|$|E

500|$|Regarding Shakespeare's weaving {{together}} of the story's threads, Hazlitt <b>marvels</b> <b>at</b> the [...] "ease and conscious unconcern" [...] with which [...] "he most straggling and seemingly casual incidents are contrived [...] {{in such a}} manner as to lead at last to the most complete developement of the catastrophe." [...] Again, he broadens the discussion and argues against the view of Dr. Johnson [...] "that Shakespear was generally inattentive to the winding-up of his plots. We think the contrary is true; and we might cite in proof of this remark not only the present play, but the conclusion of Lear, of Romeo and Juliet, of Macbeth, of Othello, even of Hamlet, and of other plays of less moment, in which the last act is crowded with decisive events brought about by natural means." ...|$|E
500|$|A. O. Scott {{identifies}} the script's precise {{use of force}} and adept use of language, including a memorable line created by Fletcher for the adaptation: a [...] "risky, remarkable film adaptation, written by Geoffrey Fletcher, the facts of Precious's life are also laid out with unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail). But just as Push achieves an eloquence that makes it {{far more than a}} fictional diary of extreme dysfunction, so too does Precious avoid the traps of well-meaning, preachy lower-depths realism. It howls and stammers, but it also sings...Inarticulate and emotionally shut down, her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place, Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look. At its plainest and most persuasive, her story is that of a writer discovering a voice. 'These people talked like TV stations I didn't even watch,' she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she <b>marvels</b> <b>at</b> the discovery of her ignorance." ...|$|E
500|$|Dark of the Moon {{also had}} {{numerous}} Star Trek references, partly because scriptwriter Ehren Kruger was a [...] "big Star Trek geek", {{but also as}} a nod to the fact that new character Sentinel Prime was voiced by Leonard Nimoy, who originated the iconic role of Spock on Star Trek and voiced Galvatron in [...] The first Star Trek reference is when refugee robots Brains and Wheelie, who live in Sam and Carly's apartment complex, are watching [...] episode [...] "Amok Time"; Wheelie comments [...] "I've seen this one. It's the one where Spock goes nuts." [...] The second reference is when Sam meets his girlfriend, Carly Spencer at work, and is being introduced to Carly's employer, Dylan Gould, Sam <b>marvels</b> <b>at</b> their workplace: [...] "It's a beautiful building you guys have. Like the Starship Enterprise in here." [...] The third reference is when Bumblebee says goodbye to Sam at Cape Canaveral: the words [...] "my friend" [...] are sampled from Spock in [...] ("You are...my friend. I am and always shall be yours."). The fourth and final reference is when Sentinel Prime activates the Control Pillar, quoting Spock's maxim in Star Trek II and , [...] "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few".|$|E

500|$|Writing in The Independent, Cathy Pryor declared, [...] "Louis Theroux is out-oddballed {{this week}} by {{the subject of his}} latest {{documentary}} ... Astonishingly, Theroux makes you feel some sympathy for them and the price they pay for being the way they are." [...] Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent posited that viewers were [...] "... wondering, after an hour, whether the Phelps hadn't got a bit more out of it than Louis. They aren't representative of anything but themselves, after all, and they rejoice in the world's detestation. So they had nothing to lose by being held up to ridicule, and gained exactly what they want – a bigger audience for their insane rantings." [...] Writing for The Daily Record, Paul English wrote favorably, [...] "The journalist in me <b>marvels</b> <b>at</b> yet more great work from Theroux. But the human in me mourns that we gave this appalling family exactly what they want. The shiny badge of notoriety..." [...] A review in the Irish Independent was critical of giving any coverage to the group, [...] "Theroux tried to get the teenage daughters to deviate from the standard family line but they weren't budging an inch. The end result was that a group of loathsome people who spend every second of their lives trying to attract free publicity for themselves got a whole hour of it courtesy of the BBC. Ah, the joys of public service television." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kathryn Flett was critical of the choice of title for the documentary, commenting, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America? Says who? Louis Theroux? BBC2? Ooh, I don't like a sweeping statement of a documentary title. Not that the family who comprise the majority of the 71 congregants of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, aren't appalling, but the title definitely infers that they are the family most hated by most Americans, when I doubt most Americans have the faintest idea who they are." [...] Mike Bradley of The Observer commented about the film, [...] "A shock doc, but an easy target for Theroux." ...|$|E

Nevertheless {{almost all of}} these came into being {{after the start of}} the Christian Era (not that this detracts from their value), whereas here it seems that the cradle of world civilization is all around us, {{everything}} dating back thousands and thousands of years. A few Saturdays ago I visited the Biblical Gibeon, and saw the remarkable ancient pool there (I'll take you to see it when you come). It's this pool that's mentioned in II Samuel in connection with Abner ben Ner and Joab ben Zeruiah, who 'met together by the pool of Gibeon' and let 'the young men arise and play before them.' And the country is all like that!" ...|$|E
