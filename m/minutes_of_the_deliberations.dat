25|$|Throughout the {{proceedings}} {{and at his}} sentencing, Crippen showed no remorse {{for his wife and}} concern for only his lover's reputation. After just 27 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberations,</b> <b>the</b> jury found Crippen guilty of murder. He was hanged by John Ellis, assisted by William Willis, at 9 a.m. on 23 November 1910 at Pentonville Prison, London.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 November 2015, {{after three}} hours and 27 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberations,</b> <b>the</b> jury found Matthews guilty of murder and Hoare guilty of manslaughter. Both were also convicted of {{conspiracy}} to kidnap Watts, perverting <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> justice, preventing a lawful burial by dismembering and hiding her body, and possession of two stun guns.|$|R
25|$|On April 15, after 49 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> {{jury found}} Speck guilty and {{recommended}} the death penalty. On June 5, Judge Herbert J. Paschen sentenced Speck {{to die in}} the electric chair but granted an immediate stay pending automatic appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court, which upheld his conviction and death sentence on November 22, 1968.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 November, after forty-five <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> {{jury found}} Whiteway guilty. [...] An appeal was {{heard by the}} Lord Chief Justice (Lord Goddard), Mr. Justice Sellers and Mr. Justice Barry but was {{rejected}} on 7 December. Whiteway was hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 22 December 1953. The axe is in the Black Museum at Scotland Yard.|$|R
50|$|When de Veulle's case came to trial, {{even though}} the judge gave the jury clear {{directions}} to find De Veulle guilty of manslaughter, after 50 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberations</b> <b>the</b> jury acquitted him on 4 April. On 7 April, {{he pleaded guilty to}} conspiracy (along with Ada Lau Ping) to procure cocaine and was sentenced to eight months without hard labour.|$|R
25|$|On November 5, after thirty <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> {{jury found}} Shull not guilty on all charges, despite his {{admission}} {{that he had}} blinded Woodard. The courtroom broke into applause upon hearing the verdict. The failure to gain conviction of Shull was perceived as a political failure by the Truman administration. Shull was never punished, dying in Batesburg, South Carolina on December 27, 1997, at age 95.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, 21 members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Panther Party {{were tried}} for {{conspiracy}} {{to blow up}} police stations and department stores. They were acquitted of all charges after only 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> jury <b>deliberation.</b> <b>The</b> trial revealed {{the extent to which}} the NYPD had infiltrated and kept dossiers on not only the Black Panthers and other radical groups, but also on anti-war groups, gay rights activists, educational reform advocates, religious groups, and civic organizations.|$|R
500|$|In his summing up, Judge Channell {{commented that}} <b>the</b> acts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{defendant}} in hiding {{the gun and}} fleeing Eastbourne [...] "were acts which a guilty man would be very likely to do." [...] He also told the jury that, while there was no direct evidence linking Williams to the murder, many cases had resulted in a conviction with even less evidence. [...] After around fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberations,</b> <b>the</b> jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Channell sentenced Williams to death.|$|R
5000|$|Lawrence {{was brought}} to trial on April 11, 1835, at <b>the</b> District <b>of</b> Columbia City Hall. The prosecuting {{attorney}} was Francis Scott Key. At his trial, Lawrence was prone to wild rants and he refused to recognize <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proceedings. At one point {{he said to the}} courtroom, [...] "It is for me, gentlemen, to pass judgment on you, and not you upon me". After only five <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> jury found Lawrence [...] "not guilty by reason of insanity." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 6) A jury for a sixth {{capital murder}} trial was convened in Winona, Mississippi on June 10, 2010; it was {{composed}} of eleven white jurors and one black juror. Montgomery County is half black, but most black potential jurors excused themselves during review because of connections to Flowers and his family, or because <b>of</b> opposition to <b>the</b> death penalty. Following 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> jury found Flowers guilty of four counts of capital murder. After deliberating for approximately 90 minutes during the penalty phase, the jury returned a death sentence.|$|R
5000|$|On November 2, after {{a week-long}} trial and 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> Charles Town jury found Brown guilty {{on all three}} counts. Brown was sentenced to be hanged in public on December 2. In {{response}} to the sentence, Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked that [...] "Brown will make the gallows glorious like the Cross." [...] Cadets from the Virginia Military Institute under <b>the</b> leadership <b>of</b> General Francis H. Smith and Major Thomas J. Jackson (who would earn the nickname [...] "Stonewall" [...] {{less than two years}} later) were called into service as a security detail in the event Brown's supporters attempted a rescue.|$|R
5000|$|The {{trial was}} based on <b>the</b> {{question}} <b>of</b> whether Sylvester had intended to kill Ross, which {{would lead to a}} second-degree murder conviction, or whether there was no premeditation nor intention to kill Ross, which would lead to a manslaughter conviction. [...] "In the end, after three hours and 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> jury was beyond a reasonable doubt in their decision that Sylvester either intended to kill his next-door neighbour Ross between their Markham houses on Aug. 17, 2005, or that he had used force he knew could kill her and acted reckless in allowing the death to happen.|$|R
5000|$|The trial {{took place}} on October 3-4, 1944, with an all-white, all-male jury. However, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assailants had been arrested, which meant that the only {{witnesses}} were Taylor's black friends and family. Taylor's family could not identify <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assailants, and since Sheriff Gamble [...] "never arranged a police line-up, Taylor could not identify her attackers in court". Also, the $250 bond Gamble placed Wilson and his accomplices under [...] "were issued late in the afternoon, the day after Taylor's hearing". After five <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> jury dismissed the case. The only way it could be re-opened would be through an indictment from the grand jury.|$|R
2500|$|On November 2, after {{a week-long}} trial and 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> Charles Town jury found Brown guilty {{on all three}} counts. Brown was sentenced to be hanged in public on December 2. In {{response}} to the sentence, Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked that [...] " [...] will make the gallows glorious like the Cross." [...] Cadets from the Virginia Military Institute under <b>the</b> leadership <b>of</b> General Francis H. Smith and Major Thomas J.

5000|$|After {{questioning}} 21 witnesses, {{the prosecution}} closed its case. The defense {{did not call}} any witnesses or cross-examine the witnesses who testified for the prosecution. After a closing statement by the prosecutor, the judge instructed the jury that since Bethea had pleaded guilty, their only task was to [...] "...fix his punishment, at confinement in the penitentiary for not less than ten years nor more than twenty years, or at death." [...] After only {{four and a half}} <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> jury returned with a sentence: death by hanging. Bethea was then quickly removed from the courthouse and returned to the Jefferson County Jail.|$|R
2500|$|After 75 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberations,</b> <b>the</b> jury {{returned}} a guilty verdict {{in respect of}} both defendants. Craig was too young for a death sentence, but Bentley was not. Nevertheless, the jury had exceptionally {{returned a}} plea of mercy in favour of Bentley along with the guilty verdict. The decision passed to the Home Secretary, David Maxwell Fyfe, to decide whether clemency should be granted. After reading Home Office psychiatric reports and a petition signed by 200 MPs, he rejected the request and Bentley was hanged by Albert Pierrepoint on 28 January 1953. Craig was sent to prison and released in 1963 after serving ten-and-a-half years. Derek Bentley had his conviction quashed in July 1998 with the appeal trial judge, Lord Bingham, noting that Lord Goddard had denied the defendant [...] "the fair trial which is <b>the</b> birthright <b>of</b> every British citizen." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Navy held a {{retirement}} pay hearing for Touissant at Norfolk Naval Station in February 2010. The government argued {{for him to}} be retired as a petty officer first class. After two days of testimony and 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> panel unanimously recommended that Touissant be retired as a senior chief petty officer. An assistant secretary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navy has the final decision. The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a legal support and advocacy group for current and former LGBT military personnel, contacted Secretary Mabus with its concerns over this outcome, stating that it sends the message that as long as LGBT people are subject to separation under [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] they can be abused by those above them in <b>the</b> chain <b>of</b> command with little regard for consequences. SLDN called upon Mabus to overrule <b>the</b> decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retirement panel and [...] "retire Toussaint at the pay-grade at which he last served honorably and that Toussaint be given a discharge characterization that reflects his service record, which is clearly, less than honorable".|$|R
50|$|In December 1981, three {{students}} at Dunn High School were spanked {{with a wooden}} paddle by the assistant principal, Glenn Varney, as punishment for skipping school. School corporal punishment is legal in <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> North Carolina and {{was at the time}} permitted by the Harnett County school district (which in 2008 changed their policy to ban corporal punishment). The paddling led <b>the</b> parents <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students, 17-year-old Shelly Gaspersohn, to file a $55,000 lawsuit against Varney and the school the following May (Gaspersohn v. Harnett County Board of Education), claiming that the punishment was too severe. When Shelley reached <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 18 in October, she took over as direct plaintiff. In December 1983, following one week of testimony and 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> jury found for the defendants, and the plaintiffs subsequent appeal was ultimately rejected two years later by <b>the</b> Supreme Court <b>of</b> North Carolina. <b>The</b> trial was chronicled by psychologist Irwin Hyman, who was a witness for the plaintiff, in his 1990 book, Reading, Writing and the Hickory Stick.|$|R
5000|$|In early November 1905, Crowe was {{captured}} by police in Butte, Montana. On November 28, 1905, Crowe {{pleaded not guilty to}} shooting the Omaha police officer in the September [...] "Battle on Hickory Street". He was also charged with robbing a street car in Omaha of $50, and for robbery in the Cudahy kidnapping case. Despite four days of testimony from dozens <b>of</b> witnesses, <b>the</b> jury acquitted Crowe after only 80 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberations.</b> <b>The</b> judge held him for the next trial, which began in February 1906; 92 witnesses were called by the prosecution, and none were called by the defense. The Chicago Examiner, following the case along with many national newspapers, proclaimed the defense's closing statement to be [...] "considered the best speech in a criminal case ever made in Omaha." [...] After 17 hours of debate on St. Patrick's Day, 1906, the jury declared Crowe not guilty. Responding to the trial, The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Omaha is evidently a happy hunting ground for savages and malefactors." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{judges are}} stumped on who to {{graduate}} {{due to the}} poor performances. After 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> experts come to {{a short list of}} Michael and Sean. Marcus and Scott think Sean should graduate, while Cam and Juliana think Michael should graduate. Andrew however, has a different idea. In what would have been the graduation ceremony, Andrew announces that Colin would be getting his car key back, to everyone's shock, but before he gives them back to Colin, he destroys the key with a cut-off tool. Andrew then tells Colin that because of his immaturity and refusal to take the lessons seriously, he is expelled from rehab, clearly stating that they're not wasting their time on drivers who don't want to make a change. This marks the first time the series (including international versions) has had someone removed from rehab. As Colin, Jeremy and his car are towed {{all the way back to}} his hometown, Andrew makes a final comment: [...] "Let's all hope Colin loses his license before his life." ...|$|R
50|$|In deliberation, Dale {{says that}} she has learned a lot, but her results say otherwise. However, the experts give her credit for finally admitting that she has severe issues behind the wheel, and that {{regardless}} of whether or not she's named Canada's Worst Driver, she still has a massive amount to learn. The experts congratulate Brad and Donna for the improvements in their relationship that have led to better driving, but they question whether Lance's anxiety, which he claims to be unrelated to his driving, could be affecting him. Lauren suggests that he see a psychiatrist, but Lance snaps at her and says he doesn't need any more help, which proves to be the final straw as far as the experts are concerned. In the end, after 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> experts arrive at a unanimous decision. Brad, having been shortlisted twice and having made relatively few mistakes in the Road Test, is the final graduate. Dale does not graduate, but by virtue of at least managing to finish the Road Test (despite her numerous errors), avoids being named Canada's Worst Driver. However, the experts feel that she should not drive until she is retested, and in an unusual move, Andrew refuses to allow her to drive herself home and has John do it instead (usually, the runner-up is allowed to drive themselves home). Lance, by virtue of having failed to complete the Road Test and refusing to acknowledge the issues which cause him so much trouble on the road, is named Canada's Worst Driver.|$|R
5|$|After four <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberation,</b> <b>the</b> jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and a sentence <b>of</b> death. <b>The</b> trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by {{a surge of}} spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to <b>the</b> ground. Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack <b>of</b> fingers. <b>The</b> fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lynching, including Washington's bones and links <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group <b>of</b> children snapped <b>the</b> teeth out <b>of</b> Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|R

We argue that putting social practices at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deliberation</b> rather than use them as yet another aspect to be taken care <b>of</b> in <b>the</b> practical planning allows for more efficient planning.
