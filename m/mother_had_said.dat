500|$|The rumour {{was that}} Griselda Steevens' reclusiveness and always being veiled were owing to her having {{been born with}} a pig's head. Chambers (1864) speculates that her unusual name {{may have contributed to}} the legend, and notes the common belief that she was named [...] "Grisly" [...] on account of her {{appearance}} when born. It was claimed that while pregnant with Richard and Griselda, Steevens' <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> [...] "take away your litter of pigs!" [...] to a woman beggar asking for money to feed her children, and Griselda had then been born with the head and face of a pig. Dismayed by the popular belief that she had a pig's head, Griselda took to sitting on an open balcony to allow the public to see her face. This failed to stem the spread of the rumour, and she commissioned a portrait of herself to be hung in the main hall of the hospital. The portrait failed to have the desired effect; many of the public chose instead to believe a portrait in a pub neighbouring the hospital, which showed Steevens with a pig's head; the pub also displayed a silver trough alleged to have belonged to her. She eventually withdrew from public view completely before her death on 18 March 1746.|$|E
500|$|... 8701 was {{recorded}} in the United States, in the cities of Los Angeles, New York, Minneapolis and Atlanta. The album's production was handled by several producers including The Neptunes, Jermaine Dupri, P. Diddy—who had produced the majority of Usher's previous album, My Way—Babyface, Kevin [...] "She'kspere" [...] Briggs, Mike City, Bryan Michael Cox and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Both Jam and Lewis were asked by Usher's mother, and then manager, to contribute to 8701s production, during the 2000 MTV Music Awards. According to Jam, his <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Oh my God, Usher's got this track and we thought you guys would be perfect to produce it". Several months later, Jam and Lewis produced the song [...] "Separated", along with multi-platinum producers Ric Atari & Daron Jones (who also wrote the record) to which the producers then turned in to L.A. Reid, who liked the track, {{and asked them to}} produce more. Following this, Usher asked both producers to create a song similar to their 1985 [...] "Tender Love", performed by R vocal group Force MDs. Though he wanted it to be his own unique record, which contains a small similarity, to which Jam and Lewis created [...] "Can U Help Me". Following the completion of 8701, Jam and Lewis were sent back to the studio by Reid to revamp the album's second single [...] "U Remind Me", explaining [...] "we already know he can dance, and he's got the style and that whole thing. But I want people to just go, he can sing.|$|E
2500|$|While [...] "the South" [...] {{exists as}} a {{geographical}} {{region of the}} United States, it is also said to exist as [...] "a place of the imagination" [...] of writers. An image of [...] "the South" [...] was fixed in Mitchell's imagination when at six years old her mother took her on a buggy tour through ruined plantations and [...] "Sherman's sentinels", the brick and stone chimneys that remained after William Tecumseh Sherman's [...] "March and torch" [...] through Georgia. Mitchell would later recall what her <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> to her: ...|$|E

5000|$|On the show, Bacon portrayed Charlie who {{is left in}} {{the care}} of her aunt Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, portrayed by Sedgwick, and Johnson's husband Special Agent Fritz Howard. [...] The role lasted for four episodes and led to what Bacon's <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> was one of the hardest scenes for her on the show, where Brenda is telling Charlie that she has to go home with Charlie {{responding}} by asking [...] "Do you not want me to stay?" [...] Bacon's <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> she would not find it unusual if Duff offered Bacon a more regular role on Major Crimes, a spin-off of The Closer series.|$|R

60|$|Sally did {{not reply}} {{for a minute or}} two, and Philip looked at her curiously: it might be thought that she was meditating upon what her <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> {{and on the other hand}} she might be {{thinking}} of the man in the moon.|$|E
60|$|Mother, mother. [To LADY FREDERICK.] I'm awfully sorry. I {{feel that}} {{you have a right to}} be angry. For all that you've {{suffered}} I beg your pardon most humbly. My <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> and done things which I regret to say are quite unjustifiable.|$|R

"It may be {{travellers}} {{will come}} our way, an' I {{can go with}} them," [...] Dick replied, taking good care not to make any promises; for he understood from what his <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> {{that it would be}} absolutely necessary that aid should be had from the nearest settlement.|$|E

60|$|A great fire, banked {{high and}} red, flamed in the grate {{and under the}} ivy-twined {{branches}} of the chandelier the Christmas table was spread. They had come home a little late and still dinner was not ready: {{but it would be}} ready in a jiffy his <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said.</b> They were waiting for the door to open and for the servants to come in, holding the big dishes covered with their heavy metal covers.|$|E
60|$|Reuben {{was glad}} {{when he heard}} of the arrangement; for although, as his <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> {{he was fond of}} school, he yet felt it as a sort of reproach that, while others of his age were earning money, he should be doing nothing. He {{accepted}} the offer of the schoolmaster to continue to work at his studies in the evening, and in a week he was installed in Tom Finch's place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tis strange," [...] {{said the}} old woman, [...] "that no one should have told thee in all this time."

60|$|He and Archy Hawkins and the {{big boys}} ran off, whooping, and the little fellows felt awfully, because their <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> they must not go.

5000|$|Daniels' parents {{divorced}} {{when she was}} four. She was subsequently raised by her <b>mother.</b> Daniels <b>has</b> <b>said</b> of her childhood that she [...] "came from an average, lower-income household...there were days without electricity".|$|R
60|$|Her heart swelled with a fury {{of grief}} {{for all she}} had {{suffered}} and lost through him. She thought of what her <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> she ought to do if he ever spoke to her again; there came without her agency, almost, three swift, sharp, electrical blows from the hand she had freed; she saw him reeling backward with his hand at his face, {{and then she was}} standing in her own room, looking at her ghost in the glass.|$|E
60|$|If you'll believe me, {{that same}} thing {{happened}} every night. Every single night! And sometimes twice or three times before morning. And every time I would bark my loudest and the man would strike a light and wallop me. The thing was baffling. I couldn't possibly have mistaken what <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> to me. She said it too often for that. Bark! Bark! Bark! It was the main plank of her whole system of education. And yet, here I was, getting walloped every night for doing it.|$|E
60|$|That was despair. There was no {{plan for}} me; I saw that; I must say where I was; stay, and wait, and take what might come--it {{was not my}} affair; that was what life is--my <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> it. Then--well, then the calling began again! All my sorrows came back. I said to myself, the master will never forgive. I {{did not know what}} I had done to make him so bitter and so unforgiving, yet I judged it was {{something}} a dog could not understand, but which was clear to a man and dreadful.|$|E

25|$|As a young boy, Bocelli {{showed a}} great passion for music. His <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that music {{was the only}} thing that would comfort him. At the age of 6, Bocelli started piano lessons, and later, also learned to play the flute, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, guitar and drums. Then, when his nanny, Oriana, gave him the first record of Franco Corelli, Bocelli began to show {{interest}} in pursuing the career of a tenor. By seven, he was able to recognize the famous voices of the time and tried to emulate the great interpreters.|$|R
50|$|He grew up nearby Arboga, a {{small town}} about 2 hours drive south of Stockholm, {{together}} with his mother, step-father and four younger sisters. In interviews his <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that she named him after Alexander the Great.

His biological father died a few weeks prior to Gustafsson's fight in London against Jimi Manuwa on March 8, 2014. In interviews after the fight {{he said he wanted}} to dedicate the victory to him.|$|R
