50|$|In {{satellite}} imaging, {{two types}} of images are available. The panchromatic image acquired by satellites is transmitted with the maximum resolution available and the <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> are transmitted with coarser resolution. This will usually be two or four times lower. At the receiver station, the panchromatic image is merged with the <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> to convey more information.|$|E
50|$|In {{remote sensing}} applications,the {{increasing}} availability of space borne sensors gives a motivation for different image fusion algorithms.Several situations in image processing require high spatial and high spectral resolution {{in a single}} image. Most of the available equipment is not capable of providing such data convincingly. Image fusion techniques allow the integration of different information sources. The fused image can have complementary spatial and spectral resolution characteristics. However, the standard image fusion techniques can distort the spectral information of the <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> while merging.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. One {{of the most}} significant results of this Skylab research involved the geometric correction and overlay of the Skylab <b>multispectral</b> scanner <b>data</b> with the LANDSAT <b>multispectral</b> scanner <b>data,</b> and also with a set of topographic data, including elevation, slope, and aspect. The Skylab S 192 <b>multispectral</b> scanner <b>data</b> had distinct differences in noise level of the data in the various wavelength bands. Results of the temporal evaluation of the SL- 2 and SL- 3 photography were found to be particularly important for proper interpretation of the computer-aided analysis of the SL- 2 and SL- 3 <b>multispectral</b> scanner <b>data.</b> There was a quality problem involving the ringing effect introduced by digital filtering. The modified clustering technique was found valuable when working with <b>multispectral</b> scanner <b>data</b> involving many wavelength bands and covering large geographic areas. Analysis of the SL- 2 scanner data involved classification of major cover types and also forest cover types. Comparison of the results obtained wth Skylab MSS data and LANDSAT MSS data indicated that the improved spectral resolution of the Skylab scanner system enabled a higher classification accuracy to be obtained for forest cover types, although the classification performance for major cover types was not significantly different...|$|R

50|$|A {{key element}} in {{acquiring}} spectra is that the radiation must somehow be energy selected - either before or after interacting with the sample. Wavelength selection can be accomplished with a fixed filter, tunable filter, spectrograph, an interferometer, or other devices. For a fixed filter approach, it is not efficient to collect {{a significant number of}} wavelengths, and <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> are usually collected. Interferometer-based chemical imaging requires that entire spectral ranges be collected, and therefore results in hyperspectral data. Tunable filters have the flexibility to provide either multi- or hyperspectral data, depending on analytical requirements.|$|E

Uniform training areas were selected within three sites from this flightline. Soil samples were collected from each site and a procedure developed to allow assignment of scan line and element number from the <b>multispectral</b> scanner <b>data</b> to each sampling location. These soil samples were analyzed on a spectrophotometer and laboratory spectral signatures were derived. After correcting for solar radiation and atmospheric attenuation, the laboratory signatures were compared to the spectral signatures derived from these same soils using <b>multispectral</b> scanner <b>data.</b> Both signatures were used in supervised and unsupervised classification routines.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} several {{methods for}} enhancing the spatial resolution of multispectral images using a higher resolution panchromatic image. A new method {{that relies on}} the local correlation between the low resolution superpixel and the corresponding mean panchromatic radiance is presented. High resolution multispectral images are produced based on the local correlation value and the high resolution panchromatic brightness levels. This method allows for within-pixel Iocol adaptation of the correlation values to account for mixed pixel effects. The resultant hybrid, high resolution, <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> set has increased visual interpretability and improved classification accuracy while preserving the radiometric integrity of the original <b>multispectral</b> <b>data.</b> These methods {{can be applied to}} create simulated high resolution <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> to enhance existent image analysis techniques such as land-cover classification...|$|E

40|$|Both {{principal}} component analysis (PCA) and principal factor analysis (PFA) were used to analyze an experimental <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> structure in terms of common and unique variance. Only the common variance of the <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> {{was associated with the}} principal factor, while higher-order {{principal component}}s were associated with both common and unique variance. The unique variance was found to represent small spectral variations within each cover type as well as noise vectors, and was most abundant in the lower-order principal components. The lower-order principal components can be useful in research designed to discriminate minor physical variations within features, and to highlight localized change when using multitemporal-multispectral data.

40|$|Data {{simulation}} {{is widely}} used in remote sensing to produce imagery for a new sensor in the design stage, for scale issues of some special applications, or for testing of novel algorithms. Hyperspectral data could provide more abundant information than traditional <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> and thus greatly extend the range of remote sensing applications. Unfortunately, hyperspectral data are much more difficult and expensive to acquire and were not available prior {{to the development of}} operational hyperspectral instruments, while large amounts of accumulated <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> have been collected around the world over the past several decades. Therefore, it is reasonable to examine means of using these <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> to simulate or construct hyperspectral data, especially in situations where hyperspectral data are necessary but hard to acquire. Here, a method based on spectral reconstruction is proposed to simulate hyperspectral data (Hyperion data) from multispectral Advanced Land Imager data (ALI data). This method involves extraction of the inherent information of source data and reassignment to newly simulated data. A total of 106 bands of Hyperion data were simulated from ALI data covering the same area. To evaluate this method, we compare the simulated and original Hyperion data by visual interpretation, statistical comparison, and classification. The results generally showed good performance of this method and indicated that most bands were well simulated, and the information both preserved and presented well. This makes it possible to simulate hyperspectral data from <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> for testing the performance of algorithms, extend the use of <b>multispectral</b> <b>data</b> and help the design of a virtual sensor...|$|E
