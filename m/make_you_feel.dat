Randy Taraborrelli, author of , {{said that the}} song demonstrated Madonna's ability to create infectitious dance music. Rikky Rooksby, author of Madonna: the complete guide to her music, said that [...] "'Into the Groove' will <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like you're a winner either way. And that's {{one of the best}} things pop music can do for ya. [...] Madonna's first great single." [...] Clive Barker and Simon Trussler, authors of New Theatre Quarterly, felt that the song was the first disco-anthem of the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Chris Schilling {{commented that}} {{although}} Ancient Trader {{was not as}} comprehensive and expansive as other Xbox Live titles such as , it deserved [...] "the opportunity {{to do business with}} the big boys rather than risk getting washed away with the shovelware tide". Schilling expressed concern that [...] "a game so elegant and accomplished should have to be dredged up from the depths of Indie Games". Lorenzo Fantoni from Eurogamer Italy awarded Ancient Trader the same score as Schilling, and explained that [...] "the final result is a quite simple title, which will last long enough to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> happy of having invested your money in this indie title".|$|E

500|$|The lyrics for [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] {{are written}} in first person, about Cyrus' {{relocation}} from Nashville, Tennessee to Hollywood, California. In the verses, she details occurrences in Hollywood, such as peers questioning her attire, that cause for her to feel homesick and intimidated. Towards the conclusion of each verse, the protagonist listens to her favorite Jay-Z and Britney Spears song, respectively, {{which leads to the}} refrains describing how her favorite songs make her feel more confident. Vicki Lutas of BBC interpreted, [...] "However cringe it sounds, your favourite song can <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> okay and feel more confident, even if you're not really." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, The Hollywood Reporter quoted Rolling Stones Meredith Blake in her concert review {{saying she}} found it {{pointless}} to have those items onstage given the song's theme. Writing for NME, Emily MacKay did a live review of the singer's tour at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London during March 2011. She said that the spiritless [...] "Circle the Drain", [...] "Hummingbird Heartbeat" [...] and [...] "Who Am I Living For?" [...] were enough to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> somewhat {{like that of a}} [...] "fractious toddler having a series of expensive toys waved in its mottled face by a fretful aunt to keep it from deciding it wants to cry." ...|$|E

[...] The director David Ayliff, son of Richardson's and Olivier's mentor, said, [...] "Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn't stop being a perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination." [...] Comparing the two, Hobson said that Olivier always made the audience feel inferior, and Richardson always made them feel superior. The actor Edward Hardwicke agreed, saying that audiences were in awe of Olivier, [...] "whereas Ralph would always <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> sympathy... you wanted {{to give him a}} big hug.

500|$|Along with {{a talking}} drum, Badu used tuning forks when {{recording}} New Amerykah Part One to evoke a certain feeling through its frequency, a practice {{she had done}} on her previous albums: [...] "Each tuning fork has a certain vibrational energy that is conducive to a feeling or a color or a smell. They're related to different chakras in the body, too. Some may <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good or sexy or conscious of what you're saying." [...] The album was mastered at Electric Lady Studios in February 2008. Before it was edited down to 11 tracks, New Amerykah Part One was originally intended as a double album, with 18 songs over two discs.|$|E
500|$|In the song, lyrically Madonna asks {{questions}} for a lover {{she is about}} to abandon: [...] "Does it <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good to see me cry? I think it does", she affirms. The lyric [...] "I'd like to hurt you" [...] was compared to that of Madonna's previous single [...] "Erotica", where she said: [...] "I only hurt the ones I love". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post noted that Madonna used a [...] "sonically filtered, detached and slightly taunting voice to talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering, mind-game-playing partner" [...] in the song. Regarding the lyrics, Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times called [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] a [...] "brushoff song".|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album was finally {{confirmed}} by MTV as Hard Candy. Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "She loves candy, [...] about the juxtaposition of tough and sweetness, or as Madonna so eloquently expressed: 'I'm gonna kick your ass, but it's going to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good." [...] The album cover art was also released {{at the same time}} and featured Madonna with short cropped hair in a black leotard with a [...] professional wrestling championship belt across her waist. The belt includes the inscription [...] "Give It to Me", the original {{title of the}} album. The backdrop displayed pink peppermint swirls. The photo was taken during a photoshoot with Klein for Interview magazine's April 2008 issue.|$|E

500|$|Marc Hogan of Spin {{wrote that}} despite the song not being as [...] "immediately jaw-dropping" [...] {{compared}} to [...] "Climax", it still contains the same [...] "Radiohead quiet storm style" [...] as the latter song, with Usher utilizing his [...] "hair-raising falsetto". Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine interpreted the song as different in terms of music and lyrics to the latter song. Wickman praised Usher's vocals, describing them as [...] "calculated" [...] to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "uneasy, swirling around in minor harmonies". Rolling Stones Jon Dolan gave the song three out of five stars, writing that [...] "Go Missin'" [...] is not as [...] "subtle" [...] as [...] "Climax", though he praised its implementation of synthesizers, saying that it gives the song a [...] "nervous, predatory throb".|$|E
500|$|The subplot of Homer {{entering}} the childproofing business {{was inspired by}} an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children. In an interview with Star-News, Payne commented: [...] "You hire this person to come into your home to look for changes you can make. They <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like the most horrible {{person in the world}} and that your house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|E

[...] "Immortal" [...] would be premiered on March 1, 2013 via SoundCloud. The song was produced by Cudi, with the main sample being a track from one of his favorite bands MGMT's, [...] "Congratulations". He reversed the song, sped it up, and produced over it.

Canning wrote, [...] "this segment may not be all that gory, but it's funny and, quite honestly, it will just <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good", and Bentley described it as [...] "a dead-on comedy assault of the Charlie Brown animated Halloween special." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concurred, writing that it [...] "succeeds because it offers sly cultural commentary." [...] Show Patrol wrote [...] "The nostalgia factor makes “Grand Pumpkin” {{the best of these}} amusing bits for me, but they all lack that trademark “Simpsons” brand of satirical smartness." [...] Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel gave the episode a 4/5 and called the final segment a [...] "witty parody of Charlie Brown's Halloween classic.

500|$|In mid-2004, the newspaper's then-public editor Daniel Okrent, {{wrote an}} opinion piece {{in which he}} said that The New York Times did have a liberal bias in news {{coverage}} of certain social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. He stated that this bias reflected the paper's cosmopolitanism, which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City. He wrote, [...] "if you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world."

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Resident Evil games, {{which take}} place inside buildings, Resident Evil 3 {{takes place in}} Raccoon City. The developers noted that the city setting allowed them to create more varied environments. Capcom also decided to give the game a more action-oriented style, {{which resulted in the}} 180-degree turn and the introduction of a dodge feature so that the player can avoid enemy attacks. Additionally, the developers designed the game so that up to nine enemies can appear {{at the same time and}} improved their artificial intelligence to hunt the player up and down stairs. The eponymous Nemesis creature was inspired by the liquid-metal T-1000 Terminator from [...] According to Mikami, [...] "I wanted to introduce a new kind of fear into the game, a persistent feeling of paranoia. The Nemesis brings that on in spades. When it disappears after the first confrontation, you live in constant dread of the next attack. The idea is to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like you're being stalked." ...|$|E

500|$|Backbreaker {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. While Backbreaker was praised for its realistic physics, {{it was also}} criticized for weak online play, lack of single-player gameplay depth, and poor passing play. [...] Review aggregator Metacritic rated the game at 54% for the Xbox 360 version and 58% for the PlayStation 3 version, calling it [...] "a fast-paced, gritty gameplay experience that's more Burnout than Madden,". Backbreaker also received an aggregate score of 57.31% on GameRankings, based upon 21 different media reviews. The game's Euphoria animation system was well liked by reviewers. PlayStation LifeStyle's Joseph Peterson commented that [...] "Realism is a major plus in Backbreaker. Running with the ball feels lifelike and {{better than any other}} football game on the market...

500|$|Brosnan left Ireland on 12 August 1964 and was {{reunited with}} his mother and her new husband, William Carmichael, now living in the Scottish village of Longniddry, East Lothian. Carmichael took Brosnan to see a James Bond film for the first time (Goldfinger), at the age of 11. Later moving back to London, Brosnan was educated at Elliott School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Putney, southwest London, now known as Ark Putney Academy. Brosnan has spoken about the transition from Ireland to England and his education in London; [...] "When you go to a very large city, a metropolis like London, as an Irish boy of 10, life suddenly moves pretty fast. From a little school of, say, seven classrooms in Ireland, to this very large comprehensive school, with over 2,000 children. And you're Irish. And they <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> it; the British have a wonderful way of doing that, and I had a certain deep sense of being an outsider."

500|$|In the hospital, as Buffy {{listens to}} the doctor confirm how Joyce died, the doctor says something, but the words [...] "I have to lie to you to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> better" [...] are spoken discordantly, as though, {{according}} to cinema scholar Katy Stevens, Buffy [...] "constructs what she believes to be an unmentionable truth—her culpability in her mother's death". In the same scene, Dawn is shot with a hand-held camera that drifts, giving her a slightly unreal moment as she struggles to believe, unlike what Buffy already knows, that her mother's body is down the hall on a steel table. The scene with Buffy and Tara sitting {{in the waiting room}} was noted by Rhonda Wilcox for its reality in showing Gellar as ragged and distinctly unglamorous, particularly because she had been presented in a specific way to attract male viewers and was a spokeswoman for Maybelline while Buffy aired. Buffy sits with circles under her eyes, unflattering hair, and slumped posture next to Tara, who had been criticized for being too heavy, despite her body type being more typical of women her age.|$|E
