5|$|Lexical {{variation}} between BASL {{and other}} dialects of ASL was first {{noted in the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language. In a later study of 34 lexical signs, Black signers {{were found to have}} 28 signs that White signers did not know. Older signers are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> variant signs than younger signers. Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less likely to use these variants, but when asked about them are aware that older signers have and use these innovative signs.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males are also <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E
25|$|Dominant {{males have}} higher mating success and also provide females with more ejaculate, and females are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the sperm of {{dominant}} males for fertilization.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to legal}} defense funds, legal {{financing}} companies provide money for lawsuits but {{are more often}} used by those without strong financial resources. Furthermore, legal financing is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>used</b> by plaintiffs, whereas legal defense funds are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>used</b> by defendants. Money obtained from legal financing companies {{can be used for}} any purpose, whether for litigation or for personal matters. On the other hand, money obtained through legal defense funds are solely <b>used</b> <b>to</b> fund litigation and legal costs.|$|R

25|$|Research {{also shows}} that people high in agreeableness {{are more likely to}} control {{negative}} emotions like anger in conflict situations. Those who are high in agreeableness are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> conflict-avoidant tactics when in conflict with others (whereas people low in agreeableness are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> coercive tactics). They are also more willing to give ground to their adversary and may lose arguments with people who are less agreeable. From their perspective, they have not really lost an argument as much as maintained a congenial relationship with another person.|$|E

25|$|Organizational {{identification}} and workplace {{freedom of speech}} {{has an effect on}} an individual's choice of expressing dissent (Kassing, 2000). If an individual highly identifies himself or herself with the organization, they are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the dissent strategy that mirrors the organization's values. If the organization demonstrates it values dissent and promotes workplace freedom of speech, the highly identified employee will demonstrate articulate dissent.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} in genealogical DNA tests {{has been linked}} to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. Those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-Chromosome tests. Those with an {{interest in}} personal ethnic origins are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> an autosomal test. However, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtDNA test or a Y-DNA test.|$|E

40|$|Examined {{differences}} {{between women and}} men in the self-reported use of 2 way-finding strategies: route strategies and orientation strategies. 288 female and 138 male undergraduates completed the Mental Rotations Test, Water-Level Task, the Way-Finding Strategy Scale, and the Spatial Anxiety Scale. Women were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>using</b> a route strategy (attending to instructions on how to get from place to place), while men were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>using</b> an orientation strategy (maintaining a sense of their own position in relation to environmental reference points). Women also reported higher levels of spatial anxiety, or anxiety about environmental navigation. Orientation strategy was positively correlated with spatial perception ability and negatively correlated with spatial anxiety...|$|R
25|$|In 2014, 3.5% of 18 to 25 year-olds {{had used}} MDMA in the United States. In Europe, an {{estimated}} 37% of regular club-goers aged 14 to 35 used MDMA {{in the past}} year according to the 2015 European Drug report. The highest one-year prevalence of MDMA use in Germany in 2012 was 1.7% among people aged 25 to 29 compared with a population average of 0.4%. Among adolescent users in the United States between 1999 and 2008, girls were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> MDMA than boys.|$|E
25|$|Hostile {{attribution}} bias {{has also}} been documented in adult populations, and adults {{with high levels of}} hostile attribution bias are over 4 times more likely to die by the age of 50 than adults with low levels of hostile attribution bias. Hostile attribution bias is particularly linked to relational problems in adulthood, including marital conflict/violence and marital/relationship dissatisfaction. Finally, parents with high levels of hostile attribution bias are also much <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> harsh discipline and aggressive parenting, which may further contribute to the intergenerational continuity in hostile attribution bias and aggression across time.|$|E
25|$|Most {{recreational}} {{scuba diving}} is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece {{to supply the}} breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.|$|E

25|$|In South Korea, barber's poles {{are used}} both for actual barbershops and for brothels. Brothels {{disguised}} as barbershops, {{referred to as}} 이발소 (ibalso) or 미용실 (miyongsil), are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> two poles next to each other, often spinning in opposite directions, though {{the use of a}} single pole for the same reason is also quite common. Actual barbershops, or 미용실 (miyongsil), {{are more likely to be}} hair salons; to avoid confusion, they will usually use a pole that shows a picture of a woman with flowing hair on it with the words hair salon written on the pole.|$|E
25|$|In an American {{study in}} 2005, the {{percentage}} of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of {{the percentage of}} women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and {{were more likely to be}} broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.|$|E
25|$|While the genders {{engage in}} IPV at about equal rates, females are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> less {{dangerous}} forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males {{are more likely}} to punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males are also <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are four times more likely to respond as having experienced rape and {{are more likely to}} suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse. Females are more likely to consider IPV a serious problem than are their male counterparts, who are more likely to disregard female-perpetrated IPV. Along with form, motivations for violence also vary by gender: females are likely to perpetrate violence in self-defense, while males are likely to perpetrate violence to exert power or control. The self-defense aspect is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males. Other research indicates that boys who have been abused in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who have been abused in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and self-efficacy; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration and victimization among adolescents vary and are not well understood.|$|E
