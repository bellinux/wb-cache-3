5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed <b>molten</b> <b>steel</b> to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of <b>molten</b> <b>steel</b> when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the optimal {{structural}} parameters of the dug arch or round hole(s) at dam bottom in an 1820 ?tons asymmetrical T-type single-strand continuous casting tundish, the flow field profiles and temperature profiles of <b>molten</b> stainless <b>steel</b> in the tundish with arch or round hole(s) at dam bottom have been investigated using hydrodynamic modeling coupled with mathematical simulation.

40|$|To further remove mini-size {{nonmetallic}} inclusions {{and improve}} surface quality {{of stainless steel}} slab at No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel Company Limited, the flow field and temperature profile of <b>molten</b> stainless <b>steel</b> in an asymmetrical T-type single-strand continuous casting tundish with a capacity of 18 - 20 tons have been investigated by both hydrodynamic and mathematical simulations. The influences of height for low-wall of turbulence inhibitor, dam height, weir depth, distance between dam and weir, submerged depth of ladle shroud and casting speed on flow field in the tundish have been studied in a 1 : 3 reduced scale hydrodynamic model. The streamlines, velocity vector fields and temperature profiles are also mathematically simulated. The hydrodynamic modelling results indicate that height for low-wall of turbulence inhibitor, dam height and weir depth are three important structural parameters on flow field of <b>molten</b> stainless <b>steel</b> in the tundish. The optimization of the three parameters can improve dispersed plug zone and reduce dead zone effectively. Changing casting speed can improve turbulent flow, and thus reduce dead zone of <b>molten</b> stainless <b>steel</b> in the tundish. As a result, five groups of optimized structural parameters of the tundish have been recommended, which can reduce volume fraction of dead zone down to 15 - 30 % and increase volume fraction of dispersed plug zone to more than 20 %. In addition, it is verified that the optimized groups of structural parameters of the tundish can maintain their advantage at different casting speeds in a narrow range. The mathematical modelling results suggest that heat losses around the tundish {{must be considered in}} order to accurately simulate the streamline, velocity vector field and temperature profile. The calculated temperature drop of <b>molten</b> stainless <b>steel</b> between inlet and outlet of the tundish is about 4. 4 K; the maximum temperature drop in the whole tundish is about 10 K, The modification of flow filed by changing structural parameters of the tundish can slightly affect temperature profile of <b>molten</b> stainless <b>steel</b> in the tundish.

5|$|When {{emergency}} services arrived, they were initially {{unable to provide}} assistance as the high temperatures of the <b>molten</b> <b>steel</b> prevented them from entering the area {{and they had to}} wait for the steel to cool. When they were eventually able to access the area, they discovered thirty-two workers had been killed by the spill. Six others in the room survived and were rushed to the hospital with severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, with the others listed as critical. They were said to be of risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the thirty-two deceased represented everyone in the room at the time, and that only two people were injured - the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.|$|E

25|$|Although {{steel is}} an alloy {{of iron and}} {{a small amount of}} carbon, {{historically}} steel and iron-making were intended for different products given the high costs of steel over wrought iron.

40|$|Oxygen is {{an element}} that is first {{purposely}} brought into the steel melt to remove some unwanted elements or to reduce their concentration (oxidation).

Concentration of oxygen in steel before casting is given, in particular, by the manner of metallurgical processing and the used deoxidation process. Oxygen is found in <b>molten</b> <b>steels</b> both as chemically bound in the form of oxides and in the form of oxygen dissolved in the solution – the melt.

The uranium-poor phase in the brown lava has a U:Zr ratio of about 1:10. It is possible from the examination of the Zr/U phases to determine the thermal history of the mixture.

25|$|The {{most common}} way of {{recycling}} graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded, or the electrode (or other) are used {{all the way}} down to the electrode holder. A new electrode replaces the old one, but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains. This is crushed and sized, and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of <b>molten</b> <b>steel.</b> Graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled, but often not because of their graphite: the largest-volume items, such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15–25% graphite, usually contain too little graphite. However, some recycled carbon-magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace-repair materials, and also crushed carbon-magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners. While crucibles have a high graphite content, the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small.|$|E
