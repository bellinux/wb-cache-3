5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the <b>maned</b> <b>wolf</b> and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E

40|$|The {{intent of}} this project was to {{investigate}} options for improvement of a commercially manufactured prescription diet designed to reduce manifestation of clinical disease secondary to cystinuria in captive <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> in the United States. Diets high in plant-based protein, independent of sulfur amino acid content, resulted {{in an increase in}} average urine pH as well as a decrease in urine cystine crystal formation and cystine excretion in <b>maned</b> <b>wolves.</b> The rate of passage of digesta in <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> was very similar to that of domestic dogs on either the commercially available formula and an experimental formula. Differences in nutrient digestibility and mineral retention were seen between the wolves and the dogs, with dogs exhibiting higher digesitibility or retention in all cases. Six <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> maintained on these same two diets exhibited plasma taurine concentrations markedly lower than canine and feline normal reference ranges, implying that <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> may have a dietary requirement for taurine.

25|$|In South America, {{the only}} {{widespread}} potential predators of sheep are cougars and jaguars, {{both of which}} are known to prey on livestock regularly. South American canids such as the <b>Maned</b> <b>wolf</b> and foxes of the genus Pseudalopex are also blamed for sheep deaths, but no evidence for a statistically significant amount of predation by most of these species has ever been presented. However, the culpeo is a threat to sheep, and is responsible for 60% of the predator losses in Patagonia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{presence}} of the warrah, Dusicyon australis, has often been cited as evidence of pre-European occupation of the islands. [...] However, [...] in 2009, this hypothesis was disproved when DNA analysis identified the Falkland Island wolf's closest living relative as the <b>maned</b> <b>wolf</b> (Chrysocyon brachyurus) [...] an unusually long-legged, fox-like South American canid, from which it separated about 6.7 million years ago. [...] It {{would seem that the}} lineages of the <b>maned</b> <b>wolf</b> and the Falkland Islands wolf separated in North America; canids did not appear in South America until roughly 3 million years ago in a paleozoogeographical event called the Great American Biotic Interchange, in which the continents of North and South America were newly connected by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. [...] This means {{it is likely that the}} warrah arrived in the islands long before humans.|$|E
60|$|There are two canines: one is Azara's {{beautiful}} grey fox-like dog, {{purely a}} fox in habits, and common everywhere. The other {{is far more}} interesting and extremely rare; it is called aguará, its nearest ally being the aguará-guazú, the Canis jubatus or <b>maned</b> <b>wolf</b> of naturalists, found north of the pampean district. The aguará is smaller and has no mane; {{it is like the}} dingo in size, but slimmer and with a sharper nose, and lias a much brighter red colour. At night when camping out I have heard its dismal screams, but the screamer was sought in vain; while from the gauchos of the frontier I could only learn that it is a harmless, shy, solitary animal, that ever flies to remoter wilds from its destroyer, man. They offered me a skin--what more could I want? Simple souls! it was no more to me than the skin of a dead dog, with long, bright red hair. Those who love dead animals may have them in any number by digging with a. spade in that vast sepulchre of the pampas, where perished the hosts of antiquity. I love the living that are above the earth; and how small a remnant they are in South America we know, and now yearly becoming more precious as it dwindles away.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of faecal {{glucocorticoid}} metabolites {{provides a}} powerful noninvasive tool for monitoring adrenocortical activity in wild animals. However, differences regarding the metabolism and excretion of these substances make a validation for each species and sex investigated obligatory. Although <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> (Chrysocyon brachyurus) {{are the biggest}} canids in South America, their behaviour and physiology are poorly known and they are at risk in the wild. Two methods for measuring glucocorticoid metabolites in <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> were validated: a radio- and an enzyme immunoassay. An ACTH challenge was used to demonstrate that changes in adrenal function are reflected in faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Our results suggest that both methods enable a reliable assessment of stress hormones in <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> avoiding short-term rises in glucocorticoid concentrations due to handling and restraint. These methods {{can be used as}} a valuable tool in studies of stress and conservation in this wild species...|$|R

50|$|Among {{the larger}} {{residents}} are cheetahs, <b>maned</b> <b>wolves,</b> otters and bat-eared foxes. The zoo {{is home to}} one of the largest collections of tamarins and marmosets, and also includes howler monkeys, gibbons and Diana monkeys.|$|R
50|$|The <b>maned</b> <b>wolf</b> is not {{a common}} prey species for any predator, {{although}} it may be attacked or killed by feral dogs. An additional threat to the <b>maned</b> <b>wolf</b> exists from sharing territory with domestic dogs. The <b>maned</b> <b>wolf</b> is particularly susceptible to infection by the giant kidney worm, a potentially fatal parasite that also may infect domestic dogs.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the <b>maned</b> <b>wolf</b> is shy and flees when alarmed, so {{it poses}} little {{direct threat to}} humans.

It once was considered a similar threat to cattle and sheep, although this now is known to be false.|$|E
40|$|Contrafreeloading {{occurs when}} animals spend {{time and effort}} to obtain food in the {{presence}} of freely available food. There are several interpretations for such an apparent contradiction to optimal foraging models, with an emphasis either on the need to gather and update information about the environment or on the value of performing species-typical responses. Evidence suggests that both gathering information about the environment and the expression of species-typical behaviour are important for the welfare of captive animals. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the existence of contrafreeloading in <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> (Chrysocyon brachyurus), in a situation where animals could get food directly from a "free" source and/or search and handle hidden food items, an alternative that requires more effort and is probably more similar to natural foraging conditions. Eight captive, pair-housed <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> were given weekly choice tests in which they could obtain food either by approaching the usual food tray in one section of the enclosure (Tray), and/or by searching for food at variable sites amongst the vegetation in the other section of the enclosure (Scattered). Results indicate that <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> spent more time in the Scattered than in the Tray section of the enclosure (P = 0. 02) and that they obtained about half of the food from that section (48. 54 % +/- SE 0. 69). Our results, the first to demonstrate contrafreeloading in <b>maned</b> <b>wolves,</b> have implications for the husbandry and welfare of this endangered species. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Electrophoretic {{analysis}} of presumptive twenty gene loci products {{was conducted in}} hemolisates and plasma samples of twenty-eight <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> (Chrysocyon brachyurus) from an area in northeastern São Paulo State, Brazil. The area sampled was divided into three sub-areas, with the Mogi-Guaçu and Pardo rivers regarded as barriers to the gene flow. The polymorphism degree and heterozygosity level (intralocus and average) estimated {{in this study were}} similar to those detected by other authors for <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> and other species of wild free-living canids. The samples of each sub-area and the total sample exhibited genotype frequencies consistent with the genetic equilibrium model. The values of the F-statistics evidenced absence of inbreeding and population subdivision and, consequently, low genetic distances were found among the samples of each area...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLeishmania (Leishmania) infantum is {{the cause}} of visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in the Americas. The disease is transmitted mostly through the bite of the invertebrate vector, the phlebotomine Lutzomyia longipalpis in the New World. Although the domestic dog is considered the most important reservoir of the disease, other mammalian, including wildlife, are susceptible to infection. The goal {{of this study was to}} perform xenodiagnosis to evaluate the capacity of naturally infected <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) to transmit Leishmania infantum to female sand flies (L. longipalpis). Xenodiagnoses were performed in February and August, 2013, when 77. 7 % (three <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> and four bush dogs) or 100 % of the animals were positive, respectively. However, parasite loads in the engorged sand flies was low (< 200 promastigotes and < 150. 2 parasites/μg of DNA). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two species or the two time points (February and August). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that <b>maned</b> <b>wolves</b> (C. brachyurus) and bush dogs (S. venaticus) asymptomatically infected with L. infantum are capable of transmitting L. infantum to the invertebrate host L. longipalpis, although the parasite loads in engorged phlebotomines exposed to these animals were very low...|$|R

5000|$|Mammals are {{considered}} frugivorous if the seed is dispersed {{and able to}} establish. One example of a mammalian frugivore is the <b>maned</b> <b>wolf,</b> or Chrysocyon brachyurus, which is found in South America. A study by J.C. Motta-Junior and K.
