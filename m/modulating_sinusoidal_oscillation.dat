40|$|The {{mathematical}} model of periodically amplitude and phase <b>modulated</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> is studied, and its Fourier spectrum is given analytically. The Fourier {{spectrum of the}} model explains the main features of the frequency spectrum of RR Lyrae stars showing light curve modulation called the Blazhko effect: among others the appearance of multiplets, the rapid decrease of their amplitudes in increasing orders, the asymmetry of the amplitudes of the side frequency pairs, {{and the possibility of}} the occurrence of frequency doublets instead of triplets in the spectrum. The good agreement of the results of this {{mathematical model}} with observational facts favours those physical models of the Blazhko effect which explain the phenomenon as a modulation of the oscillation with the modulation frequency, f_m.

These models are special {{examples of the}} class of supergravity models proposed in arXiv: 1008. 3375 and arXiv: 1011. 5945, which have a shift symmetric Kähler potential, superpotential linear in goldstino, and stable Minkowski vacua. We present a class of supergravity models with arbitrary potentials <b>modulated</b> by <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations,</b> similar to the potentials associated with axion monodromy models. We show that one can implement natural inflation in supergravity even in the models of a single axion field with axion parameters O(1). We also discuss the irrational axion landscape in supergravity, which describes a potential with infinite number of stable Minkowski and metastable dS minima.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is performed to investigate free and forced oscillation {{of a gas}} bubble and cavitation in viscoelastic liquids of a three‐parameter Oldroyd model. The first‐order perturbation method for small amplitudes has been employed to obtain periodic solutions to the bubble dynamics equation. Consideration {{is given to the}} influence of surface tension, vapor pressure, and thermodynamic behavior of the gas inside the bubble. It is disclosed that transient behavior of the bubble in viscoelastic liquids is governed by five dimensionless parameters. Conditions for stable bubbles are obtained. Free oscillation consists of a decaying exponential component and a damped <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> associated with the natural frequency of the bubble‐liquid system. The effects of the five governing parameters on the natural frequency are determined. The radial motion of the bubble in an oscillating pressure field includes a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> associated with the forcing frequency, a decaying exponential component, and a damped <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> associated with the natural frequency.

40|$|The airway {{smooth muscle}} (ASM) plays an {{important}} role in the mechanism of respiratory system. Asthma, a common respiratory disease is associated with ASM hyper-contraction and shortening of airway diameter. This results in occlusion of the airway lumen leading to breathing difficulties. Various studies have shown that ASM can be relaxed by length oscillations. Previous experiments on ASM by applying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> at low frequencies and high amplitudes have showed a clear reduction in active force. Similar tests for a larger frequency range on ASM have also shown large reduction in dynamic force. But, it is not well known what parameters induce relaxation the most on ASM. The purpose of our research is to see the degree of relaxation when superimposed oscillations are applied on breathing and see which parameter relaxes smooth muscle the most. This research also focuses on investigating the effect of pulse <b>oscillation</b> rather than <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> on contracted ASM.

40|$|Geodetic and {{geophysical}} {{time series}} may contain <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> of unknown angular frequency. Often it {{is required to}} decide if such <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> are truly present in a given time series. Here we pose the decision problem as a statistical hypothesis test, an approach very popular in geodesy and other scientific disciplines. In the case of unknown angular frequencies such a test {{has not yet been}} proposed. We restrict ourselves to the detection of a single <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> in a one-dimensional time series, sampled at non-uniform time intervals. We compare two solution methods: the likelihood ratio test for parameters in a Gauss-Markov model and the analysis of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Whenever needed, critical values of these tests are computed using the Monte Carlo method. We analyze an exemplary time series from an absolute gravimetric observation by various tests. Finally, we compare their statistical power. It is found that the results for the exemplary time series are comparable. The LR test is more flexible, but always requires the Monte Carlo method for the computation of critical values. The periodogram analysis is computationally faster, because critical values can be approximately deduced from the exponential distribution, at least if the sampling is nearly uniform...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to extend the {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) passive dynamic biped walker to a 3 -D dynamic biped walker, i. e., a walker that can walk on a horizontal surface based on a passive dynamic walking. A new prototype of 3 -D biped walker called RW 04, which has telescopic knee joints, was developed and its ability for walking was validated through some experiments. A <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation,</b> which is regarded as a central pattern generator with no sensory feedback, was provided to the knee joints to achieve the biped walking. The results showed that the biped gait of RW 04 was possible only via a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the knee joint. Moreover, the 3 -D dynamic walking gait via frequency response and zero moment point (ZMP) trajectory was also analyzed. The biped locomotion had a resonance, i. e., the frequency matched the natural frequency of the locomotion in the gain property. An “ 8 ” shaped ZMP trajectory was observed, which was found to be similar to that of the human gait. However, the simple <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> had limitations such as stride reduction or discontinuation by phase difference. Therefore, in future work, more adaptable control strategy such as a sensory feedback using ZMP should be provided. ...|$|R

40|$|Free {{induction}} decay (FID) {{measured by}} {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) in a polycrystalline solid is the isotropic average of the FIDs for individual single crystallites. It has been recently proposed theoretically and verified experimentally that the long-time behavior of single-crystal FIDs has the universal form of exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Polycrystalline averaging complicates the situation theoretically, while the available experimental evidence is also ambiguous. Exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> have been observed for Xe- 129 in polycrystalline solid xenon but not for F- 19 in the powder of CaF 2. In this paper, we present the first principles FID calculations for the powders of both CaF 2 and solid xenon. In both cases, the asymptotic long-time behavior has the expected form of exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations,</b> which {{is determined by the}} single crystallite FID with the slowest exponential decay. However, this behavior appears only at rather small values of the signal that have not yet been measured in experiments. At intermediate times accessible experimentally, a polycrystalline FID depends on the distribution of the exponential decay constants and oscillation frequencies for single crystallite FIDs. In CaF 2, these parameters are relatively broadly distributed, and as a result, the <b>sinusoidal</b> long-time <b>oscillations</b> become somewhat washed out. In contrast, the single crystallite parameters are more clustered in solid xenon, and, as a result, the experimentally observable range is characterized by well-defined oscillation frequency and exponential decay constant even though both of these parameters do not represent the true long-time behavior. The above difference of the intermediate FID behavior originates from the difference of the crystal structures of solid xenon and CaF 2. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
