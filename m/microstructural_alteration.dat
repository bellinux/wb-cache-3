40|$|GH 4169 is {{comparatively}} a new superalloy mainly used as turbine components {{because of}} its outstanding combination properties such as high-temperature strength, thermal stability and wear resistance. But these also {{make it hard to}} cut, and its machined surface quality and integrity are particularly sensitive to the manufacturing process employed. The existing researches on machining-induced surface integrity and machinability of hard-to-cut materials are briefly reviewed; the effects of processing parameters on surface integrity for GH 4169 components are studied in detail via orthogonal-designed external grinding experiment. The single-factorial plain grinding experiment was designed to further investigate the influence of depth of cut on the surface integrity characteristics. The surface roughness, residual stress distribution, microhardness profile and <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> within the subsurface were obtained and analyzed. It was shown that the surface integrity is susceptible to the magnitude of depth of cut, and the components ground with low depth of cut are of more acceptable surface quality with less variation in residual stress and microhardness within the machining-affected layer than those obtained with high depth of cut. No severe <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> or adverse surface cracking was discerned when the depth of cut is reasonably set...|$|E

Although {{it has been reported}} that DER and WEBs typically appear in bearings over extended rolling cycles (> 100 × 106) as a result of material deterioration under high-stress RCF while WECs are found to occur in much earlier of bearing’s life (< 20 % the calculated L 10 life), differences and relationship between DER/WEBs and WECs are not fully investigated or understood. This study investigated the <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> in WECs in an AISI 52100 through-hardened martensitic bearing using a combination of characterisation methods and the results are directly compared with those observed in DER and WEBs due to high-stress RCF (Šmeļova et al., 2017). The results show that, although the features maybe initiated by different causes, there are many similarities between the <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> in WECs and DER/WEBs, such as the carbide disintegration, and carbon and chromium movement that plays a role in the formation and development of <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> in all three features...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Evaluation of the {{influence}} of long-term intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment on preexisting retinal <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> in patients with diabetic macular edema. METHODS: Eyes with diabetic macular edema and a history of ≥ 20 intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (aflibercept and/or ranibizumab) injections were included in this retrospective study. Primary outcome was the extent of disorganization of retinal inner layers, alterations at the outer plexiform layer/Henle fiber layer junction, disruption of external limiting membrane/ellipsoid zone, disruption of retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch complex, and retinal atrophy at baseline versus after ≥ 20 intravitreal injections as visualized by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images. RESULTS: Of 383 eyes screened, 37 eyes were included in the current study. With the exception of outer plexiform layer/Henle fiber layer junction restoration, no significant changes regarding <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> between baseline and end of study were encountered after long-term anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (disorganization of retinal inner layers P = 0. 381, outer plexiform layer/Henle fiber layer junction P = 0. 001, external limiting membrane/ellipsoid zone P = 0. 524, retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch complex P = 0. 122, retinal atrophy P = 0. 317). Best-corrected visual acuity significantly increased {{over the course of the}} study, corresponding to central retinal thickness and intraretinal fluid reduction (all P < 0. 0001). The extent of <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> was negatively correlated with best-corrected visual acuity (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Apart from outer plexiform layer/Henle fiber layer junction layer restoration, no effect on preexisting retinal alterations was encountered after long-term intravitreal injections.

40|$|Age {{differences}} in human brain plasticity are assumed, {{but have not}} been systematically investigated. In this longitudinal study, we investigated changes in white matter (WM) microstructure in response to memory training relative to passive and active control conditions in 183 young and older adults. We hypothesized that (i) only the training group would show improved memory performance and <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations,</b> (ii) the young adults would show larger memory improvement and {{a higher degree of}} <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> as compared to the older adults, and (iii) changes in memory performance would relate to <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations.</b> The results showed that memory improvement was specific to the training group, and that both the young and older participants improved their performance. The young group improved their memory to a larger extent compared to the older group. In the older sample, the training group showed less age-related decline in WM microstructure compared to the control groups, in areas overlapping the corpus callosum, the cortico-spinal tract, the cingulum bundle, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the anterior thalamic radiation. Less microstructural decline was related to a higher degree of memory improvement. Despite individual adaptation securing sufficient task difficulty, no training-related group {{differences in}} microstructure were found in the young adults. The observed divergence of behavioral and microstructural responses to memory training with age is discussed within a supply-demand framework. The results demonstrate that plasticity is preserved into older age, and that <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> may be part of a neurobiological substrate for behavioral improvements in older adults.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of industrial waste presents major logistical, financial and environmental issues. Technologies that {{can reduce the}} hazardous properties of wastes are urgently required. In the present work, a number of industrial wastes arising from the cement, metallurgical, paper, waste disposal and energy industries were treated with accelerated carbonation. In this process carbonation was effected by exposing the waste to pure carbon dioxide gas. The paper and cement wastes chemically combined with up to 25 % by weight of gas. The reactivity of the wastes to carbon dioxide was controlled by their constituent minerals, and not by their elemental composition, as previously postulated. Similarly, <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> upon carbonation was primarily influenced by mineralogy. Many of the thermal wastes tested were classified as hazardous, based upon regulated metal content and pH.

40|$|Conventional {{nitriding}} {{treatment on}} Ti alloys is a challenging technological process because of both Ti high affinity with N, {{that produces a}} barrier for the diffusion of gas in the bulk of material, {{and the need to}} perform the treatment at high temperatures, thus producing a degradation of the microstructure obtained by previous conventional heat treatment. In this work, the induction heating has been obtained in a nitrogen rich environment at atmospheric pressure in order to nitride Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, thus reducing the <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> in the bulk of material caused by the treatment temperature of conventional nitriding. In this case the aim was to preserve, in the core, the solution and aging treatment of the material that was previously performed. The nitriding number cycles has been varied in order to produce treatments with different thicknesses and possibly different properties. Post-treatment surface morphologies and cross section microstructures have been studied by means of Stylus Profilometry and Scanning Electron Microscopy, in order to evaluate possible modifications of the original surface caused by the diffusion of N.

A variety of advanced microstructural characterization tools are available to examine the microstructural changes induced by particle irradiation, including electron microscopy, atom probe field ion microscopy, X-ray scattering and spectrometry, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, nuclear reaction analysis, and neutron scattering and spectrometry. Numerous reviews, which summarize the microstructural changes in materials associated with electron and heavy ion or neutron irradiation, have been published. These reviews have focused on pure metals as well as model alloys, steels, and ceramic materials. In this chapter, the commonly observed defect cluster morphologies produced by particle irradiation are summarized and an overview is presented on some of the key physical parameters that have a major influence on microstructural evolution of irradiated materials. The relationship between microstructural changes and evolution of physical and mechanical properties is then summarized, with particular emphasis on eight key radiation-induced property degradation phenomena.

NF 1 patients have impairments in frontal lobe based cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, and inhibition. Due to its well– characterized genetic etiology, investigations of NF 1 may shed light on neural mechanisms underlying such difficulties {{in the general population}} or other patient groups. Prior neuroimaging findings indicate global brain volume increases, consistent with neural over-proliferation. However, little is known about alterations in white matter microstructure in NF 1. We performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in 14 young adult NF 1 patients and 12 healthy controls. We also examined brain volumetric measures in the same subjects. Consistent with prior studies, we found significantly increased overall gray and white matter volume in NF 1 patients. Relative to healthy controls, NF 1 patients showed widespread reductions in white matter integrity across the entire brain as reflected by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and significantly increased absolute diffusion (ADC). When radial and axial diffusion were examined we found pronounced differences in radial diffusion in NF 1 patients, indicative of either decreased myelination or increased space between axons. Secondary analyses revealed that FA and radial diffusion effects were of greatest magnitude in the frontal lobe. Such alterations of white matter tracts connecting frontal regions could contribute to the observed cognitive deficits. Furthermore, although the cellular basis of these white matter <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration...</b>|$|E

Concomitant investigation of multiple intrinsic diffusivities may {{shed light on the}} neurobiologic substrate of the WM degeneration pattern in patients with pure hereditary spastic paraplegia across the whole brain. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: Tract-based spatial statistics analysis was performed to compare fractional anisotropy andmean, axial, and radial diffusivities of theWM skeleton in {{a group of}} 12 patients with pure hereditary spastic paraplegia and 12 healthy volunteers. Data were analyzed counting age and sex as nuisance covariates. The threshold-free cluster-enhancement option was applied, and the family-wise error rate was controlled by using permutation tests for nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: In pure hereditary spastic paraplegia, group widespread fractional anisotropy decreases and radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity increases (P. 05, corrected) were found.

40|$|In this work, a novel {{method is}} put forward to quantitatively {{simulate}} the subsurface damages <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> of titanium alloy components subjected to microscale cutting. A trans-scale numerical framework is {{conducted with the}} purpose of revealing the underlying influence mechanism of tool structure parameters on subsurface dislocation configurations using a dislocation dynamics-based model, which considers both dislocation structural transformation and grain refining. Results showed that the developed framework not only captured the essential features of workpiece microstructure, but also predicted the subsurface damages layer states and their modifications. A series of defects were found in the material subsurface during the orthogonal cutting of titanium alloy, such as edge and screw dislocations, junctions, parallel slip lines, intersection dislocation bands, vacancy defects, and refinement grains. Particularly, in the process of micro-cutting, the depth of subsurface damages layer increased significantly with cutting length at the beginning, and then remained unchanged in the stable removal phase. Moreover, smaller edge radius and larger rake angle can greatly weaken the squeezing action and heat diffusion effect between the tool tip and workpiece, which further prevents the formation of subsurface defects and enhances finished surface quality. In addition, although increasing tool clearance angle could drastically lighten the thickness of subsurface damages layer, it is noteworthy that its performance would be decreased significantly when the clearance angle was {{greater than or equal to}} 5 °.

40|$|Despite {{the many}} studies documenting {{cerebral}} white matter <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> associated with very preterm birth (< 32 weeks’ gestation), {{there is a}} dearth of similar research in moderate and late preterm infants (born 32 – 36 weeks’ gestation), who experience higher rates of neurodevelopmental delays than infants born at term (≥ 37 weeks’ gestation). We therefore aimed to determine whether whole brain white matter microstructure differs between moderate and late preterm infants and term-born controls at term-equivalent age, {{as well as to}} identify potential perinatal risk factors for white matter <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> in moderate and late preterm infants. Whole brain white matter microstructure was studied in 193 moderate and late preterm infants and 83 controls at term-equivalent age by performing Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data. Moderate and late preterm infants had lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean, axial and radial diffusivities compared with controls in nearly 70 % of the brain’s major white matter fiber tracts. In the moderate and late preterm group, being born small for gestational age and male sex were associated with lower fractional anisotropy, largely within the optic radiation, corpus callosum and corona radiata. In conclusion, moderate and late preterm infants exhibit widespread brain white matter <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> compared with controls at term-equivalent age, in patterns consistent with delayed or disrupted white matter microstructural development.

Thirty-two FD patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of classical FD (12 males, mean age 43. 3 [*]±[*] 12. 2) were enrolled, along with 35 healthy controls (HC) of comparable age and sex (14 males, mean age 42. 1 [*]±[*] 14. 5). Resting-State fMRI data were analyzed using a seed-based approach, with six different seeds sampling the main hubs of the DMN. Structural modifications were assessed by means of Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analyses. Between-group differences and correlations with neuropsychological variables were probed voxelwise over the whole brain. Possible correlations between FC modifications and global measures of <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> were also tested in FD patients with a partial correlation analysis. In the FD group, clusters of increased functional connectivity involving both supratentorial and infratentorial regions emerged, partially correlated to the widespread white matter (WM) damage found in these patients. No gray matter volume differences were found at VBM between the two groups. The connectivity between right inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus was significantly correlated with the Corsi block-tapping test results (p[*]=[*]. 0001).

40|$|AbstractTraditional {{methods for}} {{achieving}} hierarchical surface structures include highly specified, deterministic approaches to create features to meet design intention. In this study <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> was undertaken using laser apparatus and secondary texturing was achieved via succeeding electrochemical processes. Electrochemical jet machining (EJM) {{was performed on}} mild steel subjected to laser pre-treatment using power densities of 4167 and 5556 W/cm 2 with pulse durations from 0. 3 – 1. 5 s. Results show that in combination, laser pre-treatment and EJM can alter the exposed surface textures and chemistries. Here, machined surface roughness (Sa) was shown to increase from approximately 0. 45 μm for untreated surfaces to approximately 18 μm for surfaces subjected to extreme laser pre-treatments. After pre-treatments materials were characterised to appraise microstructural changes, shown to be martensite formation, reinforced by complementary simulation data, and significant increases in observable hardness from approximately 261 HV for the as-received material to over 700 HV after pre-treatment. The greater hardness was retained after EJM. Exposed martensitic lath structures at machined surfaces are shown to be partially responsible for surface roughness increases. The surfaces were explored with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy demonstrating changes in apparent surface chemistry. This analysis revealed increasing oxide formation at {{the surface of the}} pre-treated EJM surface, a further contributory factor to surface roughness increases. This new process chain will be of interest to manufacturers seeking to control surface morphology for applications including micro-injection mould/die manufacture.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to {{investigate}} the effects of MIG welding on the corrosion and mechanical properties of AA 6061 T 6. A series of experimental techniques has been conducted to evaluate the corrosion and mechanical properties of the alloy. The corrosion media used was 3. 5 % (wt) NaCl. Polarization and open circuit potential tests were conducted by exposing various zones independently; therefore the reported corrosion results correspond to uncoupled condition. Different mechanical tests including tensile, torsion, and hardness were carried out; the same tests were also used for the un-welded specimens. The results show that the heat affected zone (HAZ) exhibited poor corrosion properties compared to the base metal (BM). The corrosion on both HAZ and BM was of pitting nature. More corrosion was observed on HAZ due to the thermal effects of the welding. Corrosion potential of HAZ was largely fluctuated comparing to BM with more negative peaks. The corrosion potential of the BM remained relatively steady over the whole immersion time. Welded specimens show lower mechanical properties comparing to non-welded specimens. The location of failure for welded and un-welded specimens after tensile test was found to be across the centre of the specimens. Welded tensile specimens have shown lower tensile strength. The location of the failure for welded specimens after torsion test was found predominantly along the HAZ which was attributed to the <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> that caused by the generation of heat during the welding process. Un-welded torsion specimens were failed near the centre line. Welded specimens exhibited lower torsion properties compared to the non-welded specimens with a reduction of almost 50 %.

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> in bearing steels under rolling contact fatigue (RCF) is systematically studied. A literature review summarizes current understanding in this field, {{leading to the}} key to the {{formation of}} these microstructural features being carbon redistribution as a consequence of cyclic rolling contact. In this context, a novel theory is postulated to describe the migration of carbon caused by gliding dislocations. The theory combines the Cottrell atmosphere theory with the Orowan equation and is capable of quantifying the dislocation-assisted carbon flux. Based on the proposed theory, models are suggested for different types of <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> formed in rolling contact fatigued bearings – dark etching regions (DERs), white etching bands (WEBs) and white etching areas (WEAs). Very good agreement is obtained between the predications made by the models and the experimental data from both this research and the literature. Moreover, the models consider the effects of contact pressure, temperature, rotational speed and number of cycles, and thus can be applied for universal RCF testing conditions. The reproduced microstructural features are also characterized using advanced characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), with the observation validating the postulated formation mechanisms. It is demonstrated that DERs, WEBs and WEAs follow the same principle during formation – strain induced carbon redistribution. This {{is the first time that}} these <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> are quantitatively described using a unified theory. The achievements obtained from this research can be far reaching.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that {{autism spectrum disorder is}} underpinned by an ‘atypical connectivity’ involving higher-order association brain regions. To test this hypothesis {{in a large}} cohort of adults with autism spectrum disorder we compared the white matter networks of 61 adult males with autism spectrum disorder and 61 neurotypical controls, using two complementary approaches to diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. First, we applied tract-based spatial statistics, a ‘whole brain’ non-hypothesis driven method, to identify differences in white matter networks in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Following this we used a tractspecific analysis, based on tractography, to carry out a more detailed analysis of individual tracts identified by tract-based spatial statistics. Finally, within the autism spectrum disorder group, we studied the relationship between diffusion measures and autistic symptom severity. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed that autism spectrum disorder was associated with significantly reduced fractional anisotropy in regions that included frontal lobe pathways. Tractography analysis of these specific pathways showed increased mean and perpendicular diffusivity, and reduced number of streamlines in the anterior and long segments of the arcuate fasciculus, cingulum and uncinate—predominantly in the left hemisphere. Abnormalities were also evident in the anterior portions of the corpus callosum connecting left and right frontal lobes. The degree of <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> of the arcuate and uncinate fasciculi was associated with severity of symptoms in language and social reciprocity in childhood. Our results indicated that autism spectrum disorder is a developmental condition associated with abnormal connectivity of the frontal lobes. Furthermore our findings showed that male adults with autism spectrum disorder have regional differences in brain anatomy, which correlate with specific aspects of autistic symptoms. Overall these results suggest that autism spectrum disorder is a condition linked to aberrant developmental trajectories of the frontal networks that persist in adult life...|$|E
40|$|Nimonic C- 263 {{has been}} widely used in hot portion of jet engine, {{submarine}} and chemical industries, gas turbine components, heat exchanger and ultra-supercritical power plant due to its ability to operate at elevated temperature for {{long period of time}} and higher resistance to corrosion and oxidation in acidic and aqueous environment. Properties such as high shear strength, low thermal conductivity, high tendency towards strain hardening, high hot hardness, and chemical affinity towards tool material poses greater challenge to the industries for achieving higher productivity and good surface quality of component with sustainable machining. Topographical, mechanical, metallurgical, chemical and thermal changes happen in the surface and sub-surface layer of material during machining which influences the functional performance of component. The study focuses on the effect of coating and cooling technique on surface integrity during machining of Nimonic C- 263. Surface and sub-surface alteration such as surface damages, grain refinement, <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration,</b> white layer and work-hardened layer during machining was examined using Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X ray diffraction (XRD) system, XRD texture measurement and micro hardness tester. The effect of cutting speed and feed rate on surface integrity under these environments also has been analysed. The research demonstrated significant improvement in surface integrity with the use of minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and flood environment during machining at low and medium cutting condition. High tool wear of uncoated tool and less cooling and lubricating efficiency of MQL and flood together deteriorate surface integrity at high cutting speed and feed. The PVD multilayer coated tool even under dry machining condition has given comparable result and sometimes even better than wet machining with uncoated tool. Surface damages in the form of micro cracks, voids, grooves, cavity and material transfer mainly observed in the surface. Deformed zones were intrinsic for all process conditions whereas their intensity and thickness increases with increases in tool wear and cutting parameter. The increase of feed rate had more influence on the plastic deformation. Overall it can be recommended that dry machining can be more beneficial than wet machining when PVD multilayer coated tool vii used under high cutting speed and feed. This is particularly important for higher productivity in sustainable manner...|$|E
40|$|Understanding neural {{injury in}} {{hydrocephalus}} {{and how the}} brain changes {{during the course of}} the disease in-vivo remain unclear. This study describes brain deformation, microstructural and mechanical properties changes during obstructive hydrocephalus development in a rat model using multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Hydrocephalus was induced in eight Sprague-Dawley rats (4 weeks old) by injecting a kaolin suspension into the cisterna magna. Six sham-injected rats were used as controls. MR imaging (9. 4 T, Bruker) was performed 1 day before, and at 3, 7 and 16 days post injection. T 2 -weighted MR images were collected to quantify brain deformation. MR elastography was used to measure brain stiffness, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was conducted to observe brain tissue microstructure. Results showed that the enlargement of the ventricular system was associated with a decrease in the cortical gray matter thickness and caudate-putamen cross-sectional area (P < 0. 001, for both), an alteration of the corpus callosum and periventricular white matter microstructure (CC+PVWM) and rearrangement of the cortical gray matter microstructure (P < 0. 001, for both), while compression without gross <b>microstructural</b> <b>alteration</b> was evident in the caudate-putamen and ventral internal capsule (P < 0. 001, for both). During hydrocephalus development, increased space between the white matter tracts was observed in the CC+PVWM (P < 0. 001), while a decrease in space was observed for the ventral internal capsule (P < 0. 001). For the cortical gray matter, an increase in extracellular tissue water was significantly associated with a decrease in tissue stiffness (P = 0. 001). To conclude, this study characterizes the temporal changes in tissue microstructure, water content and stiffness in different brain regions and their association with ventricular enlargement. In summary, whilst diffusion changes were larger and statistically significant for majority of the brain regions studied, the changes in mechanical properties were modest. Moreover, the effect of ventricular enlargement is not limited to the CC+PVWM and ventral internal capsule, the extent of microstructural changes vary between brain regions, and there is regional and temporal variation in brain tissue stiffness during hydrocephalus development. 24 page(s...|$|E
40|$|To study whole-brain <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> in {{patients}} with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and {{examine the relationship between}} brain microstructure and physiological indictors in the disease. Diffusion tensor imaging data were collected from 35 patients with ESRD (28 men, 18 - 61 years) and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs, 32 men, 22 - 58 years). A voxel-wise analysis was then used to identify <b>microstructural</b> <b>alterations</b> over the whole brain in the ESRD patients compared with the HCs. Multiple biochemical measures of renal metabolin, vascular risk factors, general cognitive ability and dialysis duration were correlated with microstructural integrity for the patients. Compared to the HCs, the ESRD patients exhibited disrupted microstructural integrity in not only white matter (WM) but also gray matter (GM) regions, as characterized by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). Further correlation analyses revealed that the in MD, AD and RD values showed significantly positive correlations with the blood urea nitrogen in the left superior temporal gyrus and significantly negative correlations with the calcium levels in the left superior frontal gyrus (orbital part) in the patients. Our findings suggest that ESRD is associated with widespread diffusion abnormalities in both WM and GM regions in the brain, and microstructural integrity of several GM regions are related to biochemical alterations in the disease...|$|R
