5|$|The South Lhasa terrane {{experienced}} <b>metamorphism</b> and magmatism in the Early Cenozoic (55–45 Ma) and <b>metamorphism</b> in the Late Eocene (40–30 Ma), presumably due to {{the collision}} between the continents of India and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} <b>metamorphism</b> {{on the border}} between granite and gneiss bodies {{produces}} a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts. Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts; the green color comes from minerals, such as chlorite, epidote and actinolite that formed during <b>metamorphism.</b> After <b>metamorphism</b> occurred, these rocks were folded and faulted into a system of mountains by the Algoman orogeny.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} <b>metamorphism</b> (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). Radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700million years for the <b>metamorphism</b> during the Proterozoic. About 1,400million years ago a mass of granite now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500million years of erosion.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism; the rock has been pressure-cooked. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally sedimentary and igneous rocks with large quantities of quartz and feldspar mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted schist and gneiss, making their original parentage almost unrecognizable. Radiometric dating gives an age of 1700 million years for the <b>metamorphism,</b> placing it in the early part of the Proterozoic eon.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{significant}} events occurred around 42 Ma, including cessation of <b>metamorphism</b> of the Leech River Schists (resulting from the Metchosin/Crescent Formation being thrust under Vancouver Island) {{and the end}} of strike-slip motion on the Straight Creek Fault; these may reflect the last movement of Siletzia relative to North America. On a broader scale, there was a change in absolute direction of the Pacific plate (marked {{by the end of the}} bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain), and a change in the convergence of the Kula plate with the North American plate.|$|E
5|$|This {{study has}} been criticized on {{multiple}} grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that measurement of the northern ages may {{have been affected by}} loss of argon due to low-grade <b>metamorphism,</b> and that there might be bias in respect of stratigraphic position. The latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions, and thus are not representative of the initial phase of Siletz magmatism. Recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression ("younging").|$|E
5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, <b>metamorphism,</b> and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, West Antarctica {{closely resembles}} the Andes {{mountain}} range of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula {{was formed by}} uplift and <b>metamorphism</b> of sea bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by igneous intrusions and volcanism. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are andesite and rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the Ellsworth Mountains region, where the stratigraphy is more similar to East Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Metagreywackes and metapelites {{from two}} areas {{traversing}} {{one of these}} aureoles near Yellowknife have been studied. Most of the Slave province rocks are granitic with metamorphosed Yellowknife metasedimentary and volcanic rocks. Isotopic ages of these rocks is around , {{the time of the}} Kenoran orogeny. Rocks comprising the Slave province represent a high grade of <b>metamorphism,</b> intrusion and basement remobilization typical of Archean terranes. Migmatites, batholithic intrusive and granulitic metamorphic rocks show foliation and compositional banding; the rocks are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists. Most Yellowknife Supergroup metasediments are tightly folded (isoclinal) or occur in plunging anticlines.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of organisms' {{bodies are}} usually the most {{informative}} type of evidence. The most common types are wood, bones, and shells. Fossilisation is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or <b>metamorphism</b> {{before they can be}} observed. Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so further back in time. Despite this, it is often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history. There are also biases in the fossil record: different environments are more favorable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms. Further, only the parts of organisms that were already mineralised are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.|$|E
5|$|The Penokean Mountain Range {{formed in}} the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 million years ago, when an oceanic island arc called the Pembine–Wausau terrane {{collided}} with the southern margin of the Superior craton. From 1880 to 1850 million years ago, the region was volcanically active. This volcanism ceased 1850 million years ago when a fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone. Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior craton in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening. Rocks of the Pembine–Wassau terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior craton, forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior, crossed parts of three US states (south-central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario, Canada. Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards, forming a foreland basin at around 1850 million {{years ago in the}} south and 1835 million years ago in the north. The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin. In the southern basin, crustal thickening caused high-grade <b>metamorphism</b> of the sedimentary fill by 1830 million years ago. A series of post-orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 million years ago,; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny.|$|E
25|$|The {{forces that}} created Yule Marble make it {{distinct}} {{from all other}} American marbles. It was formed by contact <b>metamorphism,</b> unlike Vermont marble and Georgia marble, which {{are the result of}} regional <b>metamorphism,</b> a process more associated with the orogeny and erosion of mountain ranges on a regional scale. Tennessee marble did not undergo <b>metamorphism,</b> so is not true marble, which is metamorphic.|$|E
25|$|Many {{forms of}} rock {{alteration}} {{can be seen}} in the TGB. Its overall structure has attained greenschist grade <b>metamorphism,</b> even though amphibolite grade <b>metamorphism</b> surrounds the Chambers-Strathy Batholith. The <b>metamorphism</b> that creates greenschist is minimal in contrast to that which creates rocks such as gneiss. Other rock alterations include small veins of quartz and epidote, vesicles filled with quartz, calcite and chlorite, extensive replacement of volcanic rock by silica or calcite, and calcite precipitation in extension fractures.|$|E
25|$|Slate {{is a hard}} {{mudstone}} {{that has}} undergone metamorphosis, and has well-developed cleavage. It has gone through <b>metamorphism</b> at temperatures between , or extreme deformation. Since slate is formed in the lower realm of <b>metamorphism,</b> based on pressure and temperature, slate retains its stratification and {{can be defined as}} a hard, fine-grained rock.|$|E
25|$|In the ore environment, the <b>metamorphism</b> {{tends to}} remobilise the nickel sulfide which, during peak <b>metamorphism,</b> has the yield {{strength}} and behaviour of toothpaste as conceptualised by workers within the field. The massive sulfides tend to move tens {{to hundreds of}} meters away from their original depositional position into fold hinges, footwall sediments, faults or become caught up within asymmetric shear zones.|$|E
25|$|Prograde <b>metamorphism</b> {{to either}} greenschist facies or {{amphibolite}} facies tends to revert igneous olivine to metamorphic olivine, serpentinite or talc carbonated ultramafic schists.|$|E
25|$|The 1,850-year-old Penokean {{magmatism}} in Wisconsin represents margin-type igneous activity terminated by collision. Some of the Penokean granites show {{iron enrichment}} {{similar to the}} magnetite series, rather than the low-oxygen concentration of the magnetic titanium oxides. Penokean-age rocks in the northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan contain areas of low-pressure, low- to high-temperature <b>metamorphism.</b> The folding and <b>metamorphism</b> increased in intensity {{to the south and}} southeast, and produced the isolated gneissic 1,755-million-year-old Watersmeet Domes which straddle the border of Michigan and northeastern Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|The cryptocrystalline {{nature of}} chert, {{combined}} with its above average ability to resist weathering, recrystallization and <b>metamorphism</b> {{has made it}} an ideal rock for preservation of early life forms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metamorphism</b> {{is nearly}} {{ubiquitous}} within Archaean komatiites. The type locality for Kambalda-type Ni-Cu-PGE deposits has suffered several metamorphic events which {{have altered the}} mineralogy, textures and morphology of the komatiite-hosted ore.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in classifying and identifying komatiite-hosted NiS ore deposits as Kambalda type is the structural complication and overprint of <b>metamorphism</b> upon the volcanic morphology and textures of the ore deposit.|$|E
25|$|The Bowning Deformation {{caused the}} north–south {{faulting}} and long folding {{in the area}} surrounding the ACT. This deformation was connected with the attachment of the terrane to the continent. During this stage <b>metamorphism</b> occurred. In the Canberra Graben and Cullarin Block, <b>metamorphism</b> mostly reached the upper greenschist stage, with shallow burial and temperature below 350°C. This changed the volcanics and sediments with sericitisation, saussuritisation, conversion of plagioclase to albite, and conversion of biotite to chlorite, titanite, epidote and opaque minerals. On the western margin in southwest Belconnen, Duffy, and Kambah in the Laidlaw and Walker Volcanics the temperature was lower and prehnite-pumpellyite facies was achieved. This was not sufficient to convert plagioclase to albite.|$|E
25|$|The {{metamorphic}} mineralogy of ultramafic rocks, particularly komatiites, is {{only partially}} controlled by composition. The {{character of the}} connate fluids which are present during low temperature <b>metamorphism</b> whether prograde or retrograde control the metamorphic assemblage of a metakomatiite (hereafter the prefix meta- is assumed).|$|E
25|$|This {{accretion}} {{event is}} recorded by widespread granite and granodiorite intrusions, which comprise over 70% of the Yilgarn craton; voluminous tholeiitic basalt and komatiite volcanism; regional <b>metamorphism</b> and deformation {{as well as}} the emplacement of {{the vast majority of the}} craton's endowment in gold mineralisation.|$|E
25|$|At time of {{deposition}} of the Devonian formations, present-day northern South America was {{located at the}} edge of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean on the southern hemisphere. The Paleozoic occurrence on the Altiplano is localized in outcrop; the majority of surface sediments are Cretaceous to Paleogene in age. Neogene uplift of the Eastern Ranges, with its main phase in the Plio-Pleistocene, caused the exhumation of older units at surface along major thrust faults in the Eastern Andes. In two phases during the Paleozoic, intrusions occurred into the sedimentary sequence, causing local <b>metamorphism.</b> The first phase is considered pre-Devonian and the latter phase post-Devonian. The remaining stratigraphy of the Cuche Formation appears little affected by this intrusive phase, although slight <b>metamorphism</b> has been identified in later research.|$|E
25|$|Hilt's {{law is a}} {{geological}} {{observation that}} (within in a small area) the deeper the coal is found, the higher its rank (or grade). It appliies if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical; however, <b>metamorphism</b> may cause lateral changes of rank, irrespective of depth.|$|E
25|$|While sulfide {{minerals}} do {{not change}} their mineralogy during <b>metamorphism</b> as silicates do, the yield strength of the nickel sulfide pentlandite, and copper sulfide chalcopyrite is {{less than that of}} pyrrhotite and pyrite, resulting in a potential to segregate the sulfides mechanically throughout a shear zone.|$|E
25|$|Ultramafic {{mineralogy}} {{is especially}} susceptible to retrograde <b>metamorphism,</b> especially when water is present. Few komatiite sequences display even pristine metamorphic assembages, with most metamorphic olivine replaced by serpentine, anthophyllite, talc or chlorite. Pyroxene tends to retrogress to actinolite-cummingtonite or chlorite. Chromite may hydrothermally alter to stichtite, and pentlandite may retrogress into millerite or heazlewoodite.|$|E
25|$|Burial {{of rocks}} due to ongoing {{sedimentation}} leads to increased pressure and temperature, which stimulates certain chemical reactions. An {{example is the}} reactions by which organic material becomes lignite or coal. When temperature and pressure increase still further, the realm of diagenesis makes way for <b>metamorphism,</b> the process that forms metamorphic rock.|$|E
25|$|A nonconformity {{exists between}} {{sedimentary}} rocks and metamorphic or igneous rocks when the sedimentary rock lies above and was deposited on the pre-existing and eroded metamorphic or igneous rock. Namely, if the rock below the break is igneous or {{has lost its}} bedding due to <b>metamorphism,</b> the plane of juncture is a nonconformity.|$|E
25|$|Sediments {{from the}} Late Permian to Triassic periods are absent in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin, but {{evidenced}} {{in the surrounding}} orogens. Intense magmatism and <b>metamorphism</b> affected the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The compressive phase {{is associated with the}} Hercynian orogeny, leading to the formation of Pangea.|$|E
25|$|The town of Cleve lies on {{an ancient}} bedrock that has {{undergone}} high grade <b>metamorphism,</b> {{with the area}} characterised by Schists, Gneisses and Granites in a formation known as the 'Hutchinson Group'. The area's strata was laid down in the Proterozoic, some 600-2300 million years ago. The area underwent deformation during the orogeny events that shaped Australia.|$|E
25|$|Minor igneous intrusions, {{deformation}} (folding and faulting) {{and subsequent}} <b>metamorphism</b> of the Aravalli Mountains represent the main phase of orogenesis. The {{erosion of the}} mountains, and further deformation of the sediments of the Dharwarian group (Bijawars) marks the second phase. The volcanic activities and intrusions, associated with this second phase are recorded {{in the composition of}} these sediments.|$|E
25|$|More intense <b>metamorphism</b> {{occurred}} {{to the east}} of the Googong Dam, east of the ACT on the Molonglo Range and Yarrow Peak and Taliesin Hills. Psammitic schist and pellitic schist occur there. Within this region, there are two parallel belts of knotted schist even more strongly heated to over 525°C. The temperature gradient in the area was high at 70°C per kilometre.|$|E
25|$|Two {{separate}} {{periods of}} Whin dolerite injection are confirmed by studies of vitrinite reflectance over the Alston Block where two periods of Whin contact <b>metamorphism</b> have been recognized. The two periods of Whin dolerite emplacement {{form part of}} the end-Carboniferous earth movements in northern England. They can be shown to have occurred between a period of compression from a W-SW direction and later gentle doming of the Alston Block near the Westphalian-Stephanian boundary, dated about 300-295 Ma.|$|E
25|$|These factors {{contribute}} to the <b>metamorphism</b> of snow, i.e. the process of reshaping snow crystals into smaller, more rounded ice grains, which in turn consolidates and settles the snow pack. Increased density increases strength by joining of grains though sintering and freezing of melted water. New-fallen snow may have a density of 150 - 200kg/m3. Whereas a snowmobile can pack snow to a density of 300 - 350kg/m3, the densities required for recreational trails are 450kg/m3 and for racing, 500kg/m3 or higher.|$|E
25|$|Arapiles {{today is}} {{preserved}} {{due to a}} granitic intrusion that was emplaced below the sandstone and conglomerate approx 400 Ma, or 20 million years post sedimentation. This intrusion advected heat from lower in the crust, facilitating pervasive quartz cementation of the detrital grains. The granite also contained some highly siliceous fluids that were driven off as it cooled. These fluids likely {{also contributed to the}} cementation of the sediments. This process of direct heating due to magma transport is known as contact <b>metamorphism.</b>|$|E
