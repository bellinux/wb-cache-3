25|$|As {{early as}} 1918 Ellen was {{thinking}} of selling Preston Manor to Brighton Corporation; years of feuding with her son had left a legacy of bitterness. Charles and Ellen were probably influenced by their friend Henry Roberts, Director of the Royal Pavilion, but they also feared that if John did inherit he would demolish the house or {{turn it into a}} girls' school. In 1925 Charles bought Preston Manor from his wife's trustees and made provision in his will that, subject to the respective life interests of himself and Ellen, Preston Manor and four acres of adjoining land should pass to Brighton Corporation by deed of gift on the condition that it be preserved in its historic condition and be used as a museum with exhibits relevant to Brighton and Sussex. The frontage to Preston Road and Preston Drove was purchased by the Corporation for the sum of £5,000 (although the sale was not completed until after Charles and Ellen died). Also in 1925 Charles and Ellen were given the honorary freedom of Brighton and in 1929 Charles was made a baronet in recognition of his years of public service. Sir Charles and Lady Ellen Thomas-Stanford continued to live at Preston Manor until their deaths in 1932. Charles died in March having willed to the Corporation 'all <b>my</b> <b>books,</b> documents, ancient deeds and papers relating exclusively or primarily to the County of Sussex'. (The rest of his library went to the National Library of Wales). Ellen died in November, bequeathing to the corporation the furniture and contents of the house.|$|E

Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.|$|E

[...] Meyer also steers her work from subjects such as sex, despite the romantic nature of the novels. Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, [...] "I don't think <b>my</b> <b>books</b> are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am.

500|$|When {{dealing with}} the {{dialogue}} in his novels, Wodehouse would consider the book's characters {{as if they were}} actors in a play, ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline, which must be strong: [...] "If they aren't in interesting situations, characters can't be major characters, not even if you have the rest of the troop talk their heads off about them." [...] Many of Wodehouse's parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that [...] "a real character in one of <b>my</b> <b>books</b> sticks out like a sore thumb." [...] The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore [...] "shares with [...] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject".|$|E

500|$|Lord of Scoundrels is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} Regency romance novel, though its story {{is set in the}} post-Regency era of 1828. It features a strong female heroine, a characteristic that Chase has become known for including in her romances. The author explains that [...] "for most of history, and in too many cases today, women are considered (and too often consider themselves) lesser beings who do not matter. In <b>my</b> <b>books,</b> the women are not lesser, and they do matter. In other words, I make the world the way I think it should be". Romantic fiction scholars have identified Jessica Trent as a [...] "feminist heroine" [...] with whom the [...] "alpha male hero" [...] has met his match. Chase inverts many qualities typical of the archetypical romantic hero and heroine. Near the end of the story, Jessica is the one who initiates consummation of their marriage, by seducing Dain. Afterwards, Jessica promptly falls asleep, causing her husband to seethe [...] "that was what he was supposed to do".|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{emphasize}} winning, Tunis {{believed that}} values like {{hard work and}} perseverance could be taught through sports. The 1951football brochure for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Athletic Scholarship committee cites Tunis, saying [...] "The athletic department would like {{to feel that the}} existing program can do for the engineer what John Tunis had in mind when he said, 'The deep objective of games really is to train one’s reflex of purpose to develop a habit of keeping steadily at something you want until it is done. Many of Tunis' biggest heroes find themselves eventually brought low, like Roy Tucker in The Kid Comes Back, whose wartime service injury may have destroyed his career, or Iron Duke Jim Wellington at Harvard, ostracized and lonely, who perseveres by running track. The real victory is in the character's refusal to give up against long odds. [...] "My heroes are the losers" [...] he once said. [...] "All <b>my</b> <b>books</b> have been in that vein. Every book I've ever written." [...] In the Introduction to The Kid from Tomkinsville, Bruce Brooks writes [...] "for Tunis a win was what happened at the ballpark some of the time, usually just before a loss. It didn't make you a good person, [...] than a loss made you a jerk." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholar Paulina Palmer {{asserts that}} Waters, in Tipping the Velvet {{and her two}} {{following}} novels also set in the Victorian era—Affinity and Fingersmith—is establishing a literary tradition that has not existed: [...] "Women engaging in same-sex relationships in the Victorian era were on the whole invisible and we have little knowledge of their literary interests." [...] Waters, however, acknowledges that accuracy about lesbian life in the Victorian era is not her primary goal: [...] "My purpose {{was not to be}} authentic, but to imagine a history that we can’t really recover." [...] Short bursts of lesbian-themed literary activity occurred in 1920s with authors such as Natalie Clifford Barney and Djuna Barnes. Another surge of activity published as lesbian pulp fiction occurred in the 1950s and early 1960s, during which several notable lesbian authors such as Ann Bannon and Valerie Taylor helped to establish lesbian literary identity. These fictions helped to inform readers about the lives and cultural landmarks of lesbians when very little information existed. Waters states that she is not on a deliberate crusade to write about lesbians, but that it is a reflection of what she knows: [...] "Lesbianism {{is at the top of}} the agenda for <b>my</b> <b>books</b> because it's at the top of the agenda for my life. It would be bizarre not to write about it." [...] In 2009, as she reflected on her reasons for writing Tipping the Velvet and Fingersmith, Waters said she was searching for her own identity as a lesbian writer.|$|E

500|$|When Cisneros {{describes}} the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, {{the theme of}} place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, {{but also to the}} positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, {{or in the case of}} their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: [...] "Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. <b>My</b> <b>books</b> and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after." [...] An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for [...] "a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem." [...] She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead [...] "a site of poetic self-creation." [...] One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay [...] "A Room of One's Own", that [...] "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction," [...] or put another way, [...] "economic security" [...] and personal liberty are necessary for [...] "artistic production." ...|$|E
