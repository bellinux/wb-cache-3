40|$|Abstract: <b>Mare</b> <b>milk</b> {{possesses}} similar biophysical and biochemical {{characteristics to}} breast milk. Compared with cow and goat <b>milk,</b> <b>mare</b> <b>milk</b> also has higher lysozyme and lactoferrin, which affect its shelf life. This {{research was conducted}} to study the microbial, chemical and physical quality of fresh <b>mare</b> <b>milk</b> during 24 h storage at the room temperature. Milk sample which was taken from local mares in Yogyakarta stored in a sterile bottle and incubated at room temperature. Total count of bacteria, methylene blue reduction test (MBRT), acidity, pH, free fatty acid (FFA), alcohol test and clot on boiling (COB) test were assessed every 4 h within 24 h incubation. Protein, lactose, fat, ash, total solid contents and density assessment were carried out as complementary data. Although storing <b>mare</b> <b>milk</b> in room temperature for 24 h decreased the pH of milk, it did not affect its acidity and FFA. <b>Mare</b> <b>milk</b> showed positive reaction on alcohol and COB test after 24 h of storage.

N fractions were determined by means of Kjeldahl; fat and lactose by means of mid infrared lectures; mineral elements were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry; P by colorimetry. Data referring to 58 individual milk samples were analyzed by ANCOVA. Significant variations, similar in both breeds, were observed (E vs D) for density at 15 °C (1. 036 vs 1. 034), pH (6. 94 vs 7. 24), titratable acidity (3. 56 vs 1. 70 °SH), fat (1. 17 vs 0. 76 % g/ 100 g of milk), crude protein (2. 31 vs 1. 68 % g/ 100 g), casein number (52. 37 vs 46. 59) and ash (0. 50 vs 0. 30 % g/ 100 g); similarly (mg/ 100 g) for non casein N (172. 31 vs 142. 05), non protein N (34. 43 vs 29. 09), P (61. 30 vs 32. 48), Ca (112. 88 vs 54. 42), Mg (8. 40 vs 4. 38) and K (60. 77 vs 41. 31).

40|$|Background: Cow’s milk allergy is {{a common}} disease of infancy and early childhood. If the baby is not breast-fed, a {{substitute}} for cow’s milk formula is necessary. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate, in vitro and in vivo, the allergenicity of <b>mare’s</b> <b>milk</b> in a population of selected children with severe IgE-mediated cow’s milk allergy. Methods: Twenty-five children (17 male and 8 female) aged 19 to 72 months (median age 34 months) with IgE-mediated cow’s milk allergy were selected for this study. All the children underwent skin prick tests with cow’s <b>milk</b> and <b>mare’s</b> <b>milk</b> and double-blind placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCOFC) with fresh cow’s <b>milk,</b> fresh <b>mare’s</b> <b>milk,</b> and, as placebo, a soy formula (Isomil, Abbott, Campoverde, Italy). We performed immunoblotting of cow’s and <b>mare’s</b> <b>milk</b> developed with IgE from allergic children. Results: All the children showed strong positive skin test responses to cow’s milk (4 +); 2 children had positive skin test responses to <b>mare’s</b> <b>milk</b> (2 +). All children had positive DBPCOFCs to cow’s milk; one child had a positive DBPCOFC to <b>mare’s</b> <b>milk.</b> No children reacted to the placebo (Isomil). In the cow’s milk, some proteins are able to strongly react with human IgE; when the sera are tested with <b>mare’s</b> <b>milk,</b> the bands corresponding to the same proteins are recognized by a lower percentage of sera. Conclusion: These data suggest that <b>mare’s</b> <b>milk</b> can be regarded as a good substitute of cow’s milk in most children with severe IgE-mediated cow’s milk allergy.
