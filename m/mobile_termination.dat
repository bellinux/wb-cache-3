The MMC, following the same general statutory duty required of OFTEL, to promote competition under the Telecommunications Act 1984, provided a radically different analysis and disagreed with most of OFTEL's specific proposals suggesting that some were anti-competitive. As telecommunications regulators are increasingly required to implement pro-competitive regulation, the MMC's reports show that the evolving approach of sectoral regulators contains some significant flaws. <b>Mobile</b> call <b>termination</b> <b>Mobile</b> network operators Regulation Competition...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of human mobility characterizes the trajectories humans follow during their daily activities {{and is the}} foundation of processes from epidemic spreading to traffic prediction and information recommendation. In this paper, we investigate a massive data set of human activity including both online behavior of browsing websites and offline one of visiting towers based <b>mobile</b> <b>terminations.</b> The non-Markovian character observed from both online and offline cases is suggested by the scaling law in the distribution of dwelling time at individual and collective levels, respectively. Furthermore, we argue that the lower entropy and higher predictability in human mobility for both online and offline cases may origin from this non-Markovian character. However, the distributions of individual entropy and predictability show the different degrees of non-Markovian character from online to offline cases. To accounting for non-Markovian character in human mobility, we introduce a protype model with three basic ingredients, preferential return, inertial effect, and exploration to reproduce the dynamic process of online and offline human mobility. In comparison with standard and biased random walk models with assumption of Markov process, the proposed model is able to obtain characters much closer to these empirical observations.

In broad terms, the former service is likely to involve monopoly pricing if left unchecked, while the latter service [...] -if the termination charge is jointly chosen by networks [...] -may provide the mobile sector with the means by which to relax competition. Competition is often relaxed by choosing a low mobile-to-mobile termination charge. If feasible, then, unregulated networks often wish to set different termination charges depending on whether traffic originates on the fixed or mobile network. By contrast, social optimality often requires that uniform termination charges be imposed. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} UK experience, we study {{the problem of}} <b>mobile</b> call <b>termination.</b> This is an {{intriguing}} policy story, in which regulation has been imposed on {{what appears to be}} a competitive industry. We introduce a framework which integrates two existing literatures: one analyzing calls from the fixed network to mobile networks (where the predicted market failure involves the termination charge being set at the monopoly level), and one analyzing calls from one mobile network to another (where the predicted unregulated termination charge lies below the efficient level). Our unified framework allows us to consider the impact of wholesale arbitrage and demand-side substitution. In the absence of very significant market expansion possibilities, we find the unregulated termination charge lies between the efficient and the monopoly benchmarks. There remains a rationale for regulation, albeit reduced relative to the earlier literature. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} how access pricing affects network {{competition}} when subscription demand is elastic and each network uses non-linear prices and can apply termination-based price discrimination. In {{the case of}} a fixed per minute termination charge, we find that a reduction of the termination charge below cost has two oppos- ing effects: it softens competition but helps to internalize network externalities. The former reduces mobile penetration while the latter boosts it. We find that firms al- ways prefer termination charge below cost for either motive while the regulator prefers termination below cost only when this boosts penetration. Next, we consider the retail benchmarking approach (Jeon and Hurkens, 2008) that determines termination charges as a function of retail prices and show that this approach allows the regulator to increase penetration without distorting call volumes. <b>Mobile</b> Penetration; <b>Termination</b> Charge; Access Pricing; Networks; Interconnection; Regulation; Telecommunications;...|$|R

40|$|The {{last three}} years since {{competitive}} entry to the Jamaican telecommunications markets were marked by significant developments as the legal monopoly of Cable and Wireless Jamaica (C&WJ) came to an end. Two new mobile operators entered the industry in 2001 (Digicel and Oceanic Digital) and a fourth licence was recently issued. Consequently, aspects of the retail markets have become somewhat competitive {{in the face of}} the new entrants to the industry. The mobile industry is now characterized by consistent promotional activities on the part of all the players. However, there are still concerns in relation to market power in both the retail and wholesale markets, (particularly with respect to call termination services). National Regulatory Agencies (NRAs), through regulatory intervention, play a pivotal role in these telecommunications markets in terms of facilitating competitive outcomes. However, although the Jamaican retail mobile markets are generally viewed as competitive, survey data indicates there may still be a relatively high degree of market concentration. Further, markets such as <b>mobile</b> call <b>termination</b> are considered to be monopolistic. This is in spite of attempts by the OUR to regulate these markets.

50|$|The {{total cost}} of each call placed by a {{subscriber}} of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) is split in two parts. The first part is the amount that the caller's provider is charging {{in order to provide}} the service to the calling party. The second part is the <b>mobile</b> <b>termination</b> rates (MTRs) that the provider of the call-receiver demands to deliver a call. Concerning the MTRs, in North America and some parts of Asia the Receiving party pays (RPP) instead of the Calling party pays (CPP) principle is applied. In contrast to the CPP principle, in RPP the callee is asked to pay for the termination cost or in some cases to share a part of this cost with the caller. Initially this approach sounds fair, especially in the scope of the callee payment for the call receiving service, while he is mobile and not located in his home network. Furthermore, a subscriber is free to compare termination rates of each MNO and to make his choice before the establishment of a contract with a MNO. Thereby, the <b>mobile</b> <b>termination</b> rates market seems to allow for competition.|$|E
40|$|The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) attempted, in late 1999, to {{introduce}} the calling party pays (CPP) regime for mobile cellular services, with a corresponding revenue-sharing arrangement between fixed and mobile operators. According to the revenue-sharing proposal, mobile operators in India were to be compensated for carrying traffic {{to and from the}} fixed networks. Under their original license conditions, fixed operators (usually one of the two state-owned incumbents) were not paying mobile operators for terminating calls on their networks. However, mobile operators had to compensate the state-owned incumbent for terminating traffic. This unfavourable environment for mobile operators has meant that mobile services {{have not been able to}} reach their full potential in India. There was great disappointment within the mobile industry when the TRAI's CPP order was overturned by the Supreme Court of India in early 2000, due to lack of jurisdiction. Since then, the enabling legislation has been amended. It is hoped that the new provisions of the TRAI Act will empower the regulator to establish a level playing field for mobile network operators.

40|$|Termination of a {{telephone}} call can only be realized by the network operator of the receiving party. For this reason, the markets for fixed and <b>mobile</b> call <b>termination</b> are regulated ex-ante including price control. To determine the costs of call termination the current regulatory regime considers only {{those parts of the}} network where customers compete for jointly used resources (mainly bandwidth). Therefore, the critical border is the "demarcation point" between the end customer dedicated access network and the aggregation network where customers compete for bandwidth. In addition to the extent of the overall network cost to be considered (depending on the location of the demarcation point) the traffic share of the voice termination service (which determines how much of the relevant cost is borne by voice termination) compared to all the other services sharing the same NGN/ NGA network needs to be taken into account. We analyse the cost effects with a cost model, which considers the part of the access network from the MPoP to the demarcation point, where the dedicated (access) network begins, in detail. This allows us to compare the impact of different demarcation points and service scenarios on the level of voice termination rates for three NGA architectures (FTTH/P 2 P, FTTH/PON and FTTC).

50|$|Termination {{rates may}} be commercially {{negotiated}} {{or may be}} regulated. A range of approaches {{can be used to}} regulate rates. International benchmarking or cost models such as a LRIC (Long Run Incremental Cost Model) or LRIC+ cost models are the most common approaches to calculate the efficient levels of termination rates. In LRIC models, the termination costs are calculated for an efficient hypothetical mobile operator. The model assumes that firms use the best technologies to provide mobile calls and services. It is a long run model as it takes into account the growth of demand, which is calculated using data on observed traffic, income and user information. It considers the time period that the service provider needs to invest in capital improvements to provide the <b>mobile</b> call services. <b>Termination</b> rates (TRs) derived from this model therefore calculate capacity costs of each element of the network, expressed in terms of per minute use. Under a pure LRIC model, costs are also calculated for an efficient hypothetical firm. The difference between both models is that while the former calculates TRs through the division of total costs by total demand, pure LRIC methodology calculates TRs by comparing a firm that provides mobile voice access and one that does not, to determine the necessary costs of providing mobile services.|$|R
