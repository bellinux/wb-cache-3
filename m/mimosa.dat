40|$|Polygyny {{is common}} in social insects despite {{inevitable}} decreases in nestmate relatedness and reductions to the inclusive fitness returns for cooperating non-reproductive individuals. We studied the prevalence and mode of polygyny in the African acacia-ant Crematogaster <b>mimosae.</b> These ants compete intensively with neighboring colonies of conspecifics and with three sympatric ant species for resources associated with the whistling-thorn acacias in which they all obligately nest. We used the genotypes of alate males at ten microsatellite loci to reconstruct queen genotypes and found that C. <b>mimosae</b> colonies are frequently secondarily polygynous, in that they include multiple closely related (and sometimes full-sib) queens, and (more rarely) unrelated queens. We also found that individual queens in both monogynous and polygynous colonies had mated with multiple males, making C. <b>mimosae</b> an interesting example of simultaneous polygyny and polyandry. The presence of polygyny in C. <b>mimosae</b> and the intense competition for nest-sites between C. <b>mimosae</b> and its conspecifics support the association between nest-site limitation and polygyny. Polygyny may allow for increased worker populations and a competitive advantage, as inter-colony conflicts are typically won by the colony with the larger number of workers.

5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, <b>Mimosa</b> pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic <b>mimosa.</b> In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E

40|$|The African lycaenid butterfly, Anthene usamba, is an obligate myrmecophile of the acacia ant, Crematogaster <b>mimosae.</b> Female {{butterflies}} use {{the presence}} of C. <b>mimosae</b> as an oviposition cue. The eggs are laid on the foliage and young branches of the host plant, Acacia drepanolobium. Larvae shelter in the swollen thorns (domatia) of the host tree, where they live in close association with the acacia ants, and each larva occupies a domatium singly. Anthene usamba are tended by ants that feed from the dorsal nectary organ at regular intervals. Larvae also possess tentacle organs flanking the dorsal nectary organ and appear to signal to ants by everting these structures. Larvae were observed {{to spend most of}} their time within the domatia. Stable isotope analysis of matched host plant–ant–butterfly samples revealed that Anthene usamba are d 15 N enriched relative to the ants with which they associate. These data, based on the increase in d 15 N through trophic levels, indicate that the caterpillars of these butterflies are aphytophagous and either exploit the ant brood of C. <b>mimosae</b> within the domatia, or are fed mouth to mouth by adult workers via trophallaxis. This is the first documented case of aphytophagy in African Anthene. Pupation occurs inside the domatium and the imago emerges and departs via the hole chewed by the larva. The adult females remain closely associated with their natal patch of trees, whereas males disperse more widely across the acacia savannah. Females prefer to oviposit on trees with the specific host ant, C. <b>mimosae,</b> an aggressive obligate mutualist, and avoid neighbouring trees with other ant species. Adult butterflies are active during mos...|$|R

50|$|Because of {{sunshine}} <b>mimosa's</b> mat forming nature, drought tolerance, and because like many legumes it {{is capable of}} nitrogen fixation and thus doesn't need fertilizer it has become recommended as a replacement for turf grasses for the purposes of xeriscaping and lowering environmental impact. The plant is also recommended as a turfgrass replacement because of its ability to withstand some foot traffic and mowing, It is capable of spreading rapidly and as few as four or five pots may cover 300 square feet in a single growing season. Some may find it problematic that the plant is a host for the larva of little sulphur (Eurema lisa) butterflies.

50|$|Similar mutualisms with ants {{occur on}} Acacia trees in Africa, {{such as the}} {{whistling}} thorn acacia.

40|$|Silk cocoon {{shells and}} degummed fibers from four African wild silkmoth species were studied and {{compared}} with the industrial standard, Bombyx mori, for their dissolution properties. Nine M aqueous Lithium bromide, Calcium chloride and Sodium thiocyanate solution systems were used. Efficiency of the solvent systems {{was determined by the}} percentage of dissolved silk cocoon shells and degummed fibers after three hours of treatment. Degummed fibers were more readily soluble than the cocoon shells. B. mori cocoon shells (51. 5 %) and fibers (59. 3 %) had higher solubility than their wild counterparts. Among the wild species, Gonometa postica cocoon shells and degummed fibers had the highest solubility (37. 3 and 51. 7 %, respectively). Lithium bromide was the most effective dissolving agent for both the cocoon shells and fibers (41. 2 and 84. 5 %, respectively). Argema <b>mimosae,</b> Anaphe panda and Epiphora bauhiniae showed lower solubility across the solution systems used.

60|$|In {{returning}} {{we spent}} two days at Socgo, and I employed them in collecting insects in the forest. The greater number of trees, although so lofty, are not more than three or four feet in circumference. There are, of course, a few of much greater dimension. Senhôr Manuel was then making a canoe 70 feet in length from a solid trunk, which had originally been 110 feet long, and of great thickness. The contrast of palm trees, growing amidst the common branching kinds, never fails to give the scene an intertropical character. Here the woods were ornamented by the Cabbage Palm--one {{of the most beautiful}} of its family. With a stem so narrow that it might be clasped with the two hands, it waves its elegant head at the height of forty or fifty feet above the ground. The woody creepers, themselves covered by other creepers, were of great thickness: some which I measured were two feet in circumference. Many of the older trees presented a very curious appearance from the tresses of a liana hanging from their boughs, and resembling bundles of hay. If the eye was turned from the world of foliage above, to the ground beneath, it was attracted by the extreme elegance of the leaves of the ferns and <b>mimosae.</b> The latter, in some parts, covered the surface with a brushwood only a few inches high. In walking across these thick beds of <b>mimosae,</b> a broad track was marked by the change of shade, produced by the drooping of their sensitive petioles. It is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in these grand scenes; but {{it is not possible to}} give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, astonishment, and devotion, which fill and elevate the mind.|$|R
50|$|The {{symbiotic}} {{relationship between the}} trees and the ants appears to be maintained by the effects of browsing by large herbivores. At a site in Kenya, when large herbivores were experimentally excluded, trees reduced the number of nectar glands and swollen thorns they provided to ants. In response, the usually dominant C. <b>mimosae</b> increased their tending of parasitic sap-sucking insects as a replacement food source. In addition, the number of C. mimosae-occupied trees declined while twice as many become occupied by C. sjostedti, a much less aggressive defender of trees. Because C. sjostedti benefits from the holes created by boring beetle larvae, this species facilitates parasitism of trees by the beetles. As a result, the mutualistic relationship between whistling thorn trees and resident ants breaks down in the absence of large herbivores, and trees become paradoxically less healthy as a result.|$|R
50|$|Argema <b>mimosae</b> (African moon moth) {{is a giant}} {{silk moth}} of the Family Saturniidae. Similar in {{appearance}} to the giant Madagascan moon moth (Argema mittrei), but smaller, this moth can be found widely in Eastern Africa and more locally in Southern Africa, including near {{the east coast of}} South Africa. An adult can measure 10 to 12 cm across its wingspan and 12 to 14 cm from head to the tip of its elongated 'tail-like' second pair of wings. Its forward wings have a distinctive grey-coloured 'furry' leading edge, giving a very rough surface, presumably for aerodynamic reasons. Apart from the eye-like markings on its wings, the colouring and shape of the wings give the appearance of a piece of foliage, especially the 'tail-like' structures of the rearmost wings which resemble a dried out leaf stem - presumably for camouflage in its natural environment.|$|R
