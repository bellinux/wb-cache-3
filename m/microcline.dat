40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for rapidly determining, by {{the technique of}} single-crystal X-ray precession, the phase, twinning and interphase boundary character of alkali feld-spars; the approach is illustrated by representative photo-graphs of specimens of granitic and pegmatitic K-feldspar and albite from Lac du Bonnet, southeastern Manitoba and Dryden, northwestern, Ontario. The possible phases are monoclinic 'orthoclase', <b>microclines</b> of different triclinic-ities, and albite, any phase occurring either alone or predominant, with another in minor amount. Any triclinic phase may be untwinned, albite-twinned, pericline-twinned or both (M-twinned). The boundaries between twinned individuals of one triclinic phase or between K-feldspar and albite phases may be sharp (incoherent) or transitional (coherent).

40|$|Field {{relations}} of several granite types, garboroio and dioritic plutons and ampnibolitic, doleritics and alkaline dykes A camptonitic sill is also described. From {{the study of}} the amphibolitic dykes, two granite generations are differentiated by their relationship to the dykes. These are termed the Ketilidian and Sanerutian Granites. On the basis of xenolths within the granites and petrological observations, it is suggested that the older granites formed in suit while the younger (Sanerutian) granite was intruded as a magma which resulted from the fusion of the Ketilidian Granites. Detailed photographic descriptions are given of all the major rock types. It is suggested that the gaboro-norite rocks are remnants of differentiated basic intrusion, now represented by amphibolites and that the dioritic amphibolties are probably metamorphosed igneous plutons. Modal data on the course-grained rocks using a technique devised during this study is shown to be reliable and results obtained on the granite are discussed. Chemical and X-ray analyses of ten representative <b>microclines</b> separated from the Ketilidian and Sanerutian Granites, are used to show that the method of analysis of alkali feldspar by X – ray techniques (Orville, 1957 and 1960) is as accurate as conventional chemical analysis...|$|R

Samples of granite, aplite, pegmatite, rhyolite, and metamorphic rocks were investigated {{in order to determine the}} precision in Rb-Sr and K-Ar ages between various minerals and different localities. Refined chemical and mass spectro-metric methods are capable of yielding ages on most highly radiogenic minerals to an ana-lytical precision of ± 1 per cent or better. Most of the ages from these rocks show a spread commensurate with the experimental error. The average Rb-Sr age on <b>microclines,</b> muscovites, and biotites is 1020 million years and the average K-Ar age on muscovites, biotites, and hornblendes is 1045 million years (Rb 87, Ap = l- 47 x lO" 11 yr- 1; K«, Ap = 4 - 72 x 10 - 10 yr" 1, and A £ = 0 - 585 x lO" 10 yr" 1).

40|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is one of}} the most fundamental processes in biology. However, there is still a controversy over the importance of selection in microevolution of molecular traits. Despite the general lack of data most authors hold the view that selection on molecular characters may be important, but at lower rates than selection on most phenotypic traits. Here we present evidence that natural selection may contribute substantially to molecular variation on a scale of meters only. In populations of the marine snail Littorina saxatilis living on exposed rocky shores, steep <b>microclines</b> in allele frequencies between splash and surf zone groups are present in the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (allozyme locus Aat; EC. 2. 6. 1. 1). We followed one population over 7 years, including a period of strong natural perturbation. The surf zone part of the population dominated by the allele Aat 100 was suddenly eliminated by a bloom of a toxin-producing microflagellate. Downshore migration of splash zone snails with predominantly Aat 120 alleles resulted in a drastic increase in surf zone frequency of Aat 120, from 0. 4 to 0. 8 over 2 years. Over the next four to six generations, however, the frequency of Aat 120 returned to the original value. We estimated the coefficient of selection of Aat 120 in the surf zone to be about 0. 4. Earlier studies show similar or even sharper Aat clines in other countries. Thus, we conclude that microclinal {{selection is}} an important evolutionary force in this system...|$|R
40|$|The hydrous {{components}} in 85 feldspars from various igneous environments spanning {{the range of}} naturally occurring compositions were examined with infrared spectroscopy. The feldspars contain structural OH (0 – 512 ppm H_ 2 O), H_ 2 O (0 – 1350 ppm H_ 2 O), and NH_ 4 ^+ (0 – 1500 ppm NH_ 4 ^+) {{groups as well as}} fluid inclusions and alteration products. Although composition and structure do influence the type of hydrous species that can be incorporated into a particular feldspar mineral, the concentration of these species is not controlled by major-element composition. Coarse perthitic <b>microclines</b> have a heterogeneous distribution of hydrous species, and contain H_ 2 O or NH_ 4 ^+ in K-rich lamellae and fluid inclusions in Na-rich areas. The structural OH in plagioclase feldspars is not associated with twin boundaries or exsolution lamellae. All of the possible structural hydrous species are found in pegmatite feldspars, whereas volcanic feldspars contain only structural OH. The variation in OH concentration within a given feldspar composition suggests that fluids in the geologic environment play a role in determining the hydrogen concentration of each sample. The vast majority of plutonic feldspars have undergone partial or total equilibration with meteoric fluids during low-temperature (400 – 150 °C) hydrothermal exchange, obliterating any structural hydrogen and creating substantial concentrations of fluid inclusions (up to 4000 ppm H_ 2 O) in the exchanged regions. The amount of water stored as fluid inclusions within feldspars in the upper crust (1 × 10 ^(19) kg) is small compared to the 1. 35 × 10 ^(21) kg of water in the oceans, but is roughly equivalent to the reservoir of water stored in hydrous minerals in the upper crust...|$|R

Among these is the Kazi Nag Granite body, which falls in the Baramulla district of Kashmir and occupies parts of survey of India toposheet Nos. 43 J/ 3 and 43 J/ 4 0 : 50000). The {{eastern part of the}} granite massif lying on the Indian side of the India-Pakistan border has been studied. It is approachable from Chananwari, on the Srinagar-Uri oad, and has for {{the purpose of the present}} study been classified according to the proposals of Streckeisen (1976). Three main types of granite observed in the area are " (a) granodiorites; (b) monzogranites; and (c) syenogranites. The granodiorites are restricted to the outermost part of the granite body. The monzogranites form an intermediate zone between the syenogranites in the centre and the peripheral granodiorites. In thin section the alkali feldspars are seen to be in the form of <b>microclines,</b> microcline-micro-perthites, and microperthites. Seven samples of alkali felspar concentrates (four from marginal granodiorites, two from inter-mediate monzogranites and one from syeno-granites) were chemically analysed by the wet method and the results listed in Table I. The structural formulae based on 32 (0) atoms were computed and it is seen that the formulae fit very well with the standard structural formula for alkali feldspars.

40|$|International audienceStrong thermal {{quenching}} is observed from 77 to 550 K in the far-red luminescence of K-feldspars. This far-red emission, {{next to the}} emission in the UV-to-blue spectrum recorded for thermoluminescence (TL), is reported in most alkaline feldspars with a characteristic peak centered on 710 nm with a width of 100 nm. This emission was observed by cathodoluminescence (CL) at room temperature (RT) for more than 30 K-feldspars, ranging from volcanic sanidines to granitic <b>microclines</b> and sediments and it is attributed to an Fe 3 + impurity. Contrary to ‘blue’ emission in volcanic feldspars, the far-red emission displays very low anomalous fading (AF). This makes it attractive for dating purposes; however, it has weak natural TL intensity, even at saturation, which competes with the black-body emission of the heater plate. This {{is in contrast to}} an intense tunneling afterglow at liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT). Further observations show that the disadvantage of weak TL can be overcome. Photoluminescence (PL) under UV shows a very strong {{thermal quenching}} effect of the far-red emission from 77 to 550 K, which accounts for the above contrast. Near the LNT, the far-red Fe 3 + photoluminescence is at a maximum and is dominant over other emissions in the spectrum. However, as the temperature increases, the efficiency decreases, falling to well below one percent, whereas the ‘blue’ emissions remain stable. This thermal quenching effect in photoluminescence is paralleled in TL. After irradiation and during storage at RT, whereas the ‘blue’ emission in volcanic feldspars is affected by ‘fast’ anomalous fading, charge trapped at Fe 3 + centers as latent far-red emission is almost stable. As the TL evolves and the extant ‘blue’ emission is emitted, {{more and more of the}} trapped charge associated with far-red emission recombines non-radiatively, resulting in an efficiency for emission in natural TL that is less than one percent. A modified band model, which calls for 'hopping' conductivity during the storage, accounts for the anomalous fading. Trap emptying at lower temperatures should lead to better use of the stable latent far-red stored charge for the dating of volcanic deposits...|$|R
40|$|The Levang granite {{forms an}} {{elliptical}} body occupying {{the core of}} a broad antiformal structure, and covering approximately 50 sq. km. Surrounding this mass of granitoid gneisses is a series of banded gneisses of very variable composition, including amphibolites, quartzltes, and nodular sillimanite gneisses. Against these rocks the granitic gneisses make a sharp, though in places 'interfingered' contact. Agmatitl relationships are never seen. Further south, on the PortOr sub-peninsula, migmatitic granitoid gneisses are exposed which have mineral assemblages identical to those of rock types from within the main Levang granite. The composition of the Levang granite gneisses is variable, ranging from quartz monzonltic to tonalitic types lacking potash feldspar, but on the whole corresponds fairly closely with the minimum melting composition of the granite system. Over much the greater area the Levang granite is strongly foliated, and everywhere shows some degree of preferred planar or linear orientation of minerals. The foliation always parallels the contacts, and it defines a complex fold system, within the granite which is in complete structural conformity with that of the surrounding banded gneisses and migmatites. The overall symmetry of the structure is triclinic, the plunge of the linear elements varying from horizontal to vertical. The β axis of the domal structure {{in the eastern part of}} the granite mass is completely overturned. Traced eastwards from the core of the dome, P trends initially due east north east, steepens to vertical, and then plunges due west at angles of 60 to 70. The very complex tectonic evolution has probably involved disharmonic folding and two phases of deformation. Within the Levang granite amphibolitic sheets and lenses are invariably conformable to the fold pattern defined by the granite gneiss foliation. In the Helligesvann brachyanticline, a regular sequence of granitoid gneisses of variable composition, interlayered with a thick amphibolitic sheet which forms an unbroken horizon, indicates the presence of a 'ghost' stratigraphy. Investigation of the potash feldspar obliquities shows that all the potash feldspars, from granitic gneisses, migmatites, and pegmatites, are more or less fully ordered maximum <b>microclines.</b> The fact that some of the granitic gneisses approximate to the minimum melting composition is not conclusive evidence in favour of an origin through anatexis or fractional crystallization, in view of the spatial distribution of these rocks, their metamorphic textures, and the nature of the basic inclusions. The Levang granite is a metamorphic rock, the result of the transformation in an open system of a pre-existing series of supra- crustal rocks by processes of granitization and metasomatism...|$|R

This study {{has resulted in}} the distinction cf two uniu; within the Goose Tickle group: the American Tickle and Mainland formations. The Howe Harbour member has also been newly recognised w ith. tin the American Tickle formation. [...] All three formations are dominated by turbidites, ranging from the deposits of low and moderate concentration flows for the relatively sand-poor American Tickle formation, to high concentration flows for the sand-rich Mainland and Lower Head formations. The American Tickle formation was deposited under anoxic conditions in a foreland basin with at least two different sediment input points. The turbidites and debris flows of the Howe Harbour member were locally shed in front of faults generated by allochthons (Taconic Allochthons) which were advancing over the eastern margin of the basin. The Mainland formation was deposited {{in the southern part of}} the same basin, but in much closer proximity to a third sediment input point, and has complex characteristics related to unusual local topography. The Lower Head Formation exhibits complex facies variations and was deposited in a confining trench slope basin or basins. [...] Although all three units are petrographically similar, the Lower Head Formation is distinct in that it contains a higher feldspar content and a lower lithic fragment content than the Goose Tickle group. Petrographic characteristics are consistent with mixed sources for all units. While many of the sources can be related to lithologies now present in the Taconic Allochthons, there is no lithology in the allochthons which can be related to felsic volcanic grains and rounded <b>microclines.</b> Mixing of detrinis in a now destroyed basin or basins is implied, and the overall provenance suggests supply of sediment from a major and complex area of uplift of which the Taconic Allochthons are only a small and incomplete remnant. This uplifted area included passive margin sediments, possibly Grenville basement and a major arc terrane which may have been compressed prior to erosion. [...] Geochemical analyses also indicate mixed sources and demonstrate that the Lower Head Formation is distinct from the Goose Tickle group. Comparison of the behaviour of trace elements between the units suggests that weathering of source areas may have been more intense during the Llanvirn than the Arenig.
