50|$|Rothschild's {{porcupine}} is {{a medium}} sized porcupine with a head-and-body length of between 332 and 420 mm and a tail length of between 290 and 413 mm. A fully grown adult weighs {{in the region}} of 2 kg. The nose is pink and large, and the eyes are small. The body is spiny all over, the evenly spaced spines being dark with yellowish tips in the animal's mid section. The tail tapers from a broad base and is prehensile. This porcupine could be confused with the <b>Mexican</b> <b>hairy</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Sphiggurus mexicanus), but that species has long black hair which largely conceals the spines while Rothschild's is more obviously spiny.|$|E

500|$|While rodents are not {{the most}} seriously {{threatened}} order of mammals, there are 168 species in 126 genera that are said to warrant conservation attention {{in the face of}} limited appreciation by the public. Since 76 percent of rodent genera contain only one species, much phylogenetic diversity could be lost with a comparatively small number of extinctions. In the absence of more detailed knowledge of species at risk and accurate taxonomy, conservation must be based mainly on higher taxa (such as families rather than species) and geographical hot spots. Several species of rice rat have become extinct since the 19th century, probably through habitat loss and the introduction of alien species. In Colombia, the brown <b>hairy</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>porcupine</b> was recorded from only two mountain localities in the 1920s, while the red crested soft-furred spiny rat is known only from its type locality on the Caribbean coast, so these species are considered vulnerable.

40|$|The orange-spined <b>hairy</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Sphiggurus villosus) is a rodent species {{common in}} most parts of South America, and {{little is known about the}} pathologies that can afflict it. A {{specimen}} was delivered at the Wildlife Research and Medical Center (CEMPAS), School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil. The animal showed intense apathy, with purulent secretion in the nasal cavity and fracture of the lumbar spine. Due to the unfavorable prognosis, the porcupine was euthanized and microbiological culture of nasal discharge showed Staphylococcus epidermidis. The antimicrobial resistance test revealed sensitivity to all tested antimicrobials (ampicillin, oxacillin, tetracycline, penicillin G, neomycin, cephalexin, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazol, cefoxitin and cephalothin). This bacterium is part of the nasal flora of humans and other animals, and may cause infection under certain conditions. In the present study, the infection and colonization by S. epidermidis was the probable cause of the inflammatory process. The sensitivity to all tested antimicrobials suggests that this strain has not been previously exposed to such drugs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Road-killed {{wild animals}} host {{zoonotic}} pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii, offering a new {{opportunity for the}} epidemiological study of these infectious organisms. METHODS This investigation aimed to determine the presence of T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites in tissue samples of 64 road-killed wild animals, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Positive samples were then typed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using 7 markers: SAG 1, 5 &# 8242;- 3 &# 8242;SAG 2, SAG 3, BTUB, c 29 - 6, PK 1, and Apico. PCR-RFLP targeting 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes was also performed on all samples to detect other apicomplexan parasites. RESULTS T. gondii DNA was detected in 16 tissue samples from 8 individual animals, as follows: 1 Cerdocyon thous (crab-eating fox), 1 Didelphis albiventris (white-eared opossum), 1 Lutreolina crassicaudata (lutrine opossum), 2 Myrmecophaga tridactyla (giant anteater), 1 Procyon cancrivorus (crab-eating raccoon), and 2 Sphiggurus spinosus (Paraguay <b>hairy</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>porcupine).</b> Seven different T. gondii genotypes were identified, 6 of which were novel. Typing by 18 S rRNA verified these 16 T. gondii-infected samples, and identified 1 Sarcocystis spp. -infected animal [Dasypus novemcinctus (nine-banded armadillo) ]. The amplified T. gondii (GenBank accession No. L 37415. 1) and Sarcocystis spp. 18 S rRNA products were confirmed by sequencing. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that T. gondii is commonly present in wild mammals, which act as sources of infection for humans and animals, including other wild species. The approach employed herein proved useful for detecting T. gondii and Sarcocystis spp. in the environment and identifying their natural reservoirs, contributing {{to our understanding of}} host-parasite interactions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ticks {{are known}} {{worldwide}} for parasitizing {{a number of}} wild hosts. However, {{few studies have been}} conducted on ticks in zoos in Brazil. The objective {{of the present study was}} to collect, identify, and report the parasitic tick fauna found on wild Amazon animals received and attended at the Santarém Zoological Park from September 2004 to September 2013. In all, 56 animals, including 26 mammals and 30 reptiles, were sampled, from which 1172 ticks were collected and identified, comprising 862 adults, 284 nymphs, and 26 larvae. Nymphs of Amblyomma geayi on three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridactylus), adults of Amblyomma longirostre on black <b>dwarf</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Coendou nycthemera), and nymphs of Amblyomma naponense on southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla) were identified for the first time in the country in the present study.

To explain the evolving nature of alien sightings, Nickell told the Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast team, I did an alien timeline, and did sort of Walt Disney-esque cartoon drawings of the different types of aliens, starting in 1947 with some little green men, and showing the sort of imaginative variety of alien types over the years, of <b>hairy</b> <b>dwarves,</b> and cyclopean figures, and robotic forms and blobs and just all manner. Just as people would imagine; if I asked someone to imagine an alien creature, it would be all over the place. But then, with the Betty and Barney Hill case, you began to get the little big-eyed, big-headed humanoid, and that type came back and back until now, if you go into a toy store and you look at aliens, you see pretty much that's the standard model. Very unlikely that if life developed on some distant planet, that it would look so much like us. We tend to make the various entities that we're interested in in our own image. And so Bigfoot is our big, stupid cousin from the past, and ET is our futuristic relative coming from the future back to save us. These are forms of us. Of course, ghosts are transparent forms of us; angels are us with wings, and of course, vampires are us with an attitude.|$|R
50|$|In the Blue Mountains {{at about}} 1050 m altitude, P. brownii grows in an upland prairie on basalt-substrate close to conifer stands. In {{addition}} {{to a variety of}} grasses, the surrounding vegetation includes western monkshood, Hooker's and arrowleaf balsamroot, redstem ceanothus, pinkfairies, <b>hairy</b> clematis, <b>dwarf</b> larkspur, parsnipflower buckwheat, fernleaf and nineleaf biscuitroot, sulphur lupine, beardtongues species, virgate scorpion-weed, sticky and slender cinquefoil, sagebrush buttercup, dwarf and Nootka rose, common snowberry, American vetch and northern mule's ears. Brown's peony avoids drought by dying down completely in early summer, after flowering and surviving underground with stores of nutrients and energy in its thick rootstock. When parts of the plant are broken, bruised or damaged by predation it produces a pronounced bitter and unpleasant scent. Plants are rarely eaten, but caterpillars of the species Euxoa ustula, dark grey fishia and small heliothodes moth have been found to eat 1-2 mm holes in the flowers, although these species are better known from other host plants. Flowers give off the same smell more weakly and the lobes of the disc secrete a sweet nectar with a bitter aftertaste over the entire time the stigmas and anthers are fertile.|$|R
