40|$|The Pc 5 micropulsation {{power at}} <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay,</b> the AE index and the {{relativistic}} (energy > 2 MeV) electron count rates from GOES 6 geosynchronous satellite have been compared through correlation and coherence methods. The periods considered are the months January and August 1986. Dependencies of {{results on the}} magnetic local time at <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay</b> and on the Kp index are shown. The best correlation and average coherence are found between Pc 5 power and AE, especially around local magnetic midnight. A quite good correlation between the Pc 5 power and the electron rates is observed under the cusp location in August, when the cusp is closer than in January to <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay</b> latitude. In addition, the correlation Pc 5 power vs. electron rates sharply maximizes during the geomagnetic quietest periods (Kp ? 1), both in January and August 1986. Differently, the correlation between AE and the relativistic electron rates is better for 3 < Kp ? 4...|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, a plan by the Government of Canada to resettle the Inuit {{people at}} several high Arctic {{locations}} was scrapped. These settlements would have included Isachsen, Alert, Eureka, and <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Given {{its high}} latitude, <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay</b> has the coldest weather {{station in the}} Northwest Territories. On March 4th, 2017, the {{temperature}} dropped down to -54.7 C -- the coldest March temperature ever recorded in Canada.|$|R
5000|$|Increasing {{interest}} {{in studies of}} phenomena such as Arctic haze led to a conference in 1977 in Lillestrøm, Norway with participation from scientists of seven different countries. Following this conference, the Arctic Air-Sampling Network (AASN) was created to share data between scientific organizations in each member nation. [...] To fulfill Canadian obligations to this program, the Canadian Arctic Aerosol Sampling Network (CAASN) was created, eventually consisting of three stations: <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay</b> (April 1979), Igloolik (November 1979), and Alert (July 1980). [...] In 1984, the program was condensed and refocused. The sampling programs in Igloolik and <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay</b> were discontinued, and the program in Alert {{became part of the}} core mandate of the newly reformed Canadian Arctic Aerosol Chemistry Program (CAACP).|$|R

It is located in the town of Ferrisburgh (near Vergennes), in Addison County. It is situated between the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains in New York.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s, Isachsen Station was {{primarily}} collecting radiosonde observations. Along with weather soundings from similar stations such as <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay,</b> Eureka, and Alert, {{this information was}} used to complete the North American data, primarily used to produce weather forecasts over the North Atlantic Ocean, Greenland, and Iceland, and long-range weather forecasts for Western Europe.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mould</b> <b>Bay</b> Airport [...] {{was located}} on the Prince Patrick Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. It was built in 1948 as a joint effort between Canada and the United States to service the former Environment Canada weather station. The station was {{automated}} in 1997 which eliminated {{the need for an}} airport; however, the island is still occasionally visited by members of the Canadian Forces.|$|R
50|$|The airport {{has served}} as a major {{transportation}} hub in the Arctic. Today the airport is an important refuelling stop for aircraft passing through to other places in the high Arctic such as CFS Alert, Eureka and <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay.</b> Unlike some airports in Nunavut, Resolute is equipped with an ILS precision landing system, allowing for large commercial aircraft operations. The VOR/DME is located atop a hill near the airport. The airport is not equipped with radar, however during 2011's Operation Nanook, a temporary radar installation was used for the duration of that exercise.|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that Arctic sea ice and its {{environment}} undergo a number of changes during the summer period. Some of these changes affect the ice cover properties and, in turn, their response to thermal and mechanical forcing throughout the year. The main objective of this investigation {{is related to the}} development of a method for estimating the areal coverage of exposed ice, melt ponds, and leads, which are the basic surface variables determining the local surface albedo. The study is based on data obtained in a field investigation conducted from <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay</b> (NWT), Nimbus 5 satellite data, and Seasat data. The investigation demonstrates that microwave data from satellites, especially microwave brightness temperature, provide good data for estimating important characteristics of summer sea ice cover...|$|R
40|$|During the 1980 s {{extensive}} offshore geophysical surveys yielded over 100, 000 measured ice thicknesses in {{one area}} of the Arctic Archipelago. The date and location of these measurements are known and can be compared with ice regime information on Canadian Ice Service ice charts from the same time period. Air temperature data are available from Arctic Weather Stations at <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay</b> and Isachsen, from which ice strength can be calculated. It has been demonstrated that ice cover strength decreases {{by a factor of}} 10 from mid-winter to just before break-up. A methodology has been proposed for using all the aforementioned data to make adjustments to the strength factor p* in the CIS Ice Forecast Model for application in aiding ice forecasting in the Canadian Arctic Archilelago.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{measurements}} of the active microwave properties of sea ice under fall growing conditions was conducted. Ice in the inland waters of <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay,</b> Crozier Channel, and intrepid inlet and ice in the Arctic Ocean near Hardinge Bay was investigated. Active microwave data were acquired using a helicopter borne scatterometer. Results show that multiyear ice frozen in grey or first year ice is easily detected under cold fall conditions. Multiyear ice returns were dynamic due to response to two of its scene constituents. Floe boundaries between thick and thin ice are well defined. Multiyear pressure ridge returns are similar in level to background ice returns. Backscatter from homogeneous first year ice is seen to be primarily due to surface scattering. Operation at 9. 6 GHz is {{more sensitive to the}} detailed changes in scene roughness, while operation at 5. 6 GHz seems to track roughness changes less ably...|$|R
40|$|The {{scattering}} {{properties of}} second-year ice were studied {{in an experiment}} at <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay</b> in April 1983. Radar backscattering measurements were made at frequencies of 5. 2, 9. 6, 13. 6, and 16. 6 GHz for vertical polarization, horizontal polarization and cross polarizations, with incidence angles ranging from 15 to 70 deg. The {{results indicate that the}} second-year ice scattering characteristics were different from first-year ice and also different from multiyear ice. The fading properties of radar signals were studied and compared with experimental data. The influence of snow cover on sea ice can be evaluated by accounting for {{the increase in the number}} of independent samples from snow volume with respect to that for bare ice surface. A technique for calculating the snow depth was established by this principle and a reasonable agreement has been observed. It appears that this is a usable way to measure depth in snow or other snow-like media using radar...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} measure the radar {{scattering}} coefficient of ice with a helicopter or surface spectrometer was extended into the 4 - 8 GHz spectral region. The scattering coefficient was measured at <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay,</b> N. W. T., over a frequency range from 4 to 18 GHz for both summer and fall conditions. Scatter from fresh water ice in the St. Lawrence River and from numerous seasonal sea-ice types {{along the coast of}} Newfoundland were also measured. The C-band (near 5 GHz) scattering cross section for different types of ice shows poorer contrast than the scattering coefficient at higher frequencies, but better contrast than the negligible value found at L-band (1. 5 GHz). At frequencies above 4 GHz the contrast in scattering coefficient between the different ice types is much less in summer than in other seasons; at most times of year the scattering is much stronger from multiyear than from other ice types, but in early summer it is actually slightly weaker than that from first year ice...|$|R
40|$|Location {{and climate}} factors {{governing}} morphological features of ice wedge polygons in arctic zone Abstract This thesis reports {{the geometry of}} active soil and ice-wedge polygonal network located along the Canadian Arctic and in Alaska. This High Arctic periglacial environment was chosen to ensure active thermal-contraction cracking of permafrost in Holocene allowing comparison of observed ice-wedge polygons with existing climatic data. Geoinformatic software (Google Earth, ArcGIS) was used to obtain and digitalize satellite images of polygonal networks located around Eureka, <b>Mould</b> <b>Bay,</b> Churchill, Rankin Inlet, Inuvik, and Kotzebue. Defined polygonal networks were statistically analyzed in order to define predominant environmental factors controlling morphological parameters of these polygonal networks. Polygon size (overall influence computed {{on the basis of}} coefficient of determination) is determined mostly by the duration of development (18 %), frequency of cyclonic passage (17. 8 %) and winter air temperature (16. 1 %). Conversely, polygon regularity results mainly from nature of the substrate (21. 8 %), winter wind speed (15. 1 %) and snow cover thickness (12. 2 %). Dominant polygon elongation in the polygonal network follows closely the winter wind direction (3 / 4 of all networks) as the result of snow [...] ...|$|R

6000|$|SATURDAY. - This {{has been}} a charming day for me from morning to now (5 P.M.). First, I found your letter, and went down and read it on a seat in those Public Gardens of which you have heard already. [...] After lunch, my father and I {{went down to the}} coast and walked a little way along the shore between Granton and Cramond. This has always been with me a very {{favourite}} walk. The Firth closes gradually together before you, the coast runs in a series of the most beautifully <b>moulded</b> <b>bays,</b> hill after hill, wooded and softly outlined, trends away in front till the two shores join together. [...] When the tide is out there are great, gleaming flats of wet sand, over which the gulls go flying and crying; and every cape runs down into them with its little spit of wall and trees. We lay together a long time on the beach; the sea just babbled among the stones; and at one time we heard the hollow, sturdy beat of the paddles of an unseen steamer somewhere round the cape. I am glad to say that the peace of the day and scenery was not marred by any unpleasantness between us two.|$|R

The next state is an open belfry, with eight columns rising to support a bell-shaped steeple, with spire and weathervane.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, the Palestinian {{historian}} Walid Khalidi {{described the}} village: [...] "Only three houses remain; two are deserted {{and one has}} been turned into a warehouse. One of the deserted houses is a two-storey stone structure that has a large, triple-arched front porch." [...] Petersen, who inspected the place in 1994, noted [...] "a large two-storey building with a vaulted arcade on the northern side. The upper part of the building is today used as a house whilst the lower part appears to be abandoned (although it remains locked). The arcade consists of three cross-vaulted bays resting on two free-standing piers and two engaged piers at either end. On the outer (north) face of each of the two central piers there is a stone carved with two rosettes which appears to be part of a classical entablature.

50|$|The Wichita City Carnegie Library Building {{located at}} 220 S. Main Street in Wichita, Kansas, Sedgwick County, Kansas, United States, is a Carnegie library built in 1915. It was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The two-story, {{limestone}} Beaux Arts building stands in the southwestern part of Wichita's central business district, directly south of the old City Hall. Its façade orientation is west. The building measures approximately one hundred and twenty-eight feet {{from north to south}} and eighty-three feet from east to west. After the completion of Wichita's present library in 1966, the Wichita City Carnegie Library Building served as city offices and the municipal court until the Wichita Omnisphere and Science Center established its tenancy in 1976, followed by changing tenants.The two-story, ashlar cut, limestone block building sits on an ashlar cut, limestone block, raised foundation with a multiply <b>moulded</b> watertable. Three <b>bays</b> comprise the rectangular building's façade and rear. The building's main body is one bay deep, a one-bay-by-one-bay brick unit extends from the rear elevation's center bay. A parapetted entry pavilion projects from the facade's center bay. A short, square tower rises from the building's central bay, covered by a rounded, truncated hipped roof sheathed with pantiles and surmounted by a monitor roof. Tripartite windows with translucent glass pierce each wall of the central tower. Standing seam metal covers the gable roofs of the two main wings, the metal may have been tarred. Two skylights, which have been covered due to water leakage, pierce the gable roofs midway. The entry pavilion and the rear extension have low roofs hidden by parapets, they are likely covered with tar and gravel. The building retains its original metal drain pipes on the outer edges of the façade and the rear extension.|$|R
