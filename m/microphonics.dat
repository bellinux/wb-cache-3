25|$|Vacuum tubes {{may have}} or develop defects in {{operation}} that make an individual tube unsuitable {{in a given}} device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application. <b>Microphonics</b> refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way; sound or vibration pick-up may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a feedback path develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from {{the ends of the}} heater may also inject hum into the signal. Leakage current due to internal contamination may also inject noise. Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small-signal audio use, although unobjectionable for many purposes. Selecting the best of a batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications can produce better results.|$|E

40|$|Present {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} quantify the alternating current (AC) component of the semicircular canal <b>microphonic</b> for angular motion stimulation {{as a function of}} stimulus frequency and amplitude. The oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, was used as the experimental model. Calibrated mechanical indentation of the horizontal canal duct was used as a stimulus to generate hair-cell and afferent responses reproducing those present during head rotation. Sensitivity to polarization of the endolymph DC voltage re: perilymph was also investigated. Modulation of endolymph voltage was recorded using conventional glass electrodes and lock-in amplification over the frequency range 0. 2 - 80 Hz. Access to the endolymph for inserting voltage recording and current passing electrodes was obtained by sectioning the anterior canal at its apex and isolating the cut ends in air. For sinusoidal stimulation below approx. 10 Hz, the horizontal semicircular canal AC <b>microphonic</b> was nearly independent of stimulus frequency and equal to approximately 4 microV per micron indent (equivalent to approx. 1 microV per deg/s). A saturating nonlinearity decreasing the <b>microphonic</b> gain was present for stimuli exceeding approx. 3 micron indent (approx. 12 deg/s angular velocity). The phase was not sensitive to the saturating nonlinearity. The <b>microphonic</b> exhibited a resonance near 30 Hz consistent with basolateral current hair cell resonance observed previously in voltage-clamp records from semicircular canal hair cells.

25|$|Capacitors, {{especially}} ceramic capacitors, {{and older}} designs such as paper capacitors, can absorb sound waves {{resulting in a}} <b>microphonic</b> effect.

The auditory nerve compound action potential evoked by an acoustic probe was forward-masked by a train of charge-balanced biphasic current pulses.

Both pulse rate and pulse width influenced the degree of masking. The vibration of a region of the basilar membrane was estimated by recording the local cochlear <b>microphonic</b> evoked by biphasic pulses. The amplitude of the cochlear <b>microphonic</b> was proportional to the amplitude of the spectral component of the electrical stimulus to which the local cochlear <b>microphonic</b> was tuned.
