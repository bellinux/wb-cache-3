40|$|International audienceIn {{vineyard}} management, {{the block}} is today considered as the technical work unit. However, considerable variability can exist inside a block {{with regard to}} physiological parameters, such as vigour, particularly because of soil heterogeneity. To represent this variability spatially, many measurements must be taken. That is costly in both time and <b>money.</b> High <b>resolution</b> remote sensing {{appears to be an}} efficient tool for mapping intra-block heterogeneity. A vegetation index, the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), calculated with red and near infrared leaf reflectance {{can be used as a}} vine vigour indicator. Because of the cultivation of vines in rows, a specific image treatment is needed. Only high resolution remote sensing (pixels less than 20 cm per side) allows the discrimination between row pixels and inter-row ones. The significant correlation between NDVI and pruning weight demonstrates the possibility to map the vigour with the NDVI by means of high resolution remote sensing, and consequently to explain the variations of linked quality factors...|$|R
2500|$|Many UDC leaders felt {{fundraising}} {{should continue}} since the Little Rock convention of 1910 had implicitly promised to pay Ezekiel more <b>money.</b> The <b>resolution</b> which enlarged the memorial {{and increased the}} amount of money budgeted for it read: [...] "...that the monument in Washington shall cost not less than $50,000, with the hopes of $75,000, and that a contract be made to this effect...". Although Ezekiel declined to press the issue, UDC leaders felt morally bound to try to pay him the additional $25,000 ($ in [...] dollars). In November 1914, with nearly all the costs of the memorial, its erection, and dedication paid, there remained a memorial fund balance of $1,770.92 ($ in [...] dollars). This money was paid to Ezekiel. At the Savannah convention of 1914, the delegates agreed to pay Ezekiel a total of $8,229 ($ in [...] dollars) above the $40,000 already sent to him. Savannah convention raised just $1,503.75 toward this sum, and the UDC general treasury donated another $1,000 from its treasury. Moses Ezekiel died in March 1917, and it is unclear whether the UDC ever paid the outstanding $3,955.25 ($ in [...] dollars).|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the recent financial crisis, European policymakers put banking regulation in the Eurozone {{on top of the}} agenda. In 2016, as part of the newly created European banking union, a mechanism for resolving troubled banks, the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), became fully operational for the 19 member states of the euro area. The SRM was established to avoid future involvement of tax payers' <b>money</b> in the <b>resolution</b> of banks. This paper focuses on the negotiations on one of its instruments, the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), a fund of ex-ante contributions of Eurozone banks set up to winding down unviable banks. The SRF proved to be a main conflict issue during the negotiations. Germany and France were pushing for diverging preferences although both countries' banking sectors suffered from the crisis and both governments generally favored a regulatory approach on the European level. I provide an institutionalist explanation for these opposing positions of the two most important Eurozone countries. By drawing on the "Varieties of Capitalism" literature, I explain how the distinct features of these countries' financial and banking systems accounted for their preferences. On the one side, German negotiators sought to preserve the dominant way of bank-based corporate finance by particularly protecting savings and cooperative banks. On the other, the French government was in favor of higher contributions by the banking sector because market-based corporate finance is more prevalent in France. Nevertheless, France aimed at keeping its 'national champions' out as far as possible. This paper has important implications for how to think about preference formation in European financial regulation...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} heated debates in {{bankruptcy}} law scholarship has been the optimal design of corporate bankruptcy law. While traditionalist scholars defended {{the actual practice of}} Chapter 11 of the Bakruptcy Code, the law-and-economics movement has by and large heavily crticized Chapter 11 and called for its replacement. Several models of corporate bankruptcy have been offered in the literature as imporved alternatives thereto. In this article, I examine the various models offered in the literature, as well as the basic model of Chapter 11, against a certain realistic background: that of an economy characterized by the concentrated dominance of a few banks. Concentrated banking has been a subject of economic research in recent years. However, what has been lacking is a clear analysis of the ramifications of concentrated banking on corporate bankruptcy. This paper fills this gap by presenting such an analysis. In the paper, I show the anticompetitive measures which the banks, as senior lenders of the corporate debtor on one hand and the financers of any cash-driven resolution of bankruptcy on the other hand, might impose. Such measures cast doubt whether the various bankruptcy substitute models previously porposed, all of which rely on the use of cash <b>money</b> in the <b>resolution</b> of the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s financial distress, are applicable to concnetrated banking markets. As a result, this paper calls for implementing a market-based bankruptcy regime which allows the acquisition of the debtor firm through the use of non-cash payment instruments. The article shows how such a regime would encourage a healthy competition over the control of the corportae debtor and enhance the return to its prebankruptcy creditors...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic {{study of the}} pursuit of kametsa asaiki (‘the good life’) in an Ashaninka village by the Bajo Urubamba River (Peruvian Amazonia). My study centres on Ashaninka social {{organization}} in a context made difficult by {{the wake of the}} Peruvian Internal War, the activities of extractive industries, and a series of despotic decrees that have been passed by the Peruvian government. This is all framed by a change in their social organization from living in small, separated family-based settlements to one of living in villages. This shift presents them with great problems when internal conflicts arise. Whilst in the past settlements would have fissioned in order to avoid conflict, today there are two related groups of reasons that lead them to want to live in centralised communities. The first is their great desire for their children to go to school and the importance they place on long-term cash-crops. The second is the encroachment of the Peruvian State and private companies on their territory and lives which forces them to stay together in order to resist and protect their territory and way of life. I suggest that this change in organisation changes {{the rules of the game}} of sociality. Contemporary Ashaninka life is centred on the pursuit of kametsa asaiki, a philosophy of life they believe to have inherited from their ancestors that teaches emotional restraint and the sharing of food in order to create the right type of Ashaninka person. Yet, at present it also has new factors they believe allow them to become ‘civilised’: school education, new forms of leadership and conflict <b>resolution,</b> <b>money,</b> new forms of conflict resolution, intercultural health, and a strong political federation to defend their right to pursue kametsa asaiki. My thesis is an anthropological analysis of the 'audacious innovations' they have developed to retake the pursuit of kametsa asaiki in the aftermath of the war. I show that this ethos of living is not solely a communal project of conviviality but it has become a symbol of resistance in their fight for the right to have rights in Peru...|$|R
