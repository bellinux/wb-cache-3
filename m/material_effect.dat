25|$|The {{decision}} in Korematsu v. United States has been controversial. Korematsu's conviction for evading internment was overturned on November 10, 1983, after Korematsu challenged the earlier decision by filing for a writ of coram nobis. In a ruling by Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted the writ (thus voiding Korematsu's original conviction) because in Korematsu's original case, {{the government had}} knowingly submitted false information to the Supreme Court that had a <b>material</b> <b>effect</b> on the Supreme Court's decision.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel interactive mesh deformation method that can achieve various dynamic <b>material</b> <b>effects,</b> including elastic membrane and cloth effects. In our framework, a mesh is encoded by some differential quantities based on edge length and dihedral angle; and the deformation is formulated as a least square problem for preserving the edge length and dihedral angle via the differential quantities. In {{order to obtain}} anisotropic <b>material</b> <b>effects,</b> we further propose an edge weighting scheme based on a user specified vector field. To avoid specifying the local transformations, we set up an iterative scheme for solving the deformation. At last, several examples are presented to show that our approach can interactively generate visually pleasing deformations...|$|R

However, the cash-poor Creation Records {{was unable to}} pay the bill for their time at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band's equipment. Dutt recalled, [...] "I don't know what excuse Kevin gave them for leaving. He had to raise the money himself to get the gear out." [...] Shields' unexpected and random behaviour, the constant delays, and studio changes were having a <b>material</b> <b>effect</b> both on Creation's finances and the health of their staff. Dutt later admitted being desperate to leave the project, while Creation's second-in-command Dick Green had a nervous breakdown around this time. Green later recalled, [...] "It was two years into the album, and I phoned Shields up in tears. I was going 'You have to deliver me this record'." [...] During this time, both Shields and Butcher became affected with tinnitus, and had to delay recording for a further number of weeks while they recovered. Concerned friends and band members suggested this was a result of the unusually loud volumes the group played at their shows. Shields dismissed these concerns as [...] "Ill-informed hysteria." [...] Although Alan McGee was still upbeat and positive about his investment, the 29-year-old Green, who by this time was opening the label's morning post [...] "shaking with fear," [...] became a concern to his co-workers. Publicist Laurence Verfaillie, aware of the label's inability to cover further studio bills, recalled Green's hair turning grey overnight. [...] "He would have not gone grey if it was not for that album," [...] Verfaillie said.|$|E

However, the judge pointed out that [...] "the charges against Irving that have been proved to be true are of sufficient gravity" [...] that those two claims mentioned above would [...] "not have any <b>material</b> <b>effect</b> on Irving's reputation."

They were still married when he died in February 2012. Pacheco was omitted from Jones' will, which he made before their marriage.

Now that political events in Germany have restored to the concepts of human dignity and liberty their original significance, this is the opera which, {{thanks to the music}} of Beethoven, gives us comfort and courage.... Certainly, Fidelio is not an opera in the sense we are used to, nor is Beethoven a musician for the theater, or a dramaturgist. He is quite a bit more, a whole musician, and beyond that, a saint and a visionary. That which disturbs us is not a <b>material</b> <b>effect,</b> nor the fact of the 'imprisonment'; any film could create the same effect. No, it is the music, it is Beethoven himself. It is this 'nostalgia of liberty' he feels, or better, makes us feel; this is what moves us to tears. His Fidelio has more of the Mass than of the Opera to it; the sentiments it expresses come from the sphere of the sacred, and preach a 'religion of humanity' which we never found so beautiful or necessary as we do today, after all we have lived through. Herein lies the singular power of this unique opera.... Independent of any historical consideration ... the flaming message of Fidelio touches deeply.|$|E

January 1916 brought a further thirteen claims, most of them against the French and there were twenty more in February, the last month of the [...] "scourge" [...] proper. Most of the victories had been scored by aces rather than the newer pilots flying the increased number of Fokkers. Allied casualties were light by later standards but the loss of air superiority to the Germans, flying a new and supposedly invincible aircraft, caused dismay among the Allied commanders and lowered the morale of Allied airmen.

Grieve detailed the letters as containing [...] "...remarks about public affairs which would in my view, if revealed, have had a <b>material</b> <b>effect</b> upon the willingness of the government to engage in correspondence with the Prince of Wales, and would potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality....my decision is based on my view that the correspondence was undertaken as part of the Prince of Wales's preparation for becoming king. The Prince of Wales engaged in this correspondence with ministers with the expectation that it would be confidential. Disclosure of the correspondence could damage the Prince of Wales's ability to perform his duties when he becomes king." [...] Grieve concluded his justification of his veto by stating that [...] "It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the monarch is a politically neutral figure able to engage in confidence with the government of the day, whatever its political colour." [...] Grieve also said that any perception that Charles had disagreed with Blair's government [...] "would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch because, if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king".
