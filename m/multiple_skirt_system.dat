Ray Wheeler, BHC's chief engineer, was reportedly very pleased with the progress made during the initial trials. At the same time, 001 required substantial refinement and alteration in order to be reworked into a commercially viable craft.

The objective {{was to examine the}} ice breaking capability of the two designs to better understand the ice breaking mechanism and to develop scaling laws for the presnetation of air cushion icebreaking data. Data available from field and other model tests were also compated with the IMD data. In the tests, each ACIB was attached to a towing carriage. Air flow into the cushion was suppplied by a Vortex Blower. EG/AD/S ice sheets, with thicknesses in the range 30 mm to 50 mm, were used to model the ice covers. For some tests, the ice sheet was presawn to investigate the significance of the breaking component of resistance. Tow load, cushion pressure, cushion flow and carriage speed were recorded.

40|$|Ever-increasing {{demand for}} {{reduction}} of the undesirable emissions from the internal combustion engines propels broader effort in auto industry to design more fuel efficient engines. One of the major focuses is the reduction of engine mechanical losses, to which the friction of the piston skirt is one important contributor. Yet there lacks a sufficient understanding of the skirt lubrication behavior to effectively optimize the piston <b>skirt</b> <b>system</b> in practice. The ultimate goal of this work {{is to develop a}} comprehensive model to advance the predictability of the skirt friction while integrating all the dynamic behavior of the piston secondary motion and the structural deformation of the piston skirt and cylinder liner. Major contributions of this work are analysis of and development of a model for the oil transport and exchange of the piston skirt region and its surroundings. The new oil transport model is composed with two elements. First, the oil scraped into the chamfer region by the oil control ring during a down-stroke is tracked and its accumulation and release to the skirt region are modeled. Second, oil separation and re-attachment are allowed in the skirt region, breaking conventional full-attachment assumption in lubrication studies. The new oil transport model together with hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication model were coupled with piston secondary motion and structural deformation of the piston skirt and cylinder liner. For numerical efficiency and physics clarity, we used different discretization for the lubrication from the structural deformation. The final model is robust and efficient. The discussion of the model results is focused mainly on the oil transport. There exist a general pattern in available oil for skirt lubrication, namely, skirt tends to be starved when it travels at the upper portion of a stroke. Comparison with visualization experiment for oil accumulation patterns show consistency between model prediction and observation. This work represents a major step forward to realistically predicting skirt friction and the influence of all the relevant design and operational parameters. However, oil supply to the region below the piston skirt can largely influence the outcome of the friction prediction and its mechanism is system dependent. Additionally, simple treatment of the oil transport in the current model is merely a first step to modeling the complex fluid problems involved. Improvements of this model based on application and further analysis will make it a more powerful engineering tool to optimize the <b>skirt</b> <b>system</b> to minimize its undesirable outputs. by Dongfang Bai.

40|$|Despite {{increased}} {{investment in}} flood defences, {{it is not}} economically viable to protect all at risk properties {{from the threat of}} flooding. This has led to a move towards encouraging property owners to take their own steps in making their homes or businesses less vulnerable to flooding. For example, the UK Government has introduced a grant aid scheme to encourage property level flood protection and has called for the development of new innovative flood approaches and products. Examining the effectiveness of current flood protection products including both resistance and resilience measures, with regard to water ingress, installation cost and acceptance by homeowners, reveals shortcomings with the existing measures. To address this issue, a novel solution is proposed that combines resistance and resilience adapted basement waterproofing, using an internal hollow <b>skirting</b> <b>system</b> (patent protected GB- 2449777 and GB- 2452423) to address the ingress of floodwaters into properties with solid floors. The method does not attempt to resist floodwaters but manages the water using ways that homeowners can appreciate. It is easy to install and is affordable in line with current grant aid. Furthermore, the new system can be installed in both existing and new build properties and, in doing so, offers complete property flood level protection. It is concluded that the new system may provide a practical solution towards the uptake of property level flood adaptation measures...|$|R

Much of the existing simulation capability for air cushion vehicles was developed in the 1960 ’s, 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s to support the design of the LCAC and are coefficient-based models derived from small-scale experiments. The general utility of these simulations is limited in the design of new air cushion vehicles, especially for innovative concepts or new components for increased performance capability. Advances in computing power and algorithms for free surface flows have made possible the development of new simulation tools to quantitatively assess design modifications and complement model tests of air cushion vehicles. In this paper we describe the formulation, implementation and verification of a new computational model, called ACVSIM, to simulate the dynamics of air cushion vehicles operating in waves. The primary components of ACVSIM include a high-order Rankine panel method for the hydrodynamic solution, an immersed boundary model for the solution of the air cushion dynamics, and a structural dynamics model of the bag-and-finger <b>skirt</b> <b>system.</b> Several semi-empirical models for other force components, such as the aerodynamic drag, are planned for a future release of the code...|$|R

Along with maximising profits, companies such as Sims Metal Management want {{to provide the best}} working conditions possible for their employees and minimise the risks of injury or future health concerns. Companies must do what is reasonable and practicable to ensure this. Currently in the non-ferrous recovery plant, the dust levels are sometimes too high. This causes some issues, employees must wear uncomfortable dust masks all day and causes further discomforts. It settles on machinery and on the ground. Over time this dust builds up requiring extensive cleaning and production must be stopped. Dust also increase maintenance costs and reduces the life of machinery. To combat the dust the following were completed. A high pressure water system was used to slightly dampen stored material and suppress dust plumes when this material is unloaded from the bucket of a front end loader. A bag house dust suction system was installed to remove as much dust as possible without overloading the suction system. A vibratory screener was modified to filter out the finer material and remove as much dirt as possible before it travelled further down the plant spilling and vibratory feeds which usually cause dust particles to become airborne. Wider conveyor belts and additional <b>skirting</b> <b>systems</b> and belt scrapers were installed to reduce the spillage. The amount of car tires entering the plant was also reduced by rearranging the magnet setup to decrease load on metal sorters and allow an increase in the processing rates in the plant...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{demonstrate}} {{and evaluate the}} effectiveness of heat interception methods for use on a relevant cryogenic propulsion stage at a system level has been identified. Evolvable Cryogenics (eCryo) Structural Heat Intercept, Insulation and Vibration Evaluation Rig (SHIIVER) will be designed with vehicle specific geometries (SLS Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) as guidance) and will be subjected to simulated space environments. One method of reducing structure-born heat leak being investigated utilizes vapor-based heat interception. Vapor-based heat interception could potentially reduce heat leak into liquid hydrogen propulsion tanks, increasing potential mission length or payload capability. Due to the high number of unknowns associated with the heat transfer mechanism and integration of vapor-based heat interception on a realistic large-scale skirt design, a sub-scale investigation was developed. The sub-project effort is known as the Small-scale Laboratory Investigation of Cooling Enhancements (SLICE). The SLICE aims to study, design, and test sub-scale multiple attachments and flow configuration concepts for vapor-based heat interception of structural skirts. SLICE will focus on understanding the efficiency of the heat transfer mechanism to the boil-off hydrogen vapor by varying the fluid network designs and configurations. Various analyses were completed in MATLAB, Excel VBA, and COMSOL Multiphysics to understand the optimum flow pattern for heat transfer and fluid dynamics. Results from these analyses were used to design and fabricate test article subsections of a large forward skirt with vapor cooling applied. The SLICE testing is currently being performed to collect thermal mechanical performance data on <b>multiple</b> <b>skirt</b> heat removal designs while varying inlet vapor conditions necessary to intercept a specified amount of heat for a given system. Initial results suggest that applying vapor-cooling provides a 50 heat reduction in conductive heat transmission along the skirt to the tank.

40|$|Membranes {{have many}} {{engineering}} applications {{due to their}} light weight and low construction cost, {{as well as their}} flexibility. As a specific example, optimal design of seal and <b>skirt</b> <b>system</b> in Air Cushion Vehicles (ACVs) is essential to achieve higher speed and stability, and lower fuel consumption. Previously developed methods have considered elastic and hyperelastic membranes, as well as membranes with flexural rigidity. However, some membranes are inextensible, and have no or negligible bending stiffness. This dissertation proposes a number of methods to analyze structural behavior of membranes which can be effectively applied to membranes with complex geometries, those that are extensible or inextensible, as well as membranes with or without resistance to bending. In particular, this dissertation presents: •	An analytical method to investigate the deformation and internal forces in circular semi-submerged inextensible massless membranes, •	A numerical method to predict the hydrodynamic pressure applied to bow seal membranes based upon their mechanical properties and forces involved, •	A Finite Element (FE) method to model both weightless and weighted inextensible curved membranes under a variety of forces, and •	A numerical method based on Isogeometric Analysis capable of analyzing a wide range of membranes. The analytical method is a powerful, easy and precise method for a weightless membrane with specific geometry subjected to varying normal pressure. The first FE method considers weighted and weightless membranes under shear and normal pressure. Although there are some limitations in the range of applied forces this method can analyze, constant radius arc elements provide a good representation for curved membranes and very accurate results ideal for simple geometries by relatively faster analysis. The method based on the Isogeometric Analysis overcomes the limitations in the FE method; nonetheless it has potential for improvement in cases such as modeling low curvature membranes, by choosing higher degree Bezier curves or B-Spline base functions. This method, especially if improved, provides more accurate result for more complex geometries. The methods presented in this dissertation set the stage for Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) problems that involve membranes. Large displacements are assumed in all analyses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} {{application}} of using a <b>skirted</b> foundation <b>system</b> to study the behavior of foundations with structural skirts adjacent to a sand slope and subjected to earthquake loading. The effect of the adopted skirts to safeguard foundation and slope from collapse is studied. The skirts effect on controlling horizontal soil movement and decreasing pore water pressure beneath foundations and beside the slopes during earthquake is investigated. This technique is investigated numerically using finite element analysis. A four story reinforced concrete building that rests on a raft foundation is idealized as a two-dimensional model with and without skirts. A two dimensional plain strain program PLAXIS, (dynamic version) is adopted. A series of models for the problem under investigation were run under different skirt depths and lactation from the slope crest. The effect of subgrade relative density and skirts thickness is also discussed. Nodal displacement and element strains were analyzed for the foundation with and without skirts and at different studied parameters. The research results showed a great effectiveness in increasing the overall stability of the slope and foundation. The confined soil footing <b>system</b> by such <b>skirts</b> reduced the foundation acceleration therefore it can be tended to damping element and relieved the transmitted disturbance to the adjacent slope.

Vertical, horizontal, and moment capacity of multifooting foundation systems are potentially dependent on footing interaction, and in particular overturning capacity can be significantly enhanced by the structural rigidity of a multifooting foundation system. There is no established procedure for the calculation of bearing capacity of a shallow foundation system comprising cojoined footings and ad hoc approaches may simply involve summing the ultimate limit states of the individual footings as if they acted independently; neglecting additional capacity of the system available from the kinematic constraint provided by the structural connection between the footings.

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} investigating methods {{to reduce the}} boil-off rate on large cryogenic upper stages. Two such methods to reduce the total heat load on existing upper stages are vapor cooling of the cryogenic tank support structure and integration of thick multilayer insulation systems to the upper stage of a launch vehicle. Previous efforts have flown a 2 -layer MLI blanket and shown an improved thermal performance, and other efforts have ground-tested blankets up to 70 layers thick on tanks with diameters between 2 3 meters. However, thick multilayer insulation installation and testing in both thermal and structural modes has not been completed {{on a large scale}} tank. Similarly, multiple vapor cooled shields are common place on science payload helium dewars; however, minimal effort has gone into intercepting heat on large structural surfaces associated with rocket stages. A majority of the vapor cooling effort focuses on metallic cylinders called skirts, which are the most common structural components for launch vehicles. In order to provide test data for comparison with analytical models, a representative test tank {{is currently}} being designed to include <b>skirt</b> structural <b>systems</b> with integral vapor cooling.

A multilayer insulation system will be designed to insulate the tank and structure while being installed in a representative manner that can be extended to tanks up to 10 meters in diameter. In order to prove that the insulation system and vapor cooling attachment methods are structurally sound, acoustic testing will also be performed on the system.

Crew safety and mission flexibility (in terms {{of ability to}} provide {{a wide range of}} delta-V) were given high priority. Three versions were considered, using the same overall configuration based on a low L/D aerobrake with the geometry of a raked off elliptical cone with ellipsoidal nose and a toroidal <b>skirt.</b> The propulsion <b>system</b> consists of three gimballed LOX/LH 2 engines firing away from the aerobrake.

All other field joint heaters and aft <b>skirt</b> thermal conditioning <b>systems</b> had no anomalies. Shuttle thermal imager infrared readings compared favorably with measured ground environment instrumentation data. No thermal launch commit criteria violations occurred at any time. Evaluation of the development flight instrumentation showed exceptional propulsion performance.
