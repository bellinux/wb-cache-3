40|$|Self {{contained}} <b>multi-media</b> <b>kits</b> {{for grades}} 1 through 6 involve students {{directly in the}} learning process. Emphasis is on non-verbal learning which takes place when youngsters examine real objects and engage in learning activities. Involved in the discovery and inquiry process, students hypothesize, classify, and categorize. In an interdisciplinary approach to the social studies, the MATCH boxes aim for both affective and cognitive learning. Cognitive objectives involve learning facts, information about ancient. Greek life, contemporary Japanese life, and the city. Affective objectives help students to deal reflectively with themselves and toward the world around them. Each of the three kits are designed {{for two to three}} weeks of study. The program description is divided into five sections and includes information on goals and objectives, content and materials, classroom action, implementation and costs, an...|$|E

40|$|This Field Study {{centered}} on the preparation, presentation and evaluation of an introductory course in educational media for first year teacher education students. The introduction provides the rationale (theoretical and practical) for such a course and outlines the nature and purpose of the project. The approach used is clarified and justified. Basically the approach is on formal, traditional lines with regard to curriculum development; but the intention is to provide the first detailed written account of such proceedings in the educational media field. Necessary terms (educational media, multi-media, older and newer media) are defined and general aims and objectives are developed {{taking into account the}} usual constraints as well as the results of classroom surveys, consultations and case studies. Appropriate reviews of literature and previous research which are relevant to the topic are dealt with under the following headings: the need for the course; the operation of equipment; selection and production of materials; application to the classroom; the place of media in the curriculum; theory, background and attitudes. The plan follows systematic lines along the model provided in Teaching and Media. A Systematic Approach, (Gerlach and Ely: 1971 : 7). This involves providing the detailed objectives, specifying content, assessing time and space, selecting resources, evaluating performance and finally analysing feedback. Experiments conducted fall into three categories. Firstly, students were evaluated by means of a <b>multi-media</b> <b>kit</b> of materials, ability to operate equipment and a multi-choice test. Secondly, the course itself was evaluated by means of a questionnaire given to the students. This questionnaire was subsequently rewritten to eliminate the predictability of some of the responses. The third experiment involved two classroom surveys on media use (details included in the introduction). These provided useful evidence in connection with the project. Findings and recommendations for better practice are provided under the following headings: General Objectives of Course and Content of the Course Strategy Time for Course Resources Evaluation Location of Course Staff Education...|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a unit of {{curriculum}} and instruction based on the theories of Mauritz Johnson, Jr. (1967, 1969) and the criteria of the Canada Studies Foundation. [...] The unit developed, Problems of housing and planning in a growing urban centre, is part of an interdisciplinary, <b>multi-media</b> <b>kit</b> which is presently being developed by the St. John's team of Project Atlantic Canada. The kit includes student booklets, teacher's guidebook, slide tape production, wall charts and aerial photographs. The writer participated in the development and selection of many of the materials in the kit. [...] The unit was formatively evaluated at several stages of the developmental process. Materials were appraised by experts in social studies education and audio visual education to establish the validity and teachability of the unit. Guiding questions (Anderson, 1972; Hodgetts, Tomkins, and Bowles, 1974) for the development of units of curriculum and instruction were employed throughout the formative evaluation to ensure adherence to Johnson's theories and the criteria of the Canada Studies Foundation. Fry's readability formula (Fry, 1968) was applied to determine the reading level of the student narrative. Finally, the unit was field tested in six classrooms. The major conclusions which result from this study are as follows: [...] 1. Johnson's theories (1967, 1968) can be used as a theoretical framework on which to build a unit of curriculum and instruction. [...] 2. The criteria of the Canada Studies Foundation can be incorporated into the development of a unit of curriculum and instruction. [...] 3. The theories of Mauritz Johnson, Jr., used in conjunction with the criteria of the Canada Studies Foundation can provide a useful framework for involvement in curriculum development by an inexperienced developer. [...] 4. The Guiding questions to aid in the development of curriculum and instruction units (Anderson, 1972) can aid in the formative evaluation of units of curriculum and instruction. [...] 5. The Guiding questions for developing Canada studies curricula (Hodgetts, Tomkins, and Bowles, 1974) can be useful in the evaluation process of curriculum development, [...] 6. The unit developed can be successfully taught to junior high school students. [...] 7. Both students and teachers enjoyed and understood the [...] materials and activities of the unit developed. [...] 8. Both students and teachers considered the materials and activities used throughout the unit developed to be appropriate [...] 9. The unit developed can be used to supplement existing social studies programs in Canada studies...|$|R
