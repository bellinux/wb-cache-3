The games enjoyed more commercial success than their Game Boy Advance predecessors: with around 18 million units sold worldwide, Diamond and Pearl have sold over 2 <b>million</b> <b>more</b> units than Ruby and Sapphire and almost 6 <b>million</b> <b>more</b> units than FireRed and LeafGreen, while outselling their successors, Black and White, by over 2 million copies.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the Famine of 1740-41, which killed roughly two fifths of the island's population.

5|$|By early 1934, {{the focus}} {{shifted away from}} funding work {{creation}} schemes and toward rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended {{to speed up the}} rearmament programme. In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a <b>million</b> <b>more</b> in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.|$|E

During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Fox, who had {{projected}} {{the budget}} at $75 million, rejected the treatment which they estimated {{would have cost}} $5 <b>million</b> <b>more.</b> Beast, Nightcrawler, Pyro, and the Danger Room had to be deleted before the studio greenlighted X-Men. Fox head Thomas Rothman argued that this would enhance the story, and Singer concurred that removing the Danger Room allowed him to focus on other scenes he preferred. Elements of Beast, particularly his medical expertise, were transferred to Jean Grey. Singer and DeSanto brought Christopher McQuarrie from The Usual Suspects, and together did another rewrite. David Hayter simultaneously rewrote the screenplay, receiving solo screenplay credit from the Writers Guild of America, while Singer and DeSanto were given story credit. The WGA offered McQuarrie a credit, but he voluntarily took his name off when the final version was {{more in line with}} Hayter's script than his.|$|E

5|$|In 1801, the {{population}} of Wales was 587 thousand, {{and most of these}} would have been living in rural areas and employed in agriculture. By 1911, {{the population}} had swelled to 2.4 <b>million,</b> <b>more</b> than half of whom lived in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, where they were employed in mining, steel and other industries. There was a shift away from the land with many dwellers in the rural west emigrating in the 1830s and 1840s and migrating to the cities {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. By 1911, agriculture was a minor industry in Glamorgan, and migrant labour from England was needed to help get in the harvest. Rural craftsmen were also lost and their supply was replenished from depressed areas of southwestern England and by mass immigration from Ireland.|$|E

After that group left the building in 2006, Willamette spent $4.6 million ($2 <b>million</b> <b>more</b> than originally planned) to remodel the old library building over a year's time and convert it into the Oregon Civic Justice Center as part of the College of Law. The remodeling project began in the summer of 2007 and included removing a swimming pool structure that had been added to the south of the building, while also adding a new entrance to the former library on the same side as where the pool was located. Renovations also removed a mezzanine that the YWCA had added to the upper portion of the main floor. Other renovations included new heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, upgrades for technology, all while retaining the historical look and feel of the original 1912 building.|$|E
