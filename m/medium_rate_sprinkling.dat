30|$|In {{a survey}} of New Zealand forest managers, Rolando et al. (2013) found that {{subsequent}} release sprays were based on clopyralid, {{with the addition of}} picloram and/or triclopyr. The three combinations of herbicides assessed in this trial based on clopyralid gave good control of broom at all rates assessed, though the two mixtures with triclopyr were more effective than the clopyralid/picloram mixture, especially when on 12 -month-old broom. The <b>medium</b> <b>rate</b> tested for the two treatments that included both clopyralid and triclopyr mixtures (clo/tric and cpat) (which were based on rates recommended to forestry managers) appeared similar in efficacy. Although the highest rate of the clopyralid/triclopyr mix (clo/tric-H) gave slightly better control than the <b>medium</b> <b>rate</b> of both mixes (clo/tric-M and cpat-M), the difference was not statistically significant and cost was twice the <b>medium</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, there {{does not appear to be}} an advantage in adding picloram and aminopyralid to the clopyralid/triclopyr mix. However, the clopyralid/triclopyr/picloram/aminopyralid mix would cost the same as the clopyralid/triclopyr mix based on the prices obtained from Askin and Askin (2014) (Table  1). Comparisons of costs will vary depending on market prices for the various forms of triclopyr and combinations available.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in assessing the level of activity of acute Charcot foot, monitoring treatment response and predicting healing time. Materials and methods: Forty diabetic patients with acute Charcot foot were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent limb immobilization and were followed every 3 months by clinical examination (skin temperature and circumferences) and MRI. MR protocol included T 1 -weighted and fast spin echo inversion recovery (FSE-IR) sequences, and a dynamic study (fast spoiled gradient echo), after gadolinium administration (0. 1 ml/kg). The contrast <b>medium</b> uptake <b>rate</b> at D-MRI and the signal intensity (SI) ratio on the FSE-IR sequence were measured. Results: At baseline, mean contrast <b>medium</b> uptake <b>rate</b> was 136 ± 49. 7 % and the mean SI ratio was 5 ± 3. A high intra- and inter-observer agreement was found for the contrast <b>medium</b> uptake <b>rate,</b> whereas a low agreement was observed for the SI ratio. At 3 months' follow-up, reduction of the contrast <b>medium</b> uptake <b>rate</b> was observed in all patients with improved clinical findings (n = 34), whereas the SI ratio was reduced in 15 / 34 (44. 1 %) patients. Mean healing time {{was significantly related to}} the baseline contrast <b>medium</b> uptake <b>rate</b> (P= 0. 005); it was 5. 3 ± 2. 7 months in patients with contrast <b>medium</b> uptake <b>rate</b> ≤ 100 %, compared with 9. 1 ± 2. 5 months in the remaining patients (P= 0. 0003).

40|$|The {{effect of}} a noisy {{reference}} carrier {{on the performance of}} International Comet Explorer (ICE) Sequential decoder is analyzed. Ideal reference models for frame deletion probability are given for the Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA) and the Linkabit (LS 4815) sequential decoders. Based on these ideal reference models the deletion probability in the presence of noisy reference carrier is computed for both the high and the low data <b>rate</b> cases. A <b>medium</b> data <b>rate</b> performance model is then derived using an interpolation method. The derived <b>medium</b> <b>rate</b> performance model depends on the phase locked loop bandwidth-integration time product. Results are obtained for frame length 1024 bits, data bit rates of 1024 bps and 512 bps, modulation index of 60 deg, and threshold loop bandwidths of 10 Hz and 3 Hz. The <b>medium</b> <b>rate</b> model agrees with experimental data to within measurement uncertainty. For the 10 Hz loop bandwidth and modulation index of 60 deg at frame deletion rate of 0. 0001, the required total received power to noise ratio is 36 dB.

Using a model system that approximates flavonoid exudation of Medicago sativa roots, we treated a soil with 7, 4 '-dihydroxyflavone and naringenin in two separate experiments using three different rates: medium (equivalent to the exudation rate of 7, 4 '-dihydroxyflavone from M. sativa seedlings), high (10 × the <b>medium</b> <b>rate),</b> and low (0. 1 × the <b>medium</b> <b>rate).</b> Controls received no flavonoid. Soil samples were subjected to ATP assays and 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The flavonoid treatments caused no significant change in the soil ATP content. With the high 7, 4 '-dihydroxyflavone treatment rate, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as Acidobacteria subdivision 4 increased in relative abundance compared with the control samples, whereas OTUs classified as Gaiellales, Nocardioidaceae, and Thermomonosporaceae were more prevalent in the control. The naringenin treatments did not cause significant changes in the soil bacterial community structure.
