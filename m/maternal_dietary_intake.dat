A Purposive sampling procedure {{was employed to}} select pregnant women (n= 107) who had been tested for HIV into the study. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, health factors, <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> and pregnancy outcomes were collected through an interview schedule from HIV-infected (n= 48) and uninfected (n= 59) pregnant women. <b>Maternal</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> were investigated using 24 -Hour Diet Recalls and Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs). Pregnancy outcomes were assessed in terms of infants’ birth weights, gestational age, birth complications and stillbirths. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze data for descriptive and inferential statistics while NutriSurvey computer program analyzed dietary data for nutrient intake levels. The results showed that protein (p = 0. 025) and vitamin B 12 (p = 0. 021) intakes had significant correlation with infant’s gestational age among the HIV-infected women while calorie (p = 0. 042), vitamin B 6 (p = 0. 048) and vitamin B 12 (p = 0. 015) intakes significantly influenced infant’s gestational age among uninfected women. Magnesium, iron and folate had a significant influence (p < 0. 05) on infant’s gestational age in both HIV-infected and uninfected mothers. The results further revealed that HIV-infected women gave birth to infants of low birth weight (2. 70 ± 0. 3799 kg) compared with those uninfected (3. 16 ± 0. 5307 kg), while the gestational age of infants born to HIV-infected mothers was shorter (34. 6 ± 3. 24 weeks) {{compared with that of}} infants born to uninfected mothers (39. 4 ± 2. 21 weeks).

40|$|Studies {{assessing}} <b>maternal</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> and {{the relationship}} with birthweight are inconsistent, thus attempting to draw inferences {{on the role of}} maternal nutrition in determining the fetal growth trajectory is difficult. The aim of this review is to provide updated evidence from epidemiological and randomized controlled trials on the impact of <b>dietary</b> and supplemental <b>intakes</b> of omega- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, zinc, folate, iron, calcium, and vitamin D, as well as dietary patterns, on infant birthweight. A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken via the electronic databases Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Medline. Included articles were those published in English, in scholarly journals, and which provided information about diet and nutrition during pregnancy and infant birthweight. There is insufficient evidence for omega- 3 fatty acid supplements' ability to reduce risk of low birthweight (LBW), and more robust evidence from studies supplementing with zinc, calcium, and/or vitamin D needs to be established. Iron supplementation appears to increase birthweight, particularly when there are increases in maternal hemoglobin concentrations in the third trimester. There is limited evidence supporting the use of folic acid supplements to reduce the risk for LBW; however, supplementation may increase birthweight by ~ 130 g. Consumption of whole foods such as fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and lean meats throughout pregnancy appears beneficial for appropriate birthweight. Intervention studies with an understanding of optimal dietary patterns may provide promising results for both maternal and perinatal health.

Breastfeeding status was determined when the children were 3. 9 months. Diet information was obtained using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. Maternal diet was assessed by seven indicators: average daily intake of fruit, vegetables, non-core drinks, non-core sweet snacks, non-core savoury snacks, variety of fruit and variety of vegetables eaten in the preceding 12 months. Associations between breastfeeding status and each dietary variable were assessed using linear regression analyses. Socioeconomic position, maternal body mass index and the cluster-based sampling design were controlled for. Results:   Of the 529 subjects, 70 % were breastfeeding their child. Compared with non-breastfeeding mothers, breastfeeding mothers were found to consume more serves of vegetables (P= 0. 001), {{a greater variety of}} fruit and vegetables (P= 0. 001 and P≤ 0. 001 respectively), and sweet snacks were consumed more frequently (P= 0. 006). Differences were observed between low and high socioeconomic position mothers for fruit serves (P= 0. 003), vegetable serves (P= 0. 010) and fruit variety (P= 0. 006). These associations persisted after controlling for socioeconomic position and maternal body mass index. Conclusions:  The association between infant feeding (breastfeeding) and some aspects of maternal diet provides further evidence suggesting a link between maternal and child diets from a younger age than previously examined. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Congenital heart defects (CHDs) have a multifactorial origin, {{in which}} subtle genetic factors and peri-conception {{exposures}} interact. We hypothesize that derangements in the homocysteine and detoxification pathways, {{due to a}} polymorphism in the nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) gene, low <b>maternal</b> <b>dietary</b> nicotinamide <b>intake,</b> and medicine use in the peri-conception period, affect CHD risk. Methods and results: In 292 case and 316 control families, maternal peri-conception medicine use and low <b>dietary</b> <b>intake</b> of nicotinamide (≤ 13. 8 mg/day) were independently associated with CHD risk [odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) 1. 6 (1. 1 - 2. 3) and 1. 5 (1. 03 - 2. 3), respectively]. No significant association was found for the NNMT AG/AA genotype in mothers [0. 9 (0. 7 - 1. 3) ], fathers [1. 1 (0. 8 - 1. 6) ], or children [1. 1 (0. 8 - 1. 6) ]. However, the combination of peri-conception medicine use, low <b>dietary</b> nicotinamide <b>intake,</b> and the NNMT AG/AA genotype in mothers or children showed risk of 2. 7 (1. 02 - 8. 1) and 8. 8 (2. 4 - 32. 5), respectively. Conclusion: Children carrying the NNMT A allele face additional CHD risk in combination with peri-conception exposure to medicines and/or a low <b>dietary</b> nicotinamide <b>intake.</b> These findings provide a first set of data against which future studies with larger sample sizes can be compared with...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Calcium supplementation during {{pregnancy}} {{has been shown}} to reduce the incidence of hypertension in the mother, but the effects on the offspring are uncertain. Assessing the impact on the offspring is very important given the now large body of evidence indicating that blood pressure levels in childhood and young adulthood can be influenced by factors operating during fetal life. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to summarize the evidence supporting an association between <b>maternal</b> <b>dietary</b> calcium <b>intake</b> {{during pregnancy}} and blood pressure in the offspring. Methods A systematic review was performed to identify randomized, quasi-randomized and cohort studies reporting the relationship between offspring blood pressure or incidence of hypertension and levels of <b>maternal</b> <b>dietary</b> calcium <b>intake</b> during pregnancy, either from supplements (i. e. pills) or food. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library Registry were searched for relevant trials. Results Two randomized trial and three observational studies were identified and included in this review. In 4 of the 5 studies, loss to follow-up was a serious concern. There was heterogeneity between the studies, particularly those conducted on children below 12 month of age. Results were more consistent among the studies including older children (1 to 9 years) where a higher maternal calcium intake was associated with a reduction of - 1. 92 mm Hg (95 % CI - 3. 14 to - 0. 71) in offspring systolic blood pressure. One large randomized trial found a clinically and statistically significant reduction in the incidence of hypertension in 7 -year-old children (RR = 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 39 to 0. 90). Conclusion There is evidence in the literature to support an association between maternal calcium intake during pregnancy and offspring blood pressure. However, {{more research is needed to}} confirm these finding given the small sample sizes and the methodological problems in many of the studies conducted so far. More studies on populations with calcium deficit are also needed. If confirmed, these findings could have important public health implications. Calcium supplementation during pregnancy is simple and inexpensive and may be a way to reduce the risk of hypertension and its sequels in the next generation. </p...|$|R

Data on long-term impact of artificially sweetened beverage (ASB) consumption during pregnancy on offspring obesity risk are lacking. We prospectively investigated intake of ASBs and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) during pregnancy in relation to offspring growth through age 7 years among high-risk children born to women with gestational diabetes. METHODS: In a prospective study of 918 mother-singleton child dyads from the Danish National Birth Cohort, <b>maternal</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>intake</b> was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire during pregnancy. Offspring body mass index z-scores (BMIZ) and overweight/obesity status were derived using weight and length/height at birth, 5 and 12 months and 7 years. Linear regression and Poisson regression with robust standard errors were used, adjusting for major risk factors.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of the metabolic syndrome, {{a cluster of}} abnormalities focusing on insulin resistance and associated with high risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, is reaching epidemic proportions. Prevalent in both developed and developing countries, the metabolic syndrome has largely been attributed to altered dietary and lifestyle factors that favour the development of central obesity. However, population-based {{studies have suggested that}} predisposition to the metabolic syndrome may be acquired very early in development through inappropriate fetal or neonatal nutrition. Further evidence for developmental programming of the metabolic syndrome has now been suggested by animal studies in which the fetal environment has been manipulated through altered <b>maternal</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>intake</b> or modification of uterine artery blood flow. This review examines these studies and assesses whether the metabolic syndrome can be reliably induced by the interventions made. The validity of the different species, diets, feeding regimes and end-point measures used is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The Pregnancy, Nutrition & Diabetes (PND) study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the dietary status of urban Black pregnant women attending the Antenatal Clinic at the Charlotte Maxeke (Johannesburg General) Hospital. In addition, the study investigated the effects of <b>maternal</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>intake</b> and hormonal levels during pregnancy on fetal growth, birth size and the early postnatal development of risk factors for future Type 2 diabetes. The study analysis precedes {{a detailed description of}} the study population, including its comparison with other populations. Methods. 126 women were enrolled in the study before 24 weeks of gestation. Twice during pregnancy (weeks 20 - 24 and 30 - 36, visits V 1 and V 2) and approximately six months after the delivery (visit V 3), volunteers participated in a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood pressure, anthropometric and socio-demographic data were taken and a food frequency questionnaire was administered at each visit.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the intake of {{vitamins}} A and E by Polish breast feeding mothers and the correlation between the intake of these vitamins and their concentration in the <b>maternal</b> milk. <b>Dietary</b> <b>intake</b> was assessed by triple 24 h diet recall questionnaire. Milk samples were collected and the content of vitamin A and E was determined. The mean intake of vitamin E (7. 7 ± 3. 4 mg/day) covered 54. 7 % of the recommended value. The mean vitamin A content in daily food rations (DFR) - 1012 ± 735 μg-allowed to cover 63. 2 % of the requirement. The mean concentration of vitamin A in milk was 57. 07 ± 29. 3 μg/ 100 mL. There was a correlation of the content of vitamin A in milk and the intake of this vitamin (r = 0. 371) and the intake of essential fatty acids (r = 0. 455) also. The mean concentration of the vitamin E in the milk (413. 1 ± 194. 4 mg/ 100 mL), statistically significant correlated with its intake in DFR (r = 0. 483).

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{studies in}} recent years have {{demonstrated}} the effect of maternal diet on fatty acid composition of human milk. Methods Fourteen free-living lactating women participated in a cross-over dietary intervention study, consuming a low fat diet (17. 6 % of energy as fat, 14. 4 % of energy as protein, 68. 0 % of energy as carbohydrate) and a high fat diet (40. 3 % of energy as fat, 14. 4 % of energy as protein, 45. 3 % of energy as carbohydrate) each for periods of 4 days, in randomised order. Each mother was her own control. Mature milk samples were collected during each period and analysed for medium and long chain fatty acids. Results The concentration of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), was 13. 6 % in breast milk for the low fat diet compared to 11. 4 % for the high fat (p Conclusions Changing <b>maternal</b> <b>dietary</b> fat <b>intake</b> has a rapid response in terms of changes to fatty acids in breast milk. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how income, household division {{of power and}} maternal decision-making ability influence <b>dietary</b> <b>intake</b> and child morbidity. A sample of 154 households with children between one and three years was drawn from six villages in Busia District, western Kenya. Information on household and <b>maternal</b> characteristics, morbidity, <b>dietary</b> <b>intake</b> and anthropometry was gathered between July and November 1988. Household headship {{was found to have}} no significant or direct influence on children's nutritional status. Total income was higher in female-headed households. While women in male-headed households had greater financial responsibility for household maintenance, female heads of household assumed more farming responsibilities but had higher remittances from husbands. A measure of maternal differentiation was generated by principal components analysis, constituted mainly by schooling, language ability, nutrition knowledge and information seeking behaviour. Differentiation had a strong impact in lowering morbidity and {{was a significant predictor of}} greater dietary diversity and weaning practices that supported better child nutrition and growth...|$|R
