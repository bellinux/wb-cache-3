50|$|Among many of {{the other}} {{technology}} and science driven exhibits at the museum is the Ferrofluid <b>Magnetoscope.</b> This world-renowned interactive exhibit was created by Ann Arbor inventor Michael Flynn who debuted the first version of the <b>magnetoscope</b> at the Work Gallery in the School of Art and Design at the University of Michigan. Flynn has also showcased his creation around the world in Scotland, Ireland, and Italy. The Ferrofluid <b>Magnetoscope</b> at the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum is one of only 250 that are available for viewing.|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{psychiatric}} {{interviews were}} recorded with a <b>magnetoscope.</b> Their linguistic analysis allows situations of conflict {{to be studied}} without any possible outlet in reality or by some emotional or social reasons. The notion of conflict in a closed field leads to a structural and psychodynamic analysis of the existential dilemma and {{to a better understanding}} of the patients way of adaptation or break down. Theoretical and practical solutions may then be evoked. In this sense, it may help to better conceive which strategy is to be adopted in psychotherapy and readaptation of apparently heavy cases.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the mechanical testing and the microstructure analysis of dissimilar welded joint of the R 350 HT steel and the high-manganese (Hadfield) cast steel using Cr-Ni cast steel spacer. The simulation tests of the welded joint surface deformation were carried out. The macroscopic and microscopic investigation were made using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Content of the magnetic phase was measured using <b>magnetoscope.</b> The quantitative metallographic investigation was used for assessment of ferrite and martensite contents and X-ray diffraction phase analysis was carried out. The results showed that during cooling of the spacer after welding, the transformation of metastable austenite into martensite proceeded. In addition to work hardening, the phase transformation of austenite into martensite occurs {{during the process of}} the superficial deformation of the spacer while simulated exploitation. This leads to a substantial increase of hardness, and at the same time, causes the increase of wear resistance of the welded joints of crossovers...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} aid of {{technical}} records - recordings (audio, visual or combined audiovisual) events and occurrences can be registered in the outside world in detail. The recording enables the creator or anyone who has it in disposal that at any moment of its reproduction, it can be found in detail how the recorded event has happened or how an occurrence seemed {{at the time of the}} recording. Among the current formats of technical records are included: photography, filming, magnetic, <b>magnetoscope,</b> and videophone recording etc. (Sahiti & Murati 2016, 295). The possibility provided by the rapid technical development is also of interest to criminal procedure because technical records containing any fact that may be proved in criminal proceedings may serve as a source of knowledge about facts. In other words, they may serve as evidence to establish facts in criminal proceedings. Given the extensive options that technical fact recordings provide, entities that use the aid of various devices from this fi eld, as well as the different purposes of the author of the recording which have led to the case of making the recording, there is a reasonable question of the permission on their use as evidence in criminal proceedings. In Kosovo, the situation is clear in terms of recordings made in the criminal procedure, as Kosovo CCPâ€Š 1 provides the possibility of photographing, filming, sketching, etc., of the crime scene, audio visual recording etc. examination of persons (defendant, witness, expert) or recordings of any action on judicial review...|$|E
