40|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} the accuracy of an EDM total station is by a calibration procedure on a <b>measuring</b> <b>bench,</b> with a laser interferometer to monitor the real distance. For this specific calibration method an alignment of the prism and a solid knowledge {{of the construction of}} the bench is indispensable. Aberrations of the bench in lateral or vertical way, or rotations of the carrier may cause instabilities in receiving the reflected laser beam of the interferometer. This paper describes a measuring and correction procedure, by using a Trimble S 6 robotic total station, combined with an LSP- 30 laser interferometer on an EDM <b>measuring</b> <b>bench.</b> The study highlights that the lateral and vertical errors on the distance, as well as the rotation movements of the carrier, can be corrected rather accurately. However, the error on the horizontal distance, which increases in relation to the distance, could not completely be removed from the dataset.

40|$|International audienceThe {{implementation}} of the experimental methodology by optical measurements of mechanical fields, {{the development of a}} test bench, the specimen preparation, the experimental measurements, and the digital image correlation (DIC) method, have already been the object of research in the context of biological materials.

The nature of the cortical bone induces some difficulties, as no single speckled pattern technique is available for simultaneously obtaining the displacement at the macroscopic scale and at the mesoscopic scale.

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{magnetic}} materials are submitted to extreme working conditions {{in terms of}} frequencyexcitation and induction level. This is mainly driven by scientific and technical requirements todevelop compact machines and devices with high power density and efficiency. Therefore, it becomesnecessary to have a precise prediction of iron losses in these situations. Several magnetic losses orhysteresis models exist but they often fail to describe the material behavior when both saturation andhigh flux variation are imposed. This paper focuses on this issue and discusses {{the influence of the}} flux density and its time variationratio on the dynamic magnetic field; B and dB/dt, being the main parameters of the developed models. The study aims to better understand the physical phenomena, to find out the best extrapolation of thematerial behavior at extreme magnetization conditions and to simplify the experimental identificationof models. A progressive approach is considered. Starting from a simple and classical eddy current theory, thedynamic field is first computed under arbitrary frequency considering a linear and nonlinear material. This is carried out thanks to analytical and numerical calculations; the latter being performed with thehelp of finite element simulations. In all cases, the studies are limited to 2 D geometry and thewaveform of the average flux density within the material thickness is imposed triangular. In a secondstep, the steplike magnetization law approach is developed as suggested by Giorgio Bertotti(Hysteresis in magnetism, Academic Press Inc., 1998). In that case the dynamic field is calculatedassuming propagating fronts of the magnetization in the material. Finally, an experimental study iscarried out in order to highlight all the physical mechanisms including domains dynamics and eddycurrents. A thick 50 %NiFe sample provided by Aperam Company is chosen to overcome thelimitations of the <b>measuring</b> <b>bench</b> met with conventional SiFe alloys. In fact, thanks to its thickness(0. 5 mm), high permeability (200000) and low saturation level (1. 6 T), high B and high dynamiceffects can be easily investigated.

40|$|International audienceCharacterization of {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) between two powerelectronic systems {{is an important}} activity in electromagnetic compatibility(EMC). However, EMC problems are currently treated after the production ofa prototype, which causes additional costs and significant delays if therequired standards are not reached. In order to consider the compliance toEMC standards {{from the very beginning}} of the design phase, a method hasbeen developed at Laboratoire Ampère to predict near-field coupling betweencomplex components. This predictive method is based on the multipolarexpansion in spherical harmonics of the field close to the element. Thiselement can then be represented by an equivalent punctual source composed ofthe elements of a multipolar expansion, which allows the computation of thenear-field coupling with other elements. The mutual inductance, which represents the magnetic coupling between twoobjects, can be computed once the coefficients of the multipolar developmentare known. To this purpose, a dedicated <b>measuring</b> <b>bench</b> has been designed inLaboratoire Ampère: the multipolar expansion is obtained by the measurementof magnetic field all around the source. Ideally, these field should be measuredin the real environment, with all other elements present, but not excited. However, this is not always practical. In the proposed approach, all the usefulinformation is obtained from measurement of the isolated element. Then themutual inductance can be computed for any set of element positions using thevector-spherical-harmonic addition theorem. Nevertheless, as a result of theabsence of the second source during measurements, the mutual inductancecomputed in this method can possibly differs from the theoretical value. Thisis mainly due to the coupling of second order in the system and the conductingmetal in the secondary element. In this paper, we first expose how the induced currents can sometimes affectthe computed mutual impedance. We propose to study a canonical problem inwhich two systems, composed of a loop source and a passive one, arepositioned close one from the other. The study of the error between thecomputed and the theoretical value of the mutual impedance show that theerror depends on several parameters such as the position of each element, theshape of the conducting metal, etc., which means that the proposed approachcannot always be applied. In the end, a corrective method using the samemeasuring bench is proposed to take into account the effects of inducedcurrents...|$|E

40|$|Anabolic Androgenic Steroids (AAS) are {{prohibited}} substances in sport {{due to their}} ability to improve muscle strength and power. Usually athletes who abuse these substances dose in cycles of up to 8 - 12 weeks. Whether the effects require this length of time to manifest is unknown.

PURPOSE: To determine if the AAS, testosterone enanthate could increase strength and athletic performance in 3 - 6 weeks and the use the T/E ratio screening measure could detect the use of the steroid over that period. METHODS: Eighteen healthy young males (25 + 4. 0 yrs) were match-paired and randomly assigned in a double blind manner to either a testosterone enanthate or a placebo group. All subjects performed a structured heavy resistance-training program while receiving either testosterone enanthate (3. 5 mg. kg- 1) or saline intramuscular injections once weekly for six weeks. 1 RM strength <b>measures</b> (<b>bench</b> press and leg press) and 10 -second cycle sprint performance were monitored at the pre- (week 0), mid (week 3) and post (week 6) time points.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts in which two {{different}} aspects of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Project are discussed. The first part describes the design of a transition radiation tracker (TRT) for the inner detector in ATLAS. In particular, the barrel part was studied in detail. The barrel TRT consists of 52 544 1. 5 -m-long proportional tubes (straws), parallel to the beam axis and each with a diameter of 4 mm. The detector {{is divided into}} three module layers with 32 modules in each layer. The preparatory study comprises: module size optimization, mechanical and thermal calculations, tracking performance and material budget studies. A 0. 5 -m-long barrel-module prototype has been built and tested in order to validate the design. Measurements have been performed on the temperature distribution inside the detector in order to calibrate the thermal calculations and to verify the cooling scheme of the modules. Additional measurements have been performed, e. g. on leak tightness, wire tension, high voltage and cross-talk between channels. Finally, the transition radiation performance of two different fibre radiators was measured with the 0. 5 m barrel prototype and, based on the performance of individual straws, the electron identification performance was estimated for the full barrel TRT. The second part deals with the cryogenic system for the LHC superconducting magnets. They will work at a temperature below 2 K and it is essential to understand the thermal behaviour of the individual cryogenic components in order to assess the insulating properties of the magnet cryostat.
