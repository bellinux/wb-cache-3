50|$|Few {{studies of}} effects on {{wildlife}} have been conducted, but {{studies of the}} nontarget impact from emergency applications of fipronil as barrier sprays for locust control in Madagascar showed adverse impacts of fipronil on termites, which appear to be very severe and long-lived. Also, adverse effects in were indicated {{in the short term}} on several other invertebrate groups, one species of lizard (Trachylepis elegans), and several species of birds (including the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>bee-eater).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The olive bee-eater, (or <b>Madagascar</b> <b>bee-eater)</b> (Merops superciliosus) is a near {{passerine}} bee-eater {{species in}} the genus Merops. It is native to the southern half of Africa where it is present in Angola; Botswana; Burundi; Comoros; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Djibouti; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Kenya; Madagascar; Malawi; Mayotte; Mozambique; Namibia; Rwanda; Somalia; South Sudan; Sudan; Tanzania; Uganda; Zambia; Zimbabwe.

5|$|The bee-eaters have an Old World distribution, {{occurring}} from Europe to Australia. The {{centre of}} {{diversity of the}} family is Africa, although a number of species also occur in Asia. Single species occur in each of Europe, (the European bee-eater), Australia (the rainbow <b>bee-eater)</b> and <b>Madagascar</b> (the olive <b>bee-eater,</b> also found on mainland Africa). Of the three genera, Merops, which has {{the majority of the}} species, occurs across the entirety of the family's distribution. Nyctyornis is restricted to Asia, ranging from India and southern China to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The genus Meropogon has a single species restricted to Sulawesi in Indonesia.|$|R
