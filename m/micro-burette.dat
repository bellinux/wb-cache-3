40|$|From {{the results}} of our {{set-point}} titrations of calcium and zinc with an automatic titrator after Slanina et al. [2], which drives a Metrohm E 457 - 0. 5 ml <b>micro-burette,</b> we conclude that considerable systematic errors result when the true strength of the titrant is taken into the calculation of the cation concentration. These systematic errors, which cannot be inferred from Slanina's [2] results, are already evident from the deviating results, obtained when the spectro-photometer is set to measure the absorption either of the free indicator (I) (calcein: 2 = 510 nm, xylenol orange: 2 = 427 nm) or of the metal-indicator com-plex (MI) (Ca 2 +: ~ = 486 nm, Zn 2 +: 2 = 570 nm). Titrations with about i gg of cation present show differences of 10 ~ and 2 ~ for the calcium and zin...|$|E

Type, {{amount and}} {{composition}} of gases which form in rocks and coals during a metamorphism process depend {{on a number of}} factors in particular genetic type of original matter, way and conditions of its gathering, temperature, pressure and geological time. Sorption tests were done by the volumetric method, with the use of adsorption <b>micro-burettes.</b> A major advantage of the measurement set-up is that the surplus amounts of adsorbate can be used in experiments, which is of particular importance when handling sorbents with heterogeneous structure, such as hard coals. Sorbates used in the test program were the vapours of hexane, hex- 1 -ene, heptane, hept- 1 -ene, octane and benzene. Measurement results seem to corroborate the hypothesis that sorption of polar substance vapours is chiefly a surface process. Polarity of hard coals, mostly associated with the presence of reactive oxygen groups (nitrogen and sulphuric groups), largely affects the sorption of polar substances and in a most characteristic manner controls the sorption of apolar ones. In the case of the latter, sorption is induced by the action of the dispersive interaction force between the coal surface and the sorbate's polar molecules. The pattern of sorption isotherms indicates that the presence of dual bond affects the sorbent-sorbate interactions and hence the sorption capacity of investigated coals.
