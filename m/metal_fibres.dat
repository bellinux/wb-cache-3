40|$|The {{introduction}} of fibre reinforced polymer composites into {{the wings and}} fuselages of the newest aircraft are changing the design and manufacturing approach. Composites provide greater freedom to designers who want to improve aircraft performance in an affordable way. In this quest, researchers are looking {{to the area of}} multifunctional structures, which represents a new manufacturing and integration methodology. Composite materials are ideally suited to achieve multifunctionality because the best features of different materials can be combined to form a new material that has a broad spectrum of desired properties. Along these lines, this thesis explores the idea of structural multifunctionality of reinforced polymer composites through the addition of <b>metal</b> <b>fibres.</b> In this way, a new family of hybrid composite materials may be produced. Through their unique inherent properties, <b>metal</b> <b>fibres</b> offer the opportunity to expand the design envelope to incorporate tuneable properties such as ductility and electrical conductivity, for example. In this undertaking, the research was conducted in three main phases: (i) to define the properties of the <b>metal</b> <b>fibres</b> themselves, (ii) {{to determine the extent to}} which these properties contribute to the overall mechanical behaviour of the composite, and (iii) to manipulate the properties of the fibres to add functionality to the composite. Out of the many metal types, stainless steel was chosen for its superior mechanical properties. Three forms of fibres were identified; fibre bundles, fine wires and meshes, and mechanically tested. It was found that there were variations in properties dependant on fibre diameter, treatment and extent of surface flaws. Improvements in metal fibre-matrix adhesion were also demonstrated to be possible using traditional sheet metal surface treatments such as anodising; however, these results are limited by fibre diameter. Below a certain diameter, such surface treatments become too aggressive resulting in damage to the fibres. Emerging non-aggressive surface techniques may provide an answer to this shortcoming, but require further development for this application. Changes in mechanical behaviour in terms of low velocity impact and flexure were demonstrated for the hybrid composites with <b>metal</b> <b>fibres</b> compared to those without. A complex interaction between the matrix and the <b>metal</b> <b>fibres</b> has been identified as the mechanism responsible. Through intelligent placement of the <b>metal</b> <b>fibres</b> in the hybrid composite to exploit this interaction, various improvements in mechanical behaviour can be realised. Finally, innovative applications for hybrid composites were investigated, exploiting the electrical and thermal properties of the <b>metal</b> <b>fibres.</b> The first was aimed towards aiding thermographic non-destructive evaluation, and the second to provide an integrated ice protection system concept, thereby opening up new applications for the novel material concept through adding functionality to the structure.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} numerical {{models are}} discussed for describing failure mechanisms in <b>fibre</b> <b>metal</b> laminates. <b>Fibre</b> <b>metal</b> laminates {{form a new}} class of materials which are considered for a possible application to the fuselage of future aircraft generations. The intensive experimental analyses of these materials are focused on the assessment of their residual strength and on the assessment of new design methods. To support the experimental analyses numerical models are used to describe cracking and delamination in <b>fibre</b> <b>metal</b> laminates. A special continuum element and a corresponding interface element are introduced. Furthermore, loading functions are applied which account for cracking and delamination.

40|$|The growing noise {{exposure}} of residents, {{due to a}} rising number of flights, causes significant impacts on physical health. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} reduce the noise emission of aircrafts. During take-off, the noise generated by the jet engines is dominating. One way to lower the noise emission of jet engines is to build an absorption silencer by using porous liners. Because of the high thermic and corrosive attacks as well as high fatigue loads, conventional absorbers cannot be used. A promising material is sintered <b>metal</b> <b>fibre</b> felts. This study investigates the suitability of <b>metal</b> <b>fibre</b> felts for the use as absorption material in silencers. The influences of pore morphology, absorption coefficient, determined with perpendicular sound incidence, as well as geometric parameters of the silencer to the damping are identified. To characterise the material, the parameters fibre diameter, porosity and thickness are determined using three-dimensional computer tomography images. The damping potential of absorption silencers is measured using an impedance tube, which was modified for transmission measurements. The essential parameter to describe the acoustic characteristics of porous materials is the flow resistivity. It depends on the size, shape and number of open pores in the material. Finally a connection between pore morphology, flow resistivity of the <b>metal</b> <b>fibre</b> felts and damping potential of the absorption silencer is given...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of microwave radiation as the heating {{source for the}} fabrication of glass foams reinforced with metallic fibres has been investigated. A soda-borosilicate glass powder was chosen for the matrix. The <b>metal</b> <b>fibres</b> were Hastelloy X fibres in volume concentration of 0, 2 and 10 %. The fibre diameter was 8 pm and length was 100 mum. The microwave heating process {{was carried out in}} a self constructed over-moded microwave applicator operating at the 2. 45 GHz ISM frequency. The glass foamed during processing leading to greater than 50 vol. % of spherical pores. The samples were characterised in terms of pore size and distribution, density, metal fibre distribution and interface characteristics. Adding stainless steel fibres to the glass composite prevented the glass from fracturing during processing and resulted in a more even distribution of finer pores. It is proposed that porosity formed during microwave heating as a consequence of localised glass matrix overheating in correspondence with the presence of <b>metal</b> <b>fibres,</b> caused by the preferential microwave absorption exhibited by the Hastelloy X fibres themselves and by the micro-regions of the matrix heated well above the glass softening temperature...|$|E

40|$|Airborne {{particulate}} emissions originating from the wear of pads and rotors of disc brakes contribute up to 50 % {{of the total}} road emissions in Europe. The wear process that takes place on a mesoscopic length scale in the contact interfaces between the pads and rotors {{can be explained by}} the creation and destruction of contact plateaus. Due to this complex contact situation, it is hard to predict how changes in the wear and material parameters of the pad friction material will affect the friction and wear emissions. This paper reports on an investigation of the effect of different parameters of the pad friction material on the coefficient of friction and wear emissions. A full factorial design is developed using a simplified version of a previously developed cellular automaton approach to investigate the effect of four factors on the coefficient of friction and wear emission.

As part of the work 6 different ceramic manufacturing technologies were examined by using selected ceramic raw materials (ZrO 2 und Al 2 O 3) in combination with textile semi-finished metal products. Different textile technologies like nonwovens production, weaving, knitting and embroidery were used to develop these semifinished products. Characterizations of metallic raw materials as well as semi-finished products were also subject of investigations. Experimental: during project work nonwoven structures of <b>metal</b> long <b>fibres</b> and <b>metal</b> short <b>fibres</b> were investigated. The developed nonwovens could be embedded Into ceramic matrix by using slip casting, freeze foaming and injection moulding. Combinations of ceramic and <b>metal</b> <b>fibre</b> material could especially be found using injection moulding when the nonwovens contributes to increase component strength not only by form-fitting, but also by chemical bonding in the boundary layer of ceramic and fibre.
