40|$|Anti-idiotype {{antisera}} {{were raised}} in syngeneic (BALB/c mice) and homologous (A/J mice) systems to study the cross-reactive idiotypes among <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> to PR 8 and B/Lee virus HA and the expression of these idiotypes during primary and secondary antiviral responses of BALB/c mice. Extensive idiotypic cross-reactivity was demonstrated among <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> specific for distinct antigenic determinants on PR 8 hemagglutinin (HA). The study of idiotypy of <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> against the same or overlapping antigenic determinants on B/Lee HA showed that these <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> may bear (a) a true individual idiotype not shared by other <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies,</b> (b) idiotypes shared by few <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies,</b> and (c) true cross-reactive idiotypes shared by all of these <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> In contrast, no cross-reactive idiotypes were detectable among <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> to B/Lee HA and <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> to PR 8 HA. Furthermore, we {{have shown that the}} anti-idiotype antibodies we used recognize determinants on <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> closely associated with antigenic binding sites. Finally, studies of the idiotypes expressed during primary and secondary antiviral HA responses of mice immunized with B/Lee virus revealed persistence of some idiotypes during both primary and secondary responses, whereas others were only expressed in the primary or secondary response...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> in {{medicine}} for in-vivo diagnostic methods and for therapeutic purposes will {{increase in the}} future. Although <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> possess a high specificity, the animal origin of these antibodies remains a problem. Repeated administration of animal <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> (in vivo) may induce the formation of human <b>antibodies</b> against these <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Because animal <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> are also used in laboratory assays (in vitro), the presence of human antibodies against these animal <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> may cause spuriously elevated or depressed results of these assays.

40|$|<b>Monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> may {{modulate}} immune and/or biological responses alone, or as {{carriers of}} specific agents. <b>Monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed against tumours may be indirectly cytotoxic by modulation of antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement-mediated cytotoxicity. <b>Monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed against certain tumour cell receptors may alter the biological behaviour of tumour cells such as blocking or downregulation of growth factors essential to tumour cell proliferation. <b>Monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed to certain receptors on host immune cells. {{such as the}} CD 3 receptor on T lymphocytes. may activate those cells and increase their cytotoxicity. Antitumour <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> can serve as carriers of interferons, interleukin- 2, tumour necrosis factor and other lymphokines and cytokines to modulate selectively the cytotoxic potential of immune cells {{in the vicinity of}} tumour cells.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between {{a panel of}} ten <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> and hemorrhagic enteritis virus, a group II avian adenovirus, was determined. The <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> reacted with all nine isolates of group II avian adenoviruses, but not with any of five types of group I avian adenoviruses. All ten <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> recognized antigenic determinants on the hexon protein of hemorrhagic enteritis virus when analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. They reacted only with the native hexon protein and not with protein denatured by sodium dodecyl sulfate or guanidine-HCl/urea treatment combined with reduction and carboxymethylation.

The <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> in group 1 neutralized hemorrhagic enteritis virus infectivity while the <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> of group 2 did not. Group 1 consisted of eight <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> which could be further subdivided into subgroups 1 A, 1 B, 1 C and 1 D.

5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E

In addition, we showed that these two <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> reacted to a 40 -amino-acid-fragment located close to the N-terminal region of genogroup II Norovirus. Similar reactivity was observed with the equivalent region of genogroup I Norovirus. In this study, we confirmed that the epitopes of the two <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> existed within an 11 -amino-acid peptide. To obtain an idea of the reactive ranges of the two <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> toward different strains of Norovirus, their reactivities were investigated using 16 types of peptide constructed according to the data in GenBank and 8 recombinant capsid proteins (7 whole capsid proteins and 1 short [80 -amino-acid] protein fragment).
