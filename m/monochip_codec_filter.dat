Development of PPEs is facilitated by a framework that provides the modular architecture, data types, and transformations common to most <b>codecs,</b> <b>filters,</b> transcoders etc. to facilitate the implementation of emerging compression standards and their integration into media processing applications.

40|$|Wyner-Ziv (WZ) video coding is a {{particular}} case of distributed video coding, the recent video coding paradigm based on the Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv theorems that exploits the source correlation at the decoder and not at the encoder as in predictive video coding. Although many improvements have been done over the last years, {{the performance of the}} state-of-the-art WZ video codecs still did not reach the performance of state-of-the-art predictive video codecs, especially for high and complex motion video content. This is also true in terms of subjective image quality mainly because of a considerable amount of blocking artefacts present in the decoded WZ video frames. This paper proposes an adaptive deblocking filter to improve both the subjective and objective qualities of the WZ frames in a transform domain WZ video <b>codec.</b> The proposed <b>filter</b> is an adaptation of the advanced deblocking filter defined in the H. 264 /AVC (advanced video coding) standard to a WZ video codec.

40|$|In video {{transmission}} at low bit rates {{the challenge is}} to compress the video with a minimal reduction of the percieved quality. The compression can be adapted to knowledge of which regions in the video sequence are of most interest to the viewer. Region of interest (ROI) video coding uses this information to control the allocation of bits to the background and the ROI. The aim is to increase the quality in the ROI {{at the expense of the}} quality in the background. In order for this to occur the typical content of an ROI for a particular application is firstly determined and the actual detection is performed based on this information. The allocation of bits can then be controlled based on the result of the detection. In this licenciate thesis existing methods to control bit allocation in ROI video coding are investigated. In particular pre-processing methods that are applied independently of the codec or standard. This makes it possible to apply the method directly to the video sequence without modifications to the <b>codec.</b> Three <b>filters</b> are proposed in this thesis based on previous approaches. The spatial filter that only modifies the background within a single frame and the temporal filter that uses information from the previous frame. These two filters are also combined into a spatio-temporal filter. The abilities of these filters to reduce the number of bits necessary to encode the background and to successfully re-allocate these to the ROI are investigated. In addition the computational compexities of the algorithms are analysed. The theoretical analysis is verified by quantitative tests. These include measuring the quality using both the PSNR of the ROI and the border of the background, as well as subjective tests with human test subjects and an analysis of motion vector statistics. The qualitative analysis shows that the spatio-temporal filter has a better coding efficiency than the other filters and it successfully re-allocates the bits from the foreground to the background. The spatio-temporal filter gives an improvement in average PSNR in the ROI of more than 1. 32 dB or a reduction in bitrate of 31 % compared to the encoding of the original sequence. This result is similar to or slightly better than the spatial filter. However, the spatio-temporal filter has a better performance, since its computational complexity is lower than that of the spatial filter...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{quantify}} the circuit complexity and mean circuit speed of linearly quantized straight PCM video encoding techniques. Any significant reduction in circuit complexity (i. e. the number of active and passive devices to be integrated) is considered important since this determines: chip area and yield if the encoder is to be fully integrated. Analysis indicates that {{the complexity of the}} more highly developed straight PCM video encoders can be reduced by typically a factor 3 using either non-programmed sequential encoding, pulse width modulator encoding or programmed sequential encoding (closed loop successive approximation). The encoder studied in this work is an 8 -bit pulse width modulator video encoder using a 2 -step production line technique and a detailed design procedure for a prototype encoder is given. This encoder is considered to achieve 7 -bit resolution at a sampling rate of 13. 3 MHZ. A mathematical model of the encoder-decoder system is developed for numerical evaluation of the effect of encoder errors and white Gaussian noise upon a coded and decoded video signal. A triangular wave test is applied to examine the effect of encoder errors upon the statio transfer characteristic of the encoder. Dynamic errors are investigated by simulating colour subcarrier at the model input and observing the phase and gain errors at the <b>filtered</b> <b>codec</b> output. Using differential phase and gain, an attempt {{is made to}} determine a circuit design and alignment criterion such that most practical codecs will fall within specific bounds on these parameters (taken as ¬± 6 ¬∞ and ¬± 6 % respective 1 y). In the absense of dither, Monte Carlo analysis indicates that the maximum voltage error incurred by each encoder error source should have a high probability (95 %) of being less than a half quantum if 85 - 90 % of codecs measured are to fall within the above bounds. If white Gaussian noise is used as a simple dither signal then the probability of a codec falling within the above bounds may increase to about 95 %. Improvements to the encoder are discussed, including several automatic error correction techniques which combat instrumental errors and give a more robust PWM encoder. Also, by predetermining the most significant bit for each set of 4 coded bits it is possible to halve the encoder clock frequency (to 133 MHZ) without significantly changing the encoder complexity...|$|R
