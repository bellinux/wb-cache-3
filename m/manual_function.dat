40|$|This study {{systematically}} {{reviewed the}} clinical and {{psychometric properties of}} <b>manual</b> <b>function</b> outcome measures for children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) aged 3 - 18 years. Three electronic databases were searched to identify <b>manual</b> <b>function</b> tools at the ICF-CY body function, activity and participation level used in children with DCD. Study selection and data extraction was conducted by two blind assessors according to the CanChild Outcome Measures Rating Form. Nineteen clinical tests (seven fine hand use tools and 12 handwriting measures), three naturalistic observations and six questionnaires were identified. The fine-motor subdomain of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency- 2 and the Functional Strength Measurement, with adequate reliability and validity properties, might be useful for <b>manual</b> <b>function</b> capacity assessment. The Systematic Detection of Writing Problems (SOS) and the Detailed Assessment of Speed of Handwriting (DASH) could be adopted for handwriting assessment, respectively from 6 and 9 years old. Naturalistic observations and questionnaires, whose psychometric properties have been investigated into limited extent, offer {{an assessment of the}} daily performances. This review shows that a combination of different tools is needed for a comprehensive assessment of <b>manual</b> <b>function</b> in children with DCD including the three levels of the ICF-CY. Further investigation of psychometric properties of those tools in children with DCD is warranted.

[Purpose] This {{observational}} study provides a retrospective description {{of changes in}} motor func-tion of a 10 year old child who suffered from motor weakness caused by Moyamoya disease (MMD) over an ap-proximately 3 year follow-up observation period. [Methods] The child was diagnosed as MMD due to multifocal encephalomalacia in both frontal and parietal cortices. After the ischemic attack, the child received physical therapy the based on stroke rehabilitation, including muscle strengthening exercises, training of functional activity/ADL, and neurodevelopmental treatment. [Results] The child’s MRI showed areas of ischemic infarction in both the frontal and parietal lobes. Steno-occlusive findings for both the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery were observed on cerebral angiography. Regarding changes of motor function during the three-year follow-up, significant improvements, in the Motricity index, Modified Brunnstrom Classification, <b>manual</b> <b>function</b> test, and functional ambulatory category were observed. [Conclusion] The basic motor function and functional abilities of the child showed improvement with conservative treatment over approximately three years.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: the {{identification}} of Zika virus (ZikV) in the amniotic fluid, in the placenta and in newborns' brains suggests a neurotropism of this agent in the brain development, resulting in neuro-psycho-motor alterations. Thus, this present study reports the assessment of children diagnosed by a congenital infection, presumably by ZikV, followed-up at the Rehabilitation Center Prof. Ruy Neves Baptist at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP). Description: as proposed by the Ministry of Health, the following instruments were {{used to evaluate the}} neuro-motor functions of four children with microcephaly aged between three and four months: The Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP); the functional vision assessment; the <b>manual</b> <b>function</b> scale development; and the clinical evaluation protocol on pediatric dysphagia (PAD-PED). Discussion: the children evaluated presented atypical motor performance, muscle tone and spontaneous motricity which encompass the symmetry and the motion range of the upper and lower limbs proven to be altered. The functional vision showed alterations which can cause limitations in the performance of functional activities and the learning process.

40|$|Many {{therapeutic}} {{interventions for}} {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) using neurotrophic factors have focused on reducing the area damaged by secondary, post-injury degeneration, to promote functional recovery. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which is a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes and a mediator of the inflammatory responses to tissue injury, was recently highlighted as a potent neurotrophic factor in the central nervous system. We previously reported that introducing exogenous HGF into the injured rodent spinal cord using a herpes simplex virus- 1 vector significantly reduces the area of damaged tissue and promotes functional recovery. However, that study did not examine the therapeutic effects of administering HGF after injury, {{which is the most}} critical issue for clinical application. To translate this strategy to human treatment, we induced a contusive cervical SCI in the common marmoset, a primate, and then administered recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) intrathecally. Motor function was assessed using an original open field scoring system focusing on <b>manual</b> <b>function,</b> including reach-and-grasp performance and hand placement in walking. The intrathecal rhHGF preserved the corticospinal fibers and myelinated areas, thereby promoting functional recovery.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{measured}} %isolation and investigated {{whether it}} shows {{a difference between the}} presence and absence of wrist joint restriction, as well as changes in muscle activity patterns. [Methods] Twenty subjects performed upper extremity functional movement in the <b>Manual</b> <b>Function</b> Test (MFT) with and without wrist restriction, and the muscle activities of the trapezius, middle deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, extensor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi radialis were recorded. When there were differences in muscle activation, %isolation was implemented and the changes in the muscle activity patterns were noted. [Results] In the grasping and pinching tasks, there was a significant increase in %isolation of the upper trapezius and a significant decrease in %isolation of the extensor carpi radialis. Carrying a cube task, %isolation of the upper trapezius and middle deltoid signifi-cantly increased, whereas %isolation of the triceps brachii and extensor carpi radialis significantly decreased.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the factors which affect the motor evoked potential (MEP) responsiveness and parameters {{and to find}} {{the correlation between the}} function of the upper extremities and the combined study of MEP with a diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) in patients with stroke. Methods A retrospective study design was used by analyzing medical records and neuroimaging data of 70 stroke patients who underwent a MEP test between June 2011 and March 2013. MEP parameters which were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle were the resting motor threshold, latency, amplitude, and their ratios. Functional variables, Brunnstrom stage of hand, upper extremity subscore of Fugl-Meyer assessment, <b>Manual</b> <b>Function</b> Test, and the Korean version of Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) were collected together with the biographical and neurological data. The DTT parameters were fiber number, fractional anisotropy value and their ratios of affected corticospinal tract.

Results Functional and DTT variables were significantly different between MEP-P and MEP-N groups (p< 0. 001). Among the MEP-P group, the amplitude ratio (unaffected/affected) was significantly correlated with the Brunnstrom stage of hand (r=- 0. 427, p= 0. 013), K-MBI (r=- 0. 380, p= 0. 029) and the time post-onset (r=- 0. 401, p= 0. 021).
