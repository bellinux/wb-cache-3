The improvements included an enlarged film department; a film editing and cleaning equipment; a larger <b>master</b> <b>control</b> with four video transfer machines; a new telecine room with caption scanner and slide drums; as well as an expansion of the administration and staff offices which also included new offices and a boardroom.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its release, Q*bert inspired many other games with similar concepts. The magazines Video Games and Computer Games both commented on the trend with features about Q*bert-like games in 1984. They listed Mr. Cool by Sierra On-Line, Frostbite by Activision, Q-Bopper by Accelerated Software, Juice by Tronix, Quick Step by Imagic, Flip & Flop and Boing by First Star Software, Pharaoh's Pyramid by <b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> Software, Pogo Joe by Screenplay, Rabbit Transit by Starpath, as games which had been inspired by Q*bert. Further titles that {{have been identified as}} Q*bert-like games include J-bird by Orion Software, Cubit by Micromax, and in the UK Pogo by Ocean, Spellbound by Beyond, Hubert by Blaby Computer Games and Vector Hopper by Kristof Tuts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} operation of a coarse-fine teleoperation system with bilateral force reflection. The system uses a 6 -DOF magnetic levitation device (MLD) <b>master</b> to <b>control</b> a 6 -DOF fine-positioning MLD slave mounted on a 6 -DOF coarse positioner arm. Coarse-fine teleoperation expands the workspace of the slave MLD while retaining its frictionless characteristics, fine position resolution and high bandwidth. Several modes of operation are explored. In unilateral coarse-fine mode (UCF) the <b>master</b> <b>controls</b> the wrist position which in turn controls the coarse positioner. In <b>master</b> deadband rate <b>control</b> mode (MDRC) the <b>master</b> position <b>controls</b> the coarse positioner velocity while wrist position is used to reflect contact forces to the master. In symmetric bilateral control (SBC) mode the wrist and master servo to each other’s positions providing force reflection during fine manipulation. Operation of each system mode is investigated during a simple assembly task. I...|$|R

The music was picked by the AM operator prior to their shift. Some of those on air people were Dave Gordon, Mike Lynch, Steve Martak, Rich Elwood, Ted Woloshyn, Scott Cameron; any genre of music was open to airtime.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> {{unit was}} {{discontinued}} in 1985, the Slave controller, Loco Modules, and accessory modules were still available {{until the late}} 1980s. The system is still used today by many modellers, highlighted by the demand on such sites like eBay for {{the items in the}} second hand market. Despite being on the market for a short time, Zero 1 had the largest installed base among command control systems in the early 1980s in North America, according to a reader survey done by Model Railroader magazine.|$|E

WDAZ serves the northern half of the Fargo–Grand Forks market, while WDAY-TV serves the southern half. <b>Master</b> <b>control</b> and other internal operations are performed from WDAY-TV's studios on South 8th Street in Fargo.|$|E
25|$|Ownership of CFRN-TV {{changed in}} 1997, when Baton and Electrohome merged, with Baton {{assuming}} Electrohome's stations {{in exchange for}} Baton shares. In February 2000, Canadian telecommunications giant Bell Canada Enterprises, through its subsidiary Bell Globemedia, proposed to purchase CTV Inc. for $2.3 billion, the largest transaction in Canadian broadcasting. Later in March, the CTV board approved the deal, which required Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approval. The CRTC hearing was held in September and was approved on December 7. Also in 2000, <b>master</b> <b>control</b> for CFRN was relocated to the CTV Broadcast House at 80 Patina Rise Southwest in Calgary, home to sister station CFCN-TV.|$|E

25|$|In the 2000s, MTV {{launched}} MTV HD, a 1080i {{high definition}} simulcast feed of MTV. Until Viacom's main <b>master</b> <b>control</b> was upgraded in 2013, only the network's original series after 2010 (with some pre-2010 content) are broadcast in high definition, while music videos, despite being filmed for high definition presentation, {{were presented in}} 4:3 standard definition, forcing them into a windowboxing type of presentation; since that time all music videos are presented in HD when available, depending on director's preference. Jersey Shore, despite being shot with widescreen HD cameras, is also presented with SD windowboxing.

The Indian SBAS system has been given an acronym GAGAN – GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation. A national plan for satellite navigation including implementation of Technology Demonstration System (TDS) over the Indian air space as a proof of concept has been prepared jointly by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and ISRO. TDS was successfully completed during 2007 by installing eight Indian Reference Stations (INRESs) at eight Indian airports and linked to the <b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> Centre (MCC) located near Bangalore.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Burroughs Corporation {{introduced}} the B5000 with the MCP, (<b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> Program) operating system. The B5000 was a stack machine designed to exclusively support high-level languages with no machine language or assembler, {{and indeed the}} MCP was the first OS to be written exclusively in a high-level language ESPOL, a dialect of ALGOL. MCP also introduced many other ground-breaking innovations, such as being the first commercial implementation of virtual memory. During development of the AS/400, IBM made an approach to Burroughs to license MCP to run on the AS/400 hardware. This proposal was declined by Burroughs management to protect its existing hardware production. MCP is still in use today in the Unisys ClearPath/MCP line of computers.|$|E
