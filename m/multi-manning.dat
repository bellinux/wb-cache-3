40|$|<b>Multi-manned</b> {{assembly}} line balancing problems are usually occurred in plants producing large-sized high-volume {{products such as}} automobiles and trucks. In this paper, a cost- oriented objective function is presented for a <b>multi-manned</b> {{assembly line}} balancing problem. This kind of objective function {{may be used to}} balance final assembly lines of products in which manufacturing process is very labor intensive. A mixed-integer mathematical programming model is proposed to solve the problem optimally. The proposed formulation has been used to solve some small size problems by considering both time-oriented and cost-oriented objective functions. The experiments show that, given the same precedence graph of <b>multi-manned</b> assembly line with a same cycle time, two different optimal solutions can be actually found when switching from time-oriented to cost-oriented objective functions, and vice versa. This difficulty increases the complexity of the cost-oriented <b>multi-manned</b> assembly line balancing problems with respect to the <b>multi-manned</b> assembly line balancing problems addressed in the literature...|$|R

40|$|In a <b>multi-manned</b> {{assembly}} line, {{tasks of}} the same workpiece can be executed simultaneously by different workers working in the same station. This line has significant advantages over a simple assembly line such as shorter line length, less work-in-process, smaller installation space, and less product flow time. In many realistic line balancing situations, there are usually more than one objective conflicting with each other. This paper presents a preemptive goal programming model and some heuristic methods based on variable neighborhood search approach for multi-objective assembly line balancing problems with <b>multi-manned</b> stations. Three different objectives are considered, minimizing {{the total number of}} <b>multi-manned</b> stations as the primary objective, minimizing the total number of workers as the secondary objective, and smoothing the number of workers at stations as the tertiary objective.

40|$|<b>Multi-manned</b> {{assembly}} lines are often designed to produce big-sized products, such as automobiles and trucks. In {{this type of}} production lines, there are <b>multi-manned</b> workstations {{where a group of}} workers simultaneously performs different operations on the same individual product. One of the problems, that managers of such production lines usually encounter, is to produce the optimal number of items using a fixed number of workstations, without adding new ones. In this paper, such a class of problems, namely, the <b>multi-manned</b> assembly line balancing problem is addressed, with the objective of minimising the cycle time. A mixed-integer mathematical programming formulation is proposed for the considered problem. This model has the primary objective of minimising the cycle time for a given number of workstations and the secondary objective of minimising the total number of workers. Since the addressed problem is NP-hard, two meta-heuristic approaches based on the simulated annealing algorithm have been developed: ISA and DSA. ISA solves the problem indirectly while DSA solves it directly. The performance of the two algorithms are tested and compared on a set of test problems taken from the literature. The results show that DSA outperforms ISA in term of solution quality and computational time...|$|R
