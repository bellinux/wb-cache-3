25|$|Negotiations {{towards the}} {{establishment}} of an international condominium over the continent first began in 1948, involving the 7 claimant powers (Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France, Norway, Chile and Argentina) and the US. This attempt was aimed at excluding the Soviet Union from the affairs of the continent and rapidly fell apart when the USSR declared an interest in the region, refused to recognize any claims of sovereignty and reserved the right to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> claims in 1950.|$|E

WPD recommended that AWPD be limited to tactical planning, and that the Air Staff, in a subordinate role, should advise the WPD rather than <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> operational or strategic plans. George pushed for greater autonomy—he wished to prepare all plans for all air operations.|$|E

In May 2006, a Gallup {{poll found that}} 50% of Americans would favor amending the federal Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, while 47% were opposed, and 3% were undecided or did not respond. An ABC News poll that year found that 42% of Americans supported amending the U.S. Constitution, banning same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|Understanding of {{epistasis}} {{has changed}} considerably through {{the history of}} genetics and so too has {{the use of the}} term. In early models of natural selection devised in the early 20th century, each gene was considered to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> characteristic contribution to fitness, against an average background of other genes. Some introductory courses still teach population genetics this way. Because of the way that the science of population genetics was developed, evolutionary geneticists have tended to think of epistasis as the exception. However, in general, the expression of any one allele depends in a complicated way on many other alleles.|$|E
25|$|Both of the {{metabolic}} breakdown pathways shown for GHB can run in either direction, {{depending on the}} concentrations of the substances involved, so the body can <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> GHB either from GABA or from succinic semialdehyde. Under normal physiological conditions, the concentration of GHB in the body is rather low, and the pathways would run in the reverse direction to what is shown here to produce endogenous GHB. However, when GHB is consumed for recreational or health promotion purposes, its concentration in the body {{is much higher than}} normal, which changes the enzyme kinetics so that these pathways operate to metabolise GHB rather than producing it.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1988 Seoul Olympics, most of {{the luxury}} car market of South Korea was held by Daewoo Motors and its Royale Series. From October 1978, Hyundai built its luxury car, Ford Granada Mark II, in Korea but the {{competition}} with Daewoo Royale seemed that it already had ended. As Hyundai was looking to enter the luxury car market, it tried to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> luxury car. In the face of tough competition from Daewoo Motors' much more powerful brand, Hyundai abandoned the attempt to design its own luxury car, and instead borrowed the platform, technology, and internal configuration from Mitsubishi Motors to create the first Hyundai Grandeur.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{only five}} plastic {{materials}} {{continued to be}} widely used in the capacitor industry as films for capacitors: PET, PEN, PP, PPS and PTFE. Other plastic materials {{are no longer in}} common use, either because they are no longer manufactured, or they have been replaced with better materials. Even the long-time manufactured polystyrene (PS) and polycarbonate (PC) film capacitors have been largely replaced by the previously-mentioned film types, though at least one PC capacitor manufacturer retains the ability to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> films from raw polycarbonate feedstock. The less-common plastic films are described briefly here, since they are still encountered in older designs, and are still available from some suppliers.|$|E

It is the largest municipal water supplier in the country and enjoys operational autonomy and financial independence. As a separate entity from the municipal government it can <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> decisions on how to invest revenues it has collected, and such decisions are not directly subject to interference from the municipality. It receives no subsidies and makes no payments to the municipality itself. As a municipal undertaking, DMAE enjoys tax-exempt status, which allows it to keep water prices lower.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} days of the Polaris program, American {{senators}} and naval officers suggested that the United Kingdom might use Polaris. In 1957 Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh Burke and First Sea Lord Louis Mountbatten began corresponding on the project. After the cancellations of the Blue Streak and Skybolt missiles in the 1960s, under the 1962 Nassau Agreement that emerged from meetings between Harold Macmillan and John F. Kennedy, the United States would supply Britain with Polaris missiles, launch tubes, ReBs, and the fire-control systems. Britain would <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> warheads and initially proposed to build five ballistic missile submarines, later reduced to four by the incoming Labour government of Harold Wilson, with 16 missiles to be carried on each boat. The Polaris Sales Agreement was signed on April 6, 1963.|$|E
25|$|The Aosta Valley is {{nowadays}} {{the only}} {{region of the}} Franco-Provençal area where this language is still widely spoken as native by all age ranges of the population. Several events have combined to stabilize the language (Valdôtain dialect) in this region since 1948. An {{amendment to the constitution}} of Italy changed the status of the former province to an autonomous region which gives the Aosta Valley special powers to <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> decisions. Residents saw the region's economy expand and the population increase from 1951 to 1991, which encouraged them to stay and continue long-held traditions. The language is now explicitly protected by an Italian presidential decree and a federal law. Further, a regional law passed by the government in Aosta requires educators to promote knowledge of Franco-Provençal language and culture in the school curriculum. Several cultural groups, libraries, and theatre companies are fostering a sense of ethnic pride with their active use of the Valdôtain dialect as well (EUROPA, 2005).|$|E
25|$|In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies, acting {{through the}} Second Continental Congress, {{declared}} political independence from Great Britain during the American Revolution. The new states, though independent {{of each other}} as nation states, recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British. Desiring to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy, Congress negotiated the Articles of Confederation to establish an alliance between the states. As a central authority, Congress under the Articles was without any legislative power; it could <b>make</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, nor any taxes or local commercial regulations enforceable upon citizens. This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned {{with respect to the}} royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire. Out from under any monarchy, the states assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress, while severally lodging the rest within their own respective state governments. Only after all the states agreed to a resolution settling competing western land claims did the Articles take effect on March 1, 1781, when Maryland became the final state to ratify them.|$|E
