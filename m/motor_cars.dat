5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, sleet locomotives, pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars.</b> Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|E
5|$|When {{delivery}} of C67 stock began in 1977, {{two pairs of}} CO/CP stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were used as pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> to shunt the new stock at Ruislip Depot, and to marshall the scrap stock displaced by the new units. The C77 stock could be driven under its own power to Hammersmith Depot, as it was commissioned at Ruislip. The D78 stock was different, in that delivery was still to Ruislip, but the commissioning took place at Ealing Common Depot, and therefore pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were needed to transfer the stock. Two pairs of CO/CP stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were allocated {{to do this in}} 1979, with a further three pairs joining them in 1980. New trains were transferred with a pilot motor car at each end, as were trains that were withdrawn for scrapping. The pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> carried large stencils at both ends, so that they would not accidentally be scrapped until their duties were complete. Three pairs of R stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were used as pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> after the R stock was scrapped. Most of the surface stock pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were scrapped when the deliveries were complete, although one each of the CO/CP and R stock cars have been privately preserved.|$|E
5|$|Four Hungarian-built gate stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> {{were used}} as ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> and were {{numbered}} L13 to L16. The final one was stored in 1955, {{in the hope that}} it would be restored and preserved, but by 1960, the project appeared to be too costly, and so the gate end of the car was cut off, {{and the rest of it}} was scrapped. After refurbishment, the gate was displayed at the London Transport Museum. A further four Hungarian <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> from the Piccadilly line {{were used as}} pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> during the reconstruction of the Hampstead line in 1922, and were numbered L17 to L20. Once a spur between the Hampstead line and the Piccadilly line at Kings Cross station was opened on 27 March 1927, it became much easier to transfer ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> between lines. The 14 departmental vehicles which were operational in 1934 continued to be used until 1953, by which time their age made maintenance very difficult. They were replaced over the next two years and scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The next {{batch of}} ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were French-built gate stock cars, {{originally}} constructed in 1906, but converted {{in the early}} 1920s to run with the 1920 air-door stock. 20 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were converted, but were replaced by more modern cars in 1930. Although 12 of the displaced cars were scrapped, six were kept as ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> becoming numbers L24 to L29 in the service fleet. The final two were further converted to run as single cars on the Aldwych shuttle. During the Second World War they were used as pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> for refreshment trains on the Piccadilly line, which supplied food to people sleeping on the stations {{to escape from the}} bombing of the city. They returned to the Aldwych shuttle between 1946 and 1949, but were again used as pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> after that, transferring cars between the engineering works at Acton and various depots. They were both coupled to a flat wagon for a period, and were used to transfer stores from Acton Works to Northfields depot, and also took stores to Croxley Green and Queens Park depots on the Bakerloo line.|$|E
5|$|While single {{passenger}} cars were sometimes {{moved around the}} system, either between depots or to Acton Works, these movements were infrequent, {{and when they were}} necessary, standard stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> borrowed from the passenger fleet were normally used. Following the introduction of the 1959 passenger stock, single cars and parts of units were moved around much more frequently, and normal passenger <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> could not be used to perform this task, as the equipment they needed to operate was spread around the unit, rather than confined to the motor car. Eight Standard Stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> dating from 1927 and 1934, were therefore allocated as pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars.</b> In 1967, they were painted maroon, numbered L130 to L137, and became part of the ballast motor fleet. Four were withdrawn in 1971 without performing this work, however. Following withdrawal, L137 was shipped to the Isle of Wight, to replace a car on the Island Line which had been damaged. The remaining four cars worked as two pairs, and were still working as pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> in 1987, but had been withdrawn by 1993.|$|E

5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars.</b> The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 fifty {{motor car}} bodies {{were ordered to}} allow some of the {{original}} 1904–05 car bodies to be scrapped. From 1926 two stock pools were created. Main line trains were formed from 101 new <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> supplemented by <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> rebuilt from the steel bodied cars originally constructed in 1910–14 and 1923, and trailers modified from the original wooden bodied cars. A small pool of unmodified 'local stock' worked the shuttles from Acton Town to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow.|$|E
5|$|The first ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were former trailer cars {{built for}} the Central London Railway in 1900, which were {{converted}} to <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> for trials of the first multiple system {{to be used in}} Britain, and were retained for departmental use after 1903. These were followed by French and Hungarian Gate stock cars, built in 1906, which were converted in the 1920s and 1930s. The next batch consisted on 14 standard stock cars converted in 1953. Rolling stock reorganisation and replacement in the 1970s on the District and Metropolitan lines resulted in a number of surface stock cars being used for pilot motor duties. Subsequently <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> of 1938 stock and 1960 stock were used for this purpose, and complete 4-car units of 1962 stock.|$|E
50|$|The track layout {{within the}} station {{does not allow}} for the usual method of running the <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> round the trailer ready for the return journey. Instead the trailer car is {{detached}} from the <b>motor</b> <b>car,</b> and the <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> crosses over to the opposing track.

5|$|The {{first order}} for {{electric}} multiple units was placed with Metropolitan Amalgamated in 1902 for 50 trailers and 20 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> with Westinghouse equipment, which ran as 6-car trains. First and third class accommodation was provided in open saloons, second class being {{withdrawn from the}} Met. Access was at the ends via open lattice gates and the units were modified {{so that they could}} run off-peak as 3-car units. For the joint Hammersmith & City line service, the Met and the GWR purchased 20 × 6-cars trains with Thomson-Houston equipment. In 1904, a further order was placed by the Met for 36 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 62 trailers with an option for another 20 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 40 trailers. Problems with the Westinghouse equipment led to Thomson-Houston equipment being specified when the option was taken up and more powerful motors being fitted. Before 1918, the <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> with the more powerful motors were used on the circle with three trailers. The open lattice gates were seen as a problem when working above ground and all of the cars had gates replaced with vestibules by 1907. Having access only through the two end doors became a problem on the busy circle and centre sliding doors were fitted from 1911.|$|E
5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury bogie {{stock was}} {{converted}} into electric multiple units. Some Dreadnought carriages were used with electric <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> although two-thirds remained in use as locomotive hauled stock on the extension line.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were {{withdrawn from}} passenger service, and {{were converted to}} ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> with the final one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and so rather than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|E

5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> was blue, and that of the two centre <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E
5|$|The London Underground {{has also}} owned several {{departmental}} self-powered vehicles designed for other duties.

Three Plasser & Theurer track tamping machines were purchased in 1980, and two Unimog road-rail vehicles were obtained in 1983 and 1986, for use as depot shunters.|$|E
5|$|Between 1927 and 1933 {{multiple}} unit compartment stock {{was built by}} the Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon and Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for services from Baker Street and the City to Watford and Rickmansworth. The first order was only for motor cars; half had Westinghouse brakes, Metro-Vickers control systems and four MV153 motors; they replaced the <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> working with bogie stock trailers. The rest of the <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> had the same motor equipment but used vacuum brakes, and worked with converted 1920/23 Dreadnought carriages to form 'MV' units. In 1929, 'MW' stock was ordered, 30 motor coaches and 25 trailers similar to the 'MV' units, but with Westinghouse brakes. A further batch of 'MW' stock was ordered in 1931, this time from the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Co. This was to make seven 8-coach trains, and included additional trailers to increase {{the length of the}} previous 'MW' batch trains to eight coaches. These had GEC WT545 motors, and although designed to work in multiple with the MV153, this did not work well in practice. After the Met became part of London Underground, the MV stock was fitted with Westinghouse brakes and the cars with GEC motors were re-geared to allow them to work in multiple with the MV153-motored cars. In 1938, nine 8-coach and ten 6-coach MW units were re-designated T Stock. A trailer coach built in 1904/5 is stored at London Transport Museum's Acton Depot, although it has been badly damaged by fire, and the Spa Valley Railway is home to two T stock coaches.|$|E
