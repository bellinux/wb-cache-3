The metal was deposited by reacting an aqueous solution of [Pd(NH 3) 4] 2 + complexes with the support, the template of which was partially extracted. The evolution of the support characteristics was monitored at different steps of preparation using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 physisorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Particle size and metal accessibility were evaluated combining information from XRD line broadening, TEM observations, UV–visible spectra and H 2 uptakes. The PdO reducibility was investigated using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). In the templated mesoporous aluminosilicate, 27 Al-MAS-NMR revealed that Al 3 + occupied mostly tetrahedral sites, a fraction of which adopted an octahedral environment {{in the presence of}} palladium. According to the light-off curves, the catalytic methane oxidation activity is enhanced in pure silica supports where partial pore wall collapse has occurred.

40|$|A new {{formation}} {{scenario for}} TiC and Fe,Ni-metal inclusions in presolar graphite grains of supernova origin is described. The mineralogy and chemistry require condensation of (Fe,Ni) -titanides from Fe, Ni, and Ti-rich gaseous ejecta, subsequent carburization to make TiC and <b>metal,</b> and <b>encapsulation</b> into graphite. Titanides only condense if Si is depleted relative to heavier mass elements, which requires alpha-rich freeze-out {{and a deep}} mass-cut for the supernova ejecta. This Si-poor core material must remain unmixed with other supernova zones until the titanides condensed. This {{can be accomplished by}} transport of core ejecta in bipolar jets through the major expanding supernova zone ejecta. If the jets stall in regions dominated by C-rich ejecta such as C-He zone where graphite condenses, thermochemically favored in situ carburization of the titanides - either before or during encapsulation into condensing graphite - leads to a TiC and metal composite. This scenario agrees with theoretical models and observations of asymmetric core collapse in supernovae that are associated with bipolar jets loaded with iron-peak elements.

40|$|Supported metal {{catalysts}} play {{a central}} role in the modern chemical industry but often exhibit poor on-stream stability. The strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) offers a route to control the structural properties of supported metals and, hence, their reactivity and stability. Conventional wisdom holds that supported Au cannot manifest a classical SMSI, which is characterized by reversible <b>metal</b> <b>encapsulation</b> by the support upon high-temperature redox treatments. We demonstrate a classical SMSI for Au/TiO 2, evidenced by suppression of CO adsorption, electron transfer from TiO 2 to Au nanoparticles, and gold encapsulation by a TiOx overlayer following high-temperature reduction (reversed by subsequent oxidation), akin to that observed for titania-supported platinum group metals. In the SMSI state, Au/TiO 2 exhibits markedly improved stability toward CO oxidation. The SMSI extends to Au supported over other reducible oxides (Fe 3 O 4 and CeO 2) and other group IB metals (Cu and Ag) over titania.

This intimate mechanism cannot be seen in experiment, yet it can be investigated through comprehensive molecular dynamics. We systematically vary the adhesion strength (W[sub ad]) of the graphitic cap to the catalyst and temperature T (and C diffusion rate). Observations allow us to build a statistically representative map of CNT nucleation and define the conditions for growth or <b>metal</b> <b>encapsulation</b> in a fullerene-shell (catalyst poisoning). It shows clearly that weak W[sub ad], sufficient thermal kinetic energy (high T) or fast C diffusion favor the CNT nucleation.

Gas-phase tetramethyltin was used as a precursor for tin dioxide (SnO 2). Metal additives were introduced to the SnO 2 synthesis system using solid-phase metal acetates as the precursors. The physical and chemical properties of the metal acetate reactants, the combustion environment and the nanocomposite materials were characterized in order to clarify the reaction processes important during synthesis of nanocomposite materials from these categories of mixed-phase reactants. X-ray diffractometry was used to determine composition and the crystalline structure of reactant and product materials. Scanning and trans-mission electron microscopy were used to examine particle morphology of reactant and product materials, and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy was used for elemental speciation.

The employment of new in situ techniques, mainly high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (HPSTM) and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) allows the determination of the surface structure and chemical states under reaction conditions. HPSTM has identified the importance of both adsorbate mobility to catalytic turnovers and the metal substrate reconstruction driven by gaseous reactants such as CO and O- 2. APXPS is able to monitor both reacting species at catalyst surfaces and the oxidation state of the catalyst while it is being exposed to gases.

Fired coal fly ash, a solid by-product that is produced in power plants worldwide in million of tonnes, has attracted researchers' interest. In this work, fly ash was shaped into pellets that have diameter in-between 3 - 8 mm, high relative porosity and very good mechanical strength. The pellets were used in adsorption experiments {{for the removal of}} copper and cadmium ions from aqueous solutions. The effect of agitation rate, equilibration time, pH of solution and initial metal concentration were studied. The adsorption of both cations follows pseudo-second order kinetics reaching equilibrium after an equilibration time of 72 h. The experimental results for copper and cadmium adsorption fit well to a Langmuirian type isotherm. The calculated adsorption capacities of pellets for copper and cadmium were 20. 92 and 18. 98 mg/g, respectively. Desorption experiments were performed in several extraction media. The results showed that both metals were desorbed substantially from pellets under acidic solutions. For this reason, metal saturated pellets were encapsulated in concrete blocks synthesized from cement and raw pulverized fly ash in order to avoid metal desorption. The heavy <b>metals</b> immobilization after <b>encapsulation</b> in concrete blocks was tested through desorption tests in several aqueous media. The results showed that after 2 months in acidic media with pH 2. 88 and 4. 98 neither copper nor cadmium were desorbed thus indicating excellent stabilization of heavy metals in the concrete matrix. As a conclusion, the results showed that fly ash shaped into pellets could be considered as a potential adsorbent for the removal of copper and cadmium from wastewaters. Moreover, the paper proposes an efficient and simple stabilization process of the utilized adsorbents thus guarantying their safe disposal in industrial landfills and eliminating the risk of pollution for groundwater and other natural water receivers.

É importante ressaltar que a estrutura utilizada como unidade {{fundamental}} para tais fios, que consiste de um prisma formado por duas faces hexagonais de silício com um metal de transição em seu centro, já foi sintetizada em trabalho experimental[1]. Os resultados já obtidos mostram a existência de dois mínimos de energia distintos, com geometrias que diferem pelo encadeamento das unidades hexagonais ao longo do fio, para alguns dos elementos encapsulados, tais como Nb, Mo, Tc, Hf, W, Re, Os, enquanto para os demais metais das séries 4 d e 5 d um só mínimo é obtido. Pela estrutura de bandas desses fios, observamos um comportamento metálico para todos os elementos. Porém, alguns deles (Zr, Nb, Ta, Re) mostraram sofrer instabilidade de Peierls, o que provoca aberturas de gap variando entre 0. 03 eV (Ta) e 0. 21 eV (Zr). In this work, we employ an ab initiomethodology to studymonomers, dimers and nanowires {{of silicon}} clusters containing encapsulated transition <b>metals.</b> The <b>encapsulation</b> of transition <b>metals</b> of 4 d and 5 d series {{leads to the}} stabilization of clusters with a structure consisting of atwelve-atom hexagonal prism, formed by two hexagonal faces of silicon atoms with a transition metal in its center, whose chemical formula is denoted M@Si 12 (where M is the metal atom), wich was synthesized in an ealier experimental work. In general, we observe trends in structural properties of these systems, strongly related to the filling of the metal d orbitals. In the case of monomers, we observe that structures withgreater stability are those with metals that have semi-filled d shells. The greater stability of the monomers in these cases, suggests a lower propensity to form extended structures such as nanowires, which is the behavior that we observed for the wires, which have lower bindingenergies when such metals are encapsulated along the wire axis. We also study nanowires formed from monomers and dimers used as fundamental units of single and double period wires, respectively. The single-period wires basically display two types of structures, which we classify as ZZPS {{in the case of}} two types of single-period zigzaglikedistortion of the monomer units, and regular, where the monomer unti remains with its geometry essentially unaltered.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{kinetic analysis}} of <b>metal</b> <b>encapsulation</b> by a de novo-designed protein is described. The kinetic mechanism of Hg(II) encapsulation in the three-stranded coiled coil {{formed by the}} peptide CH 3 CO-G LKALEEK CKALEEK LKALEEK G-NH 2 (Baby L 9 C) is derived by global analysis. The mechanism involves rapid initial collapse of two peptides by Hg(II) forming Hg(Baby L 9 C-H) 2 with a linear thiolato Hg(II) bound to the cysteine sulfur atoms. Here, Baby L 9 C-H denotes Baby L 9 C with the cysteine thiol deprotonated. Addition of the third peptide, forming the three-stranded coiled coil, is the rate-determining step and results in an intermediate state involving two separate species. One of the species, termed the properly folded intermediate, undergoes rapid deprotonation of the third cysteine thiol, yielding the desired three-stranded coiled coil with an encapsulated trigonal thiolato Hg(II). The other species, termed the misfolded intermediate, rearranges in an experimentally distinguishable step to the properly folded intermediate. The order of the reaction involving {{the addition of the}} third peptide with respect to the concentration of Baby L 9 C indicates that addition of the third helix only occurs through reaction of Hg(Baby L 9 C-H) 2 and Baby L 9 C that is unassociated with a coiled coil. Temperature dependence of the reaction afforded activation parameters for both the addition of the third helix (ΔH‡ = 20 (2) kcal/mol; ΔS‡ = 40 (5) cal/mol K) and the rearrangement of the misfolded intermediate steps (ΔH‡ = 23 (2) kcal/mol; ΔS‡ = 27 (5) cal/mol K). The mechanism is discussed with regard to metalloprotein folding and metalloprotein design...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{human brain}} {{is filled with}} {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (liquor), which is produced in the ventricles. Normally the production and resorption are balanced. Patients suffering from normal pressure hydrocephalus produce more liquor as they resorb[1]. This leads to an increase of the intracranial pressure. This article describes a sensor transponder system to measure pressure in a ventricular drainage system (see Figure 1) which {{is connected to the}} human brain. It focuses on the development of an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with a micro machined pressure sensor as well as the principle of a wireless readout system using a handheld reader device. Methods As shown in Figure 2 the shunt sensor ASIC consists of six main building blocks: HF-front-end, digital part, EEPROM, biasing & voltage regulation, pressure sensor and readout with A/D-Converter. The pressure sensor was realized by surface micro-machined capacitive sensor elements. If sensors do not require continuous activity it is a good choice to use a transponder based approach. For the shunt sensor a low frequency transponder system was developed (Figure 3). Results The metal of the housing has a significant influence on the wireless transmission. To overcome the damping caused by the <b>metal</b> <b>encapsulation,</b> the handheld reader was designed with a high quality factor of the transmitter coil, to optimize the performance regarding reading distance and lifetime of the reader battery. The calibration of the nonlinear and temperature dependent output of the shunt sensor is performed in a temperature controlled pressure chamber. The typical calibration error is better than 0. 8 mmHg as depicted in Figure 4. Conclusion In corporation with the Christoph Miethke GmbH & Co KG a system was developed for wireless measurements of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the shunt. The system is approved for use as a long-term implant in humans...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Leaky-waves have been a topic of increasing interest in the last years, with diverse practical applications in many different engineering fields. From periodic, FSS, EBG or even metamaterial leaky-wave based antennas to waveguide filters and higher efficiency energy guiding, they all share a common base structure: a travelling-wave propagating within a <b>metal</b> <b>encapsulation,</b> that can be open or closed, and altered by a planar metallization of periodic nature, from which the energy may radiate. Due {{to the fact that}} these antennas are usually electrically large and the periodic printed circuit requires a certain grade of complexity, 3 D commercial software is prohibitively time consuming. Also, the homebrew methods developed up to this day are either not rigorous and accurate enough or unable to deal with complex periodic geometries. At this point, the evolution of leaky-wave antennas needs a solid, efficient and versatile tool where to base the future design research on. In this work a novel simulation tool for waveguide embedded leaky-wave antennas is presented. It is based on a full-wave Method of Moments applied to the spectral domain Green Functions for a rigorous modal analysis of the finite structure. The use of Subdomain basis functions allows the software to model complex periodic geometries, overcoming a main limitation, and the analytical nature of the method combined with its 2. 5 D approach, results in a significant computing time reduction. It is built on a modular coding philosophy and provided with a user-friendly graphical interface, and an intuitive working procedure, making the program not only fast and accurate, but also easy to use and extend to new geometries. Finally, it is remarkable the educational potential of this new analysis software, since it identifies higher order effects as bandgaps and multi-harmonic radiation from a complete and simple modal approach...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis review {{presents}} {{an overview of}} 1 → 2 branched dendrimers and dendrons, created by a divergent procedure, from their synthesis to modern day applications. The first members of this branched class of fractal macromolecules were prepared through a cascade synthesis, which was later replaced by the iterative divergent synthetic approach. Most classes of this 1 → 2 N-, Aryl-, C-, Si-, and P-branched families are included and catalogued by their mode of connectivity. Dendritic macromolecules have had significant impact {{in the field of}} material sciences and are one of the major starting points for nanotechnology {{as a result of the}} numerous modifications that can be conducted, either on the surface or within their molecular infrastructure, thus taking advantage of their unimolecular micelle properties. These host cavities, maintained by the dendritic branches, allow for the incorporation of nanoparticles as well as metal particles, which make these attractive in catalysis and imaging studies. The solubility of these fractal constructs can be tailored depending on their surface modifications. Highly water-soluble, neutral dendrimers appended with, grown from, or acting as hosts to specific molecules give rise to a wide variety of biomedical applications such as drug delivery systems and MRI imaging agents. The inherent supramolecular or supramacromolecular chemistry has been exploited but the design and construction of uniquely tailored macrostructures have just begun. Laser dyes, as well as electron and energy donor and acceptor functionality, have also been paired with these fractal constructs in order to probe their uses in the field of molecular electronics. With their synthetic control, seemingly limitless modifications and wide variety of potential applications, as well as their now commercial availability, these 1 → 2 branched dendrimers have become an important nanostructured tools for diverse utilitarian applications. This review mainly covers 1 → 2 branched non-chiral dendrimers prepared by a divergent process but selected chiral surfaces are considered as well as <b>metal</b> <b>encapsulation</b> and a few hyperbranched routes to related imperfect dendrimers...|$|E
40|$|Electrocodeposition is a coating {{technology}} where {{particles are}} added to an electroplating bath in order to deposit composite coatings. Unfortunately, the presence of particles in the plating solution is insufficient to obtain composite coatings. In this work, it is attempted to increase particle codeposition by modification of the particle surface. This should increase the attractive interaction force between particle and electrode, and consequently, the incorporation probability. From literature, three beneficial particle properties could be readily identified, namely hydrophobicity, specific metal affinity and electrical conductivity. An {{attempt was made to}} unequivocally determine the influence of a fourth surface property, the surface charge or potential of the particle. By smart selection criteria, BaSO 4, CaF 2 and K 1. 33 Mn 8 O 16 were identified as having potential determining ions (pdi) that are electrochemically silent. It was shown that in water and in diluted plating baths the article surface potential could be controlled by additions of the pdi. A clear relation between surface potential and codeposition was shown by codeposition tests in three different metals under acid as well as alkaline conditions. Although current step measurements proved that these pdi-additions had an influence on the electroplating process itself, the correlation between current steps and codeposition changes was close to zero. It was concluded that a positive surface potential or surface charge is a promoting surface quality for particle incorporation. In following parts of the thesis, three techniques were explored to apply favorable surface properties to particles that show low incorporation rates. TiO 2, Al 2 O 3 covered TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 were chosen as particles to be modified with these techniques. The first proposed method made use of coupling agents, specific molecules that assist in increasing the compatibility of two different surfaces. The surface of TiO 2 was grafted using a large selection of commercially available coupling agents, having two types of reactive head groups, silanes and phosphonic acids. Phosphonic acids showed a higher grafting density on TiO 2 than silanes for the same functional group. For bulkier functional groups, a limited grafting density was obtained. With respect to codepositon, hydrophobic modifications were the most efficient, followed by mercapto groups. Heterocyclic functional groups proved disappointing. An explorative study was started for using mixtures of hydrophilic and hydrophobic grafting agents. Secondly, surfactants were added to the metal electroplating bath. These compounds could possibly lower the ordering of water molecules close to the electrode and particle surface. Furthermore, an extra attractive depletion force could arise and assist in adsorption on the electrode. An extensive series of surfactants was tested as additives to enhance the codeposition of Al 2 O 3 covered TiO 2, resulting in several important observations. In the electroplating bath, the measured critical micelle concentration was one order of magnitude lower than in water. In addition, it was found that anionic surfactants adsorbed well on this particles surface, while a cationic surfactant did not adsorb. In codeposition experiments no strong influence was found if the surfactant concentration remained below the cmc. However, if the surfactant concentration was above the cmc, codeposition was suppressed due to particle agglomeration. It was concluded that surfactants are unsuitable additives in increasing the codeposition of hydrophilic particles. The third technique consisted of applying a second material on the particle surface with favorable codeposition properties. First, Ag and Au were deposited resulting in TiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 covered TiO 2 particles decorated with Ag or Au nanoparticles. The modification with Ag resulted in the highest codeposition increase in nickel, but this modification is susceptible to ageing, namely Ag dissolved in the acid Ni plating bath, while Au persisted. In zinc or copper plating baths, little influence of the <b>metal</b> <b>encapsulation</b> was noticed. Possibly, a galvanic couple was formed between the noble metal nano-particle and the deposited metal, when the noble metal touched the electrode. This results in localized dissolution of the less noble metal electrode instead of immediate fixation. This was not observed in nickel, because nickel shows a strong electrochemical irreversibility. Carbon was selected as a second modifying material since it is not only electrically conductive, but also hydrophobic and chemically inert. It was deposited on TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3. Carbon was successfully deposited with nanometer thickness using a two-step deposition mechanism: first a carbon precursor was deposited on the particles and subsequently, the particles were pyrolyzed to evacuate contaminants and increase the crystallinity. At pyrolysis temperatures above 1000 &# 176;C, only a small amount of contaminants were retained in the carbon coating. Also the electrical conductivity and hydrophobicity were most favorable at these synthesis conditions, although also agglomeration was likely to occur. A strong connection was found between the incorporation probability and modified particle properties, such as hydrophobicity, electrical resistivity and particle size. Increased incorporation rates were observed for the purest carbon coatings with the highest water contact angle and lowest electrical resistivity. The incorporation rate of the particles was compared to the theoretical particle supply, using an extension of the Levich equation. nrpages: 191 status: publishe...|$|E
