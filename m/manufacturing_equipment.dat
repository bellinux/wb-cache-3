5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>equipment.</b> Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the plan}} was {{theoretically}} sound, it was ineffective in stimulating economic growth. During Diem's time, there was little meaningful economic investment or development of infrastructure. The businessmen mostly used the import subsidies to purchase consumer goods such as boats, motorbikes, refrigerators, radios, music systems and other similar goods, which were luxuries at the time. The program was thus effective in expanding {{the size of the}} urban middle class, but it did not generate much economic investment. Only a minority of the purchases were of capital goods such as <b>manufacturing</b> <b>equipment</b> and supplies for factory production. As a result, not much of the subsidies created more economic production. The government funds generated from selling importing licenses also became a problem, with corruption and explicit theft dogging its effectiveness as a means of bankrolling the military and civil service. In addition, some government officials would not sell the coveted licenses to the businessmen until a bribe was paid. Another criticism of the CIP was that the funds collected by the government were not used for any significant amount of government-sector economic investment but mainly to fund the army. Diem defended this by stating that national security was paramount.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{the model}} M400 was released, which {{contained}} 35 notes (G–F) and a removable tape frame. It sold over 1,800 units. By the early 1970s, hundreds {{of the instruments}} were assembled and sold by EMI under exclusive licence. Following a financial and trademark dispute through a US distribution agreement, the Mellotron name was acquired by American-based Sound Sales. Streetly-manufactured instruments after 1976 were sold under the name Novatron. The American Mellotron distributor, Sound Sales, produced their own Mellotron model, the 4-Track, in the early 1980s. At the same time Streetly Electronics produced a road-cased version of the 400– the T550 Novatron. By the mid-1980s, both Sound Sales and Streetly Electronics suffered severe financial setbacks, losing their market to synthesizers and solid-state electronic samplers, which rendered the Mellotron essentially extinct. The company folded in 1986, and Les Bradley threw most of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>equipment</b> into a skip. From 1963 until Streetly's closure, around 2,500 units had been built.|$|E

5|$|The arcade game {{market is}} split into {{manufacturers}}, distributors, and operators; manufacturers like Atari sell game machines to distributors—who handle {{several types of}} electronic machines—who in turn sell them to the operators of locations. In the early 1970s, distributors bought games on an exclusive basis, meaning that only one distributor in each distribution region would carry products from a given arcade game manufacturer, restricting the manufacturer to only the operators that distributor sold to. Atari, in 1973 {{just over a year}} old and largely based on their hit first game Pong, felt that as a smaller manufacturer this setup severely limited their ability to sell arcade games: they could only contract with a limited number of distributors, who would only buy a limited number of games per year. To work around this, Atari set up a secret subsidiary company in September 1973, Kee Games, which was intended to sell clones of Atari's games, in effect doubling their potential reach. Kee did have its own <b>manufacturing</b> <b>equipment</b> and therefore the ability to develop original titles, however, and after several clone games lead engineer Steve Bristow developed the idea for a new title. Bristow, who had previously worked with the Atari founders on Computer Space, the first arcade video game, {{came up with the idea}} while thinking of how he could improve Computer Space. His idea to correct the perceived shortcomings of the game were to replace its difficult to control rocket ships with more straightforward tanks, and to make it a two-player game instead of a single-player one.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} mainly {{concerned}} with putting forward a novel manufacturing chain model {{and a new}} scheduling model for manufacturing chains in networked manufacturing systems. The manufacturing chain model is formed by adopting extensive activity-networkdiagram workflow technique. The scheduling model is built upon mobile agent technologies, e. g. aglets. It includes two different scheduling levels. One {{is defined as the}} process scheduling which implements the scheduling logic for distributive manufacturing sites or manufacturing cells based on a specific manufacturing task. The other is the node scheduling which realizes the scheduling logic for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>equipments</b> based on specific working procedures or working paces. High-level scheduling aglet templates are created to support the operations at the levels of manufacturing sites or manufacturing cells. To complement, low-level scheduling aglet templates are created to support the operations such as working procedures or working paces over <b>manufacturing</b> <b>equipments.</b> As a result, the model is able to deal with dynamic manufacturing chains and their scheduling...|$|R

40|$|Throughout the history, the {{evolutions}} of {{the requirements}} for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>equipments</b> have depended on {{the changes in the}} customers' demands. Among the present trends in the requirements for new <b>manufacturing</b> <b>equipments,</b> there are more flexible and more reactive machines.

The proposed control and monitoring framework achieves machine monitoring, process monitoring and adapting functions that are not usually provided by machine tool control systems. The proposed control and monitoring framework has been evaluated by the means of a simulated operative part of a machine tool. The communication between the agents is achieved thanks to an Ethernet network and CORBA protocol. The experiments (with and without cooperation between agents for accommodating) give encouraging results for implementing the proposed control framework to operational machines. Also, the cooperation between the agents of control and monitoring framework contributes to the improvement of reactivity by adapting cutting parameters to the machine and process states and to increase productivity...|$|R
