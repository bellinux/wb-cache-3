40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} <b>malotilate,</b> {{a new drug}} {{proposed}} {{for the treatment of}} chronic liver diseases, was studied in carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) -induced chronic liver injury in the rat. Treatment with CCl 4 (0. 5 ml/kg twice per week, intraperitoneally for 6 or 9 weeks) led to marked necrosis, steatosis and fibrosis, as shown by both biochemical and histological examinations, and a significant decrease of the bromosulfophtaleine (BSP) clearance test. <b>Malotilate</b> (50 mg/kg p. o., 5 days per week given simultaneously with CCl 4 for 6 weeks), suppressed the increase of plasma aminotransferase activity and decreased significantly the accumulation of lipid and collagen in the liver; histology confirmed this protective effect of <b>malotilate.</b> The BSP clearance test returned to normal values and the rise in hepatic collagen synthesis activity in the malotilate-treated and intoxicated rats was reduced as compared with intoxicated control rats. The same effect was found when <b>malotilate</b> (100 mg/kg, p. o., 5 days per week), was given for 3 weeks to rats already intoxicated during the 6 previous weeks. <b>Malotilate</b> was able to prevent the increase of hepatic alterations that appeared during the last 3 weeks of CCl 4 intoxication.

40|$|<b>Malotilate</b> is a {{new drug}} {{suggested}} for use in chronic liver diseases. It is shown here to prevent liver damage caused by CCl 4. The concomitant administration of <b>malotilate</b> with CCl 4 significantly decreased hydroxyproline accumulation in the liver, liver prolyl 4 -hydroxylase and liver and serum galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase activities. However, it {{had no effect on}} the daily urinary hydroxyproline excretion or the hydroxyproline content of the skin, liver or lungs in normal young growing rats. It also had no specific inhibitory effect on hydroxyproline synthesis or secretion in fibroblast cultures, and did not affect the amount of procollagen-alpha 1 (I) -specific mRNAs in these cultures. Thus it seems to have no direct inhibitory effect on collagen metabolism. In addition to inhibition of liver collagen accumulation, <b>malotilate</b> was also able to prevent the development of morphological changes in the liver such as focal necrosis, fatty infiltration and inflammatory changes. It also normalized almost completely the standard liver-function tests. It is possible that <b>malotilate</b> may prevent excessive collagen deposition by inhibiting the inflammation caused by CCl 4 -induced liver damage...|$|E
40|$|ACETIC acid induced colitis in rats {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>malotilate,</b> a drug which {{has been shown to}} inhibit 5 - 1 ipoxygenase in human macrophages, the <b>malotilate</b> derivate ZY 16268 and the flavenoid ZY 16369 on the eicosanoid production and the colonic morphology in inflammatory bowel disease. Acetic acid produced an acute inflammatory response in the colon, associated with a markedly raised inflammation score (15. 8 vs. < 0. 5), based on a seven-scaled scoring system which includes observation of haemorrhage, submucosal oedema, cellular infiltration, goblet cell depletion, loss of architecture, crypt abscesses and serosal involvement, of which every item was subdivided as mild, moderate and severe. Incubation of colonic mucosa from rats treated with arachidonic acid and stimulated with A 23187 showed an increase of the cyclooxygenase product 12 -hydroxy-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and the 12 - 1 ipoxygenase product (12 -HETE) and a decrease in the formation of 6 -keto-prostaglandin FI(6 kPGFI) in comparison with normal rat mucosa. <b>Malotilate,</b> ZY 16268 and ZY 16369 all resulted in a decrease in HHT, leukotriene B (LTB 4) -like compounds and 12 -hydroxyeicosaenoic acid (12 -HETE) production. None of the tested compounds significantly reduced the colonic damage by acetic acid although the formation of 12 -HETE was proportional to the histologically obtained inflammation score. There were marked differences in eicosanoid formation patterns between rat and human mucosa, both normal and inflamed. In view of the hyperacute nature of the mucosal damage and the marked differences in eicosanoid production, acetic acid induced colitis in rats is probably not a suitable model of ulcerative colitis in humans. The effect of <b>malotilate,</b> a derivative of rnalotilate and a flavenoid on eicosanoid production in inflammatory bowel disease in rat...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{treatment}} of chronic liver disease represents still now an open problem in medicine. The first objective of therapy {{has to be}} the causal agent removal; however, there are many cases (viral infections, autoimmunity, genetic disease) in which {{it is not possible to}} reach this issue; in these situations the secondary objective of the therapy is to inhibit the hepatic fibrogenesis, in attempt of easing or blocking the transformation of chronic liver disease in cirrhosis. The aim of this work is to review the various compounds which showed an antifibrotic activity, using a simple classification model, allowing a fast setting of different compounds. These last, on the basis of their main action, can be divided into two main groups: drugs with direct action, which interfere with collagen metabolism (for instance interferons, glucocorticoids, prolyl 4 -hydroxylase inhibitors, cyclosporin A, colchicine, D-penicillamine, phosphatidylcholine and so on) and drugs with indirect action, that decrease the inflammatory stimuli, capable of stirring up the fibrogenetic hepatic process (S-adenosylmethionine, <b>malotilate,</b> ursodeoxycholic acid, ribavirin and so on). There are drugs that have both mechanisms of action, without the prevalence of one or other mechanism (prostaglandins) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Malotilate</b> (diisopropyl, 1, 3 -dithiol- 2 -ylidenemalonate, MT) is {{clinically}} {{used as a}} hepatoprotective agent. Because {{we noticed}} that MT induced the differentiation of cultured vascular endothelial cells, we have examined its effects on lung metastasis of the highly metastatic rat mammary carcinoma c-SST- 2. MT was orally administered to syngeneic SHR rats from 7 days before or after s. c. inoculation of c-SST- 2 cells {{to the end of}} the experiments. In the MT-treated rats, pulmonary metastasis was markedly suppressed compared with the non-treated rats. In the rats treated with MT for 19 days after i. v. inoculation of c-SST- 2 cells, lung metastasis was also significantly suppressed. An in vitro invasion assay using a rat lung endothelial (RLE) cell monolayer revealed that pretreatment of the RLE cells with MT, but not c-SST- 2 cells, significantly reduced the invasion of the RLE monolayer by c-SST- 2 cells. An in vitro vascular permeability assay demonstrated that MT prevented the increase in permeability of the RLE monolayer by serum starvation. On the other hand, in vivo and in vitro growth, gelatinase production and adhesion to the RLE cell monolayer of c-SST- 2 cells were not affected by MT treatment. These findings suggest that MT suppressed tumour metastasis by intensifying the cell-to-cell contact of endothelial cells, thus preventing tumour cells from invading vascular endothelium...|$|E
