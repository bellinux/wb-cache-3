40|$|We study {{experimentally}} and theoretically a coherently-driven strongly-coupled quantum dot-microcavity system. Our {{focus is}} on physics of the unexplored intermediate excitation regime where the resonant laser field dresses a strongly-coupled single exciton-photon (polariton) system resulting in a ladder of laser-dressed Jaynes-Cummings states. In that case both the coupling of the emitter to the confined light field of the microcavity and to the light field of the external laser are equally important, as proved by observation of injection pulling of the polariton branches by an external laser. This intermediate interaction regime {{is of particular interest}} since it connects the purely quantum <b>mechanical</b> Jaynes-Cummings <b>ladder</b> and the semi-classical Autler-Townes ladder. Exploring the driving strength-dependence of the mutually coupled system we establish the maximum in the resonance fluorescence signal to be a robust fingerprint of the intermediate regime and observe signatures indicating the laser-dressed Jaynes-Cummings ladder. In order to address the underlying physics we excite the coupled system via the matter component of fermionic nature undergoing saturation - in contrast to commonly used cavity-mediated excitation.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} are proposed {{to account for}} the creep curve of glassy polymers under high applied stress; one is analytical, the other {{is in the form of}} a <b>ladder</b> <b>mechanical</b> model. Both approaches consider that creep deformation induces the rejuvenation of the sample, giving rise to faster kinetics, and they predict an inflection in the creep curve. The related responses were found to fit experimental data better than the stretched exponential law, especially at high strain. The mechanical model must be preferred because it is hierarchical, which is useful for visualization and allows memory effects to be taken into account. © 1992 Steinkopff-Verlag.

40|$|Lunar In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) {{consists}} {{of a number of}} tasks starting with mining of lunar regolith, followed by the transfer of regolith to an oxygen extraction reactor and finally processing the regolith and storing of extracted oxygen. The transfer of regolith from the regolith hopper at the ground level to an oxygen extraction reactor many feet above the surface could be accomplished in different ways, including using a <b>mechanical</b> auger, bucket <b>ladder</b> system or a pneumatic system. The latter system is commonly used on earth when moving granular materials since it offers high reliability and simplicity of operation. In this paper, we describe a pneumatic regolith feed system, delivering feedstock to a Carbothermal reactor and lessons learned from deploying the system during the 2010 ISRU field campaign on the Mauna Kea, Hawaii...|$|R

40|$|A recent model {{which was}} found useful {{to account for}} the creep curve of {{polycarbonate}} is applied here to the loss curve of this polymer in the α transition range. The deformation behaviour is approached in a twofold manner: an analytical model and a <b>ladder</b> <b>mechanical</b> model both accounting for rejuvenation effects at high strains. The expression of the loss tangent is derived here resulting in a power law of the viscosity with an exponent equal to - 1 / 3. The viscosity itself is expressed {{as a function of the}} temperature Θ characterizing the structural state of the sample. The loss curves obtained on heating the sample at constant frequency up to Tg exhibit a plateau on the left side of the α peak which is attributed to a Θ decrease during the measurements; heating the sample in this temperature range includes an involuntary thermal treatment. The loss curve is rather well modelled here, so the proposed approach seems to be suitable at small strains when the structural state is affected by heating as well as under high stress when the structural state is affected by deformation.

40|$|The Fermion Spherical {{harmonics}} [Y_ℓ^m(θ,ϕ) for half-odd-integer ℓ and m - {{presented in}} a previous paper] are shown {{to have the same}} eigenfunction properties as the well-known Boson Spherical Harmonics [Y_ℓ^m(θ,ϕ) for integer ℓ and m]. The Fermion functions are shown to differ from the Boson functions in so far as the ladder operators M_+ (M_-) that ascend (descend) the sequence of harmonics over the values of m for a given value of ℓ, do not produce the expected result in just one case: when the value of m changes from ± 1 / 2 to ∓ 1 / 2; i. e. when m changes sign; in all other cases the ladder operators produce the usually expected result including anihilation when a ladder operator attempts to take m outside the range: -ℓ< m< +ℓ. The unexpected result in the one case does not invalidate this scalar coordinate representation of spin angular momentum, because the eigenfunction property is essential for a valid quantum <b>mechanical</b> state, whereas <b>ladder</b> operators relating states with different eigenvalues are not essential, and are in fact known only for a few physical systems; that this coordinate representation of spin angular momentum differs from the abstract theory of angular momentum in this respect, is simply an interesting curiosity. This new representation of spin angular momentum is expected to find application in the theoretical description of physical systems and experiments in which the spin-angular momentum (and associated magnetic moment) of a particle is oriented in space, since the orientation is specifiable by the spherical polar angles, θ and ϕ.
