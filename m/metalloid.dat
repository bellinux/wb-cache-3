5|$|A <b>metalloid</b> is any {{chemical}} element which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them. There is neither a standard definition of a <b>metalloid</b> nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E

5|$|A <b>metalloid</b> is {{an element}} with {{properties}} in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on <b>metalloid</b> attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
500|$|Depictions of <b>metalloids</b> vary {{according}} to the author. Some do not classify elements bordering the metal–nonmetal dividing line as <b>metalloids,</b> noting that a binary classification can facilitate the establishment of rules for determining bond types between metals and nonmetals. <b>Metalloids</b> are variously grouped with metals, regarded as nonmetals or treated as a sub-category of nonmetals. Other authors have suggested that classifying some elements as <b>metalloids</b> [...] "emphasizes that properties change gradually rather than abruptly as one moves across or down the periodic table". Some periodic tables distinguish elements that are <b>metalloids</b> and display no formal dividing line between metals and nonmetals. <b>Metalloids</b> are shown as occurring in a diagonal band or diffuse region.|$|R
50|$|As late as 1888, {{classifying}} {{the elements}} into metals, <b>metalloids,</b> and nonmetals, rather than metals and <b>metalloids,</b> was still regarded as peculiar and potentially confusing.|$|R
5|$|The {{focus of}} this section is on the {{recognised}} <b>metalloids.</b> Elements less often recognised as <b>metalloids</b> are ordinarily classified as either metals or nonmetals; {{some of these are}} included here for comparative purposes.|$|R
5|$|Classifying {{aluminium}} as a <b>metalloid</b> {{has been}} disputed given its many metallic properties. It is therefore, arguably, {{an exception to}} the mnemonic that elements adjacent to the metal–nonmetal dividing line are metalloids.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, Erman and Simon {{suggested}} {{using the}} term <b>metalloid</b> {{to refer to the}} newly discovered elements sodium and potassium.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between nonmetals and metals {{is by no}} means clear. The result is that a few borderline elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids, or vice versa. For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is sometimes classified instead as a <b>metalloid,</b> particularly in environmental chemistry; and astatine (At), which is a <b>metalloid</b> and a halogen, is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E

5|$|A few non-essential {{heavy metals}} have been {{observed}} to have biological effects. Gallium, germanium (a <b>metalloid),</b> indium, and most lanthanides can stimulate metabolism, and titanium promotes growth in plants (though {{it is not always}} considered a heavy metal).|$|E
5|$|Selenium is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} <b>metalloid</b> in the environmental chemistry literature. It moves through the aquatic environment similarly to arsenic and antimony; its water-soluble salts, in higher concentrations, have a similar toxicological profile to that of arsenic.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term <b>metalloid</b> is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to {{describe}} metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied in the early 19th century to metals that floated on water (sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals. Earlier usage in mineralogy, to describe a mineral having a metallic appearance, can be sourced to as early as 1800. Since the mid-20th century {{it has been used}} to refer to intermediate or borderline chemical elements. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) previously recommended abandoning the term <b>metalloid,</b> and suggested using the term semimetal instead. Use of this latter term has more recently been discouraged by Atkins et al. as it has a different meaning in physics—one that more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance rather than the overall classification of an element. The most recent IUPAC publications on nomenclature and terminology do not include any recommendations on the usage of the terms <b>metalloid</b> or semimetal.|$|E
500|$|A single {{quantitative}} criterion such as electronegativity {{is commonly}} used, <b>metalloids</b> having electronegativity values from 1.8 or 1.9 to 2.2. Further examples include packing efficiency (the fraction of volume in a crystal structure occupied by atoms) and the Goldhammer-Herzfeld criterion ratio. The commonly recognised <b>metalloids</b> have packing efficiencies of between 34% and 41%. The Goldhammer-Herzfeld ratio, roughly {{equal to the}} cube of the atomic radius divided by the molar volume, is a simple measure of how metallic an element is, the recognised <b>metalloids</b> having ratios from around 0.85 to 1.1 and averaging 1.0.|$|R

40|$|The {{transmission}} and toxicity of metals and <b>metalloids</b> were initially investigated with various nanofiltration (NF) and seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes, under oxic condition, using wastewater effluent and seawater samples. Various metals and <b>metalloids</b> were categorized {{into three groups}} according to their properties, such as specific gravity and concentration level, as well as others. The levels of various transition metals and <b>metalloids</b> included in the wastewater effluent and seawater samples were within ng/L-mu g/L range; the concentrations of almost all compounds were substantially reduced to ng/L or a few mu g/L levels after membrane filtrations, as measured by ICP-MS. Toxicity measurements were performed using bioassays, including both the Microtox and daphnia methods, for raw and membrane treated samples of wastewater effluent and seawater. The results indicated that (1) the SWRO membrane exhibited very good removal efficiencies for all metals and <b>metalloids</b> tested, (2) most metals and <b>metalloids</b> tested were efficiently removed by the tight NF membranes employed; however, some metals and <b>metalloids</b> included in seawater were not efficiently removed by the relatively loose NF membrane, (3) based on the Microtox measurements, only the seawater sample treated using the relatively loose NF membrane provided a relatively high toxic unit close to 1. 0; otherwise, all other samples (both raw and membrane treated samples) exhibited relatively low toxicitiesclose 131...|$|R
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a <b>metalloid.</b> The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolGe and atomic number32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white <b>metalloid</b> in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature.|$|E

Aluminium can form anionic aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term <b>metalloid</b> is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to {{describe}} metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied to metals that floated on water (lithium, sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals.

5|$|The term <b>metalloid</b> {{originally}} {{referred to}} nonmetals. Its more recent meaning, {{as a category}} of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties, became widespread in 1940–1960. Metalloids are sometimes called semimetals, a practice that has been discouraged, as the term semimetal has a different meaning in physics than in chemistry.

50|$|In 1811, Berzelius {{referred}} to nonmetallic elements as <b>metalloids,</b> {{in reference to}} their ability to form oxyanions. A common oxyanion of sulfur, for example, is the sulfate ion SO. Many metals can do the same. Chromium, for instance, can form the chromate ion CrO. Berzelius' terminology was widely adopted although it was subsequently regarded by some commentators as counterintuitive, misapplied, incorrect or invalid. In 1825, in a revised German edition of his Textbook of Chemistry, Berzelius subdivided the <b>metalloids</b> into three classes. These were: constantly gaseous 'gazolyta' (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen); real <b>metalloids</b> (sulfur, phosphorus, carbon, boron, silicon); and salt-forming 'halogenia' (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine).|$|R
5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a <b>metalloid</b> or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a <b>metalloid.</b> Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|Elemental boron is a <b>metalloid</b> that {{is found}} in small amounts in meteoroids but {{chemically}} uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.|$|E

Emsley recognised four <b>metalloids</b> (germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium); James et al. listed twelve (Emsley's plus boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, moscovium and livermorium). On average, seven elements are included in such lists; individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the ill-defined margins.|$|R
