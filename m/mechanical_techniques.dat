25|$|Several <b>mechanical</b> <b>techniques</b> {{are used}} to {{dislodge}} sputum and encourage its expectoration. In the hospital setting, chest physiotherapy is used; a respiratory therapist percusses an individual's chest by hand several times a day, to loosen up secretions. Chest physiotherapy is beneficial for short-term airway clearance. Devices that recreate this percussive therapy include the ThAIRapy Vest and the intrapulmonary percussive ventilator. Other methods such as biphasic cuirass ventilation, and associated clearance mode available in such devices, integrate a cough assistance phase, {{as well as a}} vibration phase for dislodging secretions. These are portable and adapted for home use.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: The {{postoperative}} mechanical axis in 36 {{cases of}} total knee arthroplasty using navigated and mechanical alignment systems was evaluated and compared. All the operations were performed {{over the same}} period by the same surgeon and team, who were beginners in the navigated technique and experienced in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>technique.</b> Methods: Between 2008 and 2010, 36 total knee prostheses were performed and compared: 25 navigated and 11 mechanical procedures. Any deviation from the axis measured on the panoramic postoperative X-ray was considered positive. Results: The navigated prostheses produced a mean axis deviation of 1. 32 degrees and standard deviation of 1. 57 degrees and the mechanical, respectively 3. 18 and 2. 99 degrees. There was better alignment with a tendency towards a statistical difference favoring the navigated technique. Conclusion: There were significantly more cases with axis deviation greater than three degrees using the <b>mechanical</b> <b>technique.</b> The navigated technique was incorporated by this team without additional complications and, even without experience of navigated surgery, the initial cases achieved better alignment than with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>technique,</b> and a significantly smaller number of outliers from the three-degree safety zone...|$|R
25|$|In 1795, Congress {{passed the}} Factory Act, {{which sought to}} improve {{relations}} with American Indians by setting up official trading posts and teaching the natives agricultural and <b>mechanical</b> <b>techniques.</b> To implement this, McKee's successor, Silas Dinsmoor, expanded the Tellico Blockhouse to nearly double its original size to incorporate a civilian half. This new section, separated by a wall from the military section, contained lodging areas for travelers and delegates and a two-story building known as the Tellico Factory. Along with a trading post where European-American tools and finished goods were traded for Native American furs and raw materials, the factory included a section where {{members of the new}} Cherokee Nation could learn mechanical arts and spinning and weaving cloth.|$|E

In 1834, the first liberal, factual newspaper appeared, and the 1849 Constitution established lasting freedom of the press in Denmark. Newspapers flourished {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, usually tied to one or another political party or trade union. Modernisation, bringing in new features and <b>mechanical</b> <b>techniques,</b> appeared after 1900. The total circulation was 500,000 daily in 1901, more than doubling to 1.2 million in 1925. The German occupation during World War II brought informal censorship; some offending newspaper buildings were simply blown up by the Nazis. During the war, the underground produced 550 newspapers—small, surreptitiously printed sheets that encouraged sabotage and resistance.|$|E
