25|$|Bacon is a <b>meat</b> <b>product</b> {{prepared}} from cured pork. It {{is first}} cured using {{large quantities of}} salt, either a brine or a dry packing. Fresh bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, {{or it may be}} boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating. Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat.

25|$|When Genghis Khan's {{grandson}} Kublai Khan (1215–1294) invaded Moscow, {{he and his}} warriors introduced minced horsemeat to the Muscovites. This {{was later}} called steak tartare. The city states {{of what is now}} Germany took to this ground <b>meat</b> <b>product</b> and created many of their own dishes by adding capers, onions and even caviar to the blend and selling it on the streets. It is not known when the first restaurant recipe for steak tartare appeared. While not providing a clear name, the first description of steak tartare was given by Jules Verne in 1875 in his novel Michael Strogoff. There are certain similarities between steak tartare and the German dishes Labskaus and Mett. Other similar raw, chopped meats appeared in the 20th century, such as the Italian carpaccio, which itself was invented in 1930 at Harry's Bar in Venice. Similarly, one of the oldest references to a Hamburgh Sausage appeared in 1763 in the cookbook entitled Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse (1708–1770). Hamburgh Sausage is made with minced meat and a variety of spices, including nutmeg, cloves, black pepper, garlic, and salt, and is typically served with toast. A wide variety of traditional European dishes are also made with minced meat, such as meatloaf, the Serbian pljeskavica, the Arab kofta, and meatballs.|$|E

Fiber is suitable for addition to <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> and has previously been used in cooked <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> to increase the cooking yield due to its water-binding and fat-binding properties and to improve texture (Cofrades et al., 2000).

The factors impacting the supply of and demand for <b>meat</b> and <b>meat</b> <b>products,</b> elasticities, and the equilibrium price were determined. The second chapter deals with regional aspects of the <b>meat</b> and <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> market, which include studies on the composition and structure of primary and secondary spheres in the regions of Latvia. In the third chapter, the business environment in the industry and market of <b>meat</b> and <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> was analysed. The fourth chapter contains research results on the key demand factors impacting the regional market of <b>meat</b> and <b>meat</b> <b>products.</b> It outlines the disposable income of population, the existing <b>meat</b> and <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> market prices, and the price analysis for complimentary <b>meat</b> <b>products.</b> The fifth chapter contains research results on supply factors impacting the regional market of <b>meat</b> and <b>meat</b> <b>products.</b> It outlines the analysis of input volumes and prices, imports, sales volumes and prices. In the sixth chapter, strategic assessment of the <b>meat</b> and <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> industry's and market's development was carried out by applying experts' opinion and SWOT analysis.
