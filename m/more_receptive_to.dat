5|$|Each stop usually {{controls}} one rank of pipes, although mixtures and undulating stops (such as the Voix céleste) control multiple ranks. The name of {{the stop}} reflects not only the stop's timbre and construction, but also {{the style of the}} organ in which it resides. For example, the names on an organ built in the north German Baroque style generally will be derived from the German language, while the names of similar stops on an organ in the French Romantic style will usually be French. Most countries tend to use only their own languages for stop nomenclature. English-speaking nations as well as Japan are <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> foreign nomenclature. Stop names are not standardized: two otherwise identical stops from different organs may have different names.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Dmowski became <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> Russian overtures, {{particularly}} neoslavism, {{warming up}} {{to the idea that}} Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy. In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained those views in his book Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska (Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause), published in 1908.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} film to open during Super Bowl weekend is the 2008 concert film , which took in $31.1 million, {{almost half the}} total it would earn during a released limited to just that weekend and the following week. In a close second is Dear John, grossing $30.5 million in 2010, for the strongest Super Bowl weekend opening for a conventional release. Both films had strong appeal to female moviegoers, an audience <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> moviegoing on a weekend dominated by a sporting event. The 2008 action film Taken, which Cargill noted for its success in appealing to an older audience, took in $24.7 million on its opening weekend {{on its way to}} total receipts of over $100 million, making it a distant third.|$|E

During this time, the entire population felt the effects of poverty, crime, and hardship, making <b>more</b> people <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> prison narratives.|$|R

[...] Nevertheless, natives were also converted by other means. Father Paul Le Jeune advocated fear tactics to convert natives to Christianity, such as showing them frightening pictures of Hell or drawing upon the natives’ own fears, such as losing a child, {{in order to create}} horrifying mental images and encourage the natives to consider their own mortality and salvation.|$|R
5|$|Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer {{than those}} in the wild. They are more {{comfortable}} around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and {{for a longer period of}} time over their lifespan. Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other; while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position. These behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed to genetics. However, it is also theorized that there are certain underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> domestication than others, and that these differences are then passed down to offspring (compare Domesticated silver fox).|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Burchard was succeeded as Mint {{director}} by James Kimball. The {{new director}} was <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> Gilder's ideas and in 1887 announced a competition for new {{designs for the}} non-gold coinage. These plans were scuttled when Vermont Senator Justin Morrill questioned the Mint's authority to produce new designs. The Mint had claimed authority under the Coinage Act of 1873 in issuing the Morgan dollar in 1878 and the Liberty Head nickel in 1883. Morrill was a supporter of coin redesign and {{had in the past}} introduced bills to accomplish this; he felt, however, that this could not be done without an act of Congress. Kimball submitted the issue to government lawyers; they indicated that the Mint lacked the claimed authority. All three men worked to secure a bill to authorize new designs: Morrill by introducing and pressing legislation, Kimball by lobbying for the authority in his annual report, and Gilder by orchestrating favorable coverage. With legislators busy with other matters, it was not until September 26, 1890 that President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation making all denominations of U.S. coins available for immediate redesign by the Mint upon obtaining the Secretary of the Treasury's approval. Each coin could thereafter be altered from the 25th year after it was first produced; for example, a coin first struck in 1892 would be eligible for redesign in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E

In April 1949, Hubbard wrote to several {{professional}} organizations to offer his research. None were interested, so he turned to his editor John W. Campbell, who was <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> due <b>to</b> a long-standing fascination with fringe psychologies and psychic powers ("psionics") that [...] "permeated both his fiction and non-fiction".|$|R
40|$|A brief {{educational}} {{intervention with}} families {{living with a}} schizophrenic relative is described and evaluated in terms of benefits for relatives' well-being and patient recovery. Education led to considerable knowledge gains and to reductions in relatives' reported stress symptoms and fear of the patient. There was a trend for relatives to be more optimistic concerning their role in treatment. At 6 months follow-up, only knowledge gains were maintained; however, relatives' perceptions of family burden were significantly reduced. The evidence suggests that family education may be useful both as a cost-effective intervention {{in its own right}} and in facilitating a <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> attitude <b>to</b> subsequent family intervention...|$|R
50|$|The Roman and Byzantine Decapolis {{region was}} {{influenced}} and gradually {{taken over by}} Christianity. Some cities were <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> than others <b>to</b> the new religion. Pella was a base {{for some of the}} earliest church leaders (Eusebius reports that the apostles fled there to escape the Great Jewish Revolt). In other cities, paganism persisted long into the Byzantine era. Eventually, however, the region became almost entirely Christian, and most of the cities served as seats of bishops.|$|R

25|$|Rocky Mountain bighorn rams employ {{at least}} three {{different}} courting strategies. The most common and successful is the tending strategy, in which a ram follows and defends an estrous ewe. Tending takes considerable strength and dominance, so ewes are <b>more</b> <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> tending males, feeling {{they are the most}} fit. Another tactic is coursing, which is when rams fight for an already tended ewe. Ewes typically avoid coursing males, so the strategy is not effective. Rams also employ a blocking strategy. They prevent a ewe from accessing tending areas before she even goes into estrus.|$|E

40|$|The unique {{microstructure}} of nanostructured bainite {{consists of}} very slender bainitic ferrite plates and high carbon retained austenite films. As a consequence, the reported properties are opening {{a wide range}} of different commercial uses. However, bainitic transformation follows the T 0 criteria, i. e. the incomplete reaction phenomena, which means that the microstructure is not thermodynamically stable because the bainitic transformation stops well before austenite reaches an equilibrium carbon level. This article aims to study the different microstructural changes taking place when nanostructured bainite is destabilized by austempering for times well in excess of that strictly necessary to end the transformation.
