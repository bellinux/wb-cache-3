25|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex activity increases when errors {{occur and}} are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept {{as a form of}} higher-level thinking. A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the {{anterior cingulate cortex}}, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach <b>motivational</b> <b>system</b> to reduce anger.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Although a {{substantial}} {{body of research}} has {{examined the relationship between}} <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> and mood and anxiety disorders, there is disagreement among theorists regarding the nature of these relationships. Discrepancies in the literature may be explained by several factors. Studies of motivational models rarely examine both mood and anxiety disorders simultaneously, making comparisons among them difficult. Furthermore, dimen-sions of anxiety often are not distinguished, obscuring potential relationships. Finally, although research in this area is beginning to conceptualize individual differences in <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> as longstanding temperament phenomena, this notion has not been widely incorporated into motivational models. The present study examined relationships between temperamental differences in approach and avoidance <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> and dimen-sions of anxiety and depression. Results revealed distinct relationships between motivational temperaments and each psychopathology dimension. Present findings implicate individual differences in temperamental motivation as a potential factor in the development and/or maintenance of mood and anxiety disorders...|$|R

However, there is some controversy about what constitutes life satisfaction and its measurement. This study explored the influence of cognitive <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> upon estimations of life satisfaction using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The sample comprised 190 participants diagnosed with SPMI from Hawai'i's Adult Mental Health Division. Results indicated that higher behavioral inhibition or psychological distress predict lower levels of life satisfaction. However, higher levels of behavioral activation predict higher levels of life satisfaction. The model did not support psychological distress as a mediator between cognitive <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> and life satisfaction. Overall, cognitive <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> accounted for 15 % {{of the variance in}} life satisfaction while psychological distress accounted for 29 %.

With a randomized picture presentation, only a transient interference effect was observed, consistent with increased attentional demands during the processing of unpleasant pictures. During blocked presentation of affiliative pleasant pictures, reaction times were faster, suggesting the activation of appetitive <b>motivational</b> <b>systems.</b> Ultimately, both attentional and <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> are intricately tied in the brain and, together, determine behavior...|$|R

50|$|Sue Johnson's use of {{the term}} emotionally focused therapy refers to a {{specific}} model of relationship therapy that explicitly integrates systems and experiential approaches and places prominence upon attachment theory as a theory of emotion regulation. Emotionally focused therapy views attachment needs as a primary <b>motivational</b> <b>system</b> for mammalian survival. Emotionally focused therapy has expanded to be centered upon attachment theory as a theory of adult love wherein attachment, caregiving, and sex are intertwined. Attachment theory is seen to subsume the search for personal autonomy, dependability of the other and a sense of personal and interpersonal attractiveness, lovability and desire. Following attachment theory and emotion theory, emotionally focused therapy aims to reshape attachment strategies towards optimal interdependency and emotion regulation, for resilience and physical, emotional, and relational health.|$|E

If he agreed with their propositions and if the entrepreneurs were able to reach their goals in the first year, he returned 10% of the shares to the entrepreneur without charge.

If the entrepreneur failed to reach the agreed goal or if {{it was clear that the}} business was not going well, he retained the 60% so as to help absorb the loss.

50|$|The security-exploration cycle {{indicates}} that a place can become the target of attachment when it incorporates both security and exploration. For example, the home, a popular object of attachment, typically possesses a safe or familiar indoor environment and an outdoor space that satisfies desires to explore and expand knowledge. This example is capitalized upon by Morgan (2010), who proposed a combination of human attachment and place attachment in a model called the Exploration-Assertion <b>Motivational</b> <b>System,</b> {{which suggests that the}} strongest attachments originate during childhood. The model states that place attachment forms due to a cycle of repeated arousals and behaviors that are linked to both places and attachment figures. As a result of this balance between exploration and attachment behavior, children receive positive reinforcements in the forms of connectedness and a sense of adventure and mastery.|$|E

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests {{that many of the}} clinical constructs used to help understand and explain obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms, and negative mood, may be causally interrelated. One approach to understanding this interrelatedness is a <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> approach. This approach suggests that rather than considering clinical constructs and negative affect as separable entities, they are all features of an integrated threat management system, and as such are highly coordinated and interdependent. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine if clinical constructs related to OC symptoms and negative mood are best treated as separable or, alternatively, if these clinical constructs and negative mood are best seen as indicators of an underlying superordinate variable, as would be predicted by a <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> approach. A sample of 370 analogue participants completed measures of mood and the clinical constructs of inflated responsibility, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), not just right experiences (NJREs) and checking stop rules. An exploratory factor analysis suggested two plausible factor structures, one where all construct items and negative mood items loaded onto one underlying superordinate variable, and a second structure comprising of 5 factors, where each item loaded onto a factor representative of what the item was originally intended to measure. A confirmatory factor analysis showed that the five factor model was preferential to the one factor model, suggesting the four constructs and negative mood are best conceptualised as separate variables. Given the predictions of a <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> approach were not supported in the current study, other possible explanations for the causal interrelatedness between clinical constructs and negative mood are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Motivations {{direct and}} {{energize}} behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative. In the early 1970s, Paul Ekman and colleagues began {{a line of}} research which suggests that many emotions are universal. He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust. Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the EEA. For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared. Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.Motivation has a neurobiologial basis in the reward system of the brain. Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that reward systems may evolve in such a way that there may be an inherent or unavoidable trade-off in the <b>motivational</b> <b>system</b> for activities of short versus long duration.|$|E

There will become a large demand of generation Y employees as the baby boomer generation employees retire at an accelerated rate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate Y generation specific characteristics and to identify <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> to enhance performance. The research questions are: 1. What are Y generation characteristics? 2. What <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> organizations can form to motivate Y generation employees and in turn, create better performance? The Y generation specific characteristics identified from the literature include; achievement oriented; confident; educated; multitasking; having a need for feedback; needing management support; sociable and tech savvy. The proposed <b>motivational</b> <b>systems</b> can be found in four areas of the organization; HRM, training and development, communication and decision making policies. Three focus groups were held to investigate what would motivate generation Y employees to achieve better performance. Two of these focus groups were Finnish natives and the third consisted of international students. The HRM systems included flexibility and a culture of fun. It was concluded that flexibility within the workplace and role was a great source of motivation. Culture of fun was not responded to as favorably although most focus group participants rated enjoyableness as one of their top motivating factors. Training and development systems include training programs and mentoring as sources of potential motivation. Training programs were viewed as a mode to gain a better position and were not necessarily seen as <b>motivational</b> <b>systems.</b> Mentoring programs were not concluded to have a significant effect on motivation. Communication systems included keeping up with technology, clarity and goals as well as feedback. Keeping up with technology was seen as an ineffective tool to motivate. Clarity and goal setting was seen as very important to be able to perform but not necessarily motivating. Feedback had a highly motivating effect on these focus groups. Decision making policies included collaboration and teamwork as well as ownership. Teams were familiar and meet the social needs of Y generation employees and are motivating. Ownership was equated with trust and responsibility and was highly valued as well as motivating to these focus group participants...|$|R
