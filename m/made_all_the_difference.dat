The Luftwaffe supported the Afrika Korps in the Western Desert and Tunisia.

25|$|In {{his prime}} Simpson {{was known for}} his {{technical}} correctness. At slightly below average height, his noted ability to bat for long periods was attributed to his high fitness and concentration levels. He had a wide array of shots, in particular off the back foot. Along with Bill Lawry, he formed an opening partnership that was {{regarded as one of the}} finest in Test history. Simpson was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Simpson's stance was easy and his style attractive, the result of a change of technique in the late 1950s when he turned from playing too square-on to side-on. Simpson found that it <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> to him in dealing effectively with the in-dipper and going-away balls. Standing 179cm and 13stone, Simpson was most effective as an attacking batsman. Simpson was best known for his straight-drive and powerfully hit square-cut, as well as an on-drive taken from his toes. He rarely played the hook shot, regarding it as risky, and used the pull shot in moderation. Early in his career, Simpson had a square-on stance but converted to a more side on position, finding it easier to deal with swing bowling.|$|E

Terry Lee Rioux, Kelley's biographer, noted that the film proved [...] "that it was the character-driven play that <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in Star Trek".

She serves as a model faculty member that I aspire to become. Additionally, I am appreciative of Joan Hermsen, Ph. D., who advised my undergraduate honor’s thesis in sociology. She helped me understand the challenges and the rewards of being a woman in academia. Her approachability and support was much appreciated in my desire to pursue as many opportunities as possible during my education.

[...] He remarked about Vincent Canby's review of the film: [...] "In the New York Times, Vincent Canby complained that we are not given enough information about the quality of Vivian's broken marriage, asking if perhaps her lesbianism was a hysterical reaction to her divorce. This is the point at which many heterosexual critics disqualify themselves from perceptively reviewing gay films." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{conversation}} {{took place}} at Dover, when {{he went down to}} give her the money for which, at Mr. Morrish's bank, he had exchanged the cheque she had left with him. That cheque, or rather certain things it represented, had <b>made</b> somehow <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in their relations. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> was huge, and Baron could think of nothing but this confirmed vision of their being able to work fruitfully together that would account for so rapid a change. She didn't talk of impossibilities now--she didn't seem to want to stop him off; only when, the day following his arrival at Dover with the fifty pounds (he had after all to agree to share them with her--he couldn't expect her to take a present of money from him), he returned to the question over which they had had their little scene the night they dined together--on this occasion (he had brought a portmanteau and he was staying) she mentioned that there was something very particular she had it on her conscience to tell him before letting him commit himself. There dawned in her face as she approached the subject a light of warning that frightened him; it was charged with something so strange that for an instant he held his breath. This flash of ugly possibilities passed however, and it was with the gesture of taking still tenderer possession of her, checked indeed by the grave, important way she held up a finger, that he answered: [...] "Tell me everything--tell me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Thursday, 7th June 1866.—The other {{evening at}} the Queen’s ball [...] Mrs. Gladstone asked me as from her husband, to come to breakfast [...] this morning, {{at the same time}} that Colonel Holmes,(148) was [...] invited.... I decided to go. I found no cause to regret the [...] decision, for the company was very pleasant. The Duke and Duchess [...] of Argyll, Lord Lyttelton, Lord Houghton, Lord Frederick Cavendish [...] with his wife, and one of his uncles, and several whom I did not [...] know. I forgot Lord Dufferin. We sat at two round tables, thus [...] {{dividing}} the company; but Mr. Gladstone took ours, which <b>made</b> <b>all</b> [...] <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in <b>the</b> world. His characteristic is the most [...] extraordinary facility of conversation on almost any topic, with a [...] great command of literary resources, which at once gives it a high [...] tone. Lord Houghton, if put to it, is not without aptness in [...] keeping it up; whilst the Duke of Argyll was stimulated out of his [...] customary indifference to take his share. Thus we passed from [...] politics, the House of Commons, and Mr. Mill, to English prose as [...] illustrated from the time of Milton and Bacon down to this day, [...] and contrasted with German, which has little of good, and with [...] French. In the latter connection Mr. Gladstone asked me if I had [...] read the Conscrit of Erckmann-Chatrian. Luckily for me, who have [...] little acquaintance with the light current literature, I could say [...] “Yes,” and could contrast it favourably with the artificial manner [...] of Hugo. It is a cause of wonder to me how a man like Gladstone, [...] so deeply plunged in the current of politics, and in the duties of [...] legislation and official labour, can find time to keep along with [...] the ephemeral literature abroad as well as at home. After an hour [...] thus spent we rose, and on a question proposed by Colonel Holmes [...] respecting a group of figures in china which stood in a corner, [...] Mr. Gladstone launched forth into a disquisition on that topic, [...] which he delights in, and illustrated his idea of the art by [...] showing us several specimens of different kinds. One a grotesque [...] but speaking figure in Capo di Monte, another a group of [...] combatants, two of whom were lying dead with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> aspect of [...] strained muscle stiffening; and lastly, a very classical and [...] elegant set of Wedgwood ware, certainly finer than I ever saw [...] before. This is the pleasantest and most profitable form of [...] English society.|$|R
6000|$|And I often {{smile at}} my {{consciousness}} that certain conservative prepossessions have mingled themselves {{for me with}} the influences of our midland scenery, from {{the tops of the}} elms down to the buttercups and the little wayside vetches. Naturally enough. That part of my father's prime to which he oftenest referred had fallen on the days when the great wave of political enthusiasm and belief in a speedy regeneration of all things had ebbed, and the supposed millennial initiative of France was turning into a Napoleonic empire, the sway of an Attila with a mouth speaking proud things in a jargon half revolutionary, half Roman. Men were beginning to shrink timidly from the memory of their own words and from the recognition of the fellowships they had formed ten years before; and even reforming Englishmen for the most part were willing to wait for the perfection of society, if only they could keep their throats perfect and help to drive away the chief enemy of mankind from our coasts. To my father's mind the noisy teachers of revolutionary doctrine were, to speak mildly, a variable mixture of the fool and the scoundrel; the welfare of the nation lay in a strong Government which could maintain order; and I was accustomed to hear him utter the word [...] "Government" [...] in a tone that charged it with awe, and made it part of my effective religion, in contrast with the word [...] "rebel," [...] which seemed to carry the stamp of evil in its syllables, and, lit by the fact that Satan was the first rebel, made an argument dispensing with more detailed inquiry. I gathered that our national troubles in the first two decades of this century were not at <b>all</b> due to <b>the</b> mistakes of our administrators; and that England, with its fine Church and Constitution, would have been exceedingly well off if every British subject had been thankful for what was provided, and had minded his own business--if, for example, numerous Catholics of that period had been aware how very modest they ought to be considering they were Irish. The times, I heard, had often been bad; but I was constantly hearing of [...] "bad times" [...] as a name for actual evenings and mornings when the godfathers who gave them that name appeared to me remarkably comfortable. Altogether, my father's England seemed to me lovable, laudable, full of good men, and having good rulers, from Mr Pitt on to the Duke of Wellington, until he was for emancipating the Catholics; and it was so far from prosaic to me that I looked into it for a more exciting romance than such as I could find in my own adventures, which consisted mainly in fancied crises calling for the resolute wielding of domestic swords and firearms against unapparent robbers, rioters, and invaders who, it seemed, in my father's prime had more chance of being real. The morris-dancers had not then dwindled to a ragged and almost vanished rout (owing the traditional name probably to the historic fancy of our superannuated groom); also, the good old king was alive and well, which <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more <b>difference</b> because I had no notion what he was and did--only understanding in general that if he had been still on the throne he would have hindered everything that wise persons thought undesirable.|$|R
2500|$|By negating all of Grattan's efforts 1787-1789 {{and those}} of Pitt in the late 1790s to 1801, FitzGibbon allowed {{conditions}} to develop that would benefit sectarian leaders and political philosophies from both religious communities. [...] It is unclear if FitzGibbon's support of Grattan, or support for Pitt's proposals would have made much difference, given that many hardline Protestants probably {{felt the same way}} as FitzGibbon. [...] Furthermore, the British Cabinet (not to mention the Royal Family, then far more influential politically) was itself divided on the issue for most of the period. [...] But just as Catholic Emancipation was brought about by a Tory Prime Minister in 1829, or substantial voting reforms brought about by Disraeli and the Conservatives, thus winning support from a crucial minority of those originally opposed to either, the support of a prominent hardline Protestant leader for Catholic Emancipation might have <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> to Irish history.|$|E
2500|$|Initial successes with Whiteman were {{followed}} by disaster when they reached New York {{and for a while}} Whiteman must have thought of letting them go. Possibly Bing might have been retained as Whiteman was already using him as a solo performer on record, but the prospects for Rinker must have been bleak. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter Harry Barris <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> to the act and [...] "The Rhythm Boys" [...] were born. The additional voice meant that the boys could be heard more easily in the large New York theaters and they quickly became a real success. A year touring with Whiteman performing and recording with musicians Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Eddie Lang and Hoagy Carmichael, provided valuable experience and then they were sent out on tour alone. Much {{has been written about the}} escapades of the three men during this period and clearly they were living life to the full. Despite all of this, Bing was continuing to develop and when the Rhythm Boys rejoined the Whiteman troupe in 1929, he had matured considerably as a performer. He was constantly in demand as a solo artist on record and radio.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the album}} did not gain much {{attention}} from the general press on its original release, the album retrospectively has been given critical acclaim and has been cited {{as one of the}} most important hardcore punk albums ever released. Rolling Stone in their retrospective review says that [...] "Black Flag lived up to it, defining L.A. hardcore punk with violent guitar and the pissed-off scream of Henry Rollins, especially on [...] "TV Party" [...] and [...] "Rise Above." [...] Punks still listen to Damaged, and parents still hate it." [...] Pitchfork in their retrospective review from 2002 says [...] "Black Flag took on the essential ferocity of men about to snap, and combined that with an acidic sense of humor and these things called 'songs', a concept that many of the wannabe punkers of the day were still trying to sort out. Damaged hit in 1981, and by 1982, four bars bearing the Black Flag name had been airbrushed across miles and miles of spiked leather. Conflicting feelings of violence, apathy, rage, and self-satire course through this one, the essential touchstone of the entire genre of West Coast hardcore, crystallizing the turmoil of the movement. Listen to 'Rise Above' and try not to be incensed, then listen to 'TV Party' and try not to laugh out loud. That's awesome." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a very high rating of a [...] "A-" [...] and saying [...] "...Greg Ginn is the greatest noise guitarist since Johnny Thunders, new vocalist Henry Rollins can snarl along any tortured contour they serve up, and 'Rise Above', 'Six Pack', and the uproarious 'TV Party' prove they can write songs as well as gnash fragments." [...] John Dougan of AllMusic gave it a perfect five star rating saying [...] "...Although Black Flag had been recording for three years prior to this release, the fact that Henry Rollins was now their lead singer <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> His furious bellow and barely contained ferocity was the missing piece the band needed to become great. Also, guitarist/mastermind Greg Ginn wrote a slew of great songs for this record that, while suffused with the usual punk conceits (alienation, boredom, disenfranchisement), were capable of making one laugh out loud, especially the protoslacker satire 'TV Party'..." [...] and also noted [...] "...Extremely controversial when it was released, Damaged endured the slings and arrows of outrageous criticism (some reacted as though this record alone would cause the fall of America's youth) to become and remain an important document of its time." ...|$|E
