30|$|We {{succeeded in}} {{preparing}} size-controlled calpain inhibitor nanocrystals using Nano Spray Dryer B- 90. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} to prepare calpain inhibitor nanocrystals. The particle sizes were associated with the <b>mesh</b> <b>aperture</b> sizes, namely when the <b>mesh</b> <b>aperture</b> sizes decreased, the particle sizes decreased. The concentration of ethanol-dissolved drug solution significantly affected the particle size. Calpain inhibitors will be a promising drug for curing intractable diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Therefore, utilizing the calpain-inhibitor-nanocrystal-based drug delivery system targeting such intractable diseases will be quite attractive topics in the near future, and thus our fundamental findings of preparing calpain inhibitor nanocrystals in this research are noteworthy. We are also investigating the preparation of water dispersion of calpain inhibitor nanocrystals. This nanocrystal water dispersion will act as attractive nanocrystal-based eye drops for the treatment of ophthalmic disorders such as Fuchs’ endothelial dystrophy of the cornea in the near future.|$|E

40|$|If Southern Ocean {{plankton}} {{communities are}} changing {{in response to}} climate, biases in various nets need to be evaluated to help understand regional and temporal differences between historical and contemporary sample collections. A comparison of the catching ability of a Bongo net (<b>mesh</b> <b>aperture</b> 200 μm) and a reconstructed version of an N 70 net (upper <b>mesh</b> <b>aperture</b> 445 μm, lower <b>mesh</b> <b>aperture</b> 195 μm) as used by the Discovery Investigations was therefore undertaken. Forty Bongo and forty N 70 samples were obtained from 10 stations in the Southern Ocean during December 2009. Bongo net catch abundance was 3 {{times greater than the}} N 70 and 4 times greater when only copepod instars < 0. 5 mm body length were considered. The Bongo net captured more plankton at all chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations encountered, although the difference was less at high Chl a when the N 70 appeared to filter all size classes of copepod more efficiently, as well as retaining a relatively greater proportion of non-copepod plankton. Application of these findings was made to a previous study in which N 70 samples from 1926 / 1927 were compared to a series of Bongo net hauls made post- 1995. By ‘correcting’ abundances for net bias among a common set of 45 taxa, N 70 data were within the range of variability seen in the Bongo net samples. Making such inter-net comparisons allows us to use historical collections and better judge the nature and magnitude of change in these plankton communities. ...|$|E

The performance of the Pari nebuliser was independent of latex spheres particle size. For both Polygreen and Aeroneb Pro nebulizers, total aerosol output increased when the size of latex spheres increased, with highest fine particle fraction (FPF) values being recorded. However, following nebulisation of 1 or 4. 5 Î¼m suspensions with the Polygreen device, no particles were detected in the aerosols deposited in a two-stage impinger, suggesting that the aerosols generated from this device consisted mainly of the continuous phase while the dispersed microspheres were excluded and remained in the nebuliser. The Omron nebuliser efficiently nebulised the 1 Î¼m latex spheres, with high output rate and no particle aggregation. However, this device functioned inefficiently when delivering 4. 5 or 10 Î¼m suspensions, which was attributed to the mild vibrations of its mesh and/or the blockage of the <b>mesh</b> <b>apertures</b> by the microspheres. The Aeroneb Pro fragmented latex spheres into smaller particles, but uncontrolled aggregation occurred upon nebulisation.

Further, the design features the fiberoptic distribution of both RF and control signals to individual microwave integrated circuit/reflector modules in each of the inflatable, phased array antenna cells. The result of combining these two technologies is a modular, phased array antenna design that is both mechanically and electrically agile and robust...|$|R
30|$|A {{modification}} of the method of Yoder (1936) {{was used to measure}} the water stability of aggregates by wet sieving. 50  g of pre–prepared soil aggregates from series I or II were broken up to pass through a set of five sieves having 5.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25  mm <b>aperture</b> <b>mesh</b> respectively. The water level was adjusted so that the aggregates on the upper sieve were just submerged at the highest point of oscillation. The oscillation rate was 30  cycles per minute, the amplitude of the sieving action was 4.0  cm and the period of sieving was 10  min. The sieved materials remained in the five sieves and the part through all the sieves were selected and oven–dried respectively for at least 8  h. By weighting the six parts of dried materials, the mass percentage of soil aggregates in the range of > 5, 5 – 2, 2 – 1, 1 – 0.5, 0.5 – 0.25, and < 0.25  mm can be determined respectively.|$|R
30|$|A {{local variety}} of cowpea (locally called Soronko) was {{obtained}} from a local farmer in Kumasi, regional capital of the Ashanti region of Ghana. The region has a mean annual temperature of 32  °C and a mean monthly temperature ranging between 26  °C in November and 27  °C in February. The average relative humidity for November, December, January, and February are 84, 82, 78, and 75 %, respectively. In general, the experimental period fell within the months of November, December, January, and February. The storage and laboratory experiments took place at Animal Science Department of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Close to 50  kg of cowpea was poured onto a clean plane surface, mixed thoroughly, and foreign materials such as stones and broken grains were removed before the experiment was carried out. Seventy-eight transparent plastic containers with appropriate lids for storing the grains, an electronic oven for moisture content determination, an electronic balance, rectangular trays, muslin bags, polyethene rubbers, and <b>mesh</b> sieve of <b>aperture</b> size 4.80  mm were used to undertake this experiment.|$|R
