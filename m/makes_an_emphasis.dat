40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{theoretical}} problems of phenomenological sociology. The author analyses category-conceptual apparatus of P. L Berger and Th. Luckmann, as followers of A. Schutz. Their works are treated here as a “postclassical” period of phenomenological sociology, although both scientists don’t accept a possibility of “phenomenological sociology” and speak about phenomenology as a proto-sociology. The analysis is focused on the concept “legitimization” and other concepts which help to understand it, such as: “symbolic universe”, “externalization”, “objectivation”, “internalization”, “habitualization”, and “religious representations”. The author also compares Schutz’s context of the term “life-world” with that of Berger and Luck mann’s concept “world of everyday life”, that has narrower definition. An integral characteristic of their concept is “institutionalization”, they try to find mechanisms which make a life-world as taken-for-granted. To understand this fundamental process helps a conception of legitimization and symbolic universes. As a conclusion, an author <b>makes</b> <b>an</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the necessity of further development of theoretical level of phenomenological sociology. Some concepts of the theoretical systems of Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann could be used for such an aim and have extremely high heuristic and gnoseological potential...|$|E

The important factor, uniting these acts is that they all are contributed to the functioning of the local government on the principles of decentralization. A special role in the formation of a decentralized local government in Russia is played by the Russian Constitution, adopted by population vote on the December 12, 1993. Particular importance plays the provisions of Article 3 and 12 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation from 1993. Provisions of the Law "On the General Principles of Local Self-Government in the Russian Federation" dated October 6, 2003 No. 131 -FZ in the definition of local self-government, based on the principles of constitutional democracy.

This theory holds that there is no property of truth at all, and that overt uses of the predicate " in our sentences are redundant, having absolutely no e ect on what we express. However, all hypothetical examples used by de ationary theorists in exemplifying the theory, in papers, books, have been taken out of context. Thus, there is no way to examine and analyze what the predicate adds to the sentence within context. We oppose this theory not on philosophical grounds, but on empirical grounds, with an language philosophy" approach. We computationally collect 7610 occurrences of overt uses of the predicate " in the form is true that", from 10 in uential periodicals (newspapers and a magazine) published in the United States. We classify and annotate these examples with respect to coordinating and subordinating conjunctions' positions they contain.

From one aspect, Serbia has an exceptional human potential presented in number of 13, 000 graduates each year, or in share of 42 % of population who speaks English, which is the largest among all Eastern and Central European countries. This forms a basis for formulation of strategies of information society development in Serbia as well as for economic adjustments based upon knowledge, and for tracing the way to future knowledge society, i. e. eEurope 2020. On the other hand, we are witnessing an intensive development of huge complexes of mega and hypermarkets as a present dominant way for our city spaces' regeneration.

40|$|Being {{consistent}} with every experimental measurement made to date, the current paradigm of particle physics, the Standard Model, remains a successful parametrization of nature. Together, the Standard Model plus {{the theory of}} General Relativity seem to provide a consistent picture of physics at all scales, yet {{there is plenty of}} room to believe the story is incomplete. Puzzles that remain unanswered {{within the context of the}} Standard Model include (i) an explanation of the origin of Dark Matter, which accounts for no less than ∼ 25 % of the Universeâs energy budget, (ii) a meaningful answer to the question of electroweak naturalness, (iii) a rationale for the absence of anti-matter in our observable patch of the Universe, (iv) a dynamical picture of the vast hierarchies we observe in fermion masses, and (v) a resolution to the strong CP problem. With the exception of the Dark Matter mystery, all other objections to the Standard Model listed here take the guise of a 'hierarchy' problem: why is some quantity (either a scale or coupling) so small? This work addresses two of the objections to the Standard Model: the necessity of an explanation to the origin of Dark Matter, and the question of naturalness as a guiding principle in nature, understood as the necessity for a dynamical mechanism behind unexplained hierarchies. Chapters 1 and 2 introduce the topics of naturalness and Dark Matter respectively. The former <b>makes</b> <b>an</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the electroweak hierarchy problem, and a particular class of theories that provide a solution to this puzzle: models based on the Twin Higgs mechanism. Chapters 3 and 4 are based on work published in [1] and [2], where novel theories of Dark Matter, and their phenomenology, are explored in the context of Twin Higgs models. Chapter 5 explores structural aspects of a particular mechanism â the so-called 'clockwork' â for generating hierarchies in parameters in a way that can be considered natural, and it is based on [3].

Other work published during my time as a graduate student include [4 â 7], but those publications are not the focus of this thesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} three {{case studies}} conducted to address two major {{problems in the}} area of chemistry education research, the lack of reported psychometrics regarding instrument scores, and the need for well-characterized assessments to evaluate college chemistry curricula. The first case study describes a psychometric evaluation of the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS), an instrument designed to assess student beliefs about the learning of chemistry. Results from this work suggest that the CLASS instrument provides fertile ground for short instruments with reasonable psychometric properties. Responses to a single scale instrument, created from CLASS, showed that students in an introductory general chemistry course tend to be slightly more expert-like than novice-like in their beliefs about chemistry {{towards the end of the}} semester. The second case study discusses the use of a two-tier diagnostic instrument in assessing student understanding of the particulate nature of matter and chemical bonding. In addition to examining psychometric properties of the instrument 2 ̆ 7 s scores, this study uses student responses to think about the role of a preparatory chemistry course in promoting understanding of the measured concepts. Results of this study showed that the performance of students with the preparatory chemistry course was slightly better than those without it. The third case study focuses on the development of the Targeted Misconception Inventory (TMI), a two-tier instrument designed to measure student understanding of Bond Energy, Ionic, Bonding, and Phase Changes. The TMI was used to create an instructional intervention. Results from the intervention suggested a learning gain for Bond Energy concept. The three instruments discussed above were multiple-choice given as paper and pencil tests in an introductory chemistry course. The work described in this dissertation showcase a method for examining psychometric evidence. The three case studies provide a significant addition to the psychometric information available on existing instruments. This work <b>makes</b> <b>an</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the importance of pilot testing instruments and gathering psychometric information to provide evidence that the instrument is functioning as intended when used with different samples.

Also, we exhibit two approaches to introducing q-analogs of vector bundles and defining the Chern-Connes index for them on quantum spheres. In accordance with the Serre-Swan approach, the q-vector bundles are treated as finitely generated projective modules over the corresponding quantum algebras. Besides, we describe the basic properties of the REA used in this construction and compare different ways of defining q-analogs of partial derivatives and differentials on the REA and algebras close to them. In particular, we present a way of introducing a q-differential calculus via Koszul type complexes.

This will not be without its limitations, however, considering incomplete MeerKAT band overlap with current VLBI arrays and the small (real-time) field-of-view afforded by the phased up MeerKAT array. We provide a brief overview of the significant contributions MeerKAT-VLBI could <b>make,</b> with <b>an</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the scientific output of several MeerKAT extragalactic Large Survey Projects.

50|$|Converxencia XXI is a Galician party, which {{identifies}} {{itself as}} Galicianist, Pro-Europeanist and liberal, {{being the first}} party of this ideology in the country. Converxencia XXI tries to provide solutions from a Liberal-Democrat point of view, which could help solving {{the debate on the}} real needs of the Galician society, now plunged into a severe economic and social crisis.These solutions range from the creation of a solid inner infrastructure network as a means of business enhancing, to the strategic projection of all Galician capitals. These measures are also meant to oppose spoil systems and the persistent local-minded subsidiary mentality. Converxencia XXI <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> special <b>emphasis</b> on multilingualism, European integration and cultural opening. The final goal is to provide social conditions which can lead to developing the maximum potential of all individuals.|$|R

It looks first at {{the links between}} trade openness, income distribution and relative factor abundance. Next, it uses the results obtained to analyse the changing relative resource endowment of Latin America and its distributive consequences. The main conclusion is that, behind the persistent high level of inequality in the region, substantive changes have been taking place. The Latin American pattern of relative resource abundance has changed with the inroads made by Asia, China and Russia into global trade, which have reduced Latin America’s relative abundance of unskilled labour and resources, respectively. The developed countries have expanded their endowment of fixed capital, while Latin America {{has not been able}} to accumulate the physical and human capital that would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> stronger <b>emphasis</b> on external trade compatible with greater income equity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{the article}} deals with various {{possibilities}} of using literary excerpts from dystopian narrative {{in the classroom}} of English learners from technical institutes. This approach could fit into the traditional and communicative methodology framework for furthering a more informed and deeper understanding of lexical and grammatical formulas, syntactic relations, discursive particulars and extralinguistic concepts. Science fiction texts with a clear dystopian undertone provide a rich material for language-based analysis and in-class discussions inspired by poignant multimodal creative discourse related to the spheres of engineering, robotics, academic research and daily life. Therefore, it could raise students’ motivation, professional curiosity and fascination with the English language that {{is now part of}} the technical university syllabus. Materials and Methods: the author uses the theoretical and practical suggestions put forward by Western teaching ideologists and practicionaries of such literature and language approach as well as attempts to summarize her own experience of working as an English teacher at the technical university. Certain literary excerpts from exemplary science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” (1968) have been chosen for analysis and discussion. Results: the article showcases language uses and discourse messages in the passages of our choice as potential material for developing tasks, activities and discussions that could contribute to expanding students’ linguistic competencies and communicative skills. This could become a way of humanizing technical education and introducing socio-cultural or technological dilemmas. Discussion and Conclusions: the ideas for grammatical or lexical exercises, entertaining tasks or debate topics can be incorporated into the English courses that <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>emphasis</b> on general, specific or academic aspects and seek to avoid overloading their syllabus with non-contextualized or condescending English language textual material. These suggestions could be taken into account for preparing regular lessons, reading sessions or home tasks...|$|R
