The production staff based a lot of the usage of time travel in [...] "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" [...] on those from the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990) and H. G. Wells' The Time Machine (1960). The goal of the crew was to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>everything</b> stayed strong to a certain logical standpoint, which led to several surreal conversations, including several paradoxes involving time travel. The crew members sought to venture into elements that seemed complicated, as their children viewers were deemed intelligent enough to understand such elements.

500|$|The Way I See It was {{engineered}} by Saadiq, Gerry Brown, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who mixed the album with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both liked to layer multiple instruments and, prior to recording, had contemplated {{techniques such as}} sampling and drum programming. However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s. To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied Mark Lewisohn's 1988 book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and microphone placement. They also studied Motown EQs to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts. Saadiq {{said that he had}} to disregard [...] "about 85 to 90 percent of the new techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at Abbey Road. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically." [...] Brungardt said in an interview for Mix that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where [...] "they wanted it clean with no distortion. I was taught {{to make sure it was}} polish, polish, polish, and to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>everything</b> fits right, the bass hits and things are clean for the big pop vocal." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Victoria and Albert Museum's Word and Image Department {{was under}} the same {{pressure}} being felt in archives around the world, to digitise their collection. [...] A large scale digitisation project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol {{and to create a}} factory to completely digitise the collection. [...] The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs using digital cameras. [...] The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. [...] Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. [...] 15,000 images were taken {{during the first year of}} the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. [...] The second step of the Factory Project is to catalogue everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. [...] All of those items which were photographed and catalogued, must be audited to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>everything</b> listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project.

[...] There is a [...] "Search the Collections" [...] feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. [...] The main impetus behind the large-scale digitisation project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.|$|E
