5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a <b>medium</b> <b>that</b> is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to be sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult <b>medium</b> <b>that</b> demands high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E
5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the {{selfish and}} petulant {{head of a}} {{research}} team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording <b>medium</b> <b>that</b> will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E
50|$|According to Göran Sonesson, a Swedish semiotician, {{pictures}} can {{be analyzed}} by three models: (a) the narrative model, which concentrates {{on the relationship between}} pictures and time in a chronological manner as in a comic strip; (b) the rhetoric model, which compares pictures with different devices as in a metaphor; and (c) the laokoon (or laocoon) model, which considers the limits and constraints of pictorial expressions by comparing textual <b>mediums</b> <b>that</b> utilize time with visual <b>mediums</b> <b>that</b> utilize space.|$|R

5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any <b>medium</b> <b>that</b> contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} life was {{improved}} with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the papermaking process which created a writing <b>medium</b> <b>that</b> was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with {{the invention of the}} seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today.|$|E

25|$|An artist {{may prefer}} a <b>medium</b> <b>that</b> stays fluid for some time, may want one that dries hard, or may want a <b>medium</b> <b>that</b> remains {{somewhat}} sticky. If the medium dries hard the artist can build up layers of color, which will fuse {{together in a}} single firing. This can create unusual intensity or depth of color. If the medium remains sticky the artist can add to the design by dusting more color onto the surface, or can dust on an overglaze powder to create a high gloss surface.|$|E
25|$|Now let us assume {{we have a}} <b>medium</b> <b>that</b> shows only {{nonlinear}} Kerr effect but its {{refractive index}} {{does not depend on}} frequency: such a medium does not exist, but it's worth considering it to understand the different effects.|$|E
