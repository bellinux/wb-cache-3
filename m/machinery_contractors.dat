40|$|Growers working {{together}} {{have proven to}} be a successful method for improving the utilization of farm resources and accelerating the adoption of the Sugar Yield Decline Joint Venture principles (SYDJV). The Pinnacle Precision Farming Group was formed in 2004 with the aim to bring together the ideas, knowledge and resources of growers in the Herbert region. Along with their common interest in controlled traffic, minimal tillage and crop rotations, the grower group utilize a farm <b>machinery</b> <b>contractor</b> to provide some of their major farming operations. This paper provides an insight into the changes made by the Pinnacle Precision Farming Group and their journey to adopt the new farming system practices. This paper also details the changes made by the group <b>machinery</b> <b>contractor</b> and a comparison of the old and new farming systems used by a group member. A focus point of the document is the impact of the new farming system on the economic, social and environmental components of the farming business. Analysis of the new farming system with a legume crop rotation revealed an increase in the farm gross margin by AU$ 22 024 and, in addition, a reduction in tractor operation time by 38 % across the whole farm. This represents a return on marginal capital of 14. 68 times the original capital outlay required by the group member. Using the new farming system without a legume crop will still improve the group members whole of farm gross margin by AU$ 6 839 and reduce tractor operation time by 43 % across the whole farm. The Pinnacle Precision Farming group recognize the need to continually improve their farming businesses and believe that the new farming system principles are critical for the long term viability of the industry.

50|$|Involvement in {{a market}} garden lets {{immigrant}} groups who otherwise have few marketable skills apart from their labour, become {{actively involved in the}} market economy. Benefits are that it does not rely on education or language, it adapts well to providing work for extended family groups, and in large market growing regions even wider community support networks. Sharing of knowledge and experience within communities reduces risks, and supports a network of other trades such as carriers, market agents, and heavy <b>machinery</b> <b>contractors,</b> and contract farm labour. Market-gardening land is typically relatively cheap and allows immigrants to purchase land, often with an accompanying residence, far more readily than in urban settings. However, like all agriculture it risks crop failure, market collapse and competition from industrialised broad-acre farming and 'fresh-frozen' imported produce. Other risks are from hazards such as pesticide use, especially where the market gardeners are not trained in their use or able to read product information. Another consequence is marginalisation of the succeeding generation where they are relied upon as the fittest and strongest to succeed in continuing the farm rather than pursue other ambitions and opportunities.|$|E
40|$|Maize silage {{is a basic}} forage in many {{overseas}} countries yet its use {{is still}} inits infancy in Australia's livestock industries. Our foragemaize crops are generally higher yielding but of lower quality than those grown in Europe but are {{on a par with}} those grown in the United States. Genetic diversity of maize hybrids and the ranges in crop management and climate in Australiahave produced silages withvariable nutritive values. Stage of maturity at harvest is important and a milk line which marks the margin between the starch and milk phase in the grain correlates well with crop dry matter (DM) content, has been adopted in N. S. W. Until recently, little attention has been given to the role of maize silage as a supplement to grazing animals. Research at Kyabram has quantified marginalresponsesto supplementationandthe effect of pasture quality on milk responses to various levels of maize silage in the diets of grazing cows. Duringearly lactation, marginal responses are approximatelyl. 0 1 milk/kg silage DM on grass and 1. 4 1 milk/kg silage DM on higher quality clover diets. Cows grazing grass pastures (containing up to 25 g N/kg DM) can consume up to 40 % of their diet as maize silage before requiring additional protein supplements whereas cows grazing clover pastures (with 35 g N/kg DM) can show milk responses with up to 60 % maize silageintheir diet DM. The potential for maize silage in beef production has been shown at Wagga Wagga where growth rates of over lkg/day were achievedinyoung steers fed entirely on maize silage plus minerals plus urea. The integration of clover pastures and conserved forage crops should lead to large productivity gains which on irrigated dairy farms in northern Victoria, could amount to over 80 % above current levels. Maize silage can constitute over 75 % of the diet of intensively fed beef cattle in the U. K. Because of its unequalled capacity to produce utilized metabolizable energy for livestock and a better infrastructure for silage making (<b>machinery,</b> <b>contractors,</b> off-farm maize growers), maize silage should become an important source of quality forage for dairy and beef cattle throughout Austra 3,i...|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturer}} hired inside {{contractors and}} provided materials and <b>machinery.</b> Each inside <b>contractor</b> {{was expected to}} hire his own employees and meet certain production and quality goals, but everything else was left to him. As a result, the system rewarded ingenuity, but also rewarded local optimization. For example, {{it was to the}} inside contractor's benefit to allow machinery to deteriorate {{toward the end of his}} contract since maintenance was costly and he might not reap the long-term benefit if he didn't get another contract. The system was eventually replaced with the factory system, in which everyone was an employee of the manufacturer directly.|$|R

However, {{it is believed}} that the campaign, led by the NBA activists, has held up the project's completion, and NBA supporters have attacked on local people who accepted compensation for moving. Others have argued that the Narmada Dam protesters are little more than environmental extremists, who use pseudoscientific agitprop to scuttle the development of the region and that the dam will provide agricultural benefits to millions of poor in India. There had also been instances of the NBA activists turning violent and attacking rehabilitation officer from Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA), which caused damage to the <b>contractor's</b> <b>machinery.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 1995 among 135 commercial farmers in KwaZulu-Natal to analyse labour remuneration and farmers' perceptions {{about the impact of}} labour legislation recently extended to agriculture. Farm labour remuneration normally includes cash wages and payments in kind (such as rations, housing, land use rights and clothing). The study suggests that, all things being equal, farmers who pay relatively lower cash wages tend to provide more rations per worker and allocate more land use rights. Most respondents agreed that there is some need for labour legislation in agriculture, but the majority perceived the present legislation to be time-consuming and costly, and wanted the legislation to be less ambiguous, more flexible and less extensive. Labour legislation has increased transaction and wage costs in farming and could lead to the substitution of own machinery, contract machinery or contract labour for own labour. Survey respondents indicated that, if minimum wages were imposed, cash wages would be paid and perquisites would be charged for. If the minimum wage was set above present wages, labour would be replaced with <b>machinery</b> and <b>contractors.</b> Respondents would prefer an industrial council to determine minimum wages (if they are imposed), accounting for enterprise and regional differences.

50|$|In a 2011 report, The Economist {{noted the}} rural road scheme and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee to be India's biggest single welfare project, costing over $8 billion a year. Alone, it eats up over 3% of all public {{spending}} in India. The report claims Jairam Ramesh, the minister {{in charge of}} the central government department administering the program, criticises uneven, patchy implementation of the scheme. He describes wasteful construction of items such as roads that quickly crumble away. The results, in many areas, fall short of the huge sums spent. The funds aimed to employ local villagers through their panchayats is not changing the quality of rural roads, rather ending up in wasteful spending and corrupt government officials’ pockets. The gloomiest estimates suggest two-thirds of allocated scheme funds is being squandered. A review published by the Ministry in September 2011 found that skilled technicians were unavailable at almost every site. There were rules banning the use of <b>machinery</b> or <b>contractors,</b> labour is usually by shovel, resulting in patchy construction of roads, drains, ponds, dams and other assets that are of very poor quality. The government scheme has failed to improve India's awful rural infrastructure. These rural roads get washed away each monsoon, only to be rebuilt, badly, the following year.|$|R

40|$|Government of India {{like other}} governments has been facing {{the problem of}} unemployment. During its course of {{independent}} existence, it has charted out various schemes to eradicate the same. In {{the course of the}} study we trace some of these schemes and land up at the most popular and mass scheme of its time i. e. National Rural Employment Generation Scheme (NREGS). This is {{the first of its kind}} as it attaches a legal framework to the aspect of employment, limits <b>machinery</b> and <b>contractor</b> usage and typically promotes works affecting the environment. In all, it’s a scheme where we have the beneficiaries working for their own benefit in the long run. It’s in fact has government evincing strong interest in improving the livelihood of the rural masses. With a predominant rural population and the policy makers plagued with the fundamental problem of migration; this scheme theoretically seems to be the perfect solution provider. Given the size of funds allocated and the number of stakeholders involved; it becomes very important that a study is made to suggest procedural changes and bring out flaws, if any. It has been facing many a problems. Some of the problems are inherent in the very nature of the scheme itself; some generated during the course of it and some courtesy the people involved in the same. The problems are discussed at length in the present study. Each of them is dissected to find out the root cause, the problems are described and ultimately suggestions are made for each of them. We arrive at the benefits to the rural masses, who actually work, both the societal and financial benefits, benefits to the government in terms of easy monitoring, identifying accountability and financial management and lastly benefits to the local statutory authorities in terms of easy monitoring and generating goodwill. The paper draws importance because of the usage of technology. It is one stopover for generating social upliftment in rural India. In a country like India where social upliftment is linked closely with financial gains, the technology suggested is not out of place. In Odisha particularly, the backwardness has always been a perennial constraint in further development. But courtesy this, the state has a chance to showcase to the entire country about the maturity and seriousness in its thinking process; ultimately aimed towards not only optimum usage of Central Government’s funds but also quick progress in the desired rural development. Smart card (the paper discusses) has been used for various purposes. But in this paper the authors describe the usage of it in a manner suited to the typical processes under NREGS. Charity and no free lunches are possible; financial(s) with receivable cash flows are also described to generate viability for the entities involved...|$|R
