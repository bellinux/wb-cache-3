5|$|The {{earliest}} tree-like organisms were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, {{which grew}} in {{forests in the}} Carboniferous period. The first tree may have been Wattieza, fossils {{of which have been}} found in New York State in 2007 dating back to the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago). Prior to this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest known tree. Both of these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the Triassic period. The gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, gnetales and ginkgos and these may have appeared {{as a result of a}} whole genome duplication event which took place about 319 million years ago. Ginkgophyta was once a widespread diverse group of which the only survivor is the <b>maidenhair</b> <b>tree</b> Ginkgo biloba. This is considered to be a living fossil because it is virtually unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic deposits.|$|E

A temperature and/or photoperiod flowering threshold is suggested. Daily temperatures and daylengths at five Ginkgo sites in continental U. S. for January-April 1964 - 1974 were evaluated. A computer program was designed to estimate daily photothermal equivalent (PTE = temperature and photoperiod), and the magnitude and duration of the PTE {{in relation to a}} series of photothermal constants. Use of the data from production and nonproduction years provided a mathematical model for prediction of dispersal unit production.

2500|$|With {{the extra}} {{captured}} water, the Mullum Mullum Creek has carved a steep [...] "V" [...] shaped gorge with rocky cascades. Here {{in the damp}} shadows, tall old growth riparian forests provide habitat for koalas and native birds species. <b>Maidenhair</b> ferns and <b>tree</b> ferns thrive. The drier hillsides are home to native orchids and echidnas. Passing under the steep bushland escarpment below Poynton Avenue in Ringwood, the rocky cascades and fern covered banks of the Mullum Mullum gorge become apparent. Tall manna gum woodlands, some with treefern understorey, are home to tawny frogmouths and sugar gliders. Near Schwerkolt Cottage, the rocky cascades are bordered by drier open grassy woodlands, rare Valley Heathy Forest rich with native orchids, particularly near Antonio Park, Yarran Dheran, the Hillcrest area at Mitcham, and the Chaim Court bushland and pipe-track at Donvale.|$|R

50|$|When Broussonet {{returned}} to his homeland in 1782, he brought a Chinese <b>maidenhair</b> <b>tree</b> (Ginkgo biloba), given by Sir Joseph Banks and the first specimen of this tree imported into France. This species is often called a living fossil because it was first observed by Europeans in fossil records before they discovered living trees in the Zhejiang province in eastern China. He presented this rare tree to Gouan, then Directeur du Jardin des plantes de Montpellier, who planted it in the garden in 1788, where it can still be found. Broussonet also spent several months botanizing in the South of France and Catalonia with John Sibthorp (1758-1796) with Father Pierre André Pourret (1754-1818).|$|E

50|$|The Saxon Garden, {{covering}} {{an area of}} 15.5 ha, {{was formally}} a royal garden. There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are {{a place to sit}} and relax. At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated. In the 19th century the Krasiński Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: <b>maidenhair</b> <b>tree,</b> black walnut, Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasiński Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. Łazienki Park covers an area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. Wilanów Palace Park dates back to {{the second half of the}} 17th century. It covers an area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, Baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Królikarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of extraction process on the extraction efficiency and composition of selected extracts from the <b>maidenhair</b> <b>tree</b> (Ginkgo biloba L.) green and yellow leaves. Taken three-step extraction, where water, solution of acetone and water and ethyl alcohol were used, effectiveness by evaluating the content of total polyphenols was estimated. In the next step yield of selected extraction processes was estimated, then UV spectra of the obtained extracts and their content of phenolic acids. The content of phenolic compounds in the following extracts showed high efficiency of the first extraction process. Analysis of UV spectra allowed to deduce the presence of phenolic compounds in all tested extracts. The absorption maxima were recorded at wavelengths between 290 nm and 350 nm. Analysed extracts showed high content of phenolic acids. The largest of the sum of phenolic acids was estimated in the acetone-water extract from green leaves and in water extract from yellow leaves.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} a phylogenic tree for green plants by comparing 5 S rRNA sequences. The tree {{suggests that the}} emergence {{of most of the}} uni- and multicellular green algae such as Chlamydomonas, Spirogyra, Ulva, and Chlorella occurred in the early stage of green plant evolution. The branching point of Nitella is a little earlier than that of land plants and much later than that of the above green algae, supporting the view that Nitella-like green algae may be the direct precursor to land plants. The Bryophyta and the Pteridophyta separated from each other after emergence of the Spermatophyta. The result is consistent with the view that the Bryophyta evolved from ferns by degeneration. In the Pteridophyta, Psilotum (whisk fern) separated first, and a little later Lycopodium (club moss) separated from the ancestor common to Equisetum (horsetail) and Dryopteris (fern). This order is in accordance with the classical view. During the Spermatophyta evolution, the gymnosperms (Cycas, Ginkgo, and Metasequoia have been studied here) and the angiosperms (flowering plants) separated, and this was followed by the separation of Metasequoia and Cycas (cycad) /Ginkgo (<b>maidenhair</b> <b>tree)</b> on one branch and various flowering plants on the other...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of subzero temperature interactions with elevated CO 2 on plant carbon metabolism has received rather little attention, despite their likely role in influencing future vegetation productivity and dynamics. Here {{we focused on}} the critical issues of CO 2 -enrichment effects on leaf-freezing temperatures, subsequent membrane damage, and recovery of the photosynthetic system. We show that growth in elevated CO 2 (70 Pa) results in a substantial and significant (P < 0. 01) increase (up to 4 °C) in the ice nucleation temperature of leaves of <b>Maidenhair</b> <b>tree</b> (Ginkgo biloba), which was observed consistently throughout the 1999 growing season relative to their ambient CO 2 (35 Pa) counterparts. We suggest that increased sensitivity of leaves to ice damage after growth in elevated CO 2 provides an explanation for increased photoinhibition observed in the field early and late in the growing season when low nighttime temperatures are experienced. This new mechanism is proposed {{in addition to the}} earlier postulated explanation for this phenomenon involving a reduction in the rate of triose-P utilization owing to a decrease in the rate of carbohydrate export from the leaf...|$|E
40|$|The use of food {{supplements}} containing botanicals is increasing in European markets. Although intended {{to maintain the}} health status, several cases of adverse effects to Plant Food Supplements (PFS) have been described. To describe the self-reported adverse effects collected during the European PlantLIBRA PFS Consumer Survey 2011 - 2012, with a critical evaluation of the plausibility of the symptomatology reported {{using data from the}} literature and from the PlantLIBRA Poisons Centers' survey. From the total sample of 2359 consumers involved in the consumers' survey, 82 subjects reported adverse effects due to a total of 87 PFS. Cases were self-reported, therefore causality was not classified on the basis of clinical evidence, but by using the frequency/strength of adverse effects described in scientific papers: 52 out of 87 cases were defined as possible (59. 8 %) and 4 as probable (4. 6 %). Considering the most frequently cited botanicals, eight cases were due to Valeriana officinalis (garden valerian); seven to Camellia sinensis (tea); six to Ginkgo biloba (<b>Maidenhair</b> <b>tree)</b> and Paullinia cupana (guarana). Most adverse events related to the gastrointestinal tract, nervous and cardiovascular systems. Comparing the data from this study with those published in scientific papers and obtained by the PlantLIBRA Poisons Centers' survey, some important conclusions can be drawn: severe adverse effects to PFS are quite rare, although mild or moderate adverse symptoms can be present. Data reported in this paper can help health professionals (and in particular family doctors) to become aware of possible new problems associated with the increasing use of {{food supplements}} containing botanicals...|$|E
40|$|Strains of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) were {{characterized}} using random amplified polymorphic (RAPD) -PCR and sequence {{analysis of the}} 16 S- 23 S rDNA intergenic spacer regions (ISR). Results indicated that all mulberry leaf scorch (MLS) strains and the heavenly bamboo strain formed a cluster. Strains isolated from daylily, jacaranda and magnolia clustered with the Xf subspecies sandyi; strains isolated from spanish broom, a redbud strain, two new peach strains and several almond strains clustered with Xf subspecies fastidiosa, and the oak strains formed a separate cluster. Predicted members of the Xf subspecies multiplex were the strains isolated from purple leafed-plum, olive, peach, plum, some almond, sweet gum, <b>maidenhair</b> <b>tree,</b> crape myrtle and one redbud. Pathogenicity of MLS strains was demonstrated in glasshouse assays by stem inoculating mulberry, grape and oleander with Xf isolate morus 059 grown for 7 days on PW. Three months post-inoculation, only inoculated mulberries exhibited leaf scorch symptoms and bacteria were recovered {{from most of the}} inoculated mulberries but not from oleander or grape. Given that strains isolated from magnolia (MG 038), jacaranda (JM 028), and daylily (HEM 034) always grouped with oleander strains, we tested their ability to produce disease in oleander and grape. The three strains MG 038, JM 028, and HEM 034 caused oleander leaf scorch (OLS) but not Pierce’s disease (PD) symptoms and bacteria were re-isolated from oleanders that were diseased. This study served as a confirmation of our genetic results, as well as an indirect demonstration that the Xf subspecies sandyi might be found in other hosts than oleander.

In this study, the hydro-Methenolic extract from bark of Ginkgo biloba was {{screened}} for their in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. The antibacterial activities of extract against both Gram-positive & Gram-negative bacteria was determined by agar well diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), relative percentage inhibition and antioxidant activity was determined by means of 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl hydrazyl (DPPH), Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and reducing power scavenging activity. The antimicrobial potency of extract based on their zones of inhibition (mm) and MIC values and relative percentage inhibition. The extract exhibited maximum zone of inhibition against Streptococcus faecalis and minimum zone of inhibition against Escherichia Coli. The MIC values of extract and standard drug ranges between 2. 5 - 6 mg/ml and 0. 92 - 3. 5 μg/ml respectively. Extract exhibited maximum relative percentage inhibition against Streptococcus faecalis (77. 4 %) and lowest against Proteus vulgaris (42. 03 %). For antioxidant activity, results of 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl hydrazyl and hydrogen peroxide method, was expressed as IC 50. Ascorbic acid was used as standard showed IC 50 of 20. 4 μg/ml & 95 μg/ml respectively whereas extract of bark of Ginkgo biloba showed IC 50 of 40 μg/ml & 105 μg/ml respectively.
