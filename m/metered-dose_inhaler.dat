25|$|There is an {{epinephrine}} <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> sold over-the-counter in the United States for {{the relief}} of bronchial asthma. It was introduced in 1963 by Armstrong Pharmaceuticals. In 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that inhalers, which contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), failed {{to comply with the}} environmental regulations of the Montreal Protocol and therefore could not be manufactured or sold after December 31, 2011. In April 2013, after completing several years of trials, Armstrong Pharmaceuticals submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA for an hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) version.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scope of}} medical {{practice}} for EMTs is regulated by state law, and can vary significantly both among {{states as well}} as inside states. In general, EMTs provide what is considered basic life support and are limited to essentially non-invasive procedures. Besides employing basic medical assessment skills, typical procedures provided by EMTs include CPR, Automated external defibrillation, mechanical ventilation using a bag-valve mask, placement of air way adjuncts such as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways, pulse oximetry, glucose testing using a glucometer, splinting (including spinal immobilization and traction splints), and suctioning. In addition, EMT-Bs are trained to assist patients with administration of certain prescribed medications, including nitroglycerin, <b>Metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> such as albuterol, and epinephrine auto injectors such as the EpiPen. EMT-Bs can typically also administer certain non-preprescribed drugs including oxygen, oral glucose, and activated charcoal (usually upon medical direction). In response to the opioid overdose epidemic, states are rapidly changing protocols to permit EMT-Bs to administer naloxone as well.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Metered-dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> {{are only}} one type of inhaler, {{but they are the}} most {{commonly}} used type. The replacement of chlorofluorocarbons propellants with hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA) resulted in the redesign of <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> in the 1990s. For one variety of beclomethasone inhaler, this redesign resulted in considerably smaller aerosol particles being produced, and led to an increase of potency by a factor of 2.6.|$|R

50|$|In 1956, a {{technology}} competing against the nebulizer was launched by Riker Laboratories (3M), {{in the form}} of pressurized <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhalers,</b> with Medihaler-iso (isoprenaline) and Medihaler-epi (adrenaline) as the two first products. In these devices, the drug is cold-fill and delivered in exact doses through some special metering valves, driven by a gas propellant technology (i.e. Freon or a less environmentally damaging HFA).|$|R
50|$|Formoterol (INN) or eformoterol (former BAN) is a long-acting β2 agonist (LABA) {{used in the}} {{management}} of asthma and COPD. It is marketed in three forms: a dry-powder inhaler, a <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> and an inhalation solution, under various trade names including Atock, Atimos/Atimos Modulite, Foradil/Foradile, Oxeze/Oxis, and Perforomist. It is also marketed in the combination formulations budesonide/formoterol and mometasone/formoterol.|$|E
50|$|An asthma spacer is an {{add-on device}} used to {{increase}} the ease of administering aerosolized medication from a <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> (MDI). The spacer adds space {{in the form of}} a tube or “chamber” between the canister of medication and the patient’s mouth, allowing the patient to inhale the medication by breathing in slowly and deeply for five to 10 breaths.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of inhaler is the {{pressurized}} <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> (MDI). In MDIs, medication is typically stored in solution in a pressurized canister that contains a propellant, although it may also be a suspension. The MDI canister is attached to a plastic, hand-operated actuator. On activation, the <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> releases a fixed dose of medication in aerosol form. The correct procedure for using an MDI is to first fully exhale, place the mouth-piece of the device into the mouth, and having just started to inhale at a moderate rate, depress the canister to release the medicine. The aerosolized medication is drawn into the lungs by continuing to inhale deeply before holding the breath for 10 seconds to allow the aerosol to settle onto the walls of the bronchittus and other airways of the lung. Some inhalers are made to act instantly in case of an asthma attack, and others are made to act later.|$|E
5000|$|Fluorocarbons {{are also}} used as a {{propellant}} for <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> used to administer some asthma medications. The current generation of propellant consists of hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA), which has replaced CFC-propellant-based inhalers.

HFA propellant inhalers like FloVent and ProAir ( [...] Salbutamol [...] ) have no generic versions available as of October 2014.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{show that}} nebulizers {{are no more}} effective than <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> (MDIs) with spacers and that MDIs may offer advantages in children with acute asthma. Those findings refer specifically {{to the treatment of}} asthma and not to the efficacy of nebulisers generally, as for COPD for example. For COPD, especially when assessing exacerbations or lung attacks, evidence shows no benefit from MDIs over nebulizers.|$|R

5000|$|Acute {{exacerbations}} {{are typically}} treated {{by increasing the}} use of short-acting bronchodilators.

These medications can be given either via a <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> with a spacer or via a nebulizer with both appearing to be equally effective. Nebulization may be easier for those who are more unwell. Oxygen supplementation can be useful. Excessive oxygen; however, can result in increased [...] levels and a decreased level of consciousness.|$|E

50|$|A <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> (MDI) is {{a device}} that {{delivers}} a specific amount of medication to the lungs, {{in the form of}} a short burst of aerosolized medicine that is usually self-administered by the patient via inhalation. It is the most commonly used delivery system for treating asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory diseases. The medication in a metered dose inhaler is most commonly a bronchodilator, corticosteroid or a combination of both for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Other medications less commonly used but also administered by MDI are mast cell stabilizers, such as cromoglicate or nedocromil.|$|E

40|$|Richard Hodder, 1 David Price 21 Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; 2 Department of General Practice and Primary Care, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, ScotlandAbstract: Current {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) recommend the regular use of inhaled bronchodilator therapy in order to relieve symptoms and prevent exacerbations. A variety of inhaler devices are currently available to COPD patients, and the choice of device is an important consideration because it can influence patients&rsquo; adherence to treatment, and thus potentially affect the long-term outcome. The Respimat&reg; Soft Mist&trade; Inhaler (SMI) generates a slow-moving aerosol with a high fine particle fraction, resulting in deposition of a higher proportion of the dose in the lungs than pressurized <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> (pMDIs) or some dry powder inhalers (DPIs). We review clinical studies of inhaler satisfaction and preference comparing Respimat&reg; SMI against other inhalers in COPD patients. Using objective and validated patient satisfaction instruments, Respimat&reg; SMI was consistently shown to be well accepted by COPD patients, largely due to its inhalation and handling characteristics. In comparative studies with pMDIs, the patient total satisfaction score with Respimat&reg; SMI was statistically and clinically significantly higher than with the pMDI. In comparative studies with DPIs, the total satisfaction score was statistically significantly higher than for the Turbuhaler&reg; DPI, but only the performance domain of satisfaction was clinically significantly higher for Respimat&reg; SMI. Whether the observed higher levels of patient satisfaction reported with Respimat&reg; SMI might be expected to result in improved adherence to therapy and thus provide benefits consistent with those recently shown to be associated with sustained bronchodilator treatment in patients with COPD remains to be proven.

30|$|Introduction Nasal high-flow therapy (HFT) is {{increasingly}} used {{in intensive care}} for patients suffering from respiratory failure who also often require inhaled bronchodilators. Pressurized <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> (pMDIs) combined with spacers are convenient and cost-effective to generate aerosols for both ambulatory and mechanically ventilated patients. Therefore, administration of salbutamol within a spacer, placed in the HFT circuit, using a pMDI, could be relevant. The aim of this bench {{study was to determine}} optimal settings in this regard.|$|R
50|$|A <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> {{consists}} of three major components; the canister which is produced in aluminium or stainless steel by means of deep drawing, where the formulation resides; the metering valve, which allows a metered quantity of the formulation to be dispensed with each actuation; and an actuator (or mouthpiece) which allows the patient to operate the device and directs the aerosol into the patient's lungs., The formulation itself {{is made up of}} the drug, a liquefied gas propellant and, in many cases, stabilising excipients. The actuator contains the mating discharge nozzle and generally includes a dust cap to prevent contamination.|$|E
5000|$|Salmeterol is a long-acting β2 {{adrenergic}} receptor agonist (LABA) {{used in the}} maintenance and prevention of asthma symptoms and maintenance of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) symptoms. Symptoms of bronchospasm include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing and chest tightness. It is also used to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction). It is marketed as Serevent in the US. It is available as a dry powder inhaler that releases a powdered form of the drug. It was previously available as a <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> (MDI) but was discontinued in the US in 2002. [...] It is still available as an MDI in the UK as of 2013.|$|E
50|$|After {{removing}} the MDI’s cap, the MDI is {{inserted into the}} back-piece. The front part of the chamber is closed off by either a facemask that covers both the patient’s mouth and nose, or simply a mouthpiece that goes in the patient’s mouth. To administer the medication, the patient brings the facemask to the face (or the mouth-piece to the mouth) and depresses the <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> once, resulting in the release of one dose of medication. The medication from the MDI is then briefly suspended in the spacer’s chamber while the patient inhales the aerosolized medication by breathing in and out deeply at a slow rate. Some spacers are equipped with a whistle, which sounds as a warning when the patient is inhaling too quickly.|$|E

50|$|Medications are {{typically}} provided as <b>metered-dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> (MDIs) {{in combination with}} an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler.
