This left room for only three crewmen. The barrels were stowed on platforms over the tracks with foldable outer rails. According to a reliable report the medium vehicle carries 760 kg of bleach; a strip 1.7 m wide and 1.4 kilometers (just over a mile) long can be decontaminated by using a density of 300 g of bleach per square meter. The density at which the vehicle distributes decontaminant is independent of the vehicle speed, the <b>maximum</b> <b>potential</b> <b>density</b> is 600 g per square meter. In addition to this, each vehicle carries 16 decontamination canisters, each holding 22 lb of decontaminant, for use by hand on isolated areas.|$|E

To better understand and describe the Antarctic Slope Front at the Antarctic continental slope, the water masses near Antarctica are examined and their spatial distributions are described. Antarctic Surface Water over the Antarctic shelf regime is distinguished from underlying other water masses by a salinity criterion corresponding {{to the base of the}} potential temperature minimum layer of Antarctic Surface Water in the neighboring oceanic regime. This salinity varies with space and time from approximately 34. 35 to 34. 45, and is 34. 40 on average. Antarctic Surface Water has salinities less than the cut-off salinity. Shelf Water is defined as water over the Antarctic shelf regime with salinity greater than the cut-off salinity and potential temperature less than- 1. 7 'C. Low-salinity Shelf Water is distinguished from high-salinity Shelf Water by the <b>maximum</b> <b>potential</b> <b>density</b> of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water ([] = 27. 87 kg m- 3). Antarctic Slope Front Water is characterized by potential temperature between- 1. 7 'C and about 0. 2 'C, and salinity greater than the cut-off salinity. Antarctic Slope Front Water, produced by isopycnal mixing of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water with low-salinity Shelf Water, is referred to as low-salinity Antarctic Slope Front Water. High-salinity Antarctic Slope Front Water, produced by diapycnal mixing of low-salinity Antarctic Slope Front Water with high-salinity Shelf Water, is observed with densities greater than the maximum density of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (go = 27. 87 kg m- 1). Antarctic Slope Front Water is observed everywhere around Antarctica except in the Bellingshausen-Amundsen sector (between 63 ' and 155 'W) along the Antarctic continental slope. The presence of different water masses over the Antarctic continental margin produces V-shaped double meridional gradients: one (sloping down toward Antarctica) over the continental slope between Lower Circumpolar Deep Water and Antarctic Slope Front Water, and the other (sloping down toward the north) over the shelf break between Shelf Water and Antarctic Slope Front Water. The former is referred to as the Antarctic Slope Front, which is found wherever Antarctic Slope Front Water exists. To obtain westward geostrophic flows associated with the V-shape isopleths, shallow and deep references are required for the shelf regime and the oceanic regime, respectively...|$|E

The effect of HO (as produced by the enzymatic side-reaction of GOx) on BOd bioelectrocatalytic cathodes in E-BFCs was also investigated.

However, long-term testing (steady state, 24 hours) revealed that the quantity of HO produced by GOx {{is large enough to}} have detrimental effects on the performance of the E-BFCs. © 2014...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} how {{to maintain}} oceanic mixing along <b>potential</b> <b>density</b> surface in ocean data assimilation (ODA). It {{is well known that}} the oceanic mixing across the <b>potential</b> <b>density</b> surface is much weaker than that along the <b>potential</b> <b>density</b> surface. However, traditional ODA schemes allow the mixing across the <b>potential</b> <b>density</b> surface and thus may result in extra assimilation errors. Here, a new ODA scheme that uses <b>potential</b> <b>density</b> gradient information of the model background to rescale observational adjustment is designed {{to improve the quality of}} assimilation. The new scheme has been tested using a regional ocean model within a multiscale 3 -dimensional variational framework.

Forecast experiments also show that the new scheme significantly improves the model forecast skills through providing more dynamically consistent initial condition...|$|R

40|$|The {{valuation}} of an electricity storage device {{is based on}} the expected future cash ow generated by the device. Two potential sources of income for an electricity storage system are energy arbitrage and participation in the frequency regulation market. Energy arbitrage refers to purchasing (stor- ing) energy when electricity prices are low, and selling (discharging) energy when electricity prices are high. Frequency regulation is an ancillary service geared towards maintaining system frequency, and is typically procured by the independent system operator in some type of market. This paper outlines the calculations required to estimate the <b>maximum</b> <b>potential</b> revenue from participating in these two activities. First, a mathematical model is presented for the state of charge {{as a function of the}} storage device parameters and the quantities of electricity purchased/sold as well as the quantities o ered into the regulation market. Using this mathematical model, we present a linear programming optimization approach to calculating the <b>maximum</b> <b>potential</b> revenue from an elec- tricity storage device. The calculation of the <b>maximum</b> <b>potential</b> revenue is critical in developing an upper bound on the value of storage, as a benchmark for evaluating potential trading strate- gies, and a tool for capital nance risk assessment. Then, we use historical California Independent System Operator (CAISO) data from 2010 - 2011 to evaluate the <b>maximum</b> <b>potential</b> revenue from the Tehachapi wind energy storage project, an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) energy storage demonstration project. We investigate the <b>maximum</b> <b>potential</b> revenue from two di erent scenarios: arbitrage only and arbitrage combined with the regulation market. Our analysis shows that participation in the regulation market produces four times the revenue compared to arbitrage in the CAISO market using 2010 and 2011 data. Then we evaluate several trading strategies to illustrate how they compare to the <b>maximum</b> <b>potential</b> revenue benchmark. We conclude with a sensitivity analysis with respect to key parameters...|$|R
