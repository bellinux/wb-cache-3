5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the <b>metaphysis</b> in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|Hypertrophic {{osteodystrophy}} is a bone {{disease in}} rapidly growing large breed dogs. Signs include {{swelling of the}} <b>metaphysis</b> (the part of the bone adjacent to the joint), pain, depression, loss of appetite, and fever. The disease is usually bilateral in the limb bones.|$|E
2500|$|Developmental {{orthopedic}} diseases include panosteitis and hypertrophic osteodystrophy. [...] Panosteitis {{occurs in}} large and giant breed dogs usually between {{the age of}} five and fourteen months and manifests as fever, pain, and shifting leg lameness. [...] Hypertrophic osteodystrophy is also seen in young large and giant breed dogs and is characterized by pain, lameness, fever, and swelling of the long bone <b>metaphysis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Osteosarcomas tend {{to occur}} at the sites of bone growth, presumably because {{proliferation}} makes osteoblastic cells in this region prone to acquire mutations {{that could lead to}} transformation of cells (the RB gene and p53 gene are commonly involved). Due to this tendency, high incidence of osteosarcoma is seen in some large dog breeds (St. Bernards and Great Danes). The tumor may be localized {{at the end of the}} long bone (commonly in the <b>metaphysis).</b> Most often it affects the proximal end of tibia or humerus, or distal end of femur. Osteosarcoma tends to affect regions around the knee in 60% of cases, 15% around the hip, 10% at the shoulder, and 8% in the jaw. The tumor is solid, hard, irregular ("fir-tree," [...] "moth-eaten", or [...] "sun-burst" [...] appearance on X-ray examination) due to the tumor spicules of calcified bone radiating in right angles. These right angles form what is known as a Codman triangle, which is characteristic but not diagnostic of osteosarcoma. Surrounding tissues are infiltrated.|$|E

50|$|The <b>metaphysis</b> may {{be divided}} anatomically into three {{components}} based on tissue content: a cartilaginous component (epiphyseal plate), a bony component (<b>metaphysis)</b> and a fibrous component surrounding {{the periphery of}} the plate. The growth plate synchronizes chondrogenesis with osteogenesis or interstitial cartilage growth with appositional bone growth at the same that it is growing in width, bearing load, and responding to local and systemic forces and factors.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{characterized}} by the growth of cartilage-capped benign bone tumours around areas of active bone growth, particularly the <b>metaphysis</b> of the long bones. Typically five or six exostoses are found in upper and lower limbs. Most common locations are: ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>metaphysis</b> (...) is {{the narrow}} {{portion of a}} long bone between the {{epiphysis}} and the diaphysis. It contains the growth plate, {{the part of the}} bone that grows during childhood and as it grows, it ossifies near the diaphysis and the epiphyses.|$|E
50|$|Fracture {{sonography}} {{is suitable}} for the diagnosis of fractures of the shaft and <b>metaphysis</b> of bones. Because only the cortical surface can be visualized, sonography is suitable only for specific fractures. Joint fractures cannot be assessed properly. Sonography is feasible only in the growing bone.|$|E
50|$|During childhood, {{the growth}} plate {{contains}} the connecting cartilage enabling the bone to grow; at adulthood (between {{the ages of}} 18 to 25 years), {{the components of the}} growth plate stop growing altogether and completely ossify into solid bone. In an adult, the <b>metaphysis</b> functions to transfer loads from weight-bearing joint surfaces to the diaphysis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} its medical {{application}} as relating to bones, [...] "-physis" [...] can also mean [...] "to grow." [...] Specifically, as the term pertains to musculoskeletal medicine and orthopedics, [...] "physis" [...] refers to the region of a long bone between the epiphysis and the <b>metaphysis,</b> or in lay terminology, the [...] "growth plate".|$|E
50|$|Open {{reduction}} and internal fixation surgery is typically used to repair an osteochondral fracture. For a Type B1 partial articular fracture of the lateral condyle, interfragmentary lag screws {{are used to}} secure the bone back together. Supplementation of buttress screws or a buttress plate is used if the fracture extends to the proximal <b>metaphysis</b> or distal diaphysis.|$|E
5000|$|Chondromyxoid fibromas {{can share}} {{characteristics}} with chondroblastomas {{with regards to}} histologic and radiographic findings. However they more commonly originate from the <b>metaphysis,</b> lack calcification and have a different histologic organization pattern. [...] Other differential diagnoses for chondroblastoma consist of giant cell tumors, bone cysts, eosinophilic granulomas, clear cell chondrosarcomas, and enchondromas (this list is not exhaustive).|$|E
50|$|Developmental {{orthopedic}} diseases include panosteitis and hypertrophic osteodystrophy. Panosteitis {{occurs in}} large and giant breed dogs usually between {{the age of}} five and fourteen months and manifests as fever, pain, and shifting leg lameness. Hypertrophic osteodystrophy is also seen in young large and giant breed dogs and is characterized by pain, lameness, fever, and swelling of the long bone <b>metaphysis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{epiphysis}} (...) is {{the rounded}} {{end of a}} long bone, at its joint with adjacent bone(s). Between the epiphysis and diaphysis (the long midsection of the long bone) lies the <b>metaphysis,</b> including the epiphyseal plate (growth plate). At the joint, the epiphysis is covered with articular cartilage; below that covering is a zone similar to the epiphyseal plate, known as [...] bone.|$|E
5000|$|The second form is a torus or {{buckling}} fracture, {{caused by}} impaction. They {{are usually the}} result of a force acting on the longitudinal axis of the bone: they are typically a consequence of a fall on an outstretched arm, so they mainly involve the distal radial <b>metaphysis.</b> The word torus is derived from the Latin word 'torus,' meaning swelling or protuberance.|$|E
50|$|It {{is still}} not very clear why people with Apert Syndrome have both {{craniosynostosis}} and syndactyly. There has been one study that suggests {{it has something to}} do with the expression of three isoforms of FGFR2, the gene with the point mutations that causes the syndrome in 98% of the patients.KGFR, keratinocyte growth factor receptor, is an isoform active in the <b>metaphysis</b> and interphalangeal joints. FGFR1 is an isoform active in the diaphysis. FGFR2-Bek is active in the <b>metaphysis,</b> as well as the diaphysis, but also in the interdigital mesenchyme. The point mutation increases the ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2, and thus of its isoforms. This means that FGFR2 loses its specificity, causing binding of FGFs that normally do not bind to the receptor. Since FGF suppresses apoptosis, the interdigital mesenchyme is maintained. FGF also increases replication and differentiation of osteoblasts, thus early fusion of several sutures of the skull. This may explain why both symptoms are always found in Apert Syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Diagnosis {{relies on}} {{clinical}} signs and characteristic changes in radiographic {{images of the}} metaphyses. Bone changes can be observed on radiograph, and the disorder may progress to actual angular limb deformity. In the early stage of the illness, the metaphyseal area on X-ray may be observed to have an uneven radiolucent zone parallel to the physis with a thin band of increased radiodensity directly bordering the physis. Early stage radiographic changes have sometimes been described as having a [...] "moth-eaten" [...] appearance (see Figure 3). As the disease progresses, the radiolucent line may disappear and radiodensity may increase in the affected area as the body attempts to repair damage. Relapses can cause new radiolucent lines. This area is often followed by a dark line at the <b>metaphysis,</b> which may progress to new bone growth {{on the outside of}} that area. This area represents microfractures in the <b>metaphysis</b> and bone proliferation to bridge the defect in the periosteum.|$|E
50|$|A corner {{fracture}} or bucket-handle fracture is {{fragmentation of}} the distal end of one or both femurs, with the loose piece appearing at the bone margins as an osseous density paralleling the <b>metaphysis.</b> The term bucket-handle fracture is used where the loose bone is rather wide at the distal end, making it end in a crescent shape. These types of fractures are characteristic of child abuse-related injuries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{epiphyseal}} plate (or epiphysial plate, physis, or growth plate) is a hyaline cartilage {{plate in the}} <b>metaphysis</b> {{at each end of}} a long bone. It is the part of a long bone where new bone growth takes place; that is, the whole bone is alive, with maintenance remodeling throughout its existing bone tissue, but the growth plate is the place where the long bone grows longer (adds length).|$|E
50|$|The simple bone cyst is a common, benign, fluid-containing lesion, most {{commonly}} found in the <b>metaphysis</b> of long bones, typically the proximal humerus or femur. Pathologic fractures are common, often with minor trauma. These cysts typically resolve after skeletal maturity and are not typically associated with bone tumors. The cause is unknown. These were first recognised as a distinct entity in 1910. Jaffe and Lichtenstein provided a detailed discussion of simple bone cysts in 1942.|$|E
50|$|Radiographic {{features}} in infants are generally less severe than those seen in perinatal hypophosphatasia. In the long bones, {{there is an}} abrupt change from a normal appearance in the shaft (diaphysis) to uncalcified regions near the ends (<b>metaphysis),</b> which suggests the occurrence of an abrupt metabolic change. In addition, serial radiography studies suggest that defects in skeletal mineralization (i.e. rickets) persist and become more generalized. Mortality {{is estimated to be}} 50% {{in the first year of}} life.|$|E
50|$|Main {{feature of}} this type of {{fracture}} is a transverse subcondylar fracture with dissociation of the <b>metaphysis</b> from the diaphysis. The fracture pattern of the condyles is variable and all types of fractures can occur. This is a high energy injury with a complex mechanism that includes varus and valgus forces. Up to 33% of these fractures may be open, often with extensive soft tissue injuries and risk of compartment syndrome. Represents 20% of all tibial plateau fractures.|$|E
50|$|Triplane {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} at the epiphyseal plate of the tibia in early adolescence with {{involvement of the}} epiphysis and <b>metaphysis</b> of the tibia. The link presents two types of imaging. The first four images (figures 1-4) are radiographic images while the last 3 are CT scans of the left distal tibia and fibula. The first radiographic image is an anterior-posterior view of the distal third of the left tibia and fibula. The image presents a fracture of the distal epiphyseal plate of the tibia and fibula. The primary imaging (radiograph) identifies the abnormality in the anatomy of subject’s left distal tibia and fibula. However, {{it is difficult to}} view the extent of the fracture and classify the fracture based on radiographic image. Figure four is a CT scan of the posterior aspect of the left distal tibia and fibula. Note that in this image the extent of the fracture is more visible extending to the epiphysis and <b>metaphysis.</b> The type of fracture is a Salter-Harris type IV. The CT scan was an appropriate choice of advance imaging which helps clinicians determine the extent of the fracture and enable us to address the problem appropriately.|$|E
50|$|It usually {{presents}} in the {{vertebral column}} or long bones. Approximately 40% of all osteoblastomas {{are located in}} the spine. The tumors usually involve the posterior elements, and 17% of spinal osteoblastomas are found in the sacrum. The long tubular bones are another common site of involvement, with a lower extremity preponderance. Osteoblastoma of the long tubular bones is often diaphyseal, and fewer {{are located in the}} <b>metaphysis.</b> Epiphyseal involvement is extremely rare. Although other sites are rarely affected, several bones in the abdomen and extremities have been reported as sites of osteoblastoma tumors.|$|E
5000|$|Aneurysmal bone cysts are benign neoformations {{which can}} affect any bone. More than half {{occur in the}} <b>metaphysis</b> of long bones (especially femur and tibia) and between 12 and 30% in the spine. They were {{described}} in 1893 by Van Arsdale, who called these lesions [...] "homerus ossifying haematoma". In 1940 Ewing used the term [...] "aneurismal" [...] to describe these lesions. Jaffé and Lichtenstein first coined the term [...] "aneurismal cyst" [...] in 1942 In 1950 they modified this term to [...] "aneurismal bone cyst". They {{may be associated with}} bone tumors.|$|E
50|$|Slipped capital femoral {{epiphysis}} (SCFE or skiffy, slipped upper femoral epiphysis, SUFE or souffy, {{coxa vara}} adolescentium) {{is a medical}} term referring to a fracture through the growth plate (physis), which results in slippage of the overlying end of the femur (epiphysis). Normally, {{the head of the}} femur, called the capital, should sit squarely on the femoral neck. Abnormal movement along the growth plate results in the slip. The femoral epiphysis remains in the acetabulum (hip socket), while the <b>metaphysis</b> (end of the femur) move in an anterior direction with external rotation.|$|E
5000|$|Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy (HOD) is a bone {{disease that}} occurs in fast-growing large and giant breed dogs. The {{disorder}} is {{sometimes referred to as}} metaphyseal osteopathy, and typically first presents between the ages of 2 and 7 months. [...] HOD is characterized by decreased blood flow to the <b>metaphysis</b> (the part of the bone adjacent to the joint) leading to a failure of ossification (bone formation) and necrosis and inflammation of cancellous bone. [...] The disease is usually bilateral in the limb bones, especially the distal radius, ulna, and tibia.|$|E
