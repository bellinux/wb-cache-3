5|$|A major {{planning}} {{issue was}} {{the need for a}} <b>minicomputer</b> at the station. NDRE argued that it was fully capable of delivering such a system, but NTNF instead wanted to minimize risk by buying the PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation in the United States. However, NDRE was awarded the contract, in part because of NTNF's obligation to support Norwegian technology and in part because NDRE agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer if they could not successfully manufacture one themselves. A new <b>minicomputer,</b> SAM-2, was built at NDRE and completed in April 1967. It was the first computer built in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. SAM-2 was so successful that the developers established Norsk Data to commercialize the technology.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, MIT had {{acquired}} the DEC PDP-1 <b>minicomputer,</b> {{the successor to}} the TX-0, which also used a vector display system. The system's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that, like with the TX-0, the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs for the computer which were not directly academically related whenever {{it was not in}} use. In 1961-62, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen created the game Spacewar! on the PDP-1, inspired by science fiction books such as the Lensman series. The game was copied to several of the early <b>minicomputer</b> installations in American academic institutions, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, DEC {{employee}} David H. Ahl converted two <b>minicomputer</b> games, Hamurabi and Lunar Lander, {{from the}} FOCAL language to BASIC, partially {{as a demonstration}} of the language on the DEC PDP-8 <b>minicomputer.</b> Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter he edited, both ones he wrote and reader submissions. In 1973, he released the book 101 BASIC Computer Games, containing descriptions and the source code for video games written in BASIC. The games included were written by both Ahl and others, and included both games original to the language and ported from other languages such as FOCAL. Many of these ports were originally mainframe computer games. 101 BASIC Computer Games was a landmark title in computer games programming, and was a best-selling title with more than 10,000 copies sold—more sales than computers in existence at the time. Its second edition in 1978, titled BASIC Computer Games, was the first million-selling computer book. As such, the BASIC ports of mainframe computer games included in the book were often more long-lived than their original versions or other mainframe computer games.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{pioneering}} {{computer companies}} first built <b>minicomputers,</b> such as DEC, Data General, and Hewlett-Packard (HP) (who now refers to its HP3000 <b>minicomputers</b> as [...] "servers" [...] rather than [...] "minicomputers"). And although today's PCs and servers are clearly microcomputers physically, architecturally their CPUs and operating systems have developed largely by integrating features from <b>minicomputers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1986, DEC added VAXclustering {{support to}} their MicroVAX <b>minicomputers,</b> running over Ethernet instead of {{special-purpose}} hardware. While not giving the high-availability {{advantages of the}} CI hardware, these Local Area VAXclusters provided an attractive expansion path for buyers of low-end <b>minicomputers.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} Lunar Lander {{game was}} a 1969 text-based game called Lunar, or alternately the Lunar Landing Game. It was originally {{written in the}} FOCAL programming language for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 <b>minicomputer</b> by Jim Storer while a student at Lexington High School {{in the fall of}} 1969. Storer submitted the game to the DEC users' newsletter, which distributed the source code to readers. Other versions of the concept were written soon after: a version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC, among others.|$|E
5|$|Parallel to NDRE's work, NTNF {{was working}} with ESRO to gain support for a {{telemetry}} station. There was a degree of urgency as ESRO wanted the facility completed by 1967 {{in time for the}} launch of the spacecraft ESRO-2. NTNF and ESRO were also working on the establishment of Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund. The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. Part of the reason for the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and digital computing. For NDRE the station was a chance to apply its latest <b>minicomputer,</b> the Simulation for Automatic Machinery (SAM).|$|E
5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 <b>minicomputer.</b> Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E

5|$|Another {{influential}} early mainframe {{game was}} Baseball, a sports game {{that was created}} on a PDP-10 <b>minicomputer</b> at Pomona College in 1971 by English major Don Daglow. Baseball was the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players {{at the beginning of}} a game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Baseball was continually updated through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk the batter, or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and the batter to hit. The results of the play would be printed out onto paper as a verbose description, like a radio description of the game. Daglow went on to develop more sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with Intellivision World Series Baseball, and 1987 with Earl Weaver Baseball, as well as numerous other games.|$|E
5|$|Mainframe {{computers}} are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes. Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely {{available to the}} general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and the relatively smaller and cheaper <b>minicomputer</b> variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers. Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost as older computers were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 <b>minicomputer,</b> with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E

5|$|The 1969 Mansfield Amendment, {{which ended}} {{military}} funding of non-military research, {{the end of}} the Vietnam War, and {{the end of the}} Apollo program reduced ARC's funding from DARPA and NASA. SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of artificial intelligence researcher Bertram Raphael, who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to a company called Tymshare. Engelbart's house in Atherton, California burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over NLS and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff including its creator as a Senior Scientist, renamed the software Augment, and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS; when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a <b>minicomputer</b> called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.|$|E
5|$|Some {{mainframe}} {{games that}} did not appear in 101 BASIC Computer Games have still had a lasting impact. One such game was Space Travel, developed by Ken Thompson in 1969, which simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies. The game was developed at Bell Labs, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 <b>minicomputer.</b> While porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed ideas for his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by Bushnell and Dabney during 1970–71 to be a coin-operated version of Spacewar. After the pair were {{unable to find a}} way to economically run the game on a <b>minicomputer</b> such as the Data General Nova, they hit upon the idea of instead replacing the central computer with custom-designed hardware created just to run that game. After they built an early proof of concept and founded Syzygy Engineering, Bushnell found a manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. Working in partnership with Nutting, the pair ran their first location test in August 1971, a few months prior to the display of a similar prototype called Galaxy Game, also based on Spacewar. After encouraging initial results, though mixed responses from distributors, Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1,500 units with the anticipation of a hit game. While the game was successful and validated Syzygy's belief in the future of arcade video games, selling over 1,000 cabinets by mid-1972 and ultimately 1,300–1,500 units, it was not the runaway success that Nutting had hoped for. The game spawned one clone game, Star Trek (1972), and Nutting produced a two-player version of Computer Space in 1973 without involvement from Syzygy before closing in 1976. Syzygy went on to be incorporated as Atari, with their next arcade game the successful Pong (1972). Although not as influential as Pong, Computer Spaces release marked the initial start of the commercial video game industry.|$|E

25|$|A <b>minicomputer</b> is a {{class of}} {{multi-user}} computers that lies in the middle range of the computing spectrum, in between the largest multi-user systems and the smallest single-user systems. Wesley A. Clark and Charles Molnar co-invented the PDP-8 in 1965, the world's first <b>minicomputer,</b> using integrated circuit technology. Because of its relatively small size and its $18,000 price tag, Digital Equipment only sold several hundred units.|$|E
25|$|Soon the {{majority}} of the <b>minicomputer</b> and mainframe vendors instigated projects to combine the two, producing an OOP library format that could be used anywhere. Such systems were known as object libraries, or distributed objects, if they supported remote access (not all did).

25|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} {{features of the}} Wang PC was the system software. Similar to the Wang VS <b>minicomputer,</b> the command line was not immediately evident.

This software was later sold in MS-DOS compatible form for non Wang hardware.|$|E
