An important type of potential chemical reaction between <b>metal</b> <b>flashing</b> materials is galvanic corrosion. Copper and lead cannot be used in contact with or even above aluminum, zinc, or coated steel without {{an increased risk of}} premature corrosion. Also, Aluminum and zinc flashing cannot be used in contact with pressure treated wood due to rapid corrosion. Aluminum is also damaged by wet mortar and wet plaster. Salt spray in coastal areas may accelerate corrosion. so stainless steel, copper, or coated aluminum are recommended flashing materials near salt water.|$|E

40|$|The cutting {{heads of}} the first 18 {{instruments}} in six sets of clinically used Lightspeed instruments (sizes 20 - 65) were examined in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three sets had been used by full-time faculty and discarded as follows: instrument sizes 20 - 32. 5 after 18 treated root canals; instrument sizes 35 - 47. 5 after 36 treated root canals; and instrument sizes 50 - 65 after 54 treated root canals. Three other sets had been used by a private clinician who discarded all Lightspeed instruments after preparing 20 root canals. The cutting {{heads of the}} 108 instruments were examined {{for the presence of}} surface debris, <b>metal</b> strips, <b>metal</b> <b>flash,</b> disrupted cutting edges, microfractures, tears, pitting and fretting and fatigue cracks. Fewer instruments ultrasonically cleaned before examination in the SEM had debris than those not cleaned before examination. The prevalence of metal strips and <b>metal</b> <b>flash</b> was similar for both groups. In contrast, microfractures and tears were more prevalent in instruments used by the full-time faculty group, who used their instruments more frequently before discarding them. Pitting and fretting occurred equally frequently in both groups whilst no fatigue cracks were noted in any of the 108 instruments. Overusage of Lightspeed instruments may predispose the flutes of the cutting heads to microfractures and clinicians should be aware of this possibility...|$|R

40|$|Many new {{rotary files}} {{systems have been}} introduced, however, limited {{research}} has been conducted related to the surface irregularities of these files and if these have any effects on the files themselves. Hence, the aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze surface irregularities of the ProTaper® Universal rotary files (PTU) and the ProTaper Next? rotary files (PTN) before and after instrumentation in curved canals. The main objective was to investigate the nature of these irregularities and how they might influence the use and fracture of rotary files during root-canal treatments. The files were examined pre-operatively using a stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) to analyze surface imperfections and the presence of particles. Mesial roots of forty extracted mandibular molars were selected. Each instrument was used to prepare one of the mesial canals. The files were then rinsed with alcohol, and autoclaved and analyzed again. Of the 80 files used in this study, five files fractured, five files unwound and seven files were curved or bent and they all belonged to the PTU group. Irregularities and debris could be visualized with the SEM on both unused PTU and PTN files. Most of the debris was found associated with deeper milling grooves and defects on the surface of the metal. Surface analysis of the files that were used and sterilized were performed and the SEM images demonstrated organic debris, <b>metal</b> <b>flash,</b> and crack formation and initiation of fractures for both file types. All files showed machining grooves, <b>metal</b> <b>flash,</b> debris, and defects on cutting edges. These irregularities appear to be critical in the accumulation of debris and initiation of fatigue and crack propagation within the NiTi alloy. The accumulation of debris could be a concern due to the potential exchange of organic debris between patients...|$|R

50|$|The shop front {{has a wide}} awning {{that extends}} out over the footpath. Two doors {{fronting}} Grafton Street, which are set off centre, provide access to each shop. Next to each door is a large display window. The front window on the southern shop has been replaced with a window incorporating louvres but the northern shop moulded outer timber window frame remains original but has been modified from four panes to a single pane. Above each door is another smaller window, possibly originally a hopper. A brick parapet was made prior to 1927 and the mid section of the parapet raised at the front sometime after. There are 2 steeply pitched corrugated iron gabled roofs over each shop, of uniform height.

40|$|Rain wetting {{pattern on}} {{buildings}} revealed that horizontal projections {{have a major}} impact on the wetting and staining of building faces. <b>Metal</b> <b>flashing</b> is typically used at these locations to shed water away from building surfaces. Guideline manuals such as building codes, CMHC best practice guides and other technical documents do not provide any specific requirements for the flashing design. Neither do they provide any guidelines for flashing implementation, in particular the sealant application below the drip-edge of the <b>metal</b> <b>flashing.</b> Observation of buildings during rain-events revealed that buildings with excessive wetting and staining below the wall/flashing interface had no standard procedures for the design and/or the implementation of the flashing. Further, the extent of sealant application varied between projects. In some instances sealant was applied flush with the drip-edge, directing water on the building face. Previous studies have shown that the geometry of horizontal projection affects the water flow over building faces. Previous investigators have also studied the importance of variables such as the angle and length of the drip, in the performance of the drip-edge. However, the impact of sealant application on the effectiveness of profiles has not been studied. The curren...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To assess {{morphological}} alterations of ProTaper rotary NiTi files {{before and}} after continuous use by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Study Design: 30 root canals were chosen with an angle between 15 and 30 º. Before starting to prepare the canals the files were observed microscopically using a scanning electronic microscope. The ProTaper sequence recommended by the manufacturer was used, with NaOCl as irrigant. The instruments were sterilised after every three canals were shaped. The instruments were observed with the same microscope after shaping each canal, until 30 root canals were shaped. The criteria used for checking the instruments were: blunt cutting edges, disruption of cutting edge, microfractures, fatigue cracks, <b>metal</b> <b>flash,</b> dentine remains. Results: Many microscopic defects were found such as: cutting edge breaks (up to 70 %); fatigue cracks, between 33 and 100 %. No microfractures were found. An S 1 and an SX file were fractured. Conclusion: ProTaper instruments are quite reliable if used following usual requirements...|$|R

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Now days a {{considerable}} {{progress in the}} production of instruments for canal preparation can be seen. Efficiency and resistance of files during canal preparation are very important. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare surface defects in Aryatec, Mailifer Stainless-Steel(ss) and Mailifer Nickle-Titanium(Ni-Ti) K-files before and after canal preparation. Materials & Methods: This experimental study was done on the 3 groups consist of aryatec and mailifer ss K-files and Mailifer Ni-Ti K-file. In each group 30 files were selected. Each file pre and post instrumentation was observed for flextion, cracks, fracture, <b>metal</b> <b>flashing,</b> stretching, and partial clockwise using light streomicroscope at a magnification of 40 x. The data were analysed using  2 and ANOVA. Result: In all group no crack and partial clockwise were observed. Flexion in aryatec was more than the others (P 0. 05). 4 aryatec files had primary stretching and 1 mailifer Ni-Ti file were fractured after 5 times that differences were not significant(P> 0. 05). Conclusion: There are no significant differences between surfaces defects in aryatec, mailifer ss and mailifer Ni-Ti before and after canal preparation...|$|E
40|$|Tree-dwelling mammals are {{potentially}} highly vulnerable to discontinuities in habitat created by roads. We used population modeling {{to assess the}} viability of a metapopulation of Australia&# 8217;s largest gliding marsupial, the greater glider (Petauroides volans), occurring in forest remnants in the fastest-urbanizing region of Australia, where habitat is dissected by major roads. Crossing structures for arboreal mammals (consisting of a land bridge with wooden poles for gliding and adjacent rope canopy bridges) have been installed over an arterial road that separates two of these remnants (one large, one small). It is currently unknown whether this species will use the crossing structures, but available tree height and spacing do not allow a glide crossing, and fences with <b>metal</b> <b>flashing</b> prevent access to the road by terrestrial and arboreal mammals. Our modeling reveals that even a relatively low rate of dispersal facilitated by these structures would substantially reduce the probability of extinction of the smaller subpopulation. This rate of dispersal is plausible given the small distance involved (about 55 m). The inclusion of wildfire as a catastrophe in our model suggests that these two remnants may encounter an undesirable level of extinction risk. This {{can be reduced to}} an acceptable level by including inter-patch movement via dispersal among other forest remnants. However, this requires connection to a very large remnant 8 km away, through a set of remnants that straddle two motorways. These motorways create discontinuities in forest cover that are beyond the gliding ability of this species. Crossing structures will be required to enable inter-patch movement. A priority for future research should be whether the greater glider will use road-crossing structures. Loss of habitat and habitat connections is continuing in this landscape and is likely to have dire consequences for wildlife if land managers are unable to retain appropriate habitat cover with corridors and install effective wildlife road-crossing structures where large roads intersect wildlife habitat...|$|E
