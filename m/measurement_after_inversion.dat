40|$|BACKGROUND: Factors {{potentially}} causing chronic instability <b>after</b> ankle <b>inversion</b> sprains {{have rarely}} been examined during the injuring movement. PURPOSE: To compare control of ankle movement during quiet stance and <b>after</b> <b>inversion</b> perturbation in chronically unstable ankles (n = 16) with healthy controls (n = 26). METHODS: Movement control was measured as magnitude of lateral ankle oscillation, using 3 SPACE Fastrak during single leg stance (baseline oscillation) in two foot positions, flat and demi-pointe. In both positions, time to resume baseline oscillation <b>after</b> <b>inversion</b> perturbation (perturbation time) of 15 degrees for the flat foot and 7. 5 degrees on demi-pointe was also determined. RESULTS: Baseline oscillation on demi-pointe was significantly smaller (P < 0. 005) for the sprained group (2. 5 +/- 0. 5 mm) than for controls (4. 0 +/- 2. 3 mm). Perturbation {{time for the}} flat foot was significantly longer (P < 0. 05) for the sprained group (2. 2 +/- 0. 4 seconds) than for controls (1. 8 +/- 0. 5 seconds). However, failure rate was higher (P < 0. 05) among the sprained group than controls for perturbation with the foot flat and baseline oscillation on demi-pointe. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrated altered sensorimotor control in chronically unstable ankles. Those sprainers who successfully completed the tasks minimized oscillation. The impairments in the sprained group may reflect deficits in either movement detection, peroneal muscle response, or both...|$|R

30|$|According to the {{calculation}} method of short circuit currents mentioned in Section  2, the three-phase short circuit currents are reciprocals of self-impedances.

Therefore, this calculation method makes the planning model a complex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Since it is a difficult task to solve the planning model, a specific method for linearizing short circuit currents will be proposed in Section  4.|$|R

We also discuss an effect of crystallographic symmetries determining the band structure of the topological nodal-line semimetals. Thanks to protection by the symmetries, the topological nodal-line semimetals can transit into the spinless Weyl semimetals or maintain the nodal lines in many crystals <b>after</b> <b>inversion</b> symmetry is broken.
