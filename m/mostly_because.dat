5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly understood, due {{to the ability of}} water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E

Daniel's Brigade resumed its attack, now to the east against Baxter on Oak Ridge. This time Rodes was more successful, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> Early coordinated an attack on his flank.|$|E

5|$|The dish {{has created}} {{a large number of}} {{spin-off}} recipes which are commonly used around the world. For example, Korean fried chicken, a dish which is commonly served as fast food in Korea and is known for being crispier than normal fried chicken. There is also a racial stereotype surrounding fried chicken and African-American people, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> it was popular among slaves in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the {{development}} of the Argentine economy, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> of the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations, which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers. Colonial Brazil, for example, imported as many as 2.5 million Africans in the 18th century. By contrast, an estimated 100,000 African slaves arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many were destined for Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.|$|E

5|$|Following his January 1860 {{resignation}} from Parliament, Ollivier spearheaded a requisition, broadly {{supported by}} influential people, to have Brittan make himself {{available for the}} resulting by-election in the Christchurch Country electorate. Brittan declined the requisition, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> he was opposed to the rail tunnel scheme which had overwhelming support by the population, {{and he could not}} see himself being their representative if he disagreed with this popular public opinion. Isaac Thomas Cookson, who had earlier supported the Brittan requisition, was elected.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Norsk Flytjeneste {{purchased}} two 50-passenger Douglas DC-6Bs from Braathens SAFE and leased {{one from}} Sterling Airways. They {{were used for}} domestic and international charter. The largest contract was from the Norwegian Church Aid, who contracted Norsk Flytjeneste to fly aid to Bangladesh. However, the airline failed to make money on the DC-6s, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> of the high operating costs, and sold them after a year. The company followed up with purchasing a ten-seat Cessna Citation business jet that they offered in the charter market. However, the market was not large enough, and the jet was sold.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while that in the United States as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more cost-effective than alternatives such as vancomycin, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> of the ability to switch from intravenous use to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E

5|$|The P-6 variant was {{the last}} {{production}} model of the He 111 P series. In 1940, the Ministry of Aviation abandoned further production of the P series in favour of the H versions, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> the P-series' Daimler-Benz engines were needed for Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighter production. The remaining P-6s were redesignated P-6/R2s and used as heavy glider tugs. The most notable difference with previous variants was the upgraded DB 601N powerplants.|$|E

Feeling bad with their awkward reunion, Jim catches up to Pam {{at the end of the}} day and informs her that he's seeing someone. While Pam assures him that they're still friends, Jim leaves shaken as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> of electronics-related {{applications}} that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – iridium crucibles {{are commonly used}} for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of iridium in 2007, electrodes for the chloralkali process (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).|$|E

5|$|A {{full-scale}} mockup of the Q-12 {{was ready}} by 7 December 1962, {{and had already}} undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the line was {{finished}} there were public calls from {{inside and outside the}} company for Helm to resign, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> of his support for a proposed Memphis branch of the railroad. To complete the branch, the Louisville and Nashville would have to complete a line from Bowling Green to Guthrie, Kentucky. There it would join a line owned by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that began across the state line at Clarksville, Tennessee and extended to Memphis. Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Opponents argued that the project was simply a ploy to whip up new support for the struggling railroad. Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of Dragoon by some Allied generals and contemporary commentators such as Bernard Montgomery, Arthur R. Wilson, and Chester Wilmot in the aftermath, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> of its geo-strategic implications. It was argued that Dragoon diverted highly-experienced men and much-needed material {{away from the}} continuing fighting at the Western front {{that could have been}} used, instead, to bolster the Italian front or to hasten the advance towards the Rhine by the Overlord forces. The resulting loss of momentum gave Stalin on the Eastern Front a free hand to pursue his offensive efforts with more determination, allowing him to win the race towards Berlin and occupy the Balkans. Dragoon therefore had consequences reaching into the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Films {{generate}} {{income from}} several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings {{are the primary}} metric for trade publications in assessing {{the success of a}} film, <b>mostly</b> <b>because</b> of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.|$|E
