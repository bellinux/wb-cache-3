5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

25|$|However, {{reminiscent}} of Maas's junior season in Oregon with Akili Smith, Higgins seemed unable to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> In {{a game against}} the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Ray struggled and Maas came in, successfully engineering an Eskimos comeback. Ray started the next game but in the game after, the second-to-last game of the season, Maas again appeared in relief and was again solid. Finally, in the last game of the year, Maas got the start and played well.|$|E
25|$|At Cheltenham College, {{where he}} was educated, they tell of a smart bit of fielding which he did when the M.C.C. played the College Eleven one year. He was bowling to George Hearne, who stepped back and pulled him twice between the wicket and mid-on. The third ball was bowled in the same place, and Hearne pulled it again; but Mr. Strachan moved a yard or two when he saw him <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> to hit in the same way, and brought off a {{remarkable}} catch yards from the wicket.|$|E
25|$|At some point, Colonel James Fannin {{became the}} {{commander}} of the troops at La Bahia. He renamed the presidio Fort Defiance. In February 1836, President Antonio López de Santa Anna led a large force of Mexican Army troops into Texas to quell the revolution. Santa Anna and part of his force entered Bexar on February 23 and initiated a siege of the Alamo. Alamo commander William B. Travis immediately sent a courier to Fannin, asking him to provide reinforcements to the Alamo. At first unable to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> Fannin finally decided to ride to the relief of the Alamo. Historian Robert Scott suggests that the trip was initiated after Fannin's objections were overridden by his officers.|$|E

25|$|In September 1990 Chrétien {{seeing a}} chance to make a strong {{impression}} on public opinion after a shaky start as a leader reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada the government had levied a 13.5% Manufacturer's Sales Tax (MST), which was paid by manufacturers, who passed on the cost of the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market, and to compensate the government had levied tariffs on manufactured imports to maintain a level playing field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer levy tariffs on American imports, which led to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the 7% GST, whose costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the GST was economically necessary vs. his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated, and as such, he was initially vague about where he stood about the GST. It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> to oppose the GST.|$|E
500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{displays}} Milo's growth; Leonard S. Marcus in {{his notes}} to its annotated edition {{writes that the}} boy learns to think in the abstract, pledging after his unintentional jump to Conclusions {{that he will not}} <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> again without a good reason. [...] Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not. Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it will be like to do the same. According to Liston, Milo [...] "transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities".|$|E
500|$|... "4 in the Morning" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani and Kanal, who was also {{responsible}} for its production, while Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent provided additional production. Described as a 1980s-inspired midtempo synthpop ballad, the track's instrumentation includes a [...] "light" [...] keyboard, which [...] "runs tie the song together from intro through break", a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] has a midtempo beat, which according to some critics is [...] "perfect for a slow dance". Stefani's vocals throughout the song's chorus presents a [...] "fast-talking" [...] approach. Lyrically, [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] talks about transparency in a romantic relationship, with the protagonist pleading for a lover to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> Bill Lamb of About.com added that the song also deals with a relationship on the edge, which {{can be seen in}} the lines: [...] "I'm lying here in the dark, I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "I give you everything that I am/I'm handing over everything that I've got/'cause I wanna have a really true love." ...|$|E

500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith met Kissinger in Pretoria on 18 September 1976 {{to discuss}} the terms. The American diplomat told the prime {{minister}} that although he was obliged to take part, his participation in what he termed the [...] "demise of Rhodesia" [...] was [...] "one of the great tragedies of my life". All the same, he encouraged Smith strongly to accept the deal he placed on the table, though {{he knew it was}} unpalatable, as any future offer could only be worse. Western opinion was already [...] "soft and decadent", Kissinger warned, and would become even more so if, as projected, American President Gerald Ford lost that year's presidential election to Jimmy Carter. A session including Kissinger, Smith and Vorster then began, and here Smith relayed his concern that his acceptance could be perceived by the Rhodesian electorate as [...] "selling out" [...] and could cause a mass exodus of skilled workers and investment, which would in turn severely damage the country's economy. Vorster requested a break in the session and took Smith's team into a private side-room, accompanied by South African Foreign Minister Hilgard Muller. There he privately informed Smith that it was no longer viable for South Africa to support Rhodesia financially and militarily, and that Smith should <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> quickly and announce his acceptance that evening. This ultimatum deeply shocked the Rhodesian team; two of Smith's ministers, Desmond Lardner-Burke and Jack Mussett, were unable to contain their anger and vociferously berated the South African prime minister for his [...] "irresponsibility", leading Vorster to rise from his seat without a word and leave the room.|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t {{make up my mind}} about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E

2500|$|In his Curentul Nou period, Sanielevici {{focused his}} {{attention}} on the young novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, whose work he considered the main manifestation of Sămănătorism. To his critic's dismissive remarks, Sadoveanu replied with a violent article in the political gazette Voinţa Naţională: [...] "I promise you a stern comeback, and do {{let me know if}} there is any clean spot on your body that may yet receive it." [...] The first fissures between Sanielevici and his Poporanist colleagues began to show at roughly the same time. Emerging as one of the Poporanist ideologues around 1905, Ibrăileanu defended Sadoveanu against Sanielevici's observations. This stance probably helped Sadoveanu to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> about leaving the Sămănătorists and joining the Viaţa Românească group, while the controversy only increased his exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Art {{director}} Hiroshi Ono {{stated that}} he initially could not <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> whether {{to work on this}} project or not, saying [...] "The information they gave me was enough to see that this {{was not going to be}} a straightforward job. The story takes place in Versailles and stretches from France to Russia and England. This means that you can't reuse the same background elements throughout the series, and instead you have to create new ones for each episode. Traveling stories are always the most difficult projects of all." [...] Ono was responsible for the background designs used in the series, and he used photographs and classical paintings as references. 3D CGI was used in the creation of certain backgrounds and settings for the series, such as the Hall of Mirrors.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 November, Churchill {{returned}} to the topic. Speaking in the Address in Reply debate, after giving some specific instances of Germany's war preparedness, he said [...] "The Government simply cannot make up their mind or they cannot get the Prime Minister to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> So they go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all powerful for impotency. And so we go on preparing more months more years precious perhaps vital for the greatness of Britain for the locusts to eat." [...] Robert Rhodes James called this one of Churchill's most brilliant speeches during this period, Baldwin's reply sounding weak and disturbing the House. The exchange gave new encouragement to the Arms and the Covenant Movement.|$|E

2500|$|Schwarzenegger's {{endorsement}} in the Republican primary of the 2008 U.S. {{presidential election}} was highly sought; despite being {{good friends with}} candidates Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani {{dropped out of the}} presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, [...] "It's Rudy's fault!" [...] (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind).</b> Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.|$|E
2500|$|Another change {{occurred}} {{right around}} the Romantic literary period (19th century), known for its emphasis on the individual and internal motive. The Romantic period viewed Hamlet {{as more of a}} rebel against politics, and as an intellectual, rather than an overly-sensitive, being. This is also the period when the question of Hamlet's delay is brought up, as previously it could be seen as plot device, while romantics focused largely on character. Samuel Coleridge, for example, penned a criticism of Hamlet during this period that raises views which continue to this day, saying basically that he is an intellectual who thinks too much, and can't <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> [...] He extended this to say that Shakespeare's ultimate message was that we should act, and not delay. Coleridge and other writers praised the play for its philosophical questions, which guided the audience to ponder and grow intellectually.|$|E

After exchanging them repeatedly, Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely, [...] "Plastic tips! Metal tips! I can't stand it anymore!" [...] A variation in 1948 was with an expensive wallet, but repeatedly changing the greeting card, prompting Blanc to shout, [...] "I haven't run into anyone like you in 20 years! Oh, why did the governor {{have to give me}} that pardon!?" [...] Benny then realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for $1.98, whereupon the store clerk responds by committing suicide. Over the years, in the Christmas episodes, Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged cuff links, golf tees, a box of dates, a paint set (water colors or oils), and a gopher trap. In later years, Benny would encounter Mel Blanc's wife (played by Jean Vander Pyl) or the clerk's psychiatrist at the store, and drive them crazy as well.|$|E
