5|$|In 2001, Orton {{signed a}} deal with the then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was sent to its {{developmental}} territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued his training. During his time in OVW, Orton wrestled the likes of Rico Constantino and The Prototype and teamed with Bobby Eaton during a tag team title tournament. He won the OVW Hardcore Championship twice by defeating <b>Mr.</b> <b>Black</b> on February 14, 2001, and Flash Flanagan on May 5, 2001, respectively. On several occasions he faced Rico Constantino on combined WWF/OVW events, and also lost to The Prototype (John Cena) in a tag match on July 28 in Jacksonville, Indiana. He also began appearing on several WWF house shows that were unaffiliated with OVW, the first being on May 1, 2001 when he faced Billy Gunn. After taking the mic and promising to beat Gunn, Orton was defeated. That fall he began appearing regularly on WWF house shows and dark matches, facing Chuck Palumbo, Steven Richards, and Shawn Stasiak, but mostly wrestling in tag team matches.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} the {{children}} should go to a camp run by Krusty was first suggested by David M. Stern. The animators were enthusiastic about making this episode because they had all gone to summer camps as children and {{thought it would be}} a fun episode to write for. The writers also thought that [...] "it would be fun if while the kids are gone Homer and Marge find that as the kids are miserable their marriage is better than ever." [...] The layout for Bart and Lisa's cabin was influenced by the director, Mark Kirkland, who as a child went to a Boy Scout camp that had exposed wires and other similar faults. Kirkland was also sure that the character <b>Mr.</b> <b>Black</b> was going to reappear later in the series, but he never did. Al Jean commented, [...] "I guess that the hydrofoil really got <b>Mr.</b> <b>Black</b> out of the show forever." ...|$|E

Then sudden light seemed to flash in {{her eyes as she}} extended both hands.|$|R

500|$|To {{keep the}} {{children}} complacent, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Black</b> informs the campers that Krusty has finally come, {{but it is}} actually Barney dressed as Krusty. Bart leads the campers in rebellion, driving out <b>Mr.</b> <b>Black</b> and the bullies, and changing the camp's name to Camp Bart. Kent Brockman reports on the revolt, where Bart explains the camp's deplorable conditions that caused him and the campers to rebel in the first place. The stress of seeing Bart {{as the leader of}} the rebellion during the report on TV causes Homer to immediately lose the hair he grew and regain the lost weight. Krusty is called away from his vacation, and arrives at the camp where the kids at first don't believe its him, until a rough search reveals his iconic pacemaker scar. Krusty apologizes to the children for the poor conditions, saying that he was bribed to approve the camp. As compensation, Krusty takes them to [...] "the happiest place on Earth", Tijuana, Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Ham {{promptly}} countersued, {{blaming the}} initial lawsuit on poor advice Black received {{from his new}} personal assistant, his mother-in-law Jonni Hartman.

For that commitment, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Black</b> should show a little gratitude and honor his contracts".|$|E
500|$|Preservation Act 1 (1973) and Preservation Act 2 (1974) {{received}} generally poor reviews. The {{story on}} the albums involved an anti-hero called Mr Flash, and his rival and enemy <b>Mr</b> <b>Black</b> (played by Dave Davies during live shows), an ultra-purist and corporatist. Preservation Act 2 was the first album recorded at Konk Studio; from this point forward, virtually every Kinks studio recording was produced by Ray Davies at Konk. [...] The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the Preservation story for stage. Musicologist Eric Weisbard: [...] " [...] Davies expanded the Kinks into a road troupe of perhaps a dozen costumed actors, singers and horn players.... Smoother and tighter than on record, Preservation live proved funnier as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Bart Simpson {{is one of}} Krusty's biggest fans. In {{the episode}} [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (Season 1, Episode 12) he {{declared}} [...] "I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings" [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to {{the air with a}} comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately forget about it, presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Black,</b> brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E

2500|$|The lead character's iconic coffin arsenal {{has been}} paid homage in several movies and TV series, {{including}} several Japanese anime series. Fist of the North Star features a plot device wherein the lead character, Kenshiro, drags a coffin behind him into a wasteland town. [...] In the Cowboy Bebop episode, [...] "Mushroom Samba", a bounty hunter runs around with a coffin behind him. The character Wolfwood in Trigun has a cross-shaped arsenal case called the Punisher which he carries frequently that is reminiscent of Django's coffin. The character Beyond The Grave (formerly Brandon Heat), of Gungrave, carries a metal coffin-shaped device which houses a variety of weapons. The fantasy movie Death Trance features a protagonist dragging a sealed coffin around {{for much of the}} film. In the Brazilian pornochanchada film Um Pistoleiro Chamado Papaco (A Gunman Called Papaco), the title character spends the whole film carrying a coffin and the opening scene is inspired by Corbucci's film. The main character [...] of the Boktai series of video games is a vampire hunter named Django, who drags a coffin around for sealing and purifying immortals. In the PlayStation 2 game Red Dead Revolver, the boss <b>Mr.</b> <b>Black</b> carries around a coffin that houses a Gatling Gun.|$|E
