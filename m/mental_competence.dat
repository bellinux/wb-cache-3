40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{structure}} and the predictors of two psychological experiences of technostress {{associated with the use}} of information and communication technologies (ICT), i. e., technostrain (users report feelings of anxiety, fatigue, scepticism and inefficacy beliefs related to the use of technologies) and technoaddiction (users feel bad due to an excessive and compulsive use of these technologies). The study included a sample of 1072 ICT users (N[*]=[*] 675 nonintensive ICT users and N[*]=[*] 397 intensive ICT users). Results from multigroup confirmatory factor analyses among non-intensive and intensive ICT users showed, as expected, the four-factor structure of technostrain in both samples. Secondly, and also as expected, confirmatory factorial analyses revealed that technostress experiences are characterized not only by technostrain but also by an excessive and compulsive use of ICT. Moreover, multiple analyses of variance showed significant differences between non-intensive and intensive ICT users (1) in the dimensions of technostress and (2) in specific job demands and job/personal resources. Finally, linear multiple regression analyses revealed that technostrain is positively predicted by work overload, role ambiguity, emotional overload, mobbing and obstacles hindering ICT use, as well as by lack of autonomy, transformational leadership, social support, ICT use facilitators and <b>mental</b> <b>competences.</b> Work overload, role ambiguity and mobbing, as well as the lack of emotional competences, positively predict technoaddiction.

The validity of many items is not evident, so the examined person does not know what is measured, which reduces the possibility that the answers are distorted in order to be social acceptable. The answers are divided into four basic scales, every two of these scales are merged into the higher factors and the total score is made out by combining these two factors. The total score expresses "the overall fullness of the existence or "the subjective perceived meaningfulness of the existence.

Proponemos la enseñanza-aprendizaje de nuevas competencias mentales como: aprender a conocer, a hacer, a querer, a sentir, a convivir, a ser. Se requiere una teoría de la mente que incorpore los conocimientos disponibles desde las diversas ciencias cognitivas, particularmente la Neuropsicologia. Comentamos la Teoría Triárquica de la Inteligencia de Sternberg y la Teoría de las Inteligencias Múltiples de Gardner. Ambas teorías pretenden superar los modelos unidimensionales de la inteligencia y ofrecer una teoria más integradora de la mente. Las dos teorías fundamentan un programa para desarrollar la inteligencia práctica y diseñar estrategias de intervención eficaces en diferentes contextos: familiar, escolar, social. Analizamos criticamente tal Programa de Inteligencia Práctica que consideramos muy valioso y que hemos adaptado, aplicado y evaluado en investigaciones y tesis doctorales.

We are commenting on Sternberg’s Triarchic Theory of human intelligence and Howard Gardner’s Multiple intelligences Theory. Both theories aim at overcoming the one-dimensional models of intelligence in order to offer a more comprehensive theory of mind. Both theories set the foundations for the creation of programs that develop practical intelligence and also for designing interventional strategies which are effective in different contexts: academic, familial, social. We offer a critical analysis of this Programme for the Development of Practical Intelligence which we find particularly valuable and which we have adapted to our purposes, for its implementation and evaluation in our research papers and Doctoral theses...|$|R

40|$|Background Globally, {{there is}} {{increasing}} emphasis {{on the importance of}} understanding the ways in which social inequality and injustice impact individual and community mental health. Set in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, India, this thesis examines the complex relationships between individuals, communities and the social environment in relation to mental health. North India is characterised by stark gender and socio-economic inequalities and social exclusion for people with psycho-social disability (PPSD) and mental health services in these study areas were essentially absent. Community mental health competency means people are collectively able to participate in efforts to promote, prevent, treat and advocate for mental health. This thesis reflexively examines the presence and absence of community <b>mental</b> health <b>competence</b> in the upper Ganges region. Methods A mixed methods approach allowed for a multi-level examination of community <b>mental</b> health <b>competence,</b> and generated four sub-studies. In-depth interviews with thirteen PPSD and eighteen caregivers in Bijnor and Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh state) were carried out in 2013 providing data for qualitative analysis. These data were analysed using qualitative content analysis to examine experiences of exclusion and inclusion of PPSD in sub-study I, and thematic analysis to examine the gendered experiences of caregivers in sub-study II. A community based sample of 960 people in Dehradun district (Uttarakhand) were surveyed in 2014 to examine the prevalence, treatment gap and social determinants of depression in substudy III, and the attitudes and preferred social distance from people with depression and psychosis were investigated in sub-study IV. Multi-variate regression analysis in both studies was conducted with Stata software Version 13. 1. Results Within the domain of knowledge, relatively low community mental health literacy, a diverse range of explanatory models of mental health, and creative and persistent efforts in helpseeking were the themes identified. Within the domain of safe social spaces, social exclusion was harsh and prevalent for PPSD, with contrasting sub-domains of belonging, social support, social participation and ahimsa (non-violence). Women were disadvantaged more than men in most spheres of caregiving. Social determinants of depression with an adjusted odds ratio of more than 2. 0 included {{being a member of the}} most oppressed caste or tribal group, having taken a recent loan, and not completing primary schooling. The prevalence of depression was 6. 0 % in the community sample, and there was a 100 % treatment gap for counselling, and a 96 % treatment gap for anti-depressant therapy, even though 79 % of those with depression had visited a primary care provider in the previous three months. Social determinants of health and access to care are proposed as additional domains of community mental health competency. The prevailing gender regime that values males and disadvantages women influenced every domain of community mental health competency, particularly increasing caregiver burden, social exclusion and experiences of physical violence for women.   Conclusions In this thesis I have refined and strengthened a conceptual framework that portrays community <b>mental</b> health <b>competence</b> as a tree, where foundational roots of social determinants of mental health support four branches depicting access to care, knowledge, safe social spaces and partnerships for action. This tree model proposes that all five domains must operate in unison to support action for community mental health involving: development of community knowledge; promoting social inclusion, gender equality and participation; addressing upstream health determinants; and increasing access to mental health care. ...|$|R
40|$|Forensic {{psychiatry}} is {{a branch}} of psychiatry, which encompasses the interface between psychiatry and law, and involves knowledge from both fields.

40|$|Twenty {{years after}} the genocide, many Rwandans still suffer from the {{psychological}} wounds of the past. The country's mental health agenda is based on individualised and psychiatric approaches that help some but cannot be provided on a large scale. Further, many reconciliation initiatives {{have been based on}} public testimonies, which {{have been shown to be}} potentially re-traumatising, leading to calls for small-scale community-based approaches to healing, which constitute a middle way between individualised and public approaches. Drawing on the concept of ‘mental health competence’ (Campbell and Burgess, 2012), this study evaluates one such approach: the Life Wounds Healing workshops offered by the African Institute for Integral Psychology. Twenty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with former workshop participants, staff members and the institute's founder to investigate their views on how these workshops can help genocide survivors. The results suggest that the workshops succeed in creating <b>mental</b> health <b>competence</b> by establishing a safe social space for people to open up, increasing people's critical understandings of the processes of pain — and potential for healing — that informs behaviour change, generating bonding social capital and offering participants' income-generating possibilities...|$|R

The court rejected Mr. Morin’s argument, among others, that the district court violated his due process rights by refusing to allow him to waive competency at trial. The court held that since his competency to stand trial was never challenged, the issue of whether he was entitled to waive competency to stand trial was properly not considered.|$|E

Insanity was a legal tactic invented to circumvent the punishments of the Church, {{which at the time}} included confiscation of the property of those who committed suicide, often leaving widows and orphans destitute. Only an insane person would do such a thing to his widow and children, it was successfully argued. This is legal mercy masquerading as medicine, according to Szasz.|$|E
50|$|Practically all {{indicators}} of physical health and <b>mental</b> <b>competence</b> favour people of higher socioeconomic status (SES).

SES and health outcomes are general across time, place, disease, and are finely graded up the SES continuum. Gottfredson argues that general intelligence (g) is the fundamental cause for health inequality. The argument is that g is the fundamental cause of social class inequality in health, because it meets six criteria that every candidate for the cause must meet: stable distribution over time, is replicable, is a transportable form of influence, has a general effect on health, is measurable, and is falsifiable.|$|E
40|$|Court-ordered {{psychological}} {{evaluations of}} criminal defendants generally include two types: <b>mental</b> status (<b>competence</b> or sanity) versus risk assessment. When defendants are deceptive in mental status evaluations, lies of commission, in which symptoms of psychopathology are feigned (malingering), are most likely. When defendants are deceptive in risk assessments, lies of omission, in which antisocial impulses are concealed or denied, are most likely. Four research conditions, {{consisting of the}} true and false statements of two men accused of sex offenses and two men claiming an insanity defense, were rated by participants on a test of truthfulness containing eight items derived from Criterion-Based Content Analysis and Reality Monitoring. All items, {{as well as the}} collective test score, significantly differentiated between true and false statements. Further, the lie of commission was rated as significantly more false than the lie of omission, and a confession was rated as more truthful than a true statement involving only exculpatory information, which is in accordance with the theory of cognitive load. Factor analyses provided support for the construct validity of the test of truthfulness and two subscales. Further, the data suggests that statements judged true are characterized by the presence of attributes of truthfulness, while statements judged false are characterized by the absence of attributes of truthfulness along with the presence of attributes of untruthfulness...|$|R

This suggests that entrepreneurs’ abilities to cope with the demands of entrepreneurship {{play a critical role in}} achieving success. Two important intangible resources available to entrepreneurs (that is psychological capital and social capital) could help cope with the challenging role of entrepreneurship, thereby enhancing chances of success. Baron (2000) suggested that successful entrepreneurs tend to demonstrate high levels of <b>mental</b> and social <b>competences.</b> The paper, therefore, examines the contribution of these intangible resources to objective and subjective entrepreneurial outcomes. We also posit the two intangible resources have interactive effects on entrepreneurial outcomes, such that effect of psychological on each specific outcome is higher when an entrepreneur has levels of social competence.|$|R

Canadian school-based mental health programs that focus on positive psychology and positive mental health initiatives emphasize safe and supportive environments, student engagement, resilience, and self-determination. This study examined predictors of mental fitness and its 3 components (autonomy, competence, and relatedness). METHODS School Health Action Planning and Evaluation System-Prince Edward Island (SHAPES-PEI) and the New Brunswick Student Wellness Survey (NB SWS) are data collection and feedback systems that survey youth about 4 health behaviors. Grade 7 - 12 students in Prince Edward Island (N[*]=[*] 3318) and New Brunswick (N[*]=[*] 7314) completed a mental fitness questionnaire in 2008 - 2009 (PEI) and 2006 - 2007 (NB). Four linear regression models were conducted to examine student characteristics associated with <b>mental</b> fitness, autonomy, <b>competence,</b> and relatedness. RESULTS Positive associations were found between school connectedness (p[*]<[*]. 0001) and mental fitness, as well as autonomy, competence, and relatedness. There were also significant relationships between affect, pro-social and antisocial behaviors, tried smoking, and mental fitness. CONCLUSION A better understanding of adolescent health and its predictors is needed. By identifying core parameters for mental fitness, we can inform how to address students' needs through appropriate programs and policies supporting healthy school environments...|$|R
