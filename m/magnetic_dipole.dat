5|$|The global {{definition}} of the Earth's field {{is based on a}} mathematical model. If a line is drawn {{through the center of the}} Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole,</b> the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Ramsey {{returned}} to Columbia as a professor and research scientist. Rabi and Ramsey picked up where they had left off before the war with their molecular beam experiments. Ramsey and his first graduate student, William Nierenberg, measured various nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> and electric quadrupole moments.With Rabi, he helped establish the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. In 1946, he became the first head of the Physics Department there. His time there was brief, for in 1947, he joined the physics faculty at Harvard University, where he would remain for the next 40 years, except for brief visiting professorships at Middlebury College, Oxford University, Mt. Holyoke College and the University of Virginia. During the 1950s, he was the first science adviser to NATO, and initiated a series of fellowships, grants and summer school programs to train European scientists.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E
5|$|High-resolution {{images of}} Io {{acquired}} when Io is experiencing an eclipse reveal an aurora-like glow. As on Earth, {{this is due}} to particle radiation hitting the atmosphere, though in this case the charged particles come from Jupiter's magnetic field rather than the solar wind. Aurorae usually occur near the magnetic poles of planets, but Io's are brightest near its equator. Io lacks an intrinsic magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter's magnetic field near Io directly impact Io's atmosphere. More electrons collide with its atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to Io (i.e. near the equator), because the column of gas they pass through is longest there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to rock with the changing orientation of Jupiter's tilted <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole.</b> Fainter aurora from oxygen atoms along the limb of Io (the red glows in the image at right), and sodium atoms on Io's night-side (the green glows in the same image) have also been observed.|$|E

40|$|We use an {{extended}} version of electrodynamics, which admits {{the existence of}} magnetic charges and currents, to discuss how different models for electric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles</b> do or do not carry hidden momentum {{under the influence of}} external electromagnetic fields. Based on that, we discuss how the models adopted for the electric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles</b> from the particles that compose a material medium influence the expression for the electromagnetic part of the light momentum in the medium. We show that Abraham expression is compatible with electric dipoles formed by electric charges and <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles</b> formed by <b>magnetic</b> charges, while Minkowski expression is compatible with electric <b>dipoles</b> formed by <b>magnetic</b> currents and <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles</b> formed by electric currents. The expression ε_ 0 E×B, on the other hand, is shown to be compatible with electric dipoles formed by electric charges and <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles</b> formed by electric currents, which are much more natural models. So this expression has an interesting interpretation in the Abraham-Minkowski debate about the momentum of light in a medium: It is the expression compatible with the nonexistence of magnetic charges. We also provide a simple justification of why Abraham and Minkowski momenta can be associated with the kinetic and canonical momentum of light, respectively.

5|$|Saturn has an {{intrinsic}} magnetic field {{that has a}} simple, symmetric shape – a <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole.</b> Its strength at the equator – 0.2gauss (20µT) – is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field. As a result, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's. When Voyager 2 entered the magnetosphere, the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1 million km (712,000mi), although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days. Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter – by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo. This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere. Saturn's magnetosphere, like Earth's, produces aurorae.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and {{discovered}} that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field. The value of the moment is about , which is three {{times larger than the}} magnetic moment of Mercury. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.|$|E

25|$|A {{magnetic}} field contains energy, and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy. When diamagnetic material {{is placed in}} a {{magnetic field}}, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field, thereby lowering the net field strength.

Saturn's <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> is strictly aligned with its rotational axis, meaning that the field, uniquely, is highly axisymmetric.

40|$|The general aims of {{the work}} in this thesis are to locate and {{quantify}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles</b> using a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) system based on Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) sensors, and to generate various target magnetic fields using <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles.</b> MEG provides direct, real-time measurements of magnetic fields at sub-millisecond temporal resolution and femtoTesla sensitivity. It is typically used to describe sources in terms of current dipoles, but here we adapt a different approach and use it to characterise <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles.</b> In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we describe initial experiments which were carried out in order to demonstrate the feasibility of using the high sensitivity of MEG SQUID sensors to detect extremely small magnetic field shifts due to magnetised samples, and to then locate and quantify the <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles.</b> We show that a standard MEG system can be used to measure magnetic field shifts due to susceptibility effects from samples exposed to an Ultra Low Field (ULF), as well as to detect and image the distribution of decaying longitudinal nuclear magnetisation from pre-polarised samples. During our experiments, we also identified a long-lived magnetisation in biological samples, whose magnetisation orientation is fixed by the sample orientation. This finding led us to carry out experiments on samples including human tissue (the hand, wrist, and foot) using MEG, and to characterise the magnetisation behaviour. Even though ULF Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has several benefits, it is difficult for it to compete with Ultra High Field (UHF) MRI since the higher the field is, the larger does the SNR tend to be. Yet, higher fields increase the effects of intrinsic magnetic susceptibility differences, which in turn leads to field inhomogeneities. Thus, in the second part of this thesis, we aim at improving the quality of high field MR images. We show how <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles</b> can be used to generate different target fields that can be used to shim different inhomogeneous magnetic fields at UHF. These <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipoles</b> can be realised using either an array of orthogonal coils or pieces of strongly diamagnetic material...|$|R

As EDMs violate both the parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries, their values yield a mostly model-independent measure of CP-violation in nature (assuming CPT symmetry is valid). Therefore, values for these EDMs place strong constraints upon the scale of CP-violation that extensions to the standard model of particle physics may allow.

At high temperature, there is no magnetization of a large sample of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall magnetization. This magnetization has a preferred direction, since one can tell the north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole.
