5|$|The South Link expansion, {{which was}} {{intended}} to replace the South Miami-Dade Busway, a bus rapid transit that opened in segments on February 3, 1997 and in April 2005, has plans for a widened right of way, elevated crossings at major intersections, {{as well as the}} possibility of building one additional Metrorail station at SW 104 Street to alleviate traffic and parking in Dadeland. Since 2009, the <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Organization</b> has proposed that the busway be opened to regular vehicle traffic by adding a SunPass toll system with the profits going towards busway improvements.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Miami Urban Area Transportation Study {{completed}} by the Dade County <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> <b>organization</b> recommended the construction for a rapid transit system for Greater Miami. Having experienced a prolonged post-World War II population boom, metropolitan Dade County's permanent population rose by 35% to nearly 1.3 million residents within a decade, among the fastest population growth rates in the United States. Within a year of the study, county residents approved a $132.5 million ($ million, adjusted for current inflation) bond dedicated to transit, with additional funding approved by the Florida Legislature for transit which, up until that time, operated solely on fare revenue. In 1976, with preliminary engineering completed for the system, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA, then, the Urban Mass Transit Administration) committed 80% of the costs for {{the first stage of}} rapid transit system, with the county and state incurring the remaining cost. In the end the system cost over a billion dollars.|$|E

25|$|The Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) is the <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Organization</b> (MPO) for the Albany Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Every {{metropolitan}} {{area in the}} United States {{with a population of}} over 50,000 must have a MPO in order to get any federal transportation funding. The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) uses an MPO to make decisions on what projects are most important to a metro area for immediate versus long term funding. The USDOT will not approve federal funds for transportation projects unless they are on an MPO's list. The Adirondack/Glens Falls Transportation Council (A/GFTC) is the MPO for the Glens Falls MSA (and the town of Moreau, in Saratoga County).|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} set to reach a final {{decision}} {{on the future of}} I-81 with input from many local groups, or stakeholders. In early May 2011, this official process was started by two entities: NYSDOT and the Syracuse Metropolitan Transportation Council (SMTC), the region’s <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> <b>organization.</b> NYSDOT is responsible for overseeing the process and, eventually, its construction. SMTC consists of member agencies that have a stake in transportation decisions in Central New York. Both parties have yet to reach a decision, but they hope to eventually reach one that {{is in the best interest}} for everyone in the greater Syracuse area. In late March 2011, SMTC and NYSDOT announced the formation of the I-81 Community Liaison Committee (CLC). The CLC is made up of representatives from 37organizations and will give ideas and point out concerns about the future of I-81 in Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|Metro Transit is {{the primary}} public {{transportation}} operator in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area of the U.S. state of Minnesota and the largest operator in the state. The system is {{a division of the}} Metropolitan Council, the region’s <b>metropolitan</b> <b>planning</b> <b>organization</b> (MPO), averaging 267,700 riders each weekday, carrying 90% to 95% of the transit riders in the region on a combined network of regular-route buses, light rail and commuter rail. The remainder of transit ridership is generally split among suburban “opt-out” carriers operating out of cities that have chosen not to participate in the Metro Transit network. The biggest opt-out providers are Minnesota Valley Transit Authority (MVTA), Maple Grove Transit and Southwest Transit (SW Transit). The University of Minnesota also operates a campus shuttle system of its own, which ranks second in the state, measured by ridership.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Hampton Roads <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Organization</b> (MPO) (formerly a {{subcommittee}} of the HRPDC, {{now known as the}} Transportation Planning Organization) concluded that new tolls could help secure funding for transportation projects that were removed from the 2026 RTP, including the Midtown Tunnel and MLK Extension. This would include tolling the parallel Downtown Tunnel to create a congestion-management plan to prevent the diversion of potential Midtown Tunnel traffic to a competing free facility. Both tunnels were initially tolled (25 cents, both ways) to pay off their construction bonds; both were made free in the late 1980s after the opening of the second (eastbound) Downtown Tunnel. Options included adding a 58-cent toll to the Midtown Tunnel (and a 19-cent toll to the MLK Extension), which could raise $427 million for the project; or adding a $2.05 peak/$1.50 off-peak toll for the Midtown, and a $2.20 peak/$1.60 off-peak for the Downtown Tunnel, which could raise nearly $4.8 billion. Based on this study, the MPO added the projects to the regions 2030 RTP, now estimated to cost around $779 million if the Virginia General Assembly approved the new tolls and several tax increases.|$|E
