5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in {{the most commonly used}} adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of public {{concerns}} following the cholera epidemic and {{the findings of the}} Royal Commission, the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis (Burials Act) was passed in 1851. Under the Burials Act, new burials were prohibited in what were then the built-up areas of London. Seven large cemeteries had recently opened a short distance from London or {{were in the process of}} opening, and temporarily became London's main burial grounds. A proposal by Francis Seymour Haden to ship the bodies of London's dead to the Thames Estuary for use in land reclamation met with little approval, and the government sought alternative means to prevent the constantly increasing number of deaths in London from overwhelming the new cemeteries in the same <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> had overwhelmed the traditional burial grounds.|$|E
5|$|Another legacy was the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> {{led to the}} emergence—albeit only fleetingly—of an {{independence}} in Australian foreign affairs. Although previously Australian foreign interests had been largely handled by Britain, as a combatant Australia sent its own delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, while it also began {{to take a more}} assertive role in regional affairs in the Pacific. At the peace conference Prime Minister Hughes pushed aggressively for reparations and an Australian mandate over German New Guinea; a stance which conflicted with the liberal internationalist inspired Fourteen Points put forward by American President Woodrow Wilson. Regardless, following the war there was little real change in Imperial relations and Dominion affairs, and as a result the war arguably did not lead to any significant change in Australia's perception of its role in the world. Indeed, profound change would only occur following the Japanese crisis of 1942, which ultimately saw Australia pursue a foreign policy more independent of Britain, and an alliance with the United States.|$|E

50|$|Age {{differences}} in memory {{are attributed to}} age-correlated growth in the foundation of knowledge. What children know affects what they encode, how that information is organized in storage, and the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it’s</b> retrieved. The greater the background knowledge about the to-be-encoded information, the better that the information is remembered. Because older children have more knowledge than younger children, older children perform better than younger children in most memory tasks. When familiarity and meaningfulness of material were equated across age, developmental {{differences in}} memory performance {{was no longer a}} factor.|$|R
40|$|The master's thesis {{deals with}} the concept of {{infinity}} in the thought of the French thinker Emmanuel Lévinas. The formal exposition follows this concept as a core of Lévinas's philosophy (3. 1) and it aims to explain it in the terms of juxtaposing metaphysics as ontology (3. 2) and metaphysics as ethics (3. 3). The main objective of the phenomenal analysis is to "translate" this concept into particular "anthropological" categories and to pursue the <b>manners,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> structures the interior life of the subjectivity (4. 1), its existence within the world (4. 2) and how does it transfigure its relation to its neighbor, to its own death, and to love, which leads to fertility (4. 3). Secondarily, the work focuses on the context of Lévinas's thought and explores its relation to Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenology (2. 2), thinkings of Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig (2. 3) and the pioneer of subjective philosophy René Descartes (2. 4) ...|$|R
5|$|Some {{academics}} {{suggest that}} the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly {{a result of the}} <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was integrated into India. Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for. Instead, the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir. The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active insurgency.|$|E

40|$|Summary: There is an {{increasing}} requirement to breed durable resistances to woolly apple aphid (WAA) into apple cultivars. Genetically diverse apple plantings have been established in New Zealand with one aim to identify new sources of resistance to this pest, and also to allow the computation of parameters of genetic interest. Such computations are hindered by the uneven distribution of the pest in the orchard. The spatial distribution of WAA was investigated using local trend surfaces to examine large scale patterns, and point process analyses to check {{for the presence of}} small scale clumping. Large scale patterns in WAA distribution were found which could be attributed to the degree of exposure of the trees, and clumping was also detectable. The experimental design was found to adequately accommodate these spatial patterns. The application of the point process analysis to other ecological situations, and <b>manners</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> could be extended, are discussed. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

25|$|Through Frere's elevation, Lord Carnarvon sought {{another attempt}} at {{implementing}} the ill-fated and locally unsupported confederation scheme, that {{was met with}} fierce resistance by all the local groups involved.

Cape Prime Minister, John Molteno, advised that under current conditions confederation was ill-suited to and badly timed for Southern Africa.

25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{amendment}} related merely to the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was proposed.

Because the constitutional right to citizenship had been introduced {{as part of the}} Good Friday Agreement it was argued that there should have been consultation with Northern Ireland political parties. In the lead-up to the referendum the Irish and British governments issued a joint statement saying that they did not regard the proposed constitutional change as affecting the British-Irish Agreement (this being the inter-governmental component of the Good Friday Agreement). The Democratic Unionist Party cited the amendment as evidence that the Agreement could be changed.|$|E

25|$|Sourav Ganguly (51) {{given out}} by Mark Benson – While the TV {{evidence}} was inconclusive {{as to the}} correctness of the decision, the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was delivered has generated controversy.

There was a prior agreement between the teams that the fielders would be honest about whether the catch had carried. Ponting, having already consulted Clarke about the validity of the catch, raised his finger, telling the umpire that he thought the catch was cleanly taken.|$|E

Whilst some officers kept diaries or wrote memoirs of their service, The Recollections of Rifleman Harris is rare because unlike the grand actions or great people recalled by his superiors, Harris mentions dozens of men whose history is no longer remembered and whose names would otherwise be lost, and records the details of daily ennui with interesting and colloquial prose. He describes medicine from a patient's point of view, punishment from a friend of the victim's view, and military life from the bottom up, giving insight to the daily life of a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars, as well as a valuable primary source to some of the British campaigns of the period.|$|E

However, Monsoon declared that while Austin was the official winner of the Royal Rumble, his victory did not entitle him to a championship match due to the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> had been achieved. Monsoon then said he had signed a four-way, no disqualification elimination matchup for the WrestleMania title shot, which became known as the Final Four and was to serve as the main event for In Your House 13. The participants in the match were to include Austin, the official winner of the Royal Rumble, and the three men he eliminated after he illegally re-entered the match: Vader, The Undertaker, and Hart if he reconsidered his actions from before. As Austin argued with Monsoon over his decision, Hart returned to the arena, attacked Austin, and accepted the offer.|$|E

40|$|In {{this field}} guide, I {{distinguish}} five separate senses {{with which the}} term ‘mechanism’ is used in contemporary philosophy of science. Many of these senses have overlapping areas of application but involve distinct philosophical claims and characterize the target mechanisms in relevantly different ways. This field guide will clarify the key features of each sense and introduce some main debates, distinguishing those that transpire within a given sense from those that are best understood as concerning two distinct senses. The ‘new mechanisms’ sense is the primary sense from which other senses will be distinguished. In part II of this field guide, I consider three further senses of the term that are ontologically ‘flat’ {{or at least not}} explicitly hierarchical in character: equations in structural equation models of causation, causal-physical processes, and information-theoretic constraints on states available to systems. After characterizing each sense, I clarify its ontological commitments, its methodological implications, how it figures in explanations, its implications for reduction, and the key <b>manners</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> differs from other senses of mechanism. I conclude that there is no substantive core meaning shared by all senses, and that debates in contemporary philosophy of science can benefit from clarification regarding precisely which sense of mechanism is at stak...|$|R
40|$|Where {{does the}} concept of {{cultural}} capital stand regarding the histories of its creation, uses, debates and the revisions these have provoked? What are its limits? Which are the key aspects holding the best prospects for future research, or {{most in need of}} reformation? These are our concerns outlined in this paper setting out the context for our discussion of the seven papers assembled in this special issue. We first set out {{the concept of}} cultural capital in Bourdieu’s work noting that it was originally shaped pragmatically in critical interventions into education and cultural policies. We then highlight aspects of the career of the concept of cultural capital in relation to empirical studies of cultural consumption noting some key qualifications and limitations. Limits and prospects are discussed vis-a`-vis the papers assembled, under three headings: (1) cultural capital and the logics of capitalism; (2) cultural capital, education and cultural policy, and ‘social exclusion’; and (3) aesthetics and the relationality of the social. In concluding, we note the continuing operation of cultural capital as a mechanism for the reproduction of class advantages pointing to the need to consider further the <b>manners</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> engages elites, uses of new media and hierarchies based on gender and ethnicity...|$|R
