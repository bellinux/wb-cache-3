500|$|David Jason was {{the first}} actor to be cast for the production, as {{it had always been}} his desire to play Rincewind in a film {{adaptation}} of The Colour of Magic. Jason had mentioned in an interview some fifteen years previously that, of all the parts available, the character of Rincewind was the one he coveted the most. Jason describes the wizard as [...] "just such an amusing, endearing character... I always kept this idea in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> one day I [...] play Rincewind". Jason's appointment to the role, announced in April 2007, drew mixed reactions, with comments ranging from [...] "terrible choice" [...] to [...] "brilliant". A common criticism was that Jason, at 68, was too old to play a character who is, according to the books, middle-aged.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, West {{received}} a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes, but shortly after transferred to Chicago State University to study English. He soon realized that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his musical work, and at 20 {{he dropped out of}} college to pursue his musical dreams. This action greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university. She later commented, [...] "It was drummed into <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college. For Kanye to make an album called College Dropout it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Hosseini {{first began}} to {{consider}} the plot of And the Mountains Echoed during a 2007 trip to Afghanistan with the UN Refugee Agency. While there, he heard stories from several village elders about the deaths of young, impoverished children during the winters, which gave {{the foundation for the}} fundamental event of the novel: a parent's choice to sell a child to prevent this from occurring. [...] "The novel began very, very small, and it began with a single image in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> I simply could not shed," [...] he relayed. [...] "It was the image of a man walking across the desert and he's pulling a little Radio Flyer red wagon, and in it there's a little girl about 3 years old, and there's a boy walking behind him, and these three people are walking across the desert." [...] Hosseini originally planned for it to be written in a linear fashion similar to his previous novels, but, during the writing process, it was expanded to cover a series of interconnected stories surrounding a large number of characters not directly related to each other. Comparing the process to a tree, he stated that story [...] "just branched out" [...] and [...] "got bigger and bigger as it went along".|$|E

5000|$|Jungklas {{said that}} while he's proud of his pop-oriented work in the 1980s, [...] "in my mind, I'm really a blues artist ... folk and blues. People might roll their eyes when I say <b>that.</b> But in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>that's</b> what it is." ...|$|R

500|$|Because the series' {{production}} doesn't build sets till [...] "a {{couple of}} days before the shoot or even the day before the shoot or, sometimes even the morning of the shoot" [...] the stunt team was not able to coordinate with the art department and set decorators {{in the construction of the}} set, so the fight sequence had to be slightly reconfigured on the day of the shoot to fit the set. A steam effect in the sequence proved difficult due to the special effects operator having to time it with Bennet's shooting, working around a delay in the air canister system of several seconds. Tancharoen used a handheld camera, with the operator having to [...] "run all over the place with this really heavy camera on his shoulder", but wanted to move away from the Jason Bourne, shaky-cam style of filming, saying that because of his background in choreography, [...] "It’s drilled in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> the camera has to complement the movement of the action." [...] The shot took four takes to get right, with Bennet breaking her arm during the filming of the final take, and having to carry out the rest of her fight scenes for the season with the injury.|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E
60|$|An idea {{entered into}} <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> 'Is <b>that</b> horse of yours fresh?' I said.|$|R
6000|$|... "My foot {{slipped from}} the knob, {{but for a}} few moments you held me up, and bracing my knee against the stone, I swung across for the crack. Then I was on the shelf and you went over <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>That's</b> all I knew, until Stannard joined me and took control." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{seemed to}} be too faint and {{suffering}} to hear her; but presently, when she said to Maggie, [...] "Go and seek for somebody to fetch the doctor," [...] {{he looked up at}} her with full comprehension, and said, [...] "Doctor? No--no doctor. It's <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>that's</b> all. Help me to bed." ...|$|R
2500|$|Byrne {{mentioned}} in interviews and his 1995 autobiography, Pictures in <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> <b>that</b> he hates being called [...] "brooding".

2500|$|With just {{a minute}} remaining, United seemed to have forced extra-time and Coppell would later say that he [...] "had a vision in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> we would win 4–2 in extra-time" [...] – but it didn't happen. Arsenal charged forward from the restart and Alan Sunderland scored a goal which won the match. Coppell was in the losing side again.|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm {{certainly}} stoked by the result. It {{is such a}} great {{improvement on}} last year. It would have been great to have got gold, the top prize, but I am really happy. It has been a long wait. I had to put it in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> I'd get in some training this week, get a bit fitter. But I am really happy with myself; things have been going well for me. I rode well in Europe last year." ...|$|E

I borrowed forty pounds from Mr. Ramage. Thank goodness you'll understand. That's why I chucked Manning.... All right, I'm coming. But all this business has driven it clean out of <b>my</b> <b>head....</b> <b>That's</b> {{why he was}} so annoyed, you know." ...|$|R

2500|$|Her {{enthusiasm for}} Nikolai Gogol's work became {{reflected}} in both her husband's compositions {{and those of}} his friends. On the day of their betrothal, she and Rimsky-Korsakov read Gogol's short story [...] "May Night" [...] together. Afterwards, {{she told him that}} he should write an opera based on it. A week or two later she wrote him, I've been reading yet another of Gogol's stories today, [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi." [...] This is good, too, and would even be suitable for an opera, but not for you; in any case, it's not like 'May Night.' As for that, it's so stuck in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> nothing will drive it out. Either she or her sister Alexandra then suggested [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi" [...] to Mussorgsky. He did not act on it at the time, but a couple of years later, he reconsidered.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 5 {{looks at}} the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{of the work of}} Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; [...] "Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought he was not [...] & then afterwards when I said he was not you thought he was not. Why I know that – Oh no sir I thought that he was not, but I ask'd to know whether he was. – How can that be said Obtuse Angle how could you ask & think that he was not – why said he. It came into <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> he was not. – Why then said Obtuse Angle you said that he was. Did I say so Law I did not think I said that – Did not he said Obtuse Angle Yes said Scopprell. But I meant said Aradobo I I I can't think Law Sir I wish you'd tell me, how it is." [...] Northrop Frye refers to this incident as [...] "farcical conversational deadlock." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>That</b> was a mental error there. As soon as I {{realized there was}} no one to hand it to I started to run toward the line and tried to cover it up and just get down and I slid right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I guess (I was) more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{authors have}} {{commented on the}} mysterious object, [...] "Veedon Fleece" [...] as it appears in the album title and in the lyrics of the song, [...] "You Don't Pull No Punches, But You Don't Push the River". [...] Scott Thomas states in his review: [...] "The Morrison-conceived Veedon Fleece is the symbol of {{everything}} yearned for in the preceding songs; spiritual enlightenment, wisdom, community, [...] artistic vision and love." [...] Steve Turner [...] concludes: [...] "The Veedon Fleece...appears to be Van's Irish equivalent of the Holy Grail [...] a religious relic [...] that would answer his questions if he could track it down on his quest around {{the west coast of}} Ireland." [...] Morrison explained the title with: [...] "I haven't a clue about what the title means. It's actually a person's name. [...] I have a whole set of characters in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> I'm trying to fit into things. [...] Veedon Fleece is one of them and I just suddenly started singing it in one of these songs, It's like a stream of consciousness thing." [...] Morrison once told a fan when questioned about the meaning, [...] "It doesn't mean anything, I made it up myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, guitarist Dan Hoerner and bassist Nate Mendel {{met when}} they became housemates at the University of Washington. After jam sessions, they decided to form a band and sought a drummer, {{eventually}} deciding to invite William Goldsmith. Goldsmith played in many bands but decided to join the duo's project. They released a demo tape under the name [...] "Empty Set". Post-release, the band changed their name from Empty Set to Chewbacca Kaboom, upon realization that a band with the name Empty Set already existed. However, when another demo tape was released, the new name earned them little attention, and it was yet again subject to change, this time to 'One Day I Stopped Breathing'. The band eventually settled on the name Sunny Day Real Estate. Mendel stated the band's name [...] "was just a random thought that popped into <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> came from a Talking Heads song, '(Nothing But) Flowers'". He felt that since the band's outlook on the world saw that every possible thing was becoming a commodity to be bought and sold, {{it was possible that}} one day, people would even start selling sunny days. The lyrics made him ponder about what could be sold as property, and come up with the commercialization of sunny days.|$|E
2500|$|In October, at age 14, Douglas {{moved into}} the home of Missy Parton in West Des Moines, Iowa, to train under Liang Chow, the former coach of 2007 World Champion and 2008 Summer Olympics gold {{medalist}} Shawn Johnson. Although Douglas' former coach, Walker, stated in 2012 that she was convinced Douglas could {{have made it to}} the Olympics if she had remained in Virginia Beach, Douglas said, [...] "Something clicked in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>that</b> said, if I really want to make this happen I need to get better coaching." [...] The impetus for Douglas's move to Iowa was when Walker had invited Chow to teach a clinic at her gym, Excalibur. Douglas was impressed when Chow was able to teach her how to perform the Amanar vault in a single afternoon. Douglas considered a move to Texas to train with a renowned coach there, but after that coach declined to train her out of loyalty to Walker, Douglas selected Chow. Chow was initially skeptical, since Douglas had been just one of hundreds of kids at the clinic in Virginia Beach. However, Chow subsequently informed Douglas's Excalibur coaches that he had agreed to train her, but pointed out that he did not recruit her, saying, [...] "I would never recruit anybody to my program." [...] Later on, Gabby suffered from a hamstring strain and a hip flexor injury in July. She couldn't do much during this time, but this allowed her to improve her bar skills.|$|E

2500|$|On the film's {{differences}} from the novel, Gaiman commented: [...] "I sort of {{feel like my}} grounding in comics was actually very useful because in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>that's</b> just the Earth-Two version of Stardust.

5000|$|The lead vocal was sung by Brian Wilson {{who thought}} his {{performance}} was inadequate, explaining, [...] "Vocally, I thought I sounded {{a little bit}} weird in <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>That's</b> the one cut off the album I didn't really like that much.
