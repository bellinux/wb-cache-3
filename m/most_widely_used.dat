5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP {{are two of the}} <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>used</b> shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>used</b> message-passing system API.

Main aim of this work is to design a methodology, which can be use for project cost estimation in the initial part of the project stadium. Defining a basic terms of the project management and describing the <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>use</b> cost estimation metods are the first step to archive main aim. This will be achived by studing literature and relevant articles of the project management. Next step is find an appropriate factors which help to set up the methodology. This factors can derive from a stakeholder's analysis. After definition these factors there si possible to set up a particular methodology. Universality (for a wide group of the projects), accuracy (to determine a particular method) and usability (in the initial part of the project stadium) are the most important criteria to review this methodology. Finally, it is necessary to evaluate the proposed methodology. This can be achieved by comparing the methods recommended in the methodology and the methods actually used for the real project cost estimation. The expected benefits of this work are the <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>use</b> cost estimation metods arrangement and creation of the recommended metodology which can be used to cost estimation of future projects...|$|R
