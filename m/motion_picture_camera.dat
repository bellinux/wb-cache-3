5|$|In 1995, Van Dormael {{participated in}} the 1995 project Lumière et compagnie (Lumière and Company). This work is an {{anthology}} of very short works (on average 50–60 seconds) contributed by international film directors in which each used the original Auguste and Louis Lumière's <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera</b> to make his film. The Kiss is the 52-second film made by director Jaco Van Dormael featuring actor Pascal Duquenne. At the same time, Van Dormael was at work writing his next major work.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew {{that they would not}} be able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera</b> of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by accident or purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, {{just two}} years after the advent of the Cine-Kodak <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera,</b> MacMurray began making amateur films of life and travels in China, such as his trips to the Great Wall of China and a journey down the Yangtze River. One film {{depicted}} the procession of Sun Yat-sen's body from its original burial place in Peking to a new mausoleum in Nanking. Another film recorded in April 1928 captured scenes of daily life in Kalgan, north of Peking. MacMurray, along with his wife and sister, had traveled to Kalgan and Changpeh with Roy Chapman Andrews, an American explorer and naturalist who made multiple expeditions to the Gobi desert. During the civil war in 1928, however, rogue brigands and soldiers had made travel difficult in the region. To secure passage between Kalgan and Changpeh, MacMurray enlisted the aid of local warlord Chang Tso-lin, who provided an escort of 50 cavalry, 8 cars, and 150 camels.|$|E

5|$|The Kinetoscope is {{an early}} motion picture {{exhibition}} device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window {{at the top of}} the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was also used by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera</b> with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.|$|E

50|$|This {{effect is}} {{particularly}} pronounced in <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>cameras.</b> These cameras {{are subject to}} the constant motion of film being dragged through the film gate, so most <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>cameras</b> have film movements made or plated with wear-resistant alloys such as hard chrome. Given such a relatively reflective pressure plate behind the film, many <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> films use an anti-halation (and anti-static) backing.|$|R
25|$|Goldwater was {{an amateur}} {{photographer}} {{and in his}} estate left some 15,000 of his images to three Arizona institutions. He was very keen on candid photography. He got started in photography after receiving a camera as a gift from his wife on their first Christmas together. He was known to use a 4×5 Graflex, Rolleiflex, 16mm Bell and Howell <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera,</b> and 35 mm Nikkormat FT. He {{was a member of}} the Royal Photographic Society from 1941 becoming a Life Member in 1948.|$|E
25|$|A {{practical}} videotape {{system was}} not available until after Space Patrols run, so for distribution to distant stations the image on a small, bright TV monitor was filmed using a <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera</b> with a specially modified and synchronized shutter mechanism, creating kinescope recordings on 16mm or 35mm film. Most of the Saturday half-hour TV broadcasts survived in this form and so are still available today. The 15-minute weekday version {{of the program was}} at first seen mainly in the Los Angeles broadcast area, but was later also seen nationwide by syndication via kinescope films.|$|E
25|$|The {{multiplane}} {{camera is}} a special <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera</b> used in the traditional animation process that moves a number of pieces of artwork past the camera at various speeds and at various distances from one another, creating a three-dimensional effect, although not stereoscopic. Various parts of the artwork layers are left transparent, to allow other layers to be seen behind them. The movements are calculated and photographed frame-by-frame, with the result being an illusion of depth by having several layers of artwork moving at different speeds. The further away from the camera, the slower the speed. The multiplane effect is {{sometimes referred to as}} a parallax process. As a former director and animator of Walt Disney Studios, Ub Iwerks in 1933 invented the multiplane camera using four layers of flat artwork before a horizontal camera.|$|E

500|$|Ryszard Siwiec ( [...] ; 7 March 1909 — 12 September 1968) was a Polish {{accountant}} and former Home Army resistance member {{who was the}} first person to commit suicide by self-immolation in protest against the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Although his act was captured by a <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera,</b> Polish press omitted any mention of the incident, which was successfully suppressed by the authorities. Siwiec prepared his plan alone, and few people realized what he tried to achieve with his sacrifice. His story remained mostly forgotten until the fall of communism, when it was first recounted in a documentary film by Polish director Maciej Drygas. Since then, Siwiec has been posthumously awarded a number of Czech, Slovak, and Polish honors and decorations.|$|E
500|$|Ben-Hur {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews {{upon its}} release. Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, called Ben-Hur [...] "a remarkably intelligent and engrossing human drama". While praising the acting and William Wyler's [...] "close-to" [...] direction, {{he also had}} high praise for the chariot race: [...] "There has seldom been anything in movies to compare with this picture's chariot race. It is a stunning complex of mighty setting, thrilling action by horses and men, panoramic observation and overwhelming use of dramatic sound." [...] Jack Gaver, writing for United Press International, also had praise for the acting, calling it full of [...] "genuine warmth and fervor and finely acted intimate scenes". Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "magnificent, inspiring, awesome, enthralling, {{and all the other}} adjectives you have been reading about it." [...] He also called the editing [...] "generally expert" [...] although at times abrupt. Ronald Holloway, writing for Variety, called Ben-Hur [...] "a majestic achievement, representing a superb blending of the motion picture arts by master craftsmen," [...] and concluded that [...] "Gone With the Wind, Metro's own champion all-time top grosser, will eventually have to take a back seat." [...] The chariot race [...] "will probably be preserved in film archives as the finest example of the use of the <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera</b> to record an action sequence. The race, directed by Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt, represents some 40 minutes of the most hair-raising excitement that film audiences have ever witnessed." ...|$|E

In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.|$|E

2500|$|The {{method used}} for {{creating}} these effects involved a technically expanded {{version of an}} old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera is a still-picture camera not a <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>camera,</b> and it contributes just one frame to the video sequence. When those pictures are shown in sequence, they create the effect of [...] "virtual camera movement"; {{the illusion of a}} viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time.|$|E
