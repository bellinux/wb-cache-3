5|$|The United States Air Force {{intended}} to use the Gemini spacecraft to transport astronauts to its proposed space stations, the Manned Orbital Development System and later the <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Laboratory</b> (MOL). These stations would have been launched by Titan IIIM rockets, with a Gemini spacecraft atop, {{eliminating the need for}} rendezvous and docking maneuvers. For this purpose, several modifications were made to the Gemini capsule, including the installation of a hatch in the heat shield to allow access to the space station.|$|E
5|$|From 1962 to 1965, Halvorsen {{served in}} Wiesbaden, West Germany, with the Foreign Technology {{division}} of AF Systems Command. He was next {{assigned to the}} Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Development, HQ USAF, the Pentagon, and in the Directorate of Space and Technology. He developed plans for the advanced manned reusable spacecraft, space policy and procedures, and on the <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Laboratory</b> Project. He then was given the command of the 659th Instrumentation Squadron of the AF Systems Command Satellite Control Facility, Vandenberg AFB, California, which was involved in both satellite launch and orbit operations.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{applications}} were envisaged for the Gemini spacecraft {{at various stages}} before, during, and after the two years {{in which it was}} used by NASA for manned spaceflight. Although none of these proposals ever made it into operation, many were considered seriously, and in some cases flight hardware was constructed prior to cancellation. In the case of the <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Laboratory,</b> a Gemini spacecraft was launched on a suborbital demonstration flight in support of the program. In some cases technology developed in the Advanced Gemini program has been reintegrated into other programs, such as components from the Titan IIIM, which was to have launched MOL, being used to upgrade other Titan rockets.|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} under way of a <b>manned</b> <b>orbital</b> space <b>laboratory,</b> some of the {{purposes}} of which would be to determine man's adaptability to space and to study structures and systems in space before committing manned spacecraft to long-range missions. It uses an inflatable torus as laboratory and living quarters and has an erectable solar collector as the source of heat for the power plant. The station rotates six times per minute in order to provide some artificial gravity together with stabilization. An escape taxi, which is not shown, is attached {{to the bottom of the}} station...|$|R

5|$|Nixon {{was unwilling}} to keep funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the high level seen during the 1960s as NASA {{prepared}} to send men to the Moon. NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine drew up ambitious plans {{for the establishment of}} a permanent base on the Moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981. Nixon rejected both proposals due to the expense. Nixon also canceled the Air Force <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Laboratory</b> program in 1969, because unmanned spy satellites were a more cost-effective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force had an {{interest}} in the Gemini system, and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> To this end, the Gemini 2 spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the MOL, sent into space by a Titan IIIC. This was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice.|$|E
25|$|The {{first flight}} of Columbia (STS-1) was {{commanded}} by John Young, a veteran from the Gemini and Apollo programs {{who was the}} ninth person {{to walk on the}} Moon in 1972, and piloted by Robert Crippen, a rookie astronaut originally selected to fly on the military's <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Laboratory</b> (MOL) spacecraft, but transferred to NASA after its cancellation, and served as a support crew member for the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz missions.|$|E

25|$|Lawyer became {{involved}} in flight test in 1958 when his squadron was selected to test the F-105B. He attended the Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School (now the USAF Test Pilot School) at Edwards AFB and graduated with class 63A receiving the school's A.B. Honts Award as the outstanding member of his class for academic achievement and flying excellence. In 1965, Lawyer was selected {{as one of the}} first astronauts to the Air Force's classified <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> The MOL program, canceled in 1969 before sending any astronauts into space, was to man a military space station with Air Force astronauts using a modified Gemini spacecraft. Unable to transfer to NASA due to age restrictions, Lawyer did not achieve his goal of space flight, but continued flying for the Air Force. He retired from USAF service in 1982 as a Colonel.|$|E

2500|$|Gemini was robust {{enough that}} the United States Air Force planned {{to use it for}} the <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Laboratory</b> (MOL) program, which was later canceled. Gemini's chief designer, Jim Chamberlin, also made {{detailed}} plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late 1961. He believed Gemini could perform lunar operations before Project Apollo, and cost less. NASA's administration did not approve those plans. In 1969, McDonnell-Douglas proposed a [...] "Big Gemini" [...] that could have been used to shuttle up to 12 astronauts to the planned space stations in the Apollo Applications Project (AAP). The only AAP project funded was Skylab – which used existing spacecraft and hardware – thereby eliminating the need for Big Gemini.|$|E
