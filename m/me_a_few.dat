It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|E

The band played mostly blues and ballads, but the most popular music among whites in the area was country. Berry wrote, [...] "Curiosity provoked me to lay {{a lot of our}} country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering 'who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo?' After they laughed at <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> times they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it." ...|$|E

In regards to qualifying for Rio, Richter said [...] "the pressure ahead of Baku was unbearable and it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds to regain my composure in the final once I realized I clinched my place in the Olympics." [...] Richter scored 623.8 out of a possible 654.0 points during the qualification round of the 10 m air rifle. He would have needed a score of at least 625.5 to qualify for the finals.

Before filming, ABC {{announced that the}} production would adapt elements from the original 1900 book, rather than the 1939 film. such as the Silver Shoes instead of the Ruby slippers. [...] On August 25, 2004, {{it was announced that}} Hilary Duff, Jessica Simpson, and Ashanti had auditioned for the role of Dorothy Gale, but Ashanti had won the part. When asked about how she felt about working with the Muppets, Ashanti replied, [...] "I love children, and to me, the Muppets are just like little kids." [...] She also stated, [...] "The director had to give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pointers and tips for acting with them, {{but the most important thing}} that I learned was to keep eye contact."

500|$|Poulenc's {{major works}} for choir and {{orchestra}} are the Stabat Mater (1950), the Gloria (1959–60), and Sept répons des ténèbres (Seven responsories for Tenebrae, 1961–62). All {{these works are}} based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant. In the Gloria, Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, [...] "I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think I have three good religious works. May they spare <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days in Purgatory, if I narrowly avoid going to hell." [...] Sept répons des ténèbres, which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration of thought. To the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc's own requiem and is [...] "the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically, comparable only with his magnum opus sacrum, the opera, Dialogues des Carmélites." ...|$|E

500|$|The leading actor-manager Charles Hawtrey, {{whom the}} young Coward idolised and {{from whom he}} {{learned a great deal}} about the theatre, cast him in the children's play Where the Rainbow Ends. Coward played in the piece in 1911 and 1912 at the Garrick Theatre in London's West End. In 1912 Coward also {{appeared}} at the Savoy Theatre in An Autumn Idyll (as a dancer in the ballet) and at the London Coliseum in A Little Fowl Play, by Harold Owen, in which Hawtrey starred. Italia Conti engaged Coward to appear at the Liverpool Repertory Theatre in 1913, and in the same year he was cast as the Lost Boy Slightly in Peter Pan. He reappeared in Peter Pan the following year, and in 1915 he was again in Where the Rainbow Ends. He worked with other child actors in this period, including Hermione Gingold (whose mother threatened to turn [...] "that naughty boy" [...] out); Fabia Drake; Esmé Wynne, with whom he collaborated on his earliest plays; Alfred Willmore, later known as Micheál Mac Liammóir; and Gertrude Lawrence who, Coward wrote in his memoirs, [...] "gave me an orange and told <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> mildly dirty stories, and I loved her from then onwards." ...|$|E

Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E

This extended to a ten-shot lead after five holes in the final round. Kaymer found trouble in the bunkers, resulting in a round of 75 and a fall to third place behind Frenchman Gary Stal, who secured his first European Tour victory, and world number one Rory McIlroy. Speaking after the round, Kaymer told the media that he was [...] "in shock" [...] at the result: [...] "I'm surprised and shocked," [...] the German said. [...] "I don't {{really know how to}} put it into words. It was very, very surprising today. It will take <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days to reflect on this. I don't think I played that badly.

2500|$|The German {{name of the}} {{currency}} is Deutsche Mark (fem., [...] ); its plural form in standard German {{is the same as}} the singular. In German, the adjective [...] "deutsche" [...] (adjective for [...] "German" [...] in feminine singular nominative form) is capitalized because it is part of a proper name, while the noun [...] "Mark", like all German nouns, is always capitalized. The English loanword [...] "Deutschmark" [...] has a slightly different spelling and one syllable fewer (possibly due to the frequency of silent e in English), and a plural form in -s. In Germany, {{the currency}}'s name was often abbreviated as D-Mark (fem., [...] ) or simply Mark (fem.) with the latter term also often used in English. Like Deutsche Mark, D-Mark and Mark do not take the plural in German when used with numbers (like all names of units), the singular being used to refer to any amount of money (e.g. eine (one) Mark and dreißig (thirty) Mark). Sometimes, a very colloquial plural form of Mark, Märker [...] was used as either as diminutive form or to refer to a small number of D-Mark coins or bills, e.g. Gib mir mal ein paar Märker ("Just give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> marks") and Die lieben Märker wieder ("The lovely money again", with an ironic undertone).|$|E

[...] Because the Muslims and Christians wouldn't let [...] "a heathen" [...] be buried in their graveyards, Omm Sety built her own underground tomb decorated with a false door. Through this door the Ka was believed to travel between this world and the next, and it was engraved with an offering prayer in conformance with ancient beliefs. The staff of Chicago House gave her an imitation Shawabti figurine to place in the tomb. On 10 April 1981 she gave away her two cats as her condition deteriorated. On 15 April she received a letter from Olivia Robertson confirming that Omm Sety had been enrolled in the Fellowship of Isis, an interfaith spiritual movement focused on the goddess, on 23 March. On 21 April 1981 Omm Sety died in Abydos. The local health authority refused to allow her to be buried in the tomb she had constructed, so she was interred in an unmarked grave, facing the west, in the desert outside a Coptic cemetery.|$|E

It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did.

[...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting.
