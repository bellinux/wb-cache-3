5|$|Searches for the lode veins on both creeks {{succeeded by}} the 1870s and {{eventually}} led to significant lode mining at the Eva May, Uncle Sam, Grey Eagle, Hattie Ferguson, and Comet <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> the Cataract Creek district and the Bullion, Hope, and Katy <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> the Basin Creek district. By 1880, the settlement at Basin became the local source of supplies for mines and miners.|$|E
5|$|The world {{production}} of scandium {{is in the}} order of 10 tonnes per year, in the form of scandium oxide. The demand is about 50% higher, and both the production and demand keep increasing. In 2003, only three mines produced scandium: the uranium and iron <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> Zhovti Vody in Ukraine, the rare-earth <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> Bayan Obo, China, and the apatite <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> the Kola peninsula, Russia; since then many other countries have built scandium-producing facilities. In each case scandium is a byproduct from the extraction of other elements and is sold as scandium oxide.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed in the <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> the early days of industrialisation are incomplete and a few are contradictory.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights activists}} had {{previously}} alleged, and on February 28, 2017 investigative journalism reported confirmation, that child labor {{is used in}} {{a portion of the}} worldwide supply of cobalt sourced from African artisanal mines.

5|$|After {{the closure}} of the uranium <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> Elliot Lake, in 1990, the revenue {{prospects}} of the mall dropped sharply, with no recovery in sight. This prompted the Algoma Central Company to write off over $5 million in lost property value, despite 98% occupancy.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1898, without {{building}} a dam, the original Lower Bonnington Power Plant was generating hydroelectricity from Bonnington Falls in the Kootenay River near {{the confluence of}} the Slocan River in order to supply water to <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> Rossland, British Columbia.|$|E
50|$|In Tanzania, {{production}} {{increased in}} recent years because of {{the opening of the}} Geita <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2000; the Bulyanhulu <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2001; the North Mara Gold <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2002; the Buhemba <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2003; and the Tulawaka <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2005. Output increased since 2000 in Mali because of the opening of the Loulo, the Morila, and the Yatela Mines. The Mupane and the Samira Hill Gold <b>Mines</b> were opened <b>in</b> Botswana and Niger, respectively; these countries had only artisanal gold production before 2004.|$|R
50|$|Tanzania’s {{production}} {{was likely to}} rise to 60 t by 2009 {{with the opening of}} the Buckreef <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2007 and the Buzwagi Gold <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2008 and the increased capacity at the North Mara Mine; these increases could more than offset the decreased production at the Geita Gold <b>Mine.</b> Production <b>in</b> Tanzania was expected to decline to 56 t by 2011 because of the planned closure of the Tulawaka Gold <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2010. In Mali, the opening of the Tabakoto <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2006 and the reopening of the Syama <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2008 are likely to be offset by the shutdown of the Yatela <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2007 and lower production at the Morila Gold Mine.|$|R

5|$|As {{part of its}} {{campaign}} against shipping, around each full moon from late January 1945 XXBomber Command conducted minelaying missions. On the night of 25/26January, 41 B-29s from the 444th and 468th Bombardment Groups laid six minefields in the approaches to Singapore. On the same night other B-29s laid mines off Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay {{as part of the}} largest single aerial minelaying effort in the Pacific up to that time. On the night of 27/28February, twelve B-29s were dispatched to lay <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> the Straits of Johor near Singapore. Ten of these aircraft successfully deployed 55 <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> the target area, and another aircraft mined Penang. During the next full moon period on the night of 28/29March, 22 B-29s laid mines near Singapore. No aircraft were lost during these missions.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1558, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the patio process to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies. Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Coalhouse Fort was manned {{during the}} First World War by No. 2 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, which manned the guns, while the 2nd Company London Electrical Engineers {{operated}} the electric searchlights. A minefield {{was installed in}} the river between Shornemead and Coalhouse forts, with mechanically operated <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> the shallower parts {{of the river and}} remotely detonated <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> the navigable channel. Friendly ships could thus pass freely but the mines could be detonated by a shore-based observer if an enemy ship tried to use the main channel. Coalhouse Fort took on the role of an Examination Battery controlling the river traffic in conjunction with the River Examination Service. Incoming vessels were checked by tugs based alongside the old HMS Champion, moored in midriver, and if any vessel was deemed suspect or refused to stop, the fort was authorised to fire across its bows.|$|E
50|$|African mine {{production}} of palladium {{is expected to}} increase by an average of between 4% and 5% per year from 2005 to 2011, and platinum, by between 3% and 4% per year.
