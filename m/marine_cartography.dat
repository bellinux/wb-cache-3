40|$|The <b>marine</b> benthic <b>cartography</b> of the Cap de Creus and {{surrounding}} areas (NW Mediterranean Sea) {{was obtained by}} combining classical grabbing methods with more recent imaging methods based on a remotely operated vehicle. The goals of this particular survey can be summarized as follows: 1) to chart the benthic communities (and the area of each one); 2) to evaluate the benthic diversity of the areas; 3) to produce visual documentation of the distributions of the benthic organisms; 4) to identify human-induced pressures on the benthic environment; 5) to make recommendations for future management based on the visual assessment; and 6) {{to set up a}} new methodology for making large biocenosis maps that would help to manage marine protected and non-protected areas. The marine environment off the Alt Empordà County was shown to have a very rich diversity of benthic habitats. Twenty community categories were identified from videos and grabs. Though benthic habitats mostly located inside a marine protected area were assessed, man-made objects were seen in 10 % of the analyzed minutes filmed. The study led to a comprehensive review of the main biotope systems of this coastal area, as well as their environmental condition, and this will be an essential element for their future management...|$|R

40|$|The {{continental}} shelf of the Naples Bay has been intensively studied and analyzed through high resolution seismic reflection profiles coupled to morpho-bathymetric data, including Multibeam bathymetry and Side Scan Sonar imagery and sea bottom samples. Marine geological {{maps of the}} Naples Bay have been constructed by using an experimental approach to the geological maps, according to guidelines to Italian <b>Marine</b> <b>Cartography</b> suggested by the ISPRA, formerly the Italian Geological Survey. Some criteria and examples of marine geological mapping relative to the geological map n. 465 “Procida” (Naples Bay) both at the scales 1 : 10. 000 and 1 : 25. 000 are here presented. The cartographic approach {{is based on the}} recognition of laterally coeval depositional systems, representing portions of system tracts of the Late Quaternary depositional sequence. The integrated geological interpretation of seismic, bathymetric and Sidescan Sonar data have been tied by sea bottom samples and piston cores. The geological structures and the seismic sequences, both volcanic and sedimentary, have been studied with detail through multichannel and single-channel seismic profiles of different resolution and penetration, often integrated with marine magnetics. Seismic interpretation allowed for the reconstruction of stratigraphic and structural setting of shelf-slope successions, separated by tectonic and eustatic regional unconformities. In the Naples Bay the Dohrn and Magnaghi canyons, eroding the slope up to – 1000 m of water depth, represent main morpho-structural lineaments at the boundary between the sedimentary units of the eastern shelf and the volcanic units of the western shelf, in correspondence to the Phlegrean Fields, Ischia and Procida volcanic complexes. The marine geological maps, so realized, show the distribution of several lithostratigraphic units cropping out at the sea bottom and of the main morphological lineaments. The stratigraphic units belong to the Late Quaternary Depositional Sequence, showing the spatial and temporal geological evolution and the lateral and vertical migration of marine coastal, {{continental shelf}} and slope depositional environments during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene glacio-eustatic cycle. The stratigraphic succession studied through the geological survey has recorded the variations of the accommodation space of the Late Quaternary deposits during the last 4 th order glacio-eustatic cycle, ranging between 128 ky B. P. (Tyrrhenian stage) and the present (isotopic stage 5 e). The geomorphology and seismic stratigraphy of the continental shelf and slope appear strongly controlled by the interplay of volcanism and canyon formation acting in correspondence to the Magnaghi and Dohrn axes. Mound-shaped morphological highs genetically related to the emplacement of the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff volcanic unit (13 ky B. P.), widely cropping out onshore, Holocene reworked sediments and sea-bottom creep appear on acoustic Chirp profiles in the inner sectors of the bay. These features appear {{to be related to the}} interaction among volcanic, tectonic and sedimentary processes conditioning the geological evolution of the Naples Bay during the Late Quaternary. On the contrary, the sedimentation over the shelf at the southern edge of the bay (Sorrento Peninsula-Capri island) seems less influenced by volcanic activity and seabed features include Late Pleistocene regressive sand bodies and Holocene patch reefs, coastal dunes and depositional terraces. ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{would appear}} from old maps and {{descriptions}} that this island was known by European cartographers and mariners as [...] "Pulo Bardia", indicating {{that it was}} first settled by Malayo-Polynesian peoples. The old maps show a chain of three islands aligned north-south and lying off {{the east coast of}} the Malay Peninsula. The most northerly and smallest of these islands is marked P. Bardia, the name it had until the early 1900s. The best map example is by John Thornton from The English Pilot, the Third Book, dated 1701, but the specific map of the Gulf of Siam is dated around 1677. Also see maps of the East Indies by William Dampier c.1697. By modern standards of accuracy, the islands are poorly placed on early maps. Seventeenth century <b>marine</b> navigation and <b>cartography</b> used the [...] "backstaff" [...] which, in this area, was accurate to one degree of longitude, or around 60 nautical miles.|$|R
40|$|The marine {{geological}} map n. 502 ‘‘Agropoli’’, located offshore the Cilento Promontory, southern Italy, is here {{described and}} the regional geology interpreted, particularly referring to water depths between the 30 and 200 m isobaths. The geologic map has been constructed {{in the frame of}} a research program financed by the National Geological Survey of Italy (CARG Project), finalized to the construction of up-to-date cartography of the Campania region. Geological and geophysical data on the continental shelf and slope offshore of the Southern Campania region have been collected in the study area, bounded northwards by the Salerno Gulf and southwards by the Policastro Gulf. A high resolution multibeam bathymetry allowed {{for the construction of a}} marine digital elevation map; sidescan sonar profiles also have been collected and interpreted. The latter, merged to the bathymetry, have represented the base for the <b>marine</b> geologic <b>cartography.</b> The integrated geologic interpretation of seismic, bathymetric and sidescan sonar data has been calibrated by sea-bottom samples. The morpho-structures and the seismic sequences overlying the outcrops of acoustic basement reported in the cartographic representation have been studied in detail using singlechannel seismics. The interpretation of seismic profiles has been a support for the reconstruction of the stratigraphic and structural setting of the Quaternary continental shelf successions and the outcrops of rocky acoustic basement in correspondence to the Licosa Cape morpho-structural high. These areas result from the seaward prolongation of the stratigraphic and structural units, widely cropping out inthe surrounding emerged sector of the Cilento Promontory. The cartographic approach is based on the recognition of laterally coeval depositional systems, interpreted in the frame of the system tracts of the Late Quaternary depositional sequence. We present evidence of now subaqueous terraces inferred to be palaeoshorelines representing past sea-level positions and tentatively correlated these to oxygen isotopic stratigraphy...|$|R
