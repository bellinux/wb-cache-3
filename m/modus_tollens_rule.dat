40|$|We {{present a}} DNA-based {{implementation}} of reaction system with molecules encoding {{elements of the}} propositional logic, that is, propositions and formulas. The protocol can perform inference steps using, for example, modus ponens and <b>modus</b> <b>tollens</b> <b>rules</b> and de Morgan’s laws. The set of the implemented operations allows for inference of formulas using the laws of natural deduction. The system can also detect whether a certain proposition a can be deduced from the basic facts and given rules. The whole protocol is fully autonomous; that is, after introducing the initial set of molecules, no human assistance is needed. Only one restriction enzyme is used throughout the inference process. Unlike some other similar implementations, our improved design allows representing simultaneously a fact a and its negation ~a, including special reactions to detect the inconsistency, that is, a simultaneous occurrence of a fact and its negation. An analysis of correctness, completeness, and complexity is included...|$|R
5000|$|Constructive {{dilemma is}} a name of a valid rule of {{inference}} of propositional logic. It is the inference that, if P implies Q and R implies S and either P or R is true, then Q or S has to be true. In sum, if two conditionals are true {{and at least one}} of their antecedents is, then at least one of their consequents must be too.

40|$|The {{past ten}} years have shown {{a great variety of}} {{approaches}} for formal argumentation. An interesting question is to which extent these various formalisms correspond to the different application domains. That is, does the appropriate argumentation formalism depend on the particular domain of application, or does “one size fits all”. In this paper, we study this question from the perspective of one relatively simple design consideration: should or should there not be contrapostion of (or <b>modus</b> <b>tollens)</b> on defeasible <b>rules.</b> We aim to show that the answer depends on whether one is considering epistemical or constitutive reasoning, and that hence different domains require fundamentally different forms of defeasible reasoning...|$|R

40|$|The {{difference}} in difficulty between modus ponens (if p then q; p; therefore q) and <b>modus</b> <b>tollens</b> (if p then q; not-q; therefore not-p) arguments has been traditionally explained by {{assuming that the}} mind contains a rule for modus ponens, but not for <b>modus</b> <b>tollens.</b> According to the mental model theory, <b>modus</b> <b>tollens</b> is a more difficult deduction than modus ponens because people do not represent the case not-q in their initial model of the conditional. On {{the basis of this}} theory, we predicted that conditions in which reasoners are forced to represent the not-q case should improve correct performance on <b>modus</b> <b>tollens.</b> In particular, we predicted that the presentation of the minor premise (not-q) as the initial premise should produce facilitation. Experiment 1 showed that this is the case: whereas the inversion of the premise order did not affect modus ponens, it produced a significant increase of valid conclusions for <b>modus</b> <b>tollens.</b> Experiment 2 showed that this facilitation does not depend on the negative form (contrary vs. contradictory) of the minor premise. Experiments 3 and 4 (and/or some of their replications) demonstrated that facilitation also occurs when participants are asked to find the cases compatible with not-q or to evaluate a p conclusion. No premise order effect was found for sentences which make explicit the not-q case right from the start, i. e. p only if q conditionals and biconditionals (Experiments 5 and 6). Finally, Experiments 7 and 8 showed that the conditional fallacies are not significantly affected by the premise order...|$|R

The equivalence condition between fuzzy-rough modus ponens and fuzzy-rough <b>modus</b> <b>tollens</b> is discussed.

40|$|Popper’s {{falsifiability}} criterion, cast in {{the form}} of <b>modus</b> <b>tollens,</b> or ((P > Q). ~Q) > ~P, has often been applied to phylogenetic and cladistic theories. A severe criticism of such application is here examined. Questions concerning the universality, strict or numerical, of the propositions involved are irrelevant, but it is clear nevertheless that some workers have used <b>modus</b> <b>tollens</b> in an inappropriate way. Reliance on it is incorrect if the implicational statement, P > Q, is either a definitional or stochastic conditional. But if it is framed as a causal conditional then a Popperian approach to phylogenetics remains viable, although it is doubtful that this is true also of cladistics, which eschews a causal approach...|$|R
