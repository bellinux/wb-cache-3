40|$|Monitoring {{system for}} {{induction}} motor is widely developed {{to detect the}} incipient fault. Such system is desirable to detect the fault at the running condition to avoid the <b>motor</b> <b>stop</b> running suddenly. In this paper, a new method for detection system is proposed that emphasizes the fault occurrences as temporary short circuit in induction motor winding. The investigation of fault detection {{is focused on the}} transient phenomena during starting and ending points of temporary short circuit. The proposed system utilizes the wavelet transform for processing the motor current signal. Energy level of high frequency signal from wavelet transform is used as the input vriable of neural network which works as detection system. Three types of neural networks are developed and evaluated including feed forward neural network (FFNN), Elman neural network (ELMNN) and radial basis functions neural network (RBFNN). The results show that ELMNN is the most simply and accurate system that can recognize all of unseen data test. Laboratory based experimental setup is performed to provide real-time measurement data for this research...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} flagellar motor {{is one of}} the few rotary motors {{found in}} nature, and an excellent example of a complex molecular machine. Flagellar motors in the model organism Escherichia coli are products of the coordinated expression of ∼ 50 different genes. The E. coli flagellar motor is powered by the proton-motive force (pmf), an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane. Motor torque is gen- erated by proton flow through membrane-embedded stator units which bind to the basal body of the motor. This thesis aimed to investigate the relationship between the pmf and the flag- ellar motor. A novel pmf control system was developed, based on the light-driven proton pump proteorhodopsin (pR). This system enabled pmf -dependent changes in motor behaviour to be precisely monitored in vivo. Expression of pR in E. coli was shown to be sufficient to drive the flagellar motor at wild-type speeds. Using the pR-based pmf control system, the motor was shown to respond to changes in pmf on a timescale of milliseconds. Surprisingly, motor speed increase was observed when pmf was increased above the physiological norm. Reduction of pmf to low levels enabled individual steps in motor rotation to be observed. Motor response to loss of pmf was investigated. Motors were shown to exhibit a two-stage speed decrease after disruption of pmf, with motor speed falling to ∼ 20 % of its initial value within milliseconds, reaching a complete stop after 1 s. Extended periods of pmf loss was shown to lead to disengagement of stators from the motor, with motor speed increasing in a stepwise fashion after pmf restoration. The integrity of the motor at different pmf levels was investigated by using TIRF microscopy to directly image positioning of fluorescently tagged motor components. The stator protein MotB was shown to physically leave and rejoin the motor after pmf disruption and restoration, with MotB dispersal following <b>motor</b> <b>stop.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Most studies, {{investigating}} human time perception, {{have demonstrated}} {{a difference between}} subjective and objective timing. Very common are, for example, results showing that visual intervals are judged shorter than physically equivalent auditory intervals. Recent studies have also found differences between motor and perceptual timing. Considering those perceived differences, the idea has been proposed that the brain might employ distributed (modality- specific) timing mechanisms rather than one amodal timing mechanism. Distributed timing mechanisms and therefore independent temporal estimates would be convenient in the computation for reliability-based multisensory or sensorimotor integration, as predicted by Bayesian inference. Several {{studies have shown that}} multisensory temporal estimates can be predicted by reliability-based integration models, as for example the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) model. Reliability-based integration studies in time research are still fairly rare and discussed controversially, and especially studies investigating sensorimotor integration are mostly missing. The aim of this cumulative thesis was to investigate sensorimotor temporal reproduction with a focus on the influence of sensory (mainly auditory) feedback on motor timing. Here fore, in all studies a sensorimotor temporal reproduction paradigm was employed, and sensory and motor estimates were treated as different/independent estimates. First, we investigated the effect of onset and offset delayed sensory feedback on temporal reproduction (Chapter 2. 1). Second, perceptual and motor timing were compared explicitly and then a reliability-based model was used to predict the observed sensorimotor reproduction times (Chapter 2. 2). In a third study, we manipulated the prior representation of the standard duration, using different adaptation conditions (Chapter 2. 3). The findings showed that if the onset of a feedback stimulus was delayed in relation to an action (in contrast to when the feedback signal was started before the action), reproduced durations increased immediately, as soon as a delay is introduced. Offset-delayed sensory feedback, on the other hand, only induced a minor decrease in reproduction times and this effect could only be observed with auditory feedback. In comparison to auditory comparison estimates, which were shown to be fairly precise, pure motor reproduction as well as auditory reproduction was found to be consistently overestimated. The observed overestimation bias in auditory reproduction was reduced, compared to pure motor reproduction. This pattern of result could be shown for various standard durations and different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in the compared/reproduced tones. Further, a reliability-based model 4 predicted observed auditory reproduction biases successfully. In the third study, we could show that shifting the temporal range of accuracy feedback, manipulating the SNR of the reproduced tone, as well as introducing a manipulation of the reproduced tone onset, led to significant changes in the prior representation of the standard duration. Only manipulating the reproduced tone onset during the adaptation phase induced a reduction of auditory weights, which could be observed during the test phase. Additional trial-wise analysis confirmed that the adapted prior representation is shifted back to normal dynamically over time, once no accuracy feedback is provided anymore. The differences between observed sensory and motor estimates of time are discussed. We concluded that the finding that onset and offset delay influenced reproduction performance differentially implies that participants rather rely on the sensory feedback as a start- timing signal (at least if a causal relationship between action and sensory feedback can be established), while the <b>motor</b> <b>stop</b> is used as primary stop-timing signal. Observed sensorimotor reproduction biases and variability could be described as the weighted integration of the auditory estimate and the motor estimate. The integration reflects the brain combines multiple timing signals to improve overall performance. The prior knowledge of the standard duration in the reference memory is updated dynamically in that current sensorimotor estimates are constantly integrated with the history of duration estimates. In the end, overall implications of all the results for time perception, as well as sensory integration research are discussed. In summary, this thesis helps to improve our knowledge about sensorimotor temporal integration in a sensorimotor reproduction task on the basis of behavioral findings as well as probabilistic modeling...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{possible}} existence of the repeat phenomenon in police <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>stops.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The study involved a mid-western police department. Data were collected from contact cards completed by police officers making <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>stops</b> between July 1, 2001 and December 31, 2001. Contact cards included information concerning the stop itself, driver, passengers, motor vehicle, and the officer making the stop. Individual identifiers of police officers allowed for an analysis of individual officer performance concerning <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>stops.</b> A Poisson process and logistic regression {{were used in the}} analysis. Findings – Analyses revealed that <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>stops</b> are not randomly distributed across police officers and, in fact, a significant concentration of <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>stops</b> among few officers existed. Situational variables such as reason for the stop and time of the stop were significant predictors of high-performing officers. Research limitations/implications – Limitations of the results include an immeasurable bias due to officers 2 ̆ 7 discretion in completing contact cards for every <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>stop,</b> lack of external validity due to the specific circumstances surrounding the data collection, and the ‘time window effect’. Future research should focus on neighborhood level data collection, ‘hot spots’ for <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>stops,</b> the existence of high-performing (repeat) officers in field (pedestrian) stops, potential differences in racial disparity of <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>stops</b> across high- and low-performing officers. Practical implications – The results of this study may offer insights into personnel and deployment practices based on officer performance. Originality/value – This study is one of few on officer performance that included individual identifiers of police officers.

40|$|Many {{bacterial}} species swim {{by employing}} ion-driven molecular motors that power {{the rotation of}} helical filaments. Signals are transmitted to the motor from the external environment via the chemotaxis pathway. In bidirectional motors, the binding of phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P) to the motor is presumed to instigate conformational changes that result in a different rotor-stator interface, resulting in rotation in the alternative direction. Controlling when this switch occurs enables bacteria to accumulate in areas favorable for their survival.
