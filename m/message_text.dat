With people in the United States relying heavily on cell phones and <b>text</b> <b>message</b> technology, <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> offer a unique method for serving process. <b>Text</b> <b>messages</b> would be useful for serving a defendant when the defendant cannot be located. Further, <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> are sent almost instantaneously and are inexpensive. In addition, unlike e-mail, <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> do not require Internet access. Given these advantages, this Note examines whether <b>text</b> <b>message</b> service of process is constitutional. It argues that <b>text</b> <b>message</b> service of process is not per se unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the current technological limitations of <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> counsel against using <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> to serve process at this time.
