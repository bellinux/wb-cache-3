2500|$|A Chicago house album, Virgos music draws {{elements}} {{from the local}} deep house and acid house styles, and bears influence and similitaries {{with the work of}} Larry Heard, Fingers Inc. and Armando. Parallelisms can be established between its [...] "futuristic grooves" [...] and other contemporary dance styles such as techno and Balearic beat. However, Virgo has been noted for its idiosyncratic sound, more introspective and dreamy than other mechanically intense styles from its era, Phuture's [...] "Acid Trax" [...] for example. In a 2009 interview, Merwyn Sanders stated: [...] "We were into a lot of classic stuff, Kraftwerk and Gary Numan and a lot of jazz stuff. That’s what I grew up around, listening. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge jazz fan, so that was just engrained in my head without me even knowing it. So I guess that’s what you get a little sense of with that album we did." [...] Fact called it a [...] "deep post-acid" [...] album, and wrote that despite being similar to other contemporary house releases, [...] "it stands alone, and its cerebral but generously groovy evocation of the urban nightscape has never been matched for elegance or acuity." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as [...] "music you might make the day after a drugged-out bacchanal – wistful and contemplative, shot through with a creeping, contagious melancholy." [...] Joe Muggs described Virgo as [...] "archetypal house music through and through: it is design {{as much as it is}} art, absolutely attuned to the proportions and metabolism of the human body in a technological society." [...] He also noted that despite the [...] "soulfulness and the spindly stripping down of its production", the album is not [...] "less powerful than noisier, bassier or thicker music." ...|$|E
