25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As for me and <b>my</b> <b>companions,</b> we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, {{that we could not}} move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E
500|$|.....for {{all that}} he [...] was nigh blind, when he {{understood}} {{the order of the}} battle, he said to them about him:...'Sirs, ye are my men, <b>my</b> <b>companions</b> and friends in this journey: I require you bring me so far forward, that I may strike one stroke with my sword.'... they tied all their reins of their bridles each to other and set the king before to accomplish his desire, and so they went on their enemies... The king... was so far forward that he strake a stroke with his sword, yea and more than four, and fought valiantly and so did his company; and they adventured themselves so forward, that they were there all slain, and the next day they were found in the place about the king, and all their horses tied each to other.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{criticism}} of the game was its numerous technical glitches. Adam Diamond of Isthmus was {{not happy with the}} pathfinding, writing, [...] "I often found myself traveling solo through a dungeon, <b>my</b> <b>companions</b> spread out far behind me, leaving me vulnerable to attack. What's the point of having henchmen if they're not there to protect you?". [...] Some reviews compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to , a previous Obsidian game that had received similar complaints. The bugs were described as disruptive to gameplay and [...] "downright infuriating", and one reviewer encountered a [...] "showstopper bug" [...] in the initial retail version that prevented him from playing the game past a certain point. The bugs were said to negatively affect NPC AI, camera operation, and pathfinding. One review stated [...] "The launch–to–load time is fairly long so be prepared to wonder if the game has crashed or is loading." [...] Obsidian was quick to release fixes for several bugs, but later reviews still described the glitches as a serious problem. 1UP.com's review, written two weeks after the game's release, stated [...] "But the sad truth is that NWN2 shipped in a pretty messy state, and even after a couple patches (as of this writing), the biggest problems remain." ...|$|E

60|$|I crossed {{once with}} an English lady from Boulogne to Folkestone. At Folkestone a little French girl--anxious about her train--asked us a simple question. <b>My</b> <b>companion</b> replied {{to it with}} an ease that {{astonished}} herself. The little French girl vanished; <b>my</b> <b>companion</b> sighed.|$|R

500|$|Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann {{reviewed}} Fallout: New Vegas for the Xbox 360 positively, {{despite its}} many crash bugs and glitches. Gerstmann wrote: [...] "When I {{reflect on the}} experience, I'll probably think about the times the game locked up on me or broke in a dozen other crazy ways first, before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it. If {{you were able to}} look past the issues that plagued Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it, New Vegas will eventually show you a real good time." [...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making <b>my</b> <b>companions</b> disappear when I need them the most during a battle. These {{are some of the most}} frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game, especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clapton and Jimmie Vaughan {{were asked}} to {{identify}} the bodies. The Walworth County coroner conducted an autopsy and found that Vaughan suffered from multiple internal and skull injuries. Clapton issued a statement the next day, saying that the victims [...] "were <b>my</b> <b>companions,</b> my associates and my friends. This is a tragic loss of some very special people. I will miss all of them very much." [...] A Coptic cross necklace, worn by Vaughan, was given to Jimmie Vaughan.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{punishable}} by death if discovered, many inmates of the camp, both civilian and POW, kept diaries and notes about their imprisonment. One of Agnes' fellow female internees, Hilda E. Bates, described {{her in her}} diary entry dated September 21, 1944:Among <b>my</b> <b>companions</b> in camp are some outstanding personalities, and the following [...] of these. Mrs A.K. — a noted American novelist, who proposes to [...] a book on our life here. She is much sought after by the Japanese Camp Commandant, as he has read one of her previous books about Borneo. He evidently holds the opinion that a cup of [...] given in his office, and a packet of biscuits {{as a gift for}} her small son, will ensure him appearing as a hero in said book! ...|$|E

2500|$|Columnist Barbara Ellen of The Observer {{ridiculed}} the pomposity {{of some of}} the unfavourable {{reviews in}} her column on Sunday 28 March 2010, in a jokey [...] "Open letter to London's famous Adelphi theatre": [...] "Dear Mr Adelphi, Regarding the performance I viewed last week of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom sequel, Love Never Dies, ridiculed as Paint Never Dries. With regret, I must demand my money back; it simply wasn't bad or boring enough. <b>My</b> <b>companions</b> and I paid our money and went along in good faith, expecting a right old disaster. Imagine our disappointment when it was good. The phantom bore an eerie resemblance to Martin Amis sulking after his tiff with Anna Ford, but, sir, this was not enough. A catastrophe we were promised and a catastrophe we expected to see. One concedes that it is not all the production's fault. Negative reviews, the dark art of anti-hype, are a dangerous business. However, do fine feelings pay my babysitter? I feel that I, and several innocent coach parties, were tricked into going to Paint Never Dries, and, against our will, forced to endure an enjoyable evening. I'm sure I speak for many when I say I left your theatre wholly dissatisfied with how incredibly satisfied I felt".|$|E
