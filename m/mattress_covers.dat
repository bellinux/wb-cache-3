2500|$|One of the {{sponsors}} of the failed Tenpenny Australian 2015 tour was a project run by Messenger, Get Rid of Sids which claimed to educate parents about preventing Sudden infant death syndrome. Get Rid of Sids [...] "promotes a theory that toxic gas emitted from <b>mattress</b> <b>covers</b> is responsible for babies dying from SIDS. [...] This {{is based on a}} 1975 study from Japan. This study has been replicated hundreds of times and actually shows that [...] "vaccinated children have a lower rate of SIDS." [...] In 2010, it received charitable status which was revoked on 1 April 2015 by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC). The ACNC was unable to comment due to privacy reasons but they issued the statement that it [...] "had been revoked 'following a review into the organisation’s operations and activities'." [...] According to the ACNC's 2013 website, Get Rid of Sids project had no income and no employees in 2013.

Thus I saw poultry-houses being made for the Boxted Small Holdings; these cost from £4 5s. to £4 10s. net, and were excellent structures designed to hold about two dozen fowls. Further on large numbers of seats of different patterns were in process of manufacture, some of them for children, and other longer ones, with reversible backs, {{to be used in the}} numerous Army halls. Next I visited a room in which mattresses and <b>mattress</b> <b>covers</b> are made for the various Shelters, also the waterproof bunk bedding, which costs 7s. 9d. per cover. Further on, in a separate compartment, was a flock-tearing machine, at which the Mormon I have mentioned was employed.

40|$|Introduction Observational studies report inverse {{associations}} between {{the use of}} feather upper bedding (pillow and/or quilt) and asthma symptoms but there is no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence assessing the role of feather upper bedding as a secondary prevention measure. Objective To determine whether, among children not using feather upper bedding, a new feather pillow and feather quilt reduces asthma severity among house dust mite (HDM) sensitised children with asthma over a 1 -year period compared with standard dust mite avoidance advice, and giving children a new mite-occlusive <b>mattress</b> <b>cover.</b> Design RCT. Setting The Calvary Hospital in the Australian Capital Territory and the Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales. Patients 197 children with HDM sensitisation and moderate to severe asthma. Intervention New upper bedding duck feather pillow and quilt and a mite-occlusive <b>mattress</b> <b>cover</b> (feather) versus standard care and a mite-occlusive <b>mattress</b> <b>cover</b> (standard). Main outcome measures The proportion of children reporting four or more episodes of wheeze in the past year; an episode of speech-limiting wheeze; or one or more episodes of sleep disturbance caused by wheezing; and spirometry with challenge testing. Statistical analysis included multiple logistic and linear regression. Results No differences between groups were found for primary end points - frequent wheeze (OR 1. 51, 95 % CI 0. 83 to 2. 76, p= 0. 17), speech-limiting wheeze (OR 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 32 to 1. 48, p= 0. 35), sleep disturbed because of wheezing (OR 1. 17, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 2. 13, p= 0. 61) or for any secondary end points. Secondary analyses indicated the intervention reduced the risk of sleep being disturbed because of wheezing and severe wheeze to a greater extent for children who slept supine. Conclusion No differences in respiratory symptoms or lung function were observed 1 year after children with moderate-severe asthma and HDM sensitisation were given a mite-occlusive <b>mattress</b> <b>cover</b> and then received either feather upper bedding (pillow and quilt) or standard bedding care...|$|R

40|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with endogenous and exogenous estrogen excess. Some investigators have posited that electromagnetic fields may influence cancer risk through estrogenic hormonal mechanisms; however, {{there have been no}} studies reporting on electric blanket exposure in relation to endometrial cancer. The authors examined this possible association between endometrial cancer risk and electric blanket or <b>mattress</b> <b>cover</b> use as part of a population-based, case-control study. This analysis included incident endometrial cancer cases 40 – 79 years of age, interviewed during 1994 (n = 148; response rate, 87 %) and identified from the Wisconsin tumor registry. Female controls of similar age were randomly selected from population lists (n = 659; response rate, 85 %). Information regarding electric blanket and <b>mattress</b> <b>cover</b> use and endometrial cancer risk factors was obtained through structured telephone interviews approximately 1 year after diagnosis. After adjustment for age, body mass index, and postmenopausal hormone use, the risk of endometrial cancer was similar among ever users (odds ratio = 1. 04, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 70, 1. 55) and among current users (odds ratio = 0. 87, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 49, 1. 54) as compared with never users. Despite its small size and potential misclassification of exposure, this study provides evidence against an association between electric blanket or <b>mattress</b> <b>cover</b> use and endometrial cancer.

50|$|Avoidance of {{triggers}} is a {{key component}} of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include allergens, smoke (tobacco and other), air pollution, non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods. Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids. Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma. Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, <b>mattress</b> <b>covers</b> and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms. Overall, exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma. Yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.|$|E

50|$|A body bag, {{also known}} as a cadaver pouch or human remains pouch (HRP), is a non-porous bag {{designed}} to contain a human body, used for the storage and transportation of corpses. Body bags can also be used for the storage of corpses within morgues. Before purpose-made body bags were available, cotton <b>mattress</b> <b>covers</b> were sometimes used, particularly in combat zones during the Second World War. If not available, other materials were used such as bed sheets, blankets, shelter halves, ponchos, sleeping bag covers, tablecloths, curtains, parachute canopies, tarpaulins, or discarded canvas—“sealed in a blanket”—slang. However, the subsequent rubber (and now plastic) body bag designs are much superior, not least because they prevent leakage of body fluids, which often occurs after someone dies. The dimensions of a body bag are generally around 36 inches by 90 inches (91 cm by 229 cm). Most have some form of carrying handles, usually webbing, at each corner and along the edges.|$|E
