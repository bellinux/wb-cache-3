50|$|Due to {{its many}} uses, D. microcarpum has great {{potential}} for poverty or hunger stricken areas where growing conditions are poor especially. Efforts must be put forth to encourage its use and domestication.

40|$|The {{extinction}} of animal species has undergone acceleration {{in the past}} century (Ehrlich & Ehrlich 1981). The main causes of animal extinctions are overkill, habitat impoverishment, and the impact of introduced species (Diamond 1989). The stablishment and protection of nature reserves is a necessary first step to limit the extinctions, but not much more than that. The reserves are often too small to sustain so-called <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of especially the larger species (Belovsky 1987; Newmark 1987). These large species, mammalian herbivores in particular, may have a keystone function in communities by creating niches for other species (Laws 1970).

40|$|The use of {{environmental}} safety standards is being increasingly advocated, and economists are being increasingly required to adapt their policy models {{to take account}} of such standards, e. g. by the use of transferable environmental damage quotas. The use of these standards may be a consequence of a greater desire to achieve more sustainable development and preserve the natural wealth available to future generations. An important means to this goal is to preserve biodiversity and genetic variability. Safe minimum standards for conservation of wildlife have been suggested as a way to achieve this. Sometimes safe minimum standards for conservation of species are defined in terms of their <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> and their <b>minimum</b> habitat requirements.

While bighorn sheep die-offs have occurred in every western state (Toweill and Geist 1999), recent conflicts in Intermountain states over the origins of disease effects on bighorn populations have erupted within the contexts of litigation over public lands grazing, Endangered Species Act dynamics, and the restoration discourse all noted above. In the past 5 [*]years, under these intensifying management and policy conditions, federal and state land management agencies have now developed strategic policies and management protocols that will require species separation {{as a means to}} ensure <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> for given areas. Although not currently constrained as a listed species within the Endangered Species Act, the Rocky Mountain subspecies of bighorn sheep holds its status as an iconic and symbolic wildlife species caught within the conflict over land use and management.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we develop a {{spatially}} explicit model for analyzing {{the consequences of}} alternative land use patterns on species conservation and market-based economic returns. We use the model to search for efficient land use patterns that maximize species conservation objectives for a given level of economic return, and vice-versa. We find that there is minimal conflict between the goals of maintaining <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of terrestrial vertebrates, consisting of at least 1000 breeding pairs, and economic returns. Generating {{the maximum number of}} species meeting this threshold involves sacrificing less than 1 % of economic returns compared to maximum economic returns. When the conservation goal is more ambitious, maintaining 10 % or 50 % of the maximum potential population for each species, there are large tradeoffs between conservation and economic returns. For the 10 % goal, the efficiency frontier is bowed inward indicating high initial marginal costs of conservation. 2 1...|$|R
40|$|Gap {{analysis}} is {{an approach to}} conserving biological diversity that maps species richness and identifies sites {{that ought to be}} protected but are not in conservation networks. Gap analyses based on species richness may have high error rates when species models are based solely on species-habitat association, because patches too small to support populations are still considered to be potential habitat. We incorporated information on the home range and dispersal distances of the mammals of Florida to estimate minimum critical areas (MCA) to support <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> for each mammal species. Incorporating MCA decreases the area occupied by the highest levels of species richness and alters the mapped spacial distribution of potential species richness. For example, in St. Lucie and Okeechobee counties, Florida, the total area occupied by 15 or more species was 30, 448 ha under simple mammal-habitat association models, but only 7820 ha under model conditions incorporating MCA. This reflects the fragmented condition of many landscapes, where most patches are too small to support <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of larger species. Incorporating minimum area requirements into maps of potential species richness produces more conservative and defensible maps...|$|R
40|$|The SLOSS (single {{large or}} several small) debate {{is no longer}} an issue in the {{discussion}} about the optimal size of nature reserves. The best way to estimate the minimum sizes of reserves may be a three-step process: (1) identify target or keystone species whose disappearance would significantly decrease the value or species diversity of the reserve; (2) determine the minimum number of individuals in a population needed to guarantee a high probability of survival for these species; (3) using known densities, estimate the area needed to sustain the minimum number. The forces that affect population viability and determine MVPs (<b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations)</b> are extremely complex. Thoughtful estimates of MVPs for many animal species are rarely lower than an effective size of a few hundred. Attempts to save only common or smaller species in a community will usually be ill-fated because of the web of ecological relationships between species, including the importance of predation and herbivory in the maintenance of species diversity. Other topics discussed include the complementarity of conservation goals, the problematic function of corridors and the value of buffer zones...|$|R

40|$|Species {{richness}} {{and maintenance of}} <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> are associated to area of fragment, whereas edge effect is related to its perimeter. Further, distance to nearest fragments affect the capacity for organisms dispersion and the geographic amplitude of metapopulations, i. e., replacement of small populations and gene flow between patches. Thus, planning and design of protected areas present great significance to assess patterns of specie-area and ecological process which cause then. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess clusters of Cerrado biome in the Corrente River Basin, in the State of Goias Brazil, in accordance with their area/perimeter ratio through Kernel estimator of points pattern, in order to provide guidelines to planning and maintenance of protected areas. A supervisioned classification of CCD/CBERS images has produced a map of fragments of native vegetation. Centroids and attributes of polygons have been generated and clusters have been evaluated through Kernel estimator. Results indicate that most fragments get area/perimeter ratio less than 150 km, given the intense agricultural activity in the region.

40|$|Tropical {{rainforest}} trees typically {{occur in}} low population densities {{and rely on}} animals for cross-pollination. It is of conservation interest therefore to understand how rainforest fragmentation may alter the pollination and breeding structure of remnant trees. Previous studies of the Amazonian tree Dinizia excelsa (Fabaceae) found African honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) as the predominant pollinators of trees in highly disturbed habitats, transporting pollen up to 3. 2 km between pasture trees. Here, using microsatellite genotypes of seed arrays, we compare outcrossing rates and pollen dispersal distances of (i) remnant D. excelsa in three large ranches, and (ii) a population in undisturbed forest in which African honeybees were absent. Self-fertilization was more frequent in the disturbed habitats (14 %, n = 277 seeds from 12 mothers) than in undisturbed forest (10 %, n = 295 seeds from 13 mothers). Pollen dispersal was extensive in all three ranches compared to undisturbed forest, however. Using a TWOGENER analysis, we estimated a mean pollen dispersal distance of 1509 m in Colosso ranch, assuming an exponential dispersal function, and 212 m in undisturbed forest. The low effective density of D. excelsa in undisturbed forest (~ 0. 1 trees/ha) indicates that large areas of rainforest must be preserved to maintain <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations.</b> Our results also suggest, however, that in highly disturbed habitats Apis mellifera may expand genetic neighbourhood areas, thereby linking fragmented and continuous forest populations. ...|$|R
40|$|Habitat loss, {{fragmentation}} and degradation are {{important factors in}} the decline of biodiversity worldwide. It {{is important to be}} able to evaluate the success of policies at different levels, including, increasingly, the global level. Whilst attention has been given to the development of predictive models that focus on individual species within biogeographic regions or smaller areas, however, {{to assess the impact of}} land-use change and policy measures on biodiversity at global level, there is an urgent need for generic tools (models, algorithms, databases). In this paper we test the potential of a generic tool, as part of the GLOBIO model, for assessing the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation. It combines existing data for the <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of terrestrial bird and mammal species with knowledge of individual area requirements to derive estimates of their minimum area requirements (MAR). This approach focuses on comparing the minimum area requirements (MAR) to the natural habitat areas, assuming that below a certain threshold populations are no longer viable and the species assembly will eventually be reduced. The relationship between nature area and percentage of species meeting Minimum Area Requirements appears to be log-linear between 10 km 2 and 10 000 km 2 for conservation priority species and has the form Y=- 15. 45 + 28. 61 * LOG(AREA). Our results suggest that many existing parks and reserves might be too small for the long-term viability of species that they are meant to preserve. Applying this relationship to a global land cover dataset reveals that substantial proportions of mammal and bird species occur in areas that fail to cover sufficient space to support long term <b>viable</b> <b>populations.</b> This applies even at current state, especially for those areas of the globe where rapid urbanisation and agricultural expansion have taken place and are anticipated to proceed...|$|R

50|$|A {{demographic}} model {{based on}} Bavarian alpine populations of capercaillie suggest a <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>population</b> {{size of the}} order of 500 birds. However, genetic data show clear signs of reduced variability in populations with numbers of individuals in the range of fewer than 1000 birds, which indicates that a demographic minimum population of 500 birds may be too small to maintain high genetic variability. Genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation exist for this species in the form of increased genetic differentiation due to increased isolation of populations. Therefore, anthropogenic habitat deterioration and fragmentation not only leads to range contractions and extinctions, but may also have significant genetic, and thus, evolutionary consequences for the surviving populations.|$|E
5000|$|All of the {{surviving}} black robins are descended from [...] "Old Blue", giving little genetic variation among the population and creating an extreme population bottleneck.

It was generally assumed that the <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>population</b> protecting from inbreeding depression was around 50 individuals, but this is now known to be an inexact average, with the actual numbers being below 10 in rapidly reproducing small-island species such as the black robin, to several hundred in long-lived continental species with a wide distribution (such as elephants or tigers).|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} Rothschild giraffe, the eastern bongo is arguably {{one of the}} most {{threatened}} large mammals in Africa, with recent estimates numbering less than 140 animals, below a <b>minimum</b> sustainable <b>viable</b> <b>population.</b> The situation is exacerbated because these animals are spread across four isolated populations. Whilst the bongo endangered species program can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe, it has not yet become actively involved in the conservation of this species in the wild in a coordinated fashion. The plan is to engage in conservation activities in Kenya to assist in reversing the decline of the eastern bongo populations and genetic diversity in Africa, and in particular, applying population management expertise to help ensure the persistence of genetic diversity in the free ranging wild populations.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of land use zones on the {{conservation}} of <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of threatened cracids (Family Cracidae), was conducted in the Cofan territory of Zabalo in the Cuyabeno Reserve of eastern Ecuador. Salvin's curassow (Mitu salvini), a cracid which exhibits high sensitivity to overharvest, was used as the subject from which to conduct the analysis. The objectives of the study were to (i) determine the relative frequency and density of Salvin's curassow in three land use zones; (ii) record sex and age-specific harvest of cracids; (iii) assess hunting protocol and community incentives for adoption of land use zones; (iv) calculate a <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> curassow <b>population</b> size which has a 99 % probability of persistence for 50 years; (v) estimate a sustainable harvest and examine the impact of hunting, rates of curassow dispersal and zone size on curassow population trends. Results suggest that a Salvin's curassow population which contains 300 breeding individuals has a 99 % probability of persistence for 50 years. The conservation zone, with its current curassow population density, is of sufficient size to contain a <b>viable</b> curassow <b>population</b> for the next 50 years if the guidelines of the current land use plan are maintained. As such it can serve as an important source population for the adjacent hunted zones. The current curassow harvest exceeds this study's recommendations, which estimates that approximately twenty Salvin's curassows could be sustainably harvested annually from the hunted zones. The assurance of secure land use rights and economic return from ecotourism and scientific investigation are important factors affecting the adoption and continued enforcement of land use zones by the Zabalo community...|$|R
40|$|Roads {{have large}} impacts on wildlife, as they form {{one of the}} {{principal}} causes of mortality, and disturbance and fragmentation of habitat. These impacts are mainly studied and mitigated on major roads. It is, however, a widespread misconception that most animals are killed on major roads. In this paper, we argue that minor roads have a larger impact on wildlife with respect to habitat destruction, noise load and traffic mortality. We use data on traffic related deaths in badgers (Meles meles) in The Netherlands to illustrate that traffic mortality is higher on minor roads. We ask for a more extensive investigation of the environmental impacts of minor roads. Moreover, we argue that the success of mitigation on roads drastically increases when both major and minor roads are integrated in the planning of traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a strategy based on the concept of a "traffic-calmed area". Traffic-calmed areas create opportunities for wildlife by decreasing limitations for animal movement. We ask for further studies to estimate what size traffic-calmed areas should be to maintain <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> animal <b>populations.</b> © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|This {{species is}} not {{currently}} listed as threatened or endangered, and the {{populations in the}} southern United States {{are thought to be}} secure. Because of this, it is somewhat difficult to find management plans for this species. There has been research done to determine its usefulness in improving the growth of largemouth bass, a popular sporting fish, though {{it does not seem to}} be able to sustain the predator by itself. Since the fish is secure throughout 50% of its range, states like Alabama have listed it as a fish species of lowest concern. There are some areas where the chubsucker has been extirpated, or is at least thought to be, such as in New York. According to their website, New York management includes trying to find extant populations if they are still present. The most important cause of decline in abundance would appear to be siltation due to human practices of agriculture. There do not appear to be any refuges or conservation easements specific to the lake chubsucker as it is not considered endangered. In Canada some research was conducted to determine how the lake chubsucker was faring, since it has been extirpated in several areas. With no further harm and no recovery efforts, it was suggested that the extant lake chubsucker populations would reach <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>population</b> standards in about 12 years. Populations of E. sucetta in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, are listed as secure; Michigan’s is ranked as apparently secure, Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, North Carolina, Indiana, and Wisconsin are listed as vulnerable, and the populations of Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia, and Ontario are imperiled.

40|$|The <b>minimum</b> ecologically <b>viable</b> <b>population</b> size (MEVP) of {{a species}} {{describes}} the minimum size at which the species itself or another species in the same ecosystem goes extinct {{as a result of}} the loss of inter-specific interactions.

In this study the MEVP is used to investigate what properties of species can be used as good indicators of ecological importance. 100 large computer generated food webs were created with an assembly model and the reduction in density that was necessary to induce an extinction event in the web was subsequently determined for each species within the webs. This change in density was then correlated with 28 different properties, measured for each species. The results show that properties that measure how well connected a species is, as well as measures of the species role as a prey item in the web are the ones with the greatest potential to find species with high MEVP. Further, the results put emphasis on the importance of regarding the web as a whole when working with species extinctions, while also highlighting the usefulness of the MEVP concept...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} a Habitat Management Plan {{is to use the}} best {{available}} science, within an adaptive framework, to provide habitat {{for a wide variety of}} native forest wildlife species while profitably managing private land for wood production. This process is currently under development by Weyerhaeuser Company in Washington State. The process starts with a Watershed Analysis conducted under the forest practices laws of the state. In this analysis, technical experts of the appropriate disciplines identify the causal mechanisms behind those processes (mass wasting, surface erosion, temperature regulation, etc.) which are related to fish habitat and water quality. With knowledge of these mechanisms, and the guidance of the technicians, foresters derive prescriptions to protect these public resources in future management activities. Habitat Management Planning itself then proceeds by setting broad resource goals appropriate to private commercial forestland. Extensive assessments of vegetative characteristics, unique habitat features, and wildlife populations are then performed to provide the initial data on which the plan will be based. A Geographic Information System is an essential tool in this process, providing a means of analyzing field data and displaying current and future habitat conditions. These data are used to evaluate and improve a series of wildlife/habitat models which are initially based primarily on relations developed from the scientific literature. This process of adaptive model improvement is fundamental to the plan. Specific management plans including harvest scheduling and silvicultural prescriptions are then derived in an integrated model which simulates forest development, identifies predicted suitable habitat, and evaluates the outcome in an economic context. Through a series of such simulations a management plan is developed which meets the broad resource goals for wildlife within acceptable economic constraints. Such a process cannot be done without a sophisticated spatial analysis which accounts for wildlife home range size, areas required for <b>minimum</b> <b>viable</b> <b>populations,</b> and such forest management considerations as limits on harvest area size and 2 ̆ 2 green-up 2 ̆ 2 rules. Monitoring of the results of plan implementation is an integral part of the adaptive process, providing a measure of plan effectiveness in meeting objectives, and guiding plan improvements over time. This process is being developed and pilot tested on a 40, 000 hectare block of commercial forestland in coastal Washington State. This presentation provides an overview of the habitat management planning process, describes the technical approaches being used to evaluate and model wildlife and habitat relationships, and displays some of the field data being collected in support of model validation...|$|R
40|$|The {{extinction}} risk {{of threatened}} species {{has traditionally been}} assessed {{by the use of}} tools of Population Viability Analysis (PVA). Species interactions, however, have seldom been accounted for in PVA:s. The omission of species interactions in risk assessments may further lead to serious mistakes when setting target sizes of populations. Even a slight abundance decrease of a target species may result in changes of the community structure; in the worst case leading to a highly impoverished community. Of critical importance to conservation is therefore the question of how many individuals of a certain population that is needed in order to avoid this kind of consequences. In the current study, a stochastic multispecies model is used to estimate <b>minimum</b> ecological <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> (MEVP); earlier defined as “the minimum size of a population that can survive before itself or some other species in the community becomes extinct”. The MEVP:s are compared to population sizes given by a single species model where interactions with other species are treated as a constant source incorporated in the species specific growth rate. MEVP:s are found to be larger than the population sizes given by the single species model. The results are trophic level dependent and multispecies approaches are suggested to be of major importance when setting target levels for species at the basal level. Species at higher trophic levels, however, are altogether more prone to extinction than species at the basal level, irrespective of food web size and food web complexity...|$|R
