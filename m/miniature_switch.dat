40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents RF MEMS capacitive switches {{which are}} based on a thin-film aluminum circular beam geometry that exhibit reduced sensitivity to both initial residual stress and stress-changes versus ambient temperature. The device symmetry also facilitates low- series-inductance compact device arrays for high-value capacitances. These switches are built in the Raytheon RF MEMS process and show an 8 - 10 x improvement in temperature stability over the standard fixed-fixed beam designs. Also, cascadable RF MEMS switched capacitors are demonstrated that are suitable for VHF and UHF tunable filters and reconfigurable matching networks. These devices are fabricated in the UCSD and Raytheon RF MEMS processes and result in a near ideal capacitor impedance over a 30 : 1 frequency range. The circular geometry is then used to demonstrate an RF MEMS switched capacitor with 10 W power handling at 10 GHz under hot-switching conditions that maintains a relatively-low (< 30 V) pull-in voltage. The device consists of separate RF and DC electrodes, which are defined underneath a temperature-stable circular beam, to result in both increased restoring force above the RF electrode and higher RF self-actuation voltage. This thesis also presents a compact low-loss tunable X-Band bandstop filter that is implemented on a quartz substrate using both <b>miniature</b> RF-MEMS capacitive <b>switches</b> and GaAs varactors. The 2 -pole filter is based on capacitively loaded folded-[lambda] resonators that are coupled to a microstrip line, and the filter analysis includes the effects of non-adjacent inter-resonator coupling. The RF MEMS loaded filter results in a measured 25 dB improvement in power handling and linearity compared to the GaAs varactor design.

Chapter 2 presents a miniature RF MEMS metal contact switch based on a tethered-cantilever structure. The miniature size and the use of tethers result in an excellent biaxial residual stress and stress gradient tolerance. The switch is built using thin metal process with a large biaxial stress and a high stress gradient (50 MPa and - 105 MPa/um), and works well under these conditions. In the up-state, the switch capacitance is 9. 4 fF and results in an isolation of 20 dB at 20 GHz. In the down-state, the switch resistance is 3. 6 ohm for a gold-gold contact under 30 V actuation voltage. The switch is compatible with CMOS back-end processing. With its <b>miniature</b> size, the <b>switch</b> could be placed in arrays to achieve lower contact resistance and higher power handling. Chapter 3 presents a multi-contact mN-force RF MEMS metal-contact switchwith a pull-down voltage (Vp) of 45 V- 50 V and an operation voltage of 60 V- 65 V. The switch gets a contact force of s 2. 0 mN under 65 V actuation voltage and a release force of s 1. 2 mN (simulated). The switch gets an on-state resistance of s 1. 8 with Ru-Au contact and an off-state capacitance of 13. 5 fF, which results in a figure of merit of 24 fs. In the temperature stability measurement, the switch shows a change of 4 V in pull-down voltage and a change of 2 V in release voltage from 25 C to 125 C. In the high power handling measurement, the switch demonstrates a reliability of > 10 million cold switching cycles with 5 W RF power. Chapter 4 first presents a high capacitance ratio (Cr) capacitive switch with continuous tuning capability after pull-down. The measured up-state capacitance is 74 fF. The pull-down voltage of the switch is 30 V - 32 V and there is an 8. 4 % linear tuning range from 33 V to 40 V actuation voltage.

To our knowledge, this is the smallest high-performance SPDT switch to-date (0. 04 mm²). Furthermore, the design, fabrication and measurements of a novel metal-contact RF MEMS switch with variable spring constant and high contact and release forces are demonstrated. The spring constant of the switch dramatically increases when the applied voltage is larger than the threshold voltage (Vt), defined as the voltage obtained when the tip touches a dielectric block. This design shows a total contact force and restoring force of 0. 6 - 1. 1 mN and a 0. 5 mN, respectively, for an actuation voltage of 75 - 90 V. The measured switching time is < 10 [mu]s.

The pull-up electrode increases the capacitance ratio from 3. 2 (standard operation with no pull-up electrode) to 5. 8. The pull-up electrode also solves the problem of RF self actuation and the 2 x 2 switch was tested up to 4 W at 5 GHz (pull-up electrode engaged) with no change in the measured S- parameters.
