40|$|Two Pycnogonida {{only have}} been {{collected}} during the cruises of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>vessel</b> ”Cirrus” in deep plankton tows, but both specimens, each belonging to a different species, proved to be of considerable interest. I am indebted to Mr. C. L. Bekkering and Mr. S. D. Koning, who presented this precious material to the Zoölogisch Museum, Amsterdam. The one specimen belongs to a relatively well-known species, Callipallene acus (Meinert, 1898). On {{the basis of this}} material, our knowledge on the external morphology of this species, more particularly on the polymorphism in the legs, could be extended...|$|E

50|$|The {{systematic}} {{scientific studies}} of tropical {{systems in the}} Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea was started during the 19th century by Henry Piddington. Piddington utilised <b>meteorological</b> logs of <b>vessels</b> that navigated the seas and published a series of memoirs, in the “Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal” between 1839 and 1858. These memoirs gave accounts and tracks of individual storms in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.|$|R

The accumulation of ice on <b>vessels</b> depends on <b>meteorological</b> conditions and <b>vessel</b> design. <b>Meteorological</b> data is input into either the Overland or Modified Stallabrass algorithms which calculate the amount of icing that will occur. Ice coverage in the Arctic region has changed significantly since algorithms were developed in the 1980 s. The goal of the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) {{is to create a}} cohesive model that determines the icing rate throughout the North American region. A comprehensive overview of vessel icing algorithms that compared their strengths and weaknesses was conducted to lead to the eventual revision and development of a new algorithm. Specifically, ongoing efforts to obtain new observation data from vessels in the North American region will be used to recalibrate the algorithms by relating the model’s output to the severity of icing described by the observations. After relating the new observational data, a different Overland predictor value can be derived from the simplified heat balance of ice surface [1]. A constant value, for the liquid water content equation, = ∗ 10 ∗ ∗ exp(−), in the Modified Stallabrass algorithm can be calculated with updated data [2]. Current observational data applied to the algorithms will reflect the meteorological conditions in the Arctic. Progress made in the understanding of the meteorological conditions and associated augmentations necessary to the development of accurate icing predictions for vessel safety will be reported...|$|R
