Gill Sans was also used in much of its printed output, very often in capitals-only settings for signage. Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive (part of the British Transport Commission) for signs in its manual {{for the use of}} signpainters painting large signs by hand. Other users included Penguin Books' iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official <b>mapping</b> <b>agency</b> Ordnance Survey. It was also used by London Transport for documents which could not be practically set in Johnston. Paul Shaw, a historian of printing, has described it as a key element of the 'Modernist classical' style from the 1930s to the 1950s, that promoted clean, spare design, often with all-capitals and centred setting of headings.|$|E

25|$|Before the Hodgson Committee, the {{metrication}} {{process was}} already in operation. One example was the Ordnance Survey, the national <b>mapping</b> <b>agency</b> for Great Britain, which initiated the Retriangulation of Great Britain in 1936, using metric measures. A metric National Grid was then {{used as the basis}} for maps published by the Ordnance Survey from World War II onwards, the War Office maps having had a metric grid since 1920. The Ordnance Survey decided on full metrication in 1964. The best-selling 1 inch to the mile range of maps started being replaced with the 1:50000 range in 1969. The metrication of Admiralty Charts began in 1967 as part of a modernisation programme. , road and street maps with primary scales in inches per mile were still being produced by the company Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas.|$|E

2500|$|After 1996, most foreign {{countries}} have carefully avoided taking an unequivocal {{stand on the}} Imia/Kardak issue in favour of either side. However, both Greek and Turkish public opinion has been eager to observe the stance of foreign governments on the issue, as evidenced through details such as the cartographic treatment of Imia/Kardak in maps published by state agencies. Particular close {{attention has been paid}} in this context to maps published by US government agencies. Shortly after the 1996 crisis, the US National Imaging and <b>Mapping</b> <b>Agency</b> (NIMA) removed the Greek name Vrakhoi Imia from its maps, adding instead a note saying [...] "Sovereignty undetermined", but in a new edition a few months later, in October 1996, it reverted that move and returned to the Greek name. In addition, the U.S. administration suggested that Turkey’s claims be taken to a peaceful resolution according to the international law.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for volunteer groups to contribute geographic data to National <b>Mapping</b> <b>Agencies</b> {{has been widely}} recognised. Several investigations have been done to determine the geometric accuracy of this data {{for the purposes of}} national mapping. Beyond accuracy, from a production perspective National <b>Mapping</b> <b>Agencies</b> will also be interested in the sufficiency and uniformity of the data. This paper presents an investigation of whether presently geographic data generated by volunteers is uniform across a country and whether the rate of production of data is consistent. For the purpose of the test, changes in data of South Africa from OpenStreetMap are analysed for the period 2006 to 2011. Here only point and line data are considered. The results generally show that the rate at which data is generated varies in space and time. The results also confirm that volunteers emphasise on the capture of certain information and that the capture doesn’t average out as might be expected. The results also showed that social events, such as a World Cup, also have the effect of spurring the generation of volunteer geographic data. The implication of these results for National <b>Mapping</b> <b>Agencies</b> is that they cannot treat volunteer geographic information as being of a uniform standard. How National <b>Mapping</b> <b>Agencies</b> respond to this will have to be the subject of other investigations. OTB ResearchOTB Research Institute for the Built Environmen...|$|R

It really is of interest, if official authorities like National <b>Mapping</b> <b>Agencies</b> (NMAs) are starting to implement the RPASs technology within their specific data acquisition processes – to establish alternatives to their traditional manned photogrammetric survey flights. The European Spatial Data Research organization (EuroSDR), representing European NMAs and research organizations of currently 17 European states, is following UAV developments since end of 2004, where an ongoing activity was created, to continuously update their members on the developments in this technology. As systems consolidated, new impetus was given to more deeply explore the potential RPAS for national mapping. Today first national <b>mapping</b> <b>agencies</b> have already used RPAS based data for first experiments in mapping. Several NMAs are discussing on the future role of this technology within their agencies.
