5000|$|The {{problem that}} caused the {{accident}} was immediately obvious, as the rear cargo door was missing and had caused severe damage to the left horizontal stabilizer as it blew off. Investigators immediately studied the maintenance history and found that on March 3, 1972, {{three months before the}} accident, the handlers reported that the door had not latched electrically and had to be closed manually. On May 30, McDonnell Douglas issued Service Bulletin 52-27, DC-10 SC 612, which called for the upgrading of the electrical wiring that drove the latches because [...] "Three operators have reported failure of the electrical <b>latch</b> <b>actuators</b> to latch/unlatch the cargo doors. <b>Latch</b> <b>actuator</b> failure is attributed to an excessive voltage drop reducing the output torque to the actuator. This condition may prevent electrical latching/unlatching of the hooks." [...] The modification was not compulsory, however, and had not been carried out on N103AA, the plane involved in the incident.|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Flight 96, the NTSB made several recommendations. Its primary concern was the addition of vents in the rear cabin floor that would ensure that a cargo area decompression would equalise the cabin area, and not place additional load onto the floor. In fact, most of the DC-10 fuselage had vents like these, only those {{in the rear of}} the aircraft lacked them. Additionally, the NTSB suggested that upgrades to the locking mechanism and to the <b>latching</b> <b>actuator</b> electrical system be made compulsory. Despite this, the FAA also agreed with McDonnell-Douglas' assessment that additional venting would be too expensive to implement and did not demand that this change be made.|$|R

However many low power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} a novel type of MEMS optical switch based on moving waveguide which has merits inherited from both MEMS and integrated optics technologies. It provides an expandable 2 × 2 switching capability, a first {{in this category}} of switches. The switch is built by assembling independently optimized <b>latching</b> silicon <b>actuator</b> and soft polymer waveguides. The actuator is based on two new structures: a microhinge, dubbed the fork hinge, and a latching structure using a precompressed microspring. The mechanical switching speed was measured below 0. 5 ms. The complex polymer waveguide structure was thoroughly characterized to obtain all {{the components of the}} optical loss. This analysis allowed us to estimate robustly the insertion loss of the assembled optical switch below 3 dB and to identify the possibilities to improve this figure...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 40) A {{need for}} a self <b>latching</b> solenoid <b>actuator</b> was created by commercial applications where reliability, minimum power consumption, minimum weight and reduced cost were important. As a result, {{the concept of a}} magnetic circuit that utilizes the residual magnetism retained in the magnetic materials was developed. With that concept in mind, the developmental program proceeded to find means to optimize the power consumption of the solenoid actuator and eliminate the {{need for a}}n external electrical pulse. To accomplish those tasks, an electrical analogy of the electro-mechanical system was used. The electrical circuit employs a switch, mechanically coupled to the armature movement, which controls the amount of energy used by the actuator and thereby eliminates the need for an external electrical pulse. The actuator's principle of operation, system behavior, concept verification and test results are presented herein...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the 2 D FEM {{which used to}} calculate the dynamic electromagnetic torque of TRL 5 magnetic latching relay in ANSYS. The operation principle of magnetic latching relay is introduced and the generation mechanism of Lorenz forces is analyzed as well. The magnetic theory applied to obtain the electromagnetic torque of the magnetic <b>latching</b> relay <b>actuator</b> is discussed by the authors. Furthermore, the Maxwell stress tensor and virtual work methods, which are employed in ANSYS to calculate the electromagnetic torque are investigated. The coordinates’ variation characteristics of the yoke and permanent magnet during the whole operation of relay shows that the dynamic electromagnetic torque can be calculated by using coordinate changes. Thus, we transform the dynamic solution into a static solution successfully, which reduces the difficulty and complexity of modeling and calculation greatly. Finally, the calculation sample of TRL 5 magnetic latching relay is given to explain the modeling process in ANSYS. The simulation results indicate that the electromagnetic torque increases with the increase of the rotation angle and it reaches the maximum when the armature pulls in completely...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the loss}} of the first X- 43 during launch, the mishap {{investigation}} board indicated the Fin Actuator System (FAS) needed to have a larger torque margin. To supply this added torque, a second actuator was added. The consequences of {{what seemed to be a}} simple modification would trouble the X- 43 program. Because of the second actuator, a new computer board was required. This proved to be subject to electronic noise. This resulted in the <b>actuator</b> <b>latch</b> up in ground tests of the FAS for the second launch. Such a latch up would cause the Pegasus booster to fail, as the FAS was a single string system. The problem was corrected and the second flight was successful. The same modifications were added to the FAS for flight three. When the FAS underwent ground tests, it also latched up. The failure indicated that each computer board had a different tolerance to electronic noise. The problem with the FAS was corrected. Subsequently, another failure occurred, raising questions about the design, and the probability of failure for the X- 43 Mach 10 flight. This was not simply a technical issue, but illuminated the difficulties facing both managers and engineers in assessing risk, design requirements, and probabilities in cutting edge aerospace projects...|$|R
