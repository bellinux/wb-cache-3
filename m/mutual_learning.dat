In July 2010, it was announced that HCI would be developing a school in the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City in Guangzhou, China, akin to that of its first satellite campus, following the inking of a memorandum of understanding (MOU).

In this paper, we develop a discriminant <b>mutual</b> subspace <b>learning</b> algorithm for indoor and outdoor face recognition. Unlike traditional algorithms using one subspace to model both indoor and outdoor face images, our algorithm simultaneously learn two related subspaces for indoor and outdoor images respectively thus can better model both. To further improve the recognition performance we develop a DMSL-based multiclassifier fusion framework on Gabor images using a new fusion method called adaptive informative fusion scheme. Experimental results clearly show that this framework can greatly enhance the recognition performance. 1...|$|R

Despite this fact, many organisations are finding it difficult to effectively manage knowledge. This study reports on the 'soft' enablers of knowledge management in Malaysian MSC status companies. These enablers were identified using multiple case studies. The results indicate that there are nine factors namely collaboration, <b>mutual</b> trust, <b>learning,</b> leadership, incentives/rewards, centralisation, formalisation, T-shaped skills and kiasu-ism impacting knowledge management activities in these companies. To our knowledge, {{this is perhaps the}} first study of its kind in Malaysia. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how two people, {{a professor in}} educational administration and a graduate student who acted as coach, used the coaching process {{as a part of}} collaborative action research. It focuses on the professor-coach interpersonal issues of <b>mutual</b> trust, new <b>learning,</b> and autonomy. The graduate student was an expert in coaching methods and a central-office administrator, who observed the professor's teaching behaviors over two semesters. These coach's learning concerns were also shared by students and the professor: the lessening needs for clarity and structure; the resolution of tension associated with new learning; the working toward <b>mutual</b> respect; the <b>learning</b> to trust of adult autonomy; and the recognition that change needs time. The coaching-learning process, which initially led to stress, pain, and lack of clarity, evolved into flexibility, an acceptance of complexity, and a renewed appreciation for other ways of teaching and learning.

We argue that the very heterogeneity of the students with respect to their socio-cultural background and personal experiences offers a rich potential for <b>mutual</b> social <b>learning</b> that reinforces formal education activities.
