The doctor had arrived at Penetanguishene in 1959, and in 1965 stepped up his efforts to reform the unit's programmes, which on his arrival were still based around the traditional methods of neuroleptic tranquillisation and electroconvulsive therapy, supplemented by long periods of isolation for each inmate. Barker innovated a programme whereby the patients could spend more {{of their time in}} each other's company, in a more natural environment; he believed that the key to overcoming these illnesses was communication. [...] "My original vision," [...] he writes, [...] "was that I wasn't really dealing with patients. I thought we could evolve a social structure where people could resolve the internal conflicts in community." [...] Barker's [...] "Social Therapy Unit" [...] (STU), initially made up exclusively of young male psychopaths and schizophrenics of normal intelligence, began in September 1965, with a programme of 80 hours of treatment a week, focussing on cures brought about by mutual cooperation and interaction. Joan Hollobon, the <b>medical</b> <b>editor</b> of the Toronto Globe and Mail, volunteered in 1967 to spend two days at Oak Ridge {{as if she were a}} patient, and afterwards heaped praise on the inmates, saying that they were [...] "pioneering a brave and exciting experiment in self-government and self-therapy ... individual responsibility, co-operation with colleagues and authority, and acceptance of rules reached by consensus." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bioidentical hormones {{have been}} advertised, marketed and {{promoted}} as a risk-free panacea that is safer than standard HRT. [...] Literature reviews by private practitioners who sell bioidentical preparations suggest benefits and advantages {{in the use}} of BHRT over its conventional counterpart, but there is significant skepticism over claims made about BHRT; there is no peer-reviewed evidence that compounded bioidentical hormones are safer or more effective than FDA-approved formulations or that they carry less risk. [...] The hormones are expected to carry the same risks as their conventional counterparts, while the risks of including estriol—a hormone normally produced in large amounts only in pregnant women—have not been studied. [...] The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned that claims about compounded BHRT products are unsupported by medical evidence—unlike claims about manufactured, FDA-approved products. Bioidentical hormones have been described as a form of marketing; the chief <b>medical</b> <b>editor</b> of Endocrine Today called compounded BHRT a [...] "marketing concept" [...] with no scientific backing, and the FDA warned that pharmacies use these terms to imply that the drugs are natural and have the same effects as endogenous hormones. [...] Other claims include compounded BHRT's ability to prevent or treat conditions such as heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, endometrial and breast cancer; fewer side effects; and custom blending to uniquely address individuals. [...] There is no credible evidence to support these claims. Bioidentical hormones and compounded BHRT are expected to have the same risks and benefits as CHRT; the latter benefits from years of study and regulation, while compounded BHRT has no scientific data to support claims of superior safety or efficacy. The following specific claims have been made for the efficacy of bioidentical hormones and compounded BHRT, with varying evidence to support or contradict them: ...|$|E
