The JTWC then issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late the next day as the system moved westward and started warnings on Tropical Depression 29W on November 1. However, intensification was severely inhibited by outflow from nearby Typhoon Dan, and the depression failed to develop. It passed within 30 nmi (55 km) of Wake Island, causing a <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> dip and gusts to 32 kn (60 km/h).

30|$|In quartz-dominated {{sandstones}} with quartz overgrowths, {{the most}} probable source of silica is from quartz dissolution along grain contacts (commonly stylolite) and feldspar dissolution (Walderhaug 2000; Tournier et al. 2010). The feldspar alteration, {{in this case}} kaolinitization, could release considerable amounts of silica ions (Bjørlykke 1983). In this study, the sandstones experienced <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> dissolution; additionally, both the authigenic kaolinite and released silica are the products of feldspar dissolution, and there is indeed {{a positive correlation between}} authigenic kaolinite and quartz overgrowth (Fig.  8 c). It is proposed in this study that the most probable silica source for quartz overgrowth is the dissolution of local feldspars and pressure dissolution has provided a minor contribution.|$|E
40|$|Refrigerant {{maldistribution}} in the microchannel {{heat exchanger}} (MCHX), though mainly due to phase separation in the header in two-phase flow, is also {{affected by the}} pressure drop in the header. This paper investigates the single-phase flow pressure drop of nitrogen, R 134 a vapor, and R 134 a liquid in the vertical header of a multi-pass microchannel heat exchanger. The objective {{is to develop a}} model for the single-phase pressure drop in the header and provide the basis for two-phase flow pressure drop model. The fluid enters into the vertical header through five microchannel tubes in the bottom pass and exits through the five microchannel tubes in the top pass representing the flow in the outdoor MCHX of a reversible system under heat pump mode. The local pressure drop across each exit microchannel tube in the header is measured at various inlet mass flow rates. For nitrogen and R 134 a vapor, the local pressure drop usually reduces along the upward flow in the header. For R 134 a liquid, the local pressure drop is highest across the second exit tube, then it decreases along the upward flow. The measured overall local pressure drop includes the acceleration, gravitation, friction, and <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> drop due to the protruded microchannel tube. The <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> drop coefficient based on the experimental results is compared with the existed empirical correlation. It is found that the empirical correlation works well for nitrogen and R 134 a vapor but not for R 134 a liquid. A new correlation for R 134 a liquid is proposed with the same format, but the coefficients are derived based on the experimental results of this study using the least square curve-fit method...|$|E

40|$|Parallel channel configurations, such as Z-type, used to {{distribute}} reagents in planar fuel cells provide lower overall pressure drop {{as compared to}} other channel designs. However, due to their inherent characteristics, flow maldistribution in parallel configurations is commonly observed and leads to starvation of reagents in middle channels. In addition, the Reynolds number dependent minor losses at branching tee junctions may cause asymmetric flow non-uniformity and reagent imbalance between the cathode and anode. Herein, we present a universal and simple optimization method to simultaneously reduce flow maldistribution, asymmetry, and parasitic pressure in Z-type parallel configurations of fuel cells or fuel cell stacks that has improved scalability relative to previous methods. A discrete model's governing equations were reduced to yield geometric ratios between headers. Increasing header widths to satisfy these ratios reduced flow maldistribution without modifying parallel channel geometry as validated by computation fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Furthermore, decreased Reynolds numbers throughout the headers reduced <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> drops and flow distribution asymmetry. We offer several methods to reduce the optimized geometry's footprint, including an adaptation of the discontinuous design. close 0...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Sediments {{considered}} to be of Permian or Permo-Triassic age are exposed {{in many areas of}} Scotland and within several offshore basins. These sediments were deposited within fault-bounded, intermontane basins and represent a variety of continental facies typical of arid or semi-arid areas. A major study of the diagenetic evolution of the Scottish Pcrmo-Triassic reveals that the basins were isochcmical and experienced similar patterns of diagenesis, largely controlled by the climatic aridity of the depositional environment. Depositional pore-waters in the Permo-Triassic sediments of Scotland were well oxygenated and alkaline in nature, allowing the rapid alteration of the unstable mineral assemblage. Ionic complexes r leased as a result ofthis alteration were precipitated as a suite of eodiagenetic minerals with oxygen isotope analysis on the authigenic K-feldspar phase confirming an origin from meteoric watcrs in an arid climate. These eodiagenetic modifications resulted in a major loss of primary porosity.

40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of flat-plate solar collectors with riser and header arrangements is {{strongly influenced by}} the flow distribution through the absorber tubes. A more uniform flow distribution leads to a homogenous temperature distribution which gives higher collector efficiency. The Z distribution usually has better performance when compared to P distribution. The design of the manifold influences the observed flow distribution. To optimize the manifold design, a correlation model was developed, based on correlations for <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> losses. Furthermore, the flow in this optimized geometry was simulated in 3 D using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software code in order to confirm {{the results of the}} correlation based model. A new experimental low-intrusive technique was used to measure the flow distribution in an existing solar collector, validating the simulation results. The flow inside the absorber tubes is laminar; the major pressure loss inside riser tubes was measured using a high accuracy differential pressure transmitter, which then permits the indirect estimation of the mean velocity inside the tubes. It {{was the first time that}} this experimental methodology has been applied to analyse the flow distribution in solar collectors. The influence of the total water flow rate was analysed. For a good flow distribution it was concluded that the outlet header manifold should have a higher diameter compared to the inlet header diameter.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the mathematical formulation of a nonlinear programming (NLP) model which optimizes simultaneously crude oil blending and operating {{conditions for a}} system of several crude oil distillation units (CDUs) at a Colombian refinery. The CDU system consists of three industrial units processing a blending of five extra-heavy crude oils and producing two commercial fuels, Jet- 1 A and Diesel. The NLP model involves typical restrictions (e. g., flow rate according to capacity of pumps, distillation columns, etc.) and the heat integration of streams from atmospheric distillation towers (ADTs) and vacuum distillation towers (VDTs) with the heat exchanger networks for crude oil preheating. A metamodeling approach is used so as to represent the ADTs. Preheating networks are modeled with mass, energy balances, and design equations of each heat exchanger. The NLP model has been implemented in GAMS using CONOPT as solver. Different cases are solved by the NLP model such that the optimal case with less profit increment had an economical benefit of 13 % with respect to its case without optimization.

Pairs of wide and narrow channels, with integrated pressure sensors, are connected via transition sections with included angles varying from 5 degrees to 180 degrees. <b>Minor</b> <b>pressure</b> losses (not due to friction) were studied by passing nitrogen through the channels under inlet pressures up to 60 p. s. i.

The detailed pressure distribution along the straight segments and around the transition section was then measured in order to understand the flow pattern. The Reynolds number for these flows is less than 1, suggesting the flow to be of the Hele-Shaw type with no separation such that the results for all the devices should be similar. However, the flow rate was found to decrease and the pressure loss to increase significantly with increasing included angle of the transition section, regardless of the flow direction.

40|$|A hot {{filtration}} unit downstream of a 1 kg/h fluidised bed fast pyrolysis reactor {{was designed and}} built. The filter unit operates at 450 oC and consists of 1 exchangeable filter candle with reverse pulse cleaning system. Hot filtration experiments up to 7 hours were performed with beech wood as feedstock. It was possible to produce fast pyrolysis oils with a solid content below 0. 01 wt%. The additional residence time of the pyrolysis vapours and secondary vapour cracking on the filter cake caused an increase of non-condensable gases {{at the expense of}} organic liquid yield. The oils produced with hot filtration showed superior quality properties regarding viscosity than standard pyrolysis oils. The oils were analysed by rotational viscosimetry and gel permeation chromatography before and after accelerated aging. During filtration the separated particulates accumulate on the candle surface and build up the filter cake. The filter cake leads to an increase in pressure drop between the raw gas and the clean gas side of the filter candle. At a certain pressure drop the filter cake has to be removed by reverse pulse cleaning to regenerate the pressure drop. The experiments showed that successful pressure drop recovery was possible during the initial filtration cycles, thereafter further cycles showed <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> drop recovery and therefore a steady increase in differential pressure.

Results can be classified into two parts: previous test data and the EES program model. Previous test data include fan performance curves produced by the Riverside Energy Efficiency Laboratory (REEL), vent cap performance data produced by a former student at the REEL facility and capture efficiency data published by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). An assortment of six (6) fans, twenty-two (22) vent caps, and the capture efficiency equations were used to complete a mathematical model in the EES program. The vent cap performance data collected was for the two most common residential ventilation duct diameters, 4 -inch and 6 -inch in the variety of wall-mounted, roof-jack, and soffit. With most range-hoods using the larger duct size, all fan performance curves collected were 6 -inch round. Trend lines using a spreadsheet calculator were constructed to fit the associated static pressure and flow rate data plots. It was shown that increasing the R^ 2 value to a maximum of one (1) did not necessarily produce trend lines similar to the experimental data. In fact, a third degree polynomial trend line in most cases fit the experimental data better than a larger degree polynomial. Graphing alongside the experimental data was determined to {{be the best way to}} quickly see how well the trend line fit the experimental data.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out high {{resolution}} MHD simulations of the nonlinear evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable flows in 2 1 / 2 dimensions. The modeled flows and fields were initially uniform {{except for a}} thin shear layer with a hyperbolic tangent velocity profile and a small, normal mode perturbation. The calculations consider periodic sections of flows containing magnetic fields parallel to the shear layer, but projecting over {{a full range of}} angles with respect to the flow vectors. They are intended as preparation for fully 3 D calculations and to address two specific questions raised in earlier work: 1) What role, if any, does the orientation of the field play in nonlinear evolution of the MHD Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in 2 1 / 2 D. 2) Given that the field is too weak to stabilize against a linear perturbation of the flow, how does the nonlinear evolution of the instability depend on strength of the field. The magnetic field component in the third direction contributes only through <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> contributions, so the flows are essentially 2 D. Even a very weak field can significantly enhance the rate of energy dissipation. In all of the cases we studied magnetic field amplification by stretching in the vortex is limited by tearing mode, ``fast'' reconnection events that isolate and then destroy magnetic flux islands within the vortex and relax the fields outside the vortex. If the magnetic tension developed prior to reconnection is comparable to Reynolds stresses in the flow, that flow is reorganized during reconnection. Otherwise, the primary influence on the plasma is generation of entropy.

40|$|The {{function}} of the suppression-chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers is to relieve vacuum in the drywell. There are four vacuum breakers located outside the primary containment which form {{an extension of the}} primary containment boundary. The vacuum relief valves are mounted in special piping between the drywell and the suppression chamber, which allow air and steam flow from the suppression chamber to the drywell when the drywell is at a negative pressure with respect to the suppression chamber. Therefore, suppression chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers prevent an excessive negative differential pressure across the wetwell drywell boundary. Each vacuum breaker is a self actuating valve with one vacuum breaker in each line. Manual isolation valves are located on each side of each vacuum breaker. A negative differential pressure across the drywell wall is caused by rapid depressurization of the drywell. Events that cause this rapid depressurization are cooling cycles, inadvertent drywell spray actuation, and steam condensation from sprays or subcooled water reflood of a break {{in the event of a}} primary system rupture. Cooling cycles result in <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> transients in the drywell that occur slowly and are normally controlled by heating and ventilation equipment. Spray actuation or spill of subcooled water out of a break results in more significant pressure transients and becomes important in sizing the vacuum breakers. In the event of a primary system rupture, steam condensation within the drywell results in the most severe pressure transient. Following a primary system rupture, air in the drywell is purged into the suppression chamber free airspace, leaving the drywell full of steam. Subsequent condensation of the steam can be caused in two possible ways, namely, Emergency Core Cooling Systems flow from a recirculation line break, or drywell spray actuation following a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). These two cases determine the maximum depressurization rate of the drywell...|$|E

Peloids and intraclasts, derived mainly from {{the breakdown of the}} calcified algae Girvanella and Epiphyton, are the most important allochems in the fine-grained sediments. [...] Burial compaction occurred mainly in argillaceous sediments. Limestones are uncompacted and demonstrate only <b>minor</b> <b>pressure</b> solution effects. Intrastratal deformation was due to submarine failure and layer-parallel compression during Taconic orogenesis. Subtly-expressed synsedimentary deformation fabrics indicate that slope failure was more common than is apparent based solely on the presence of intraformational truncation surfaces and slide masses. [...] In conglomerates, clasts with diagenetic microfabrics identical to those of the thinly-bedded, fine-grained sediments indicate that lithification (calcite authigenesis, early dolomitization, and some silicification) occurred within several metres of the sediment-water interface. Carbon isotope analyses suggest that carbonate precipitation was driven by bacterial sulphate reduction and methane generation. Trace element (Mg, Fe, Mn, and Sr) and cathode luminescence patterns record calcite precipitation from progressively more reduced pore-waters. These patterns are indistinguishable from those generated during meteoric-water diagenesis. [...] Cathode luminescence microfabrics of radiaxial fibrous calcite from shallow-water boulders in conglomerates and in situ displacive fibrous calcite indicate that these crystals are composite and grew both as spherocrystals and unit crystals. Aggrading neospar on the margins of mudstone beds and nodules resulted from decreased nucleation density and precipitation of progressively younger calcite, commonly as asymmetrical, irregular increments. [...] Three types of dolomite are differentiated: (1) detrital, (2) early diagenetic, and (3) late diagenetic. Silt-size particles of detrital dolomite were derived from weathering of older carbonates or penecontemporaneous dolomite from the adjacent, shallow-water platform. Diagenetic dolomite occurs both as a replacement and a pore-filling phase. Early dolomitization was synchronous with or postdated the main phase of calcite authigenesis. Late dolomitization is related to tectonic faults and joints. Silicification also has a protracted diagenetic history, but its distribution is controlled primarily by the abundance of radiolaria and siliceous sponge spicules...|$|E
40|$|Oil and gas {{have been}} {{produced}} from onshore and offshore fields for more than 100 years, and production rates are falling for the most easily accessible fields. New oil fields are found at deeper and more remote areas, and exploration costs are increasing. A new tool that can enhance the well testing process is a wireline operated downhole shut-in valve. In order to get as precise as possible results from the well testing, the two-phase pressure drop across the shut-in valve must be known. The flow path through this shut-in valve is however complex and cannot easily be compared to standard tubing parts and singularities. Frictional pressure losses in pipes are well understood now and have been studied {{by a number of}} authors since the late forties. <b>Minor</b> <b>pressure</b> losses arise from singularities like bends, contractions, expansions etc. Two-phase flow minor losses have also been studied by many authors, but only for well-defined and common shapes like bends, nozzles, sharp edged contractions etc. In a typical industrial application like the shut-in valve, the flow path is complex. More research is therefore needed {{in order to be able}} to predict the two-phase pressure drop in a complex flow path. The modeling methods developed here should hopefully be applicable to other two-phase flow systems as well. The main objective for this work is therefore to find methods for modeling twophase flow in complex geometries with several singularities and changes of cross section. The work has included design, construction and instrumentation of a full scale shut-in valve mock-up. A series of experiments have been performed with two-phase flow of air, water and two different oil types. This provides a valuable experimental data base for two-phase flow in a typical downhole valve. Furthermore an in-house simulation tool for 1 -D models was implement, verified and validated. The first achievement in this thesis is the validation of 3 -dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of single-phase flow in the valve. Provided that the mesh is properly designed etc. the deviation in pressure drop is only 3 - 6 % compared to experimental data. The next achievement is the 1 -D modeling of the flow in the valve. This 1 -D model serves as a necessary basis for the two-phase simulations. The main achievement is the implementation of two-phase flow in the 1 -D model. Two approaches are used. First classical flow pattern independent correlations are applied, and then the state-of-the-art Unified Comprehensive Model formulation is introduced. The latter provides the best results with only some 10 % deviation in pressure drop...|$|E
40|$|A 36 -year-old {{woman and}} a 49 -year-old man with {{symptoms}} of an obstructive sleep-apnoea syndrome benefited insufficiently from the therapy of choice, i. e. treatment with continuous positive airway <b>pressure.</b> <b>Minor</b> surgical procedures to improve the upper airways {{did not have the}} desired effect. Subsequently, maxillo-mandibular osteotomy was performed. Thereafter, both the daytime somnolence and the snoring during sleep disappeared. Indications for osteotomy of the maxilla and mandible are: failure of conservative therapy or other forms of treatment with a lower morbidity, severe mandibular hypoplasia, extreme respiratory distress and morbid obesity. Ventral displacement of the maxilla or mandible eliminates the obstruction {{at the level of the}} base of the tongue. The operation is successful for the first year in 95 % of the patients.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{soybean oil}} hydrogenation process (metal catalyst on solid support particles slurried in oil, H 2 bubbled through the oil) {{is compared to}} metal-decorated integral-asymmetric polyetherimide (PEI) membranes, as far as changes in temperature and pressure are concerned. Using metal decorated-polymeric membranes, H 2 is supplied to the catalytic sites by permeation from the membrane substructure. As opposed to the slurry process, metal-decorated membranes show only slightly increased trans fatty acid (TFA) formation when the temperature is raised (50 - 90 °C) to accelerate the process. This is likely due to the efficient {{and to some extent}} self-regulating H 2 supply directly to the catalytic sites on the membrane skin. The hydrogenation rate and TFA formation of the metal decorated membrane process show a <b>minor</b> dependence on <b>pressure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Amphibolite-facies para- and orthogneisses near Dulan, in the {{southeast}} part of the North Qaidam terrane, enclose <b>minor</b> ultra-high <b>pressure</b> (UHP) eclogite and peridotite. Field relations and coesite inclusions in zircons from paragneiss suggest that felsic, mafic, and ultramafic rocks all experienced UHP metamorphism and a common amphibolite-facies retrogression. Ion microprobe U–Pb and REE analyses of zircons from two granitic orthogneisses indicate magmatic crystallization at 927 ± Ma and 921 ± 7 Ma. Zircon rims {{in one of these}} samples yield younger ages (397 – 618 Ma) compatible with partial zircon recrystallization during in-situ Ordovician-Silurian eclogite-facies metamorphism previously determined from eclogite and paragneiss in this area. The similarity between a 2496 ± 18 Ma xenocrystic core and 2. 4 – 2. 5 Ga zircon cores in the surrounding paragneiss suggests that the granites intruded the sediments or that the granite is a melt of the older basement which supplied detritus to the sediments. The magmatic ages of the granitic orthogneisses are similar to 920 – 930 Ma ages of (meta) granitoids described further northwest in the North Qaidam terrane and its correlative west of the Altyn Tagh fault, suggesting that these areas formed a coherent block prior to widespread Mid Proterozoic granitic magmatism.
