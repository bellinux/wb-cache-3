In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no <b>mental</b> <b>disability,</b> Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E

50|$|Most {{children}} with milder forms of <b>mental</b> <b>disabilities</b> {{learn how to}} take care of their basic needs, but they often require training in self-management skills to achieve the levels of performance necessary for eventual independent living. Making and sustaining friendships and personal relationships present significant challenges for many persons with <b>mental</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Limited cognitive processing skills, poor language development, and unusual or inappropriate behaviors can seriously impede interacting with others. Teaching students with <b>mental</b> <b>disabilities</b> appropriate social and interpersonal skills is one of the most important functions of special education. Students with <b>mental</b> <b>disabilities</b> more often exhibit behavior problems than {{children with}}out disabilities. Some of the behaviors observed by students with <b>mental</b> <b>disabilities</b> are difficulties accepting criticism, limited self-control, and bizarre and inappropriate behaviors. The greater the severity of the <b>mental</b> <b>disabilities,</b> generally the higher the incidence of behavioral problems.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or <b>mental</b> <b>disability</b> every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or <b>mental</b> <b>disability,</b> agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E

500|$|Burnet {{was born}} in Traralgon, Victoria; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish {{emigrant}} to Australia, was {{the manager of the}} Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (née Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of Koroit. Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah when they married in 1893. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as [...] "Mac". He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a <b>mental</b> <b>disability</b> that consumed most of Hadassah's time and the family saw Doris's condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father—who liked to spend his free time fishing and playing golf—from a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father's character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.|$|E

This legislation extends previous federal law and promises anti- discrimination protection for all persons with physical and <b>mental</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Disability advocates across the nation cheered when President George Bush signed the ADA into law in July 1990. However, as with many pieces of legislation, the story did not end with Congress passing the ADA or President Bush signing it.
