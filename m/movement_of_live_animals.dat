40|$|Outbreaks {{of animal}} {{diseases}} such as {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) are of great concern for agriculture. In this paper, we quantify the potential dynamic impacts of such a disease on Brittany, a French region with an important livestock sector. In order to do this, we develop a dynamic computable general equilibrium model that allows us to measure the impacts on the livestock sectors and downstream food industries. We study the impacts of a FMD outbreak including the culling infected animals, a temporary decline in demand, and restrictions on <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> and meats during the FMD outbreak period. Our results show that economic losses following this disease are spread over many periods even with a one-time shock. We also find that the impacts on the various primary sectors and downstream food sectors are quite different, depending on their initial trade position. Our general equilibrium results show the great incidence of potential constraints affecting factor markets. Capital and wage constraints severely increase the aggregate costs of such disease. These results challenge the definition of a simple efficient management policy for this disease...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{comprehensive}} review of literature and OIE (World Animal Health Organisation) outbreak reports, this scientific opinion reports, first, that {{there is no evidence that}} Rift Valley fever (RVF) has spread to previously uninfected countries during the past 10 years. Nevertheless, RVF has moved north within Mauritania, in a desert area. Secondly, maps of Europe and the southern Mediterranean Basin are provided, displaying the geographic distribution of the reported presence of nine potentially competent Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vectors of the region, based on a systematic literature review. From environmental and eco-climatic data, predicted presence maps were generated that suggest the suitability of several parts of Europe and the southern Mediterranean Basin for these potentially competent RVFV vectors. Thirdly, to assess the risk of introduction of RVFV into some designated countries in the southern Mediterranean Basin (hereafter defined as the region concerned, RC), especially through the <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> and vectors, a quantitative model was constructed and model parameters were derived based on expert knowledge elicitation (EKE). The EKE model indicates that some hundreds of RVFV-infected animals will be moved into the RC when an epidemic in the source areas occurs. The risk of RVFV entering the RC through the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> vectors is expected to be small in comparison with the risk of entry through infected animals. Because of a lack of quantitative information on the seasonality of vector abundance and vertical transmission of RVFV within local vector species, the risk of endemicity could not be assessed. However, based on the abundance of the vector Culex pipiens, the livestock densities and the temperature in the region, there is a potential for the occurrence of RVF spread in the coastal areas of the RC...|$|R
40|$|In most European countries, data {{regarding}} <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> are routinely collected and can greatly aid predictive epidemic modeling. However, {{the use of}} complete movements' dataset to conduct policy-relevant predictions has been so far limited by the massive amount of data {{that have to be}} processed (e. g., in intensive commercial systems) or the restricted availability of timely and updated records on animal movements (e. g., in areas where small-scale or extensive production is predominant). The aim {{of this study was to}} use exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to reproduce, understand, and predict pig trade networks in different European production systems. Three trade networks were built by aggregating <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> pig batches among premises (farms and trade operators) over 2011 in Bulgaria, Extremadura (Spain), and Côtes-d'Armor (France), where small-scale, extensive, and intensive pig production are predominant, respectively. Three ERGMs were fitted to each network with various demographic and geographic attributes of the nodes as well as six internal network configurations. Several statistical and graphical diagnostic methods were applied to assess the goodness of fit of the models. For all systems, both exogenous (attribute-based) and endogenous (network-based) processes appeared to govern the structure of pig trade network, and neither alone were capable of capturing all aspects of the network structure. Geographic mixing patterns strongly structured pig trade organization in the small-scale production system, whereas belonging to the same company or keeping pigs in the same housing system appeared to be key drivers of pig trade, in intensive and extensive production systems, respectively. Heterogeneous mixing between types of production also explained a part of network structure, whichever production system considered. Limited information is thus needed to capture most of the global structure of pig trade networks. Such findings will be useful to simplify trade networks analysis and better inform European policy makers on risk-based and more cost-effective prevention and control against swine diseases such as African swine fever, classical swine fever, or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome.

Key West was chosen as the venue for this conference for many interlocking reasons. It is the most southerly point of the continental USA, it has been a vital import station for human travelers and animals, and it is as tropical as it can be in Florida. The island has a fascinating history and maintains an ambiance that is unique; if indeed a little rebellious at times! Over the five days of the conference, we hope you will find time to explore the history and cosmopolitan nature of Key West. The program committee has put together an outstanding agenda that covers the many issues faced by tropical veterinary medicine. Despite improved technology utilizing diagnostic tests and vaccines, the international <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> and the complexity of food trading patterns is increasing the worldwide risk of emerging diseases for both animals and man. Animal pathogens continue to establish new niches and undergo genetic mutation. We hope you will take advantage of the many opportunities this conference provides to interact with colleagues from around the world, and to discuss common concerns and up-to-date research on tropical and emerging diseases...|$|E

40|$|<b>Movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> {{is a key}} {{contributor}} to disease spread. Farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, rainbow trout Onchorynchus mykiss and brown/sea trout Salmo trutta are initially raised in freshwater (FW) farms; all the salmon {{and some of the}} trout are subsequently moved to seawater (SW) farms. Frequently, fish are moved between farms during their FW stage and sometimes during their SW stage. Seasonality and differences in contact patterns across production phases have been shown to influence the course of an epidemic in livestock; however, these parameters have not been included in previous network models studying disease transmission in salmonids. In Scotland, farmers are required to register fish movements onto and off their farms; these records were {{used in the present study}} to investigate seasonality and heterogeneity of movements for each production phase separately for farmed salmon, rainbow trout and brown/sea trout. Salmon FW-FW and FW-SW movements showed a higher degree of heterogeneity in number of contacts and different seasonal patterns compared with SW-SW movements. FW-FW movements peaked from May to July and FW-SW movements peaked from March to April and from October to November. Salmon SW-SW movements occurred more consistently over the year and showed fewer connections and number of repeated connections between farms. Therefore, the salmon SW-SW network might be treated as homogeneous regarding the number of connections between farms and without seasonality. However, seasonality and production phase should be included in simulation models concerning FW-FW and FW-SW movements specifically. The number of rainbow trout FW-FW and brown/sea trout FW- FW movements were different from random. However, movements from other production phases were too low to discern a seasonal pattern or differences in contact pattern...|$|E
40|$|Vascular {{networks}} {{within a}} living organism are complex, multi-dimensional, and challenging to image capture.
