5|$|After the killings, Muslim Chetnik leader Ismet Popovac {{arrived in}} the town to console the local {{population}} and to advise the Chetniks there against committing further atrocities.

5|$|In April 1943, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, {{was invited}} by Berger {{to assist in}} organising and {{recruiting}} Muslims into the Waffen-SS and other units.

5|$|On paper, the edict ordered {{expulsion}} {{rather than}} a forced conversion, but it forbade nearly all possible destinations; in reality, the Castilian authorities preferred <b>Muslims</b> <b>to</b> convert than emigrate. Castile's western neighbor Portugal had already banned Muslims since 1497. The order explicitly forbade going to other neighboring regions, such as the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, the Principality of Catalonia, and the Kingdom of Navarre. Of possible overseas destination, North Africa and territories of the Ottoman Empire were also ruled out. The edict allowed travel to Egypt, then ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate, but there were few ships sailing between Castile and Egypt in those days. It designated Biscay in the Basque country as the only port where the Muslims could depart, which meant that those from the south (such as Andalusia) would have to travel {{the entire length of}} the peninsula. The edict also set the end of April 1502 as the deadline, after which Islam would become outlawed and those harboring Muslims would be punished severely. A further edict issued on 17 September 1502 forbade the newly converted <b>Muslims</b> <b>to</b> leave Castile within the next two years.|$|E
5|$|As the Muslim {{forces were}} {{geographically}} divided, Heraclius sought to exploit this situation {{and planned to}} attack. He {{did not wish to}} engage in a single pitched battle but rather to employ central position and fight the enemy in detail by concentrating large forces against each of the Muslim corps before they could consolidate their troops. By forcing the <b>Muslims</b> <b>to</b> retreat, or by destroying Muslim forces separately, he would fulfill his strategy of recapturing lost territory. Reinforcements were sent to Caesarea under Heraclius' son Constantine III probably to tie down Yazid's forces which were besieging the town. The Byzantine imperial army moved out from Antioch and Northern Syria sometime in the middle of June 636.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Heraclius died, much of Egypt had been lost, and by 637638 {{the whole of}} Syria was {{in the hands of}} the armies of Islam. With 3,5004,000 troops under his command, 'Amr ibn al-A'as first crossed into Egypt from Palestine at the end of 639 or the {{beginning}} of 640. He was progressively joined by further reinforcements, notably 12,000 soldiers by Al-Zubayr. 'Amr first besieged and conquered Babylon, and then attacked Alexandria. The Byzantines, divided and shocked by the sudden loss of so much territory, agreed to give up the city by September 642. The fall of Alexandria extinguished Byzantine rule in Egypt, and allowed the <b>Muslims</b> <b>to</b> continue their military expansion into North Africa; between 643644 'Amr completed the conquest of Cyrenaica. Uthman succeeded Caliph Umar after his death.|$|E
5|$|In 837, a Muslim army under Abd al-Salam ibn Abd al-Wahhab {{attacked}} Enna, but {{was defeated}} by the Byzantines, and Abd al-Salam himself was taken prisoner. The Muslims responded by reinforcing their position around Enna, which they placed under siege. During the following winter, one of the besiegers discovered an unguarded path leading to the town, allowing the <b>Muslims</b> <b>to</b> take the entire lower town. The Byzantines however managed to maintain control of the citadel, and after negotiations secured a Muslim withdrawal {{in exchange for a}} large ransom.|$|E
5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} <b>Muslims</b> <b>to</b> follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at the way of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E

He {{was impressed by the}} philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita and encouraged people to follow it in their own lives. He advised his devotees and followers to lead a moral life, help others, love every living being without any discrimination, and develop two important features of character: devotion to the Guru (Sraddha) and waiting cheerfully with patience and love (Saburi). He criticised atheism.|$|E
5|$|The Oran fatwa was a responsum fatwa, or an Islamic legal opinion, {{issued in}} 1504 {{to address the}} crisis that {{occurred}} when Muslims in the Crown of Castile (now part of Spain) were forced to convert to Christianity in 15001502. The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the <b>Muslims</b> <b>to</b> conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Enna {{reduced the}} Byzantines {{to the eastern}} coastal strip between Syracuse and Taormina, and forced the emperor to send a large army and a fleet of {{reportedly}} 300 ships, under Constantine Kontomytes, which arrived at Syracuse in autumn 859. Soon after, the Byzantine navy was defeated a major battle with the Muslims, in which the Byzantines lost {{a third of their}} fleet. Nevertheless, the arrival of a large Byzantine army induced several settlements, which had previously submitted to the <b>Muslims,</b> <b>to</b> rise in revolt. Abbas soon suppressed these uprisings, and marched against Kontomytes. The two armies met near Cefalù, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were heavily defeated and retired to Syracuse, while Abbas strengthened his position by refortifying and colonizing Enna.|$|E
