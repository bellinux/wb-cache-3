The model was derived from a subset of diverse chemical structures found in the Draize eye irritation ECETOC data set. Methods: <b>Molecular</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>simulation</b> (<b>MDS)</b> was used to generate intermolecular membrane-solute interaction properties. These intermolecular properties were combined with intramolecular physicochemical properties and features of the solute (irritant) to construct QSAR models using multi-dimensional linear regression and the Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) algorithm.

We look at the change in bilayer permeability {{as a function of}} lipid structure and area per lipid molecule. A <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>simulation</b> (<b>MDS)</b> of a solvent surfactant system was used in the canonical ensemble to simulate the membranes. Permeability was obtained by calculating the permeative resistance. This method, developed by Marrink and Berendsen, allows the sampling of very long time scale events on short time scale simulations. The structural properties of the simulated bilayer are studied and compared both to atomistic MDS and experiments. The elasticity of the simulated membranes are shown to be in good agreement with experimental results. The permeation is found to increase only slightly for a relative stretch of up to 20 %, a result which is qualitatively similar to recent experiments. The increase is described by a linear relation between the permeability and the relative extension. Most of the changes in the lipid bilayer are found to occur in the central part near the ends of the tails. The effect of lipid packing on bilayer permeability are also discussed...|$|E

Many Single nucletotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in different genes {{have been associated with}} various types of congenital heart defects. NKX 2 - 5 gene is one among them, which encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor that plays a crucial role during the initial phases of heart formation and development. Mutations in this gene could cause different types of congenital heart defects, including Atrial septal defect (ASD), Atrial ventricular block (AVB), Tetralogy of fallot and ventricular septal defect. This highlights the importance of studying the impact of different SNPs found within this gene that might cause structural and functional modification of its encoded protein.

40|$|The non-ribosomal {{functions}} of mammalian ribosomal proteins have recently attracted worldwide attention. The mouse ribosomal protein S 5 (rpS 5) derived from ribosomal material is an assembled non phosphorylated protein. The free form of rpS 5 protein, however, undergoes phosphorylation. In this study, we have (a) investigated the potential role of phosphorylation in rpS 5 protein transport into the nucleus {{and then into}} nucleoli and (b) determined {{which one of the}} domains of rpS 5 are involved in this intracellular trafficking. In vitro PCR-mutagenesis of mouse rpS 5 cDNA complemented by subsequent cloning-expression of rpS 5 truncated recombinant forms produced in fusion with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) permitted the investigation of rpS 5 intracellular trafficking in HeLa cells using confocal microscopy complemented by Western blot analysis. Our results indicate the following: (a) rpS 5 protein enters the nucleus via the region 38 - 50 aa that forms a random coil as revealed by <b>Molecular</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Simulation</b> (<b>MDS),</b> (b) Immunoprecipitation of rpS 5 with casein kinase II (CKII) and Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) analysis complemented by in vitro kinase assay revealed that phosphorylation of rpS 5 seems to be indispensable for its transport from nucleus to nucleoli; upon entering the nucleus, Thr- 133 phosphorylation triggers Ser- 24 phosphorylation by CKII, thus promoting entrance of rpS 5 into the nucleoli. Another important role of rpS 5 N-terminal region is proposed to be the regulation of protein’s cellular level. Namely the repetitively co-appearance of a satellite C-terminal band below the entire rpS 5 at the late stationary phase and not at the early logarithmic phase of cell growth suggests a specific degradation balancing probably the unassembled ribosomal protein molecules with that which are efficiently assembled to ribosomal subunits. Overall, these data provide new insights on the structural and functional domains within the rpS 5 molecule that contribute to its cellular functions. The possible role of rpS 5 in cell differentiation was investigated with the siRNA technology or by using MEL cell stable transfected with the recombinant eukaryotic vector pcDNA- 3. 1 -rpS 5 (MEL-C 14 and MEL-C 56 are the isolated clones).

Synergistic use of low-angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) and atomistic <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>simulations</b> (<b>MD)</b> indicate Tat peptide binding to neutral dioleoylphosphocholine (DOPC) lipid headgroups. This binding induced the local lipid phosphate groups to move 3 Å closer {{to the center of}} the bilayer.

LAXS data for DOPC, DOPC/dioleoylphosphoethanolamine (DOPE), DOPC/dioleoylphosphoserine (DOPS), and a mimic of the nuclear membrane gave similar results. Generally, the Tat peptide decreased the bilayer bending modulus KC and increased the area/lipid. Further indications that Tat softens a membrane, thereby facilitating translocation, were provided by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and neutron scattering.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor (TF) STAT 3 {{is an attractive}} target for development of anticancer drugs. STAT 3 is over-expressed and activated in many human malignancies and has {{an important role in}} multiple oncogenic signaling pathways affecting proliferation, survival and metabolic adaptation of cancer cells. It has been difficult, however, to develop effective inhibitors of STAT 3. In this study, we performed an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of action of two compounds, OPB- 31121 and OPB- 51602, which are currently undergoing clinical testing. We combined computational docking (CD), <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>simulation</b> (<b>MDS)</b> and in vitro binding assays to study the compounds interaction with STAT 3. CD predicted that OPB- 31121 and OPB- 51602 could bind to a common pocket in the STAT 3 SH 2 domain, which was not shared with other STAT 3 inhibitors. MDS and in silico mutational analysis allowed refinement of the binding site predictions and an estimate of the relative binding affinities. Isotermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies confirmed that OPB- 31121 and OPB- 51602 bound with high affinity (Kd, 5 - 10 nM) to recombinant STAT 3 SH 2 domain. Binding of the two compounds was disrupted by mutations of aminoacid residues in the predicted binding pocket and was mutually exclusive in competition assays. In contrast, OPB- 31121 and OPB- 51602 did not compete for binding with other STAT 3 inhibitors, confirming that they occupied distinct pockets in the SH 2 domain. In cell culture assays, OPB- 31121 and OPB- 51602 interfered with both Tyr 705 and Ser 727 phosphorylation, which are required for full transcriptional activity of STAT 3. Proliferation of cancer cells was strongly affected in vitro by OPB- 51602 and OPB- 31121 in anchorage-dependent growth and soft-agar assays. In these assays OPB- 51602 and OPB- 31121 were active at low nanomolar concentrations (IC 50, 5 - 10 nM). Interestingly, the compounds were more effective in metabolic stress conditions (e. g., nutrient and glucose depletion), suggesting that STAT 3 inhibition interfered with relevant metabolic functions in cancer cells. In vivo treatment with OPB- 51602 (PO, 20 - 40 mg/kg, 3 - 5 days) reduced Tyr 705 and Ser 727 phosphorylation in tumor xenografts. Growth of DU 145 prostate tumor xenografts was almost completely arrested by daily treatment with OPB- 51602 (PO, 20 - 40 mg/kg, 2 weeks). Interestingly, tumor growth did not resume after discontinuation of the 2 -weeks treatment, indicating a persistent impairment of tumor-initiating capability. Altogether, this study demonstrates that STAT 3 is the relevant intracellular target of OPB- 51602 and OPB- 31121. The two compounds bound with high affinity to a distinct pocket in the SH 2 domain of STAT 3 and interfered with STAT 3 functions both in cells and tumor xenografts. These features resulted in distinctive biological activity and pharmacological properties of these novel compounds...|$|E

In this study the effect of temperature, indenter diameter, loading rate, composition on mechanical properties of alloys have been investigated. The simulated deformation studies were carried out by nano-indentation at room temperature as well as at elevated temperatures (300 K and 500 K). Also the effect of Cu on the deformation behavior was studied by varying copper content in the range of 15 - 25 at%. The simulation box size of dimension (100 Ǻ× 100 Ǻ× 100 Ǻ) and consisting of 62500 atoms were used for all the alloys. In this study NVT ensemble with periodic boundary conditions along the non-loading directions was used. It has been found that with increase in copper content the strength of the alloy increased. Further, with increase of loading rate from 1 Å/ps to 2 Å/ps the load increases as there is no sufficient time for atomic rearrangements. Also, with increase in indenter diameter from 15 Å to 20 Å hardness increases, this is due to more resistance offered by the atoms of the alloy to indentation.

Because of the relative large scale of lipid bilayer, quantum ab-initio methods are not common for such systems; consequently, both all atom and coarse grained <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>simulation</b> (<b>MD)</b> are widely performed.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{synthesize}} a non-isocyanate poly(dimethylsiloxane) hydroxyurethane with biomimetic terminal catechol moieties, {{as a candidate for}} inorganic and metallic surface modification. Such surface modifier is capable to strong lyattach onto metallic and inorganic substrates forming layers and, in addition, providing water-repellent surfaces. The non-isocyanate route is based on carbon dioxide cycloaddition into bis-epoxide, resulting in a precursor bis(cyclic carbonate) -polydimethylsiloxane(CCPDMS), thus fully replacing isocyanate in the manufacture process. A biomimetic approach was chosen with the molecular composition being inspired by terminal peptides present in adhesive proteins of mussels, like Mefp (Mytilus edulis foot protein), which bear catechol moieties and are strong adhesives even under natural and saline water. The catechol terminal groups were grafted by aminolysis reaction into a polydimethylsiloxane backbone. The product, PDMSUr-Dopamine, presented high affinity towards inhomogeneous alloy surfaces terminated by native oxide layers as demonstrated by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D), as well as stability against desorption by rinsing with ethanol. As revealed by QCM-D, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and computational studies, the thickness and composition of the resulting nanolayers indicated an attachment of PDMSUr-Dopamine molecules to the substrate through both terminal catechol groups, with the adsorbate exposing the hydrophobicPDMS backbone. This hypothesis was investigated by classical <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>simulation</b> (<b>MD)</b> of pure PDMSUr-Dopamine molecules on SiO 2 surfaces.

To define the level of wetting, we characterized contact angles of aluminum droplets on alumina substrates for all temperatures and sizes. We quantified the size and temperatures dependence of contact angle. Chemical reactions might be more effective for the small droplets 16 and 24 ? vs the bigger droplets 32, 40 ? due to the surface volume ratio of droplets...|$|R
40|$|Slip {{phenomenon}} usually {{occurs at}} the fluid–solid interface as a fluid flows in a nanometer device. The slip length that characterizes the slip behavior depends {{on a variety of}} factors. In this work, the influences of the fluid–wall interaction and system temperature on the slip length for dense fluid flows are studied using a kinetic model and the <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamic</b> (<b>MD)</b> <b>simulation.</b> It is found that the results predicted by the both approaches agree with each other qualitatively...|$|R

Two different sample geometries {{of the same}} crystallographic orientation were tested with negative and positive values of the T-stress, which change the ductile-brittle behavior along the crack front in 3 D. This phenomenon is explained {{in the framework of}} stress analysis, both on the continuum and atomistic level...|$|R

It reported the use of all-component MD studies to simulate and evaluate MIP mini-emulsion prepolymerization mixtures, including the mixtures used in the synthesis of a series of MIP-nanoparticles (MIP-NPs). The insights gained were correlated to the colloidal stability and NP physical characteristics and to the template rebinding capacity...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{previous}} studies of drug development to resolve the amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's Disease, supporting <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamic</b> (<b>MD)</b> <b>simulation</b> was designed to investigate the mechanism of drug candidate molecule, Erythrosine B. AutoDock Vina was performed to reduce the duration of <b>MD</b> <b>simulation</b> as it determines favored binding sites.
