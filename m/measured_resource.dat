40|$|Abstract. The {{services}} offered by Internet Data Centers involve {{the provision of}} storage, bandwidth and computational resources. A common business model is to charge consumers on a pay-per-use basis where they periodically pay for the resources they have consumed (as opposed to a fixed charge for service provision). The pay-per-use model {{raises the question of}} how to <b>measure</b> <b>resource</b> consumption. Currently, a widely used accounting mechanism is provider-side accounting where the provider unilaterally <b>measures</b> the consumer’s <b>resource</b> consumption and presents the latter with a bill. A serious limitation of this approach is that it does not offer the consumer sufficient means of performing reasonableness checks to verify that the provider is not accidentally or maliciously overcharging. To address the problem the paper develops bilateral accounting models where both consumer and provider independently <b>measure</b> <b>resource</b> consumption, verify the equity of the accounting process and try to resolve potential conflicts emerging from the independently produced results.

40|$|Abstract — Many network {{services}} such as voice, video, and collaborative applications require an informed view of network characteristics for effective operation. Sharing a network measurement service across multiple applications can significantly reduce measurement overhead, and remove the burden of performing network measurements from individual applications. To be effectively shared, a network measurement service must provide a variety of measurements to applications on-demand, including end-to-end available bandwidth, delay, and loss. We propose such a service, {{with a focus on}} quantifying and bounding the impact of active measurements on the network resources being <b>measured.</b> <b>Resource</b> bounds are necessary for wide-scale deployment, since not all users of the service can be trusted. The service informs applications of how service bounds affect their measurements. We introduce methods to characterize the behavior of active measurements for use in admission control and scheduling decisions.

40|$|In {{resource}} provisioning for datacenters, {{an important}} issue is how resources may be allocated to an application such that the service level agreements (SLAs) are met. Resource provisioning is usually guided by intuitive or heuristic expectation of performance and existing user model. Provisioning based on such methodology, however, usually leads to more resources than are actually necessary. While such overprovisioning may guarantee performance, this guarantee may come {{at a very high}} cost. A quantitative performance estimate may guide the provider in making informed decisions about the right level of resources, so that acceptable service performance may be provided in a cost-effective manner. A quantitative estimate of application performance must consider its workload characteristics.

40|$|Background and aims: Enhanced crop {{productivity}} by intercropping is commonly {{assumed to be}} driven by resource complementarity. However, relatively few studies have directly <b>measured</b> <b>resource</b> acquisition to assess potential mechanisms underlying enhanced performance of intercropping. Methods: A long-term field experiment with three P application rates (0, 40, 80 kg P ha− 1 yr. − 1) and four maize-based intercropping systems was used to assess P acquisition and P fertilizer recovery efficiency (PRE) for three consecutive years. To identify underlying mechanisms, the additive partitioning method was applied to determine complementarity (CE) and selection effects (SE) in P acquisition of intercropping. Results: Average P acquisition increased by 28. 4 % and 27. 6 % compared to their monocultures in faba bean/maize and chickpea/maize intercropping, respectively. However, P acquisition was generally not enhanced and even reduced in the last year in soybean/maize and oilseed rape/maize intercropping. Enhanced P acquisition was due to positive CE in faba bean/maize, and to positive CE and SE in chickpea/maize intercropping. Conclusions: Increased resource acquisition via CE and/or SE depended on the particular crop combination in intercropping systems. Application of the additive partitioning method to intercropping may help to identify underlying mechanisms of overyielding and carefully select crop combinations to enable more efficient resource use...|$|E

Our sites of mixed deciduous coniferous forest in north-central BC, Canada, support a rich diversity of eight species of primary cavity nesters (PCNs) (woodpeckers), four species of weak cavity nesters (nuthatch, chickadees) and 20 secondary cavity-nesting species (ducks, passerines and birds of prey). Richness varied across forest-types with some plots being ‘hotspots ’ and others being depauperate. Across {{a range of}} forest-types, we measured species richness and abundance of birds and squirrels using point count census techniques, playbacks of taped calls of woodpeckers and owls, and by searching for active nests. We also <b>measured</b> <b>resource</b> use (trees able to support cavities, or existing cavities) in relation to availability (tree species, abundance and habitat characteristics such as edge-type and degree of fragmentation).

None of the three cavity-nesting groups {{was positively correlated with}} open-nesting (non-cavity) forest birds, rejecting our null hypothesis of common habitat quality. In contrast, the abundance of secondary cavity-nesting species was significantly negatively correlated with non-cavity species, possibly because these species compete for resources other than nest sites, such as invertebrate prey. Using these data, we construct a nest web for the cavity-nesting community in north...|$|E

The sewage of Melbourne, Australia, was stockpiled in large, closed, lagoonal tanks from 1898 until 1980. Reeves, Plimer and Foster, 1999, have conducted, and published, an extensive and exhaustive study of the Werribee sewage reserves utilising RNAA, INAA, GFAAS, ICPMS, and FLAAS to determine 31 elements, including Au, Ag, Sb, As, Cd, Hg, Zn, Cu, and Pb. The study was initiated to determine Au, Ag and other metal variations in both space and time and to investigate the economics of chemical extraction of the precious metals. A total of 149 samples from over 50 hand-auger drillholes to a depth up to 4 m were analysed from the stockpiles, with Au assays yielding remarkably consistent results.

40|$|Invasions by alien plants {{provide a}} unique {{opportunity}} to examine competitive interactions among plants. While resource competition has long been regarded as a major mechanism responsible for successful invasions, given a well-known capacity for many invaders to become dominant and reduce plant diversity in the invaded communities, few studies have <b>measured</b> <b>resource</b> competition directly or have assessed its importance relatively to that of other mechanisms, at different stages of an invasion process. Here, we review evidence comparing the competitive ability of invasive species vs. that of co-occurring native plants, along a range of environmental gradients, showing that many invasive species have a superior competitive ability over native species, while invasive congeners are not necessarily competitively superior over native congeners, nor alien dominants are better competitors than native dominants. We discuss how the outcomes of competition depend on a number of factors, such as the heterogeneous distribution of resources, the stage of the invasion process, as well as phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation, which may result in increased or decreased competitive ability in both invasive and native species. Competitive advantages of invasive species over natives are often transient and only important at the early stages of an invasion process. It remains unclear how important resource competition is relative to other mechanisms (competition avoidance via phenological differences, niche differentiation in space associated with phylogenetic distance, recruitment and dispersal limitation, indirect competition, and allelopathy). We then identify the conceptual and methodological issues characterizing competition studies in plant invasions, and we discuss future research needs, including examinations of resource competition dynamics and of the impact of global environmental changes on competitive interactions between invasive and native species...|$|E

Evolutionary Ecology Research, 17 (1), 53 - 73. Retrieved from ://WOS: 000384803400004 Background: Species are often grouped into distinct trophic guilds based on their average diets. But the diets of populations may be highly variable through space and time. Even populations that are described as foraging {{on a wide variety}} of dietary resources are often comprised of individuals with very narrow dietary preferences, and such individual specialization may vary among populations as a function of local conditions. River gradients provide subtle variation in environmental conditions, so that stream fishes that occur along such gradients may be studied to reveal how environmental conditions shape trophic {{resource use}} and individual specialization. Questions: How does trophic resource use vary among species and populations? Does it correlate with local resource availability? What variability exists in individual dietary widths among populations and species? May we attribute variation in individual dietary widths among sites to any environmental variation?
