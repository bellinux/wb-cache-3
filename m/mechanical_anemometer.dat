50|$|The {{anemometer}} {{has changed}} little since its {{development in the}} 15th century. Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472) {{is said to have}} invented the first <b>mechanical</b> <b>anemometer</b> around 1450. In following centuries, numerous others, including Robert Hooke(1635-1703), developed their own versions, with some being mistakenly credited as the inventor. In 1846, John Thomas Romney Robinson (1792-1882) improved upon the design by using four hemispherical cups and mechanical wheels. In 1926, Canadian meteorologist John Patterson (January 3, 1872 - February 22, 1956) developed a three-cup anemometer, which was improved by Brevoort and Joiner in 1935. In 1991, Derek Weston added the ability to measure wind direction. In 1994, Andrews Pflitsch developed the sonic anemometer.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{anemometer}} (UA) is a {{core application}} in natural environment measurement. As well known, <b>mechanical</b> <b>anemometer</b> works well in good weather {{but it is}} not suitable to be applied in bad environment such as polar region and upper air. On the other hand, ultrasonic anemometer works well in most situations. Moreover, ultrasonic anemometer has wider detectable wind speed range. It can be said that ultrasonic anemometer is a more advanced instrument to measure wind velocity. In this paper, the theory of ultrasonic anemometer is first discussed. Using the theory, a test bed is then designed and constructed to measure one-dimensional wind speed. Active Butterworth filter is introduced into the circuit in order to increase the stability and accuracy. Furthermore, we test the one-dimensional ultrasonic anemometer and compare the measured wind speed with theoretical wind speed measured by a thermal anemometer device. Error is also discussed and improvement has also made during the experiment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} Gaussian radial basis {{function}} network (GRBFN) based wind speed estimation algorithm for {{maximum power point}} tracking (MPPT) of wind power generation system (WPGS). A specific design of the proposed control algorithm for the WPGS with a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is presented. The aerodynamic characteristics of the turbine are approximated by a GRBFN based nonlinear input-output mapping. Based on this nonlinear mapping, the wind speed is estimated from the measured generator electrical output power while taking into account the power losses in system and the dynamic process of shaft system. The estimated wind speed is then used to determine the optimum DFIG rotor speed for maximum wind power extraction. Then the DFIG rotor speed is controlled with the wind speed change, the maximum power extraction can be achieved. Simulation model of 1 MW WPGS is built in MATLB/SIMULINK software. The validity and feasibility of the proposed control algorithm is verified by simulation experiment. The simulation results show that the wind speed can be estimated accurately and WPGS can operate in the optimum operating point without <b>mechanical</b> <b>anemometer...</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the other}} forms of <b>mechanical</b> {{velocity}} <b>anemometer</b> is the vane anemometer. It may {{be described as a}} windmill or a propeller anemometer. Unlike the Robinson anemometer, whose axis of rotation is vertical, the vane anemometer must have its axis parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes, a wind vane or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed.|$|R

Individual types of anemometers are compared in this thesis, including <b>mechanical,</b> thermo <b>anemometer</b> and ultrasound anemometer. Different construction renderings and measurement principles of ultrasonic anemometers are analyzed. In addition, an experi- mental method of measuring {{the speed of sound}} by phase shift between two transmitting frequency is described in the document.

40|$|Time {{dependent}} {{dust accumulation}} on the Telltale fibers was observed during the Phoenix mission. Laboratory experiments {{were performed to}} determine the critical wind speeds needed to remove the accumulated dust. 1. Observations The NASA Mars Mission Phoenix lasted 152 sols corresponding to Ls = 76 ° to 148 ° [1]. During this time wind speeds and directions were measured with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>anemometer,</b> the Telltale (Fig. 1), by analyzing {{the position of the}} Kapton cylinder in pictures taken with the Surface Stereo Imager (SSI). Figure 1 : Color composite image of the Telltale taken on Ls ~ 119 o [2] The Kevlar fibers were originally monitored for dust accumulation to assess the possible error to the wind measurements. Laboratory tests have shown that this effect introduces a negligible error, however the time dependency of the dust accumulation displays interesting features. Figure 2 : Images of the Telltale taken around 15 : 35 LMST at the solar longitudes indicated [2]. The dust accumulation {{can be seen in the}} Telltale images (Fig. 2). Since neither the fibers nor the dust thereupon are optically thick, a dust factor was calculated assuming exponential absorption through the dust loaded fibers (Fig. 3). At Ls ~ 78 o the dust accumulation is minor as seen from the contrast between the fibers and the background. This contrast increases steadily until Ls ~ 114 o...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} a {{comparison}} of peak wind speeds reported by <b>mechanical</b> and ultrasonic <b>anemometers</b> at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center (CCAFS/KSC) on the east central coast of Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) on the central coast of California. The legacy mechanical wind instruments on CCAFS/KSC and VAFB weather towers are being changed from propeller-and-vane (CCAFS/KSC) and cup-and-vane (VAFB) sensors to ultrasonic sensors under the Range Standardization and Automation (RSA) program. The wind tower networks on KSC/CCAFS and VAFB have 41 and 27 towers, respectively. Launch Weather Officers, forecasters, and Range Safety analysts at both locations {{need to understand the}} performance of the new wind sensors for a myriad of reasons that include weather warnings, watches, advisories, special ground processing operations, launch pad exposure forecasts, user Launch Commit Criteria (LCC) forecasts and evaluations, and toxic dispersion support. The Legacy sensors measure wind speed and direction mechanically. The ultrasonic RSA sensors have no moving parts. Ultrasonic sensors were originally developed to measure very light winds (Lewis and Dover 2004). The technology has evolved and now ultrasonic sensors provide reliable wind data over a broad range of wind speeds. However, because ultrasonic sensors respond more quickly than mechanical sensors to rapid fluctuations in speed, characteristic of gusty wind conditions, comparisons of data from the two sensor types have shown differences in the statistics of peak wind speeds (Lewis and Dover 2004). The 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) and the 30 WS requested the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) to compare data from RSA and Legacy sensors to determine if there are significant differences in peak wind speed information from the two systems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the performance of}} <b>mechanical</b> and ultrasonic <b>anemometers</b> at the Eastern Range (ER; Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Florida's Atlantic coast) and the Western Range (WR; Vandenberg Air Force Base on California's Pacific coast). Launch Weather Officers, forecasters, and Range Safety analysts {{need to understand the}} performance of wind sensors at the ER and WR for weather warnings, watches, advisories, special ground processing operations, launch pad exposure forecasts, user Launch Commit Criteria (LCC) forecasts and evaluations, and toxic dispersion support. The current ER and WR weather tower wind instruments are being changed from the current propeller-and-vane (ER) and cup-and-vane (WR) sensors to ultrasonic sensors through the Range Standardization and Automation (RSA) program. The differences between mechanical and ultrasonic techniques have been found to cause differences in the statistics of peak wind speed in previous studies. The 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) and the 30 th Weather Squadron (30 WS) requested the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) to compare data between RSA and current sensors to determine if there are significant differences. Approximately 3 weeks of Legacy and RSA wind data from each range were used in the study, archived during May and June 2005. The ER data spanned the full diurnal cycle, while the WR data was confined to 1000 - 1600 local time. The sample of 1 -minute data from numerous levels on 5 different towers on each range totaled more than 500, 000 minutes of data (482, 979 minutes of data after quality control). The 10 towers were instrumented at several levels, ranging from 12 ft to 492 ft above ground level. The RSA sensors were collocated at the same vertical levels as the present sensors and typically within 15 ft horizontally of each another. Data from a total of 53 RSA ultrasonic sensors, collocated with present sensors were compared. The 1 -minute average wind speed/direction and the 1 -second peak wind speed/direction were compared...|$|R
