40|$|The leaked Trans-Pacific Partnership Investment Chapter {{has been}} {{analyzed}} extensively {{with respect to}} its dangerous intellectual property protections and enhanced enforcement mechanisms and its equally dangerous extra-judicial investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions. In contrast, this analysis focuses on the particular risks of the Investment Chapter with respect to access to medicines because of the direct and indirect inclusion of IPRs in the Chapter 2 ̆ 7 s coverage. These risks are cumulative because of other provisions in the proposed US IP chapter that would strengthen, broaden, and lengthen intellectual property rights with respect to pharmaceutical patent, data, and pricing provisions and that would expand both private IP enforcement mechanisms via <b>mandatory</b> <b>injunctions</b> and expanded damages and impose new enforcement obligations on governments in terms of border measures and criminal enforcement.

There are four main dangers in the Investment Chapter that threaten access to medicines. First, the minimum standard of treatment, including fair and equitable treatment, and indirect expropriation conceptscontain significant ambiguities that could greatly restrict countries 2 ̆ 7 ability to enact, use, and defend flexibilities that enhance access to medicines. Second, it is dangerous to include IP rights {{at all in the}} investment chapter, given the extensive private enforcement rights that rightholders already have, including administrative remedies at borders andjudicial remedies for infringing conduct, and given drug companies 2 ̆ 7 proclivities to bring suits against governments. Third, the bracketed limited exception to IP-related investment rights for compulsory licenses does not provide the securityagainst investor claims that TPP Parties might need to safeguard TRIPS-compliant measures that promote access to affordable medicines for all as promised by the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. Finally, the Investment Chapter prevents certain performance requirements that in the IP context might give developing countries the leeway to develop domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in order to ensure a self-sufficient and uninterrupted supply of medicines and to legitimately promote their own industrial development...|$|R

50|$|There can be {{cases where}} {{the nature of the}} {{contract}} do not allow damages to likely serve any purpose nor admit to specific performance. In such cases, the court may have to restrain the party who threatens the breach, to the possible extent.

In case the singer threatens breach, the court cannot force him to sing. The positive side of the bargain is not specifically enforceable. But the negative undertaking i.e. not to sing elsewhere, can be enforced by restraining him from singing elsewhere. When he is prevented from resorting to other openings, it may exert some pressure upon his mind and he may be persuaded {{to go ahead with the}} performance of his contract. This type of remedy is known as preventive relief. This is granted by issuing an order known as injunction.

40|$|Copyright {{protection}} {{is rooted in}} the Intellectual Property Clause of the United States Constitution, which sets boundaries for the subject matter that can be protected by federal copyright law. The Ninth Circuit’s 2014 decision in Garcia v. Google, Inc., marked the first time a court ruled that an individual actor with a minor role in a film has a copyright interest in her own performance. In Garcia v. Google, Inc., the Ninth Circuit originally held that the actor likely had a copyright interest in the film because she was “duped into providing an artistic performance that was used in a way she never could have foreseen. ” The court reasoned that Garcia established she was likely to succeed on her copyright claim due to the serious threats against her life, and the balance of the equities and public interest that were in her favor. The Ninth Circuit applied the standard for a <b>mandatory</b> preliminary <b>injunction</b> and found that Garcia, as an actor, had a copyright interest in the film because she evinced a minimal degree of creativity in her performance. The court should have only ruled that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant Garcia’s copyright interest, if the facts and law clearly favored issuing a preliminary injunction. The court assumed Garcia was an author and created its own law to provide her — as an actor — a copyright interest in a film. Nothing about Garcia’s performance or what she demonstrated provide that the facts and the law “clearly favor her claim of a copyrightable interest” in her acting performance. The court demanded YouTube remove the film, a request that was subjected to the incorrect degree of scrutiny. The court should have applied a higher degree of scrutiny and reversed the district court’s decision only if the decision was illogical or implausible. Garcia did not clearly satisfy the requirements to claim copyright infringement, thus the district court’s decision was not illogical or implausible, and the district court did not abuse its discretion. Part I of this Note presents a background of the factual history of the case and the relevant history of copyright law. Part II focuses on the procedural history of Garcia v. Google, Inc., focusing on the Ninth Circuit’s misapplication of copyright law and the en banc court’s restoration of copyright law’s intention. Part III presents possible remedies that Garcia may have had outside of an action asserted under copyright law. The Note concludes by emphasizing that the expansion of technology could have substantial implications for copyright interests, and that such expansion may force the United States to adopt more specific laws going forward...|$|R

40|$|Although the Court of Appeal has {{previously}} provided judicial guidance on the grant of interim mandatory injunctions, {{it is remarkable}} that local authority on grants of final mandatory injunctions is almost non-existent. In relation to breaches of contractual obligations, this may be a matter of little note since the assistance of equity will be neither necessary nor sought given the adequacy of contractual damages as a remedy for most instances of breach. Nevertheless, in a series of unreported decisions, the High Court and the Court of Appeal may have made some rather surprising inroads into this small patch of wilderness in Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s legal landscape.

40|$|A {{landowner}} {{builds a}} house that encroaches two feet on his neighbor 2 ̆ 7 s property. The encroachment involves very little land, but it creates many issues for the respective landowners. In today 2 ̆ 7 s society, where subdivisions are developed daily, there is an increasing potential for encroachments due to innocent mistakes, negligence, or willfulness. When an encroachment occurs, it would be terrific if the parties could negotiate a fair solution, but this rarely happens. This is because the law automatically places an encroaching landowner in an inferior bargaining position. In North Carolina, courts will order the encroaching landowner to remove the encroachment regardless of his intent. Therefore, the encroaching landowner must meet the neighbor 2 ̆ 7 s demands for waiving a <b>mandatory</b> <b>injunction</b> to compel removal or prepare to move the encroaching portion of the structure. This Article addresses the public policy and equitable issues sparked by the encroachment of a permanent structure on an adjoining landowner 2 ̆ 7 s property. It focuses on the equitable hardship doctrine, which is commonly invoked by many jurisdictions in encroachment cases and applied when the circumstances of a given case justify superseding the landowner 2 ̆ 7 s ordinary remedy to an injunction-a doctrine which North Carolina has paid lip service to but does not apply. The analysis in this Article leads {{to the conclusion that}} in determining whether to grant an injunction, a court must balance the equities by assessing the relative hardship of each party. Application of the equitable hardship doctrine in encroachment cases will prevent economic waste, the potential for extortion, and unnecessary litigation, and create a just result for both parties...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{last six}} to seven decades have been marked by {{inconsistent}} attitudes {{on the part of}} the Federal Government in the field of labor. Beginning with the application of the Sherman Anti-trust Act against organized labor, federal attitude has vacillated. Concerted secondary activities on the part of unions which interfered with interstate commerce were held to be illegal under the Sherman Act. The Clayton Act was passed to exempt labor unions from the Anti-trust laws, but the Courts ruled, much to the chagrin of Samuel Gompers, that those who take part, in a labor dispute must be directly concerned. Thus one local could not appeal to another located elsewhere to aid them in a dispute. There was no additional federal labor legislation until the Norris - LaGuardia Act in 1932. By this time, Congress had gone through a complete change in attitude toward labor, no doubt accentuated by the Depression. As a result, the Norris - LaGuardia Act was passed, outlawing the use of the labor injunction except in special instances. This act as rapidly followed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The import of the two acts was that "concerted activities" on the part of unions were permissible. Included in the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) was a list of employer unfair labor practices. For the first time, employers could be held liable for certain acts in labor disputes. The pendulum of power had swung toward labor. Within a short time, voices were being raised in opposition to the Wagner Act. It was claimed that the Act was not equitable for it listed employer unfair labor practices while not listing employee unfair labor practices. It was also claimed that labor unions had economic power which was so great that it was destructive. After World War II, anti - union feeling was high because of the wave of post war strikes. Therefore, the new 80 th Congress, passed in 1947, the omnibus Labor Management Relations Act commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act. The Taft-Hartley Act was supposed to have amended the inequities of the Wagner Act. Included in the provisions of the Act is a list of employee unfair labor practices as well as a provision outlawing the secondary boycott. There is also a provision providing for the issuance of an injunction in case of "prima facie" violation of the boycott section. Congress, in passing the secondary boycott provision, wished to protect "neutrals" in industrial disputes, but in doing so weakened labor's power. In the simple type of secondary boycott case, in which there was no question as to the existence of the boycott, both the National Labor Relations Board and the Courts applied the proscription of Section 8 (b) (4) A, thus protect ing the secondary employer, the so-called "neutral. " But the National Labor Relations Board and the Courts recognized that a union's lawful primary rights must be preserved. These rights, in connection with Section 8 (b) (4) A, are the rights to strike and picket the primary employer for legitimate ends as defined by Taft-Hartley. It was ruled in such cases as Pure Oil and others that primary action with secondary effects is permissible. By secondary effects, the National Labor Relations Board referred to cases in which a union would be conducting a lawful strike against a primary employer, but would affect secondary employers just as if they were being struck against. Recently, the Supreme Court of the United States exempted from the proscriptions of Section 8 (b) (4) A "hot cargo" clauses. The decision allows labor unions to have clauses written into their collective bargaining agreements to the effect that the employees of the employer could refuse to work on another employer's struck goods. Therefore, any union which has such an agreement can refuse to handle the primary employer's struck goods. The implication is that general ubiquity of such clauses will completely negate Section 8 (b) (4) A. But it is evident that protection of the "neutral" in industrial disputes has weakened labor. To what extent is not certain, for "hot cargo" clauses might very well provide a loophole for labor. The labor injunction, the use of which was effectively curtailed by the Norris-La Guardia Act, was reinstated by Section 10 (1) of the Taft-Hartley Act. The General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board can petition a Federal District Court for an injunction for suspected violation of Section 8 (b) (4). If there is "prima facie" evidence to the effect that a secondary boycott exists, the court will issue an injunction to remain in effect until the National Labor Relations Board rules on the case. The success of a union varies inversely with the length of the injunction. This statement holds true for several reasons. First, injunctions are in effect on the average seven months. There have been some that have been in effect less than two months and some that have been in effect for more than two years. In many cases, unions have given up before the Board decision. The building unions, more than others, are most affected by injunctions of extended duration and it is in the building industry that one finds the most withdrawals. Threat of a lengthy injunction seems to be the best reason for the great incidence of withdrawals in the building industry. Secondly, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>injunction</b> restores the "status quo" which is the situation that existed before the labor dispute began. But the injunction, by restoring the original situation, prevents the union from taking any action whatsoever. If the dispute was over some immediate problem, then the union is defeated no matter what the later decision of the Board might be. If the dispute occurs in the construction industry, a lengthy injunction might allow the project to be finished without the dispute having been decided upon by the Board. Thus, in such cases, the belated decisions of the Board are of no concern to the union involved. We see then, that restoration of the ''status quo" works against the union. Thirdly, the General Counsel is affiliated with the National Labor Relations Board. When an employer petitions the General Counsel to go before a Federal District Court, he is attempting to enlist the aid of a person that has "the massive prestige of the United States Government behind him. " Also, conclusive proof is not needed for issuance of an injunction. Therefore, the injunction procedure has been severely criticized by labor and pro-labor sympathizers. In summation, it can be said that Sections 8 (b) (4) A and 10 (1) of the Taft - Hartley Act have been instrumental in reversing the trend of increased labor power. Modifications of both sections have been suggestions by President Truman and President Eisenhower. If past events are any key to the future, then there will be a reveraal of governmental attitude once more...|$|E
