With a fast growing pervasive computing, especially cloud computing, the behaviour measurement {{is at the core}} and plays a vital role. A new behaviour measurement tailored for <b>Multitenants</b> in cloud computing is needed urgently to fundamentally establish trust relationship. Based on our previous research, we propose an improved trust relationship scheme which captures the world of cloud computing where <b>multitenants</b> share the same physical computing platform. Here, we first present the related work onmulti-tenant behaviour; secondly, we give the scheme of behaviour measurement where decoupling of <b>multitenants</b> is taken into account; thirdly, we explicitly explain our decoupling algorithm for multitenants; fourthly, we introduce a new way of similarity calculation for deviation control, which fits the coupled <b>multitenants</b> under study well; lastly, we design the experiments to test our scheme. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As a key service {{model in}} cloud computing, SaaS {{applications}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular. Multi-tenancy is a key characteristics of SaaS applications. Business processes {{play a key role}} in SaaS applications because of the composability and reusability of software services. This paper focuses on multi-tenants instance-intensive workflows system, in which workflows have a large number of instances belonging to multiple tenants in a SaaS environment, and further proposes a scheduling algorithm for <b>multitenants</b> workflow instances. This algorithm improves the quality of service (QoS) for tenants and saves the execution cost of workflows. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm guarantees the workflow execution conforming to the deadline set by tenants, and reduces the mean execution time for tenants in high priority whilst saves the execution cost for service providers...|$|R
40|$|Benchmarking of {{corporate}} real estate performance {{is an essential}} tool in the efficient management of assets to support the core business. Many of the performance indicators used to measure property {{are based on the}} area of the property occupied. The disparity that exists in the methods of measuring office properties hampers the comparison of properties on a global scale. This paper explores the extent of measurement differences that exist between Australia, Europe and the UK. The paper demonstrates that differences in the methodologies applied to the measurement of office accommodation can lead to discrepancies in the range of 3 % or 4 % for a typical <b>multitenanted</b> office floor. This research demonstrates the need for caution in comparing benchmarks based on area and further illustrates the need {{for the development of a}} global standard for measurement.

40|$|The methodologies {{to develop}} multi-tenanted {{architectures}} {{have been investigated}} in the recent literature due to the popularity of cloud computing. A number of challenges need to be overcome if <b>multitenanted</b> architectures are to be effective and efficient. Among the challenges is the management of performance properties while effectively sharing the limited resources between the tenants. This work presents an approach to design such a management system for a multi-tenanted business process server. This approach not only enables performance to be maintained at different levels for different tenants depending on their priorities, but also autonomously detects the overloads of aggressive tenants and dynamically changes the control objectives to safeguard the business operations of other tenants. The novelty of the proposed approach {{is the use of}} the nonlinear feedback control. The experiment results indicate that the proposed nonlinear control approach achieves the objectives much better compared to the existing fixed and linear control techniques...|$|R
40|$|We {{undertake}} the first formal {{analysis of the}} role of symmetry, interpreted broadly, in the design of server-centric datacenter networks. Although symmetry has been mentioned by other researchers, we explicitly relate it to various specific, structural, graph-theoretic properties of datacenter networks. Our analysis of symmetry is motivated by the need to ascertain the usefulness of a datacenter network as regards the support of network virtualization and prevalent communication patterns in <b>multitenanted</b> clouds. We argue that a number of structural concepts relating to symmetry from general interconnection networks, such as recursive-definability, the existence and dynamic construction of spanning trees, pancyclicity, and variations in Hamiltonicity, are appropriate topological metrics to use in this regard. In relation to symmetry, we highlight the relevance of algebraic properties and algebraic constructions within datacenter network design. Built upon our analysis of symmetry, we outline the first technique to embed guest datacenter networks in a host datacenter network that is specifically oriented towards server-centric datacenter networks. In short, we provide the graph-theoretic foundations for the design of server-centric datacenter networks so as to support network virtualization and communication patterns in cloud computing...|$|R
40|$|The {{market of}} {{existing}} office buildings is going green. While early adopters of green buildings were owner-occupiers, {{there is a}} current wave of nonowner-occupied office buildings seeking Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Existing Buildings certification. This thesis examines the current context in which this dramatic change is transpiring as well as answers the following questions {{as they relate to}} this green transformation of existing <b>multitenanted</b> office buildings: * Who is participating? * Why are they participating? * What is the process? * What are the costs? * How is it being financed? Research conducted included literature review and interviews with building owners, property managers, building engineers and brokers in several major metropolitan office markets in the United States. This thesis examines green building rating systems from around the world. We focus on the LEED rating system, the most widely used in the United States, as it provides a good framework for owners and managers to evaluate and benchmark the environmental performance of their building. Our research indicates that a much higher percentage of Class A office building owners and managers are pursuing LEED for Existing Building (LEED-EB) certification, while Class B owners and managers are not. Class B owners face less incentives and greater obstacles when pursuing LEED-EB certification. In chapter four of this thesis, we explore two creative ways that Class B owners and managers may be able to overcome some of these hurdles - Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). by Tyson H.
