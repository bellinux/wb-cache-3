40|$|Genes, behaviour, and the {{environment}} {{are known to be}} the major risk factors for common diseases. When the patient visits a physician, typical questions include family history (genes) and lifestyle of the patient (behaviour), but questions concerning environmental risk factors often remain unasked. It is ironic that 25 centuries ago Hippocrates, known as the father of medicine, noted the importance of environmental exposure in medical investigation as documented in his classic work, “Airs, Waters, Places”, yet the practice of routinely incorporating environmental risk factors is still not in place. Modern epigenetic studies have found that unhealthy lifestyle and environmental factors can cause changes to our genes that can increase disease risk factors. Therefore, attempting to solve the puzzle of diseases using heredity and lifestyle alone will be incomplete without accounting for {{the environment}}al exposures. The primary reason why environmental exposure has not yet been a routine part of the patient’s medical history is mostly due to our inability to provide clinicians useful measures of environmental exposures suitable for their clinical practices. This presentation will discuss advances in geospatial technology that show the potential to catalyse a paradigm shift in medical practice and health research by allowing environmental risk factors to be documented as the patient’s “Geographic Medical History”. In order to accomplish this we need information on: a) relevant spatiotemporal environmental variables, and b) location of the individual in that person’s dynamic environment. Common environmental agents that are known to interact with genetic <b>make-up</b> include <b>air</b> pollutants, mold spores, pesticides, etc. Until recently, the other component, location of an individual was limited to a static representation such as residential or workplace location.

Experimentally, the effect of different <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> supply positions and inlet area on the fire-induced inner conditions and smoke layer descent was studied by means of three full-scale fire tests conducted in a 20 m cubic atrium. Detailed transient measurements of gas and wall temperatures, as well as pressure drop through the exhaust fans and airflow at the inlets were recorded. Later computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of these tests were performed with the code Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS).

Traditional two-layer approach with an upper smoke layer and a lower air layer will be assumed. Three scenarios of extraction with different relative positions of the air inlet are studied.

40|$|The cost {{of energy}} for drying paper is {{substantial}} for the pulp and paper industry, and studies of various strategies for energy cost reductions such as increased energy efficiency, increased heat recovery from the exhaust drying air and reduced cost of the process heat are presented in this thesis. The energy use and cost studies were performed using a block-model based simulation tool developed for this specific purpose. For a multicylinder drying-section, the heat recovery potential was shown to vary from 25 to 60 %, based on total energy available in the exhaust air stream, as the dew point of the drying air was varied {{in the range of}} 45 to 70 °C. For minimum energy costs, the dryer should be operated at the highest dew point possible. Dryer-limited paper machines should, however, always be operated at the lowest exhaust air humidity possible since the revenue from the extra produced paper is much higher than the additional cost of energy. The use of drying-sections including gas-fired paper dryers was shown to increase the heat recovery potential by up to 40 %. However, due to the higher cost of natural gas and the reduced backpressure power generation with such drying-sections, the overall energy costs will be significantly higher. If black liquor gasification is implemented the produced syngas {{can be used as a}} substitute for the fossil natural gas. The process economics will improve significantly, especially if the gas is used to fire a combined cycle system and the exhaust gases from the gas turbine are used as <b>make-up</b> drying <b>air</b> in the impingement hood. At current energy price levels, in-house power generation based on biomass fuels is greatly favoured by the electricity certificate system, and the high power-to-heat ratio of the combined cycle system is thus favourable.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Climatic Wind Tunnel (CWT) is a facility used by the motor industry to test vehicles under climatic extremes {{without the need for}} expensive overseas test programs. This work focuses on the application of computer simulation to the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) plant that makes up a CWT facility. The objective being to reduce its operational costs through the identification of energy saving operational strategies. When in operation the CWT has a peak power consumption of 3 MW. The implementation of any measures that would reduce this peak load would give rise to considerable savings in the operating costs of the facility. Computer simulation is an accepted technique for the study of systems operating under varying load conditions. Simulation allows rapid analysis of different strategies for operating plant and the effectiveness of achieving the desired effect without compromising the buildings performance. Models for the components of the CWT have been developed and coded in Neutral Model Format. These models have then been linked together in a modular simulation environment to give a model of the complete plant. The CWT plant naturally decomposesin to four major subsystems these being the test chamber, the soakroom, <b>air</b> <b>make-up</b> and refrigeration system. Models of all the primary and secondary HVAC plant are described as is how they constitute the systems that make up the CWT. Validation tests for individual components {{as well as for the}} systems have been carried out. To illustrate the potential of the application of computer simulation into finding improved modes of operation that would reduce the energy consumption of the facility, four studies have been carried out. The studies involve the possibility of scheduling the operation of condenser fans as a function of refrigeration load and outside ambient temperature, methods for the pre-test conditioning of a vehicle, a reduction in the secondary refrigerant flow temperature and an increase in the thickness of the insulated panels from which the facility is constructed. The studies carried out showed that there was potential for moderate energy savings to be made in the operation of the facility and that extended simulation runs would allow for the in-depth assessment of a large range of possible modes of plant operation in order to identify the areas where the greatest savings are possible...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on the fluid {{dynamics}} of the <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> at the vents in case of an atrium fire, its influence on the fire-induced conditions and the necessity of properly model it to obtain an accurate numerical prediction. For this aim, experimental data from two full-scale atrium fire tests conducted in a 20 m cubic facility, with venting conditions involving mechanical smoke exhaust and <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> velocities larger than 1 m/s, and with different fire powers, are presented. Subsequent numerical simulations of these tests have been performed with the code Fire Dynamics Simulator v 5. 5. 3. Two different approaches have been followed to simulate the <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> inlet fluid dynamics, involving one domain which only considers the inside of the building and another which includes part of the outside. In the former simulations, anomalous phenomena around the fire appear, while the inclusion of the exterior domain provides with a completely different fluid dynamics inside the facility which agrees better with the experimental data. A detailed analysis of the fluid mechanics at the air inlet vents is conducted to explain these discrepancies.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the North Carolina's PV Bonus Team was to develop and demonstrate a commercially viable, building-integrated, photovoltaic system that, {{in addition to providing}} electricity, would capture and effectively utilize the thermal energy produced by the photovoltaic array. This project objective was successfully achieved by designing, testing, constructing, and monitoring two roof integrated photovoltaic systems [...] one on a Applebee's Restaurant in Salisbury, North Carolina and the second on a Central Carolina Bank in Bessemer City, North Carolina. The goal of Innovative Design is to now use these successful demonstrations to facilitate entry of building integrated, pv/thermal systems into the marketplace. The strategy was to develop the two systems that could be utilized in future applications. Both systems were designed and then constructed at the North Carolina Solar Center at North Carolina State University. After extensive testing at the North Carolina Solar Center, the systems were moved to the actual construction sites and implemented. The Applebee's Restaurant system was designed to substitute for the roof assembly of a low sloping, south-facing sunspace roof that typically incorporated clay tile. After monitoring the installed system for one year it was determined that the 1. 2 kilowatt (peak) system produces an average peak reduction of 1 kilowatt (rated peak is 1. 7 kiloWatts), saves 1, 529 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and offsets 11, 776 kilowatt-hours of thermal energy savings used to pre-heat water. A DC fan connected directly to eight of the thirty-two amorphous modules moves air through air passages mounted on the backside of the modules and into a closed loop duct system to a heat exchanger. This heat exchanger is, in turn, connected to a pre-heat hot water tank that is used to heat the water for the restaurant. The Central Carolina Bank system was designed to substitute for the roof assembly of the drive-in window area of the bank. The design featured a triangulated truss that incorporated ten crystalline photovoltaic modules {{on one side of the}} truss and a reflective panel on the opposite side. The system used a utility interactive, programmable inverter and a 18. 9 kilowatt-hour battery bank. The system is designed so that a DC fan, connected to one of the modules, forces ambient air across the back side of the modules. In the summer this heat is vented to the outside but in the winter this heated, fresh air is introduced into the building as ventilation air. Like the Applebee's system, the design allowed the entire roof assembly to be constructed off-site, tested, and then shipped to the site in pie-assembled, large components. During the first full year of operation, the 2. 2 kilowatt (rated peak is 2. 7 kilowatts) system contributed to an average peak reduction of. 9 kilowatts. The system, as designed, saves 2, 576 kilowatt-hours of electricity and offsets 3, 473 kilowatt hours (of a potential thermal benefit of 10, 172 collected kWhs) of thermal energy savings that is used as fresh <b>air</b> <b>make-up</b> in the colder months.

40|$|Gas {{sensitive}} semiconductors {{have been}} known {{for many years and}} applied in static gas alarm systems for the monitoring of hazardous gases, however, their application has been limited by a lack of selectivity. In this work a semiconducting gas sensor has been configured for use as a gas chromatographic detector thus combining the sensitivity of semiconductor sensors with the selectivity of gas chromatography. The study has been confined to tin oxide devices, more specifically the Taguchi gas sensor (TGS). The majority of this work has concentrated on the TGS 813 although the use of other TGS is described. The development of suitable instrumentation is described and rigorous optimisation of the operating parameters e. g. heater voltage and column temperature has been performed using the variable step size simplex technique. Attention was concentrated on the response of the TGS 813 to hydrogen which was used as a test gas. A novel figure of merit, response multiplied by retention time and divided by skew factor was designed so that optimum response was obtained whilst maintaining adequate chromatographic separation. Optimum conditions were verified by univariate searches and the response was observed to be most dependant upon heater voltage. A limit of detection of 20 ppb v/v of hydrogen in a 1 ml sample was obtained at optimal conditions. Illustrative analyses of hydrogen were performed in human breath and laboratory air with results found to be in close agreement with literature values. Calibration was found to be linear over at least three orders of magnitude. The response of the TGS 813 to low molecular weight alkanes has also been investigated. It was observed that different heater voltage optima existed for each of the C 1 -C 5 alkanes and that the sensor was relatively more sensitive to the higher molecular weight compounds. As with hydrogen linear response was obtained over at least three orders of magnitude and an illustrative analysis of natural gas showed excellent agreement with known levels. A compromise optimum heater voltage was used to study the response of the TGS 813 to alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and some Cs hydrocarbons. Capillary columns were used in this investigation and it was noted that they had potentially wider application than packed columns due to the use of an inert carrier with an <b>air</b> <b>make-up</b> flow to the detector. This replaced the air carrier gas used previously which might degrade certain stationary phases. Three different types of TGS: the 813; 822 and 831 were used in a study of the response and skew factor for the detection of halogen-containing compounds. Very high skew factors were often observed, although, for some compounds it appeared that symmetrical peaks could be obtained within narrow heater voltage ranges. Skewed response was observed to be dependant upon sensor type, heater voltage and halogen proportion and type. Analysis of the three sensor types was performed and differences in potential surface area and tin oxide additives observed. The presence of additives was observed to adversely affect sensor recovery. Philips Scientific, York Street, Cambridge CBl 2 P...|$|R

Substantial temporal and spatial variability was observed in all seasons and attributed, in part, to the batch nature of operations, process emission variabil-ity and frequent work interruptions. The need for fine mapping grids was demonstrated, where elevations in particle concentrations were highly localized. Ultrafine particle concentrations were generally greatest during winter when incoming <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> was heated with direct fire, natural gas burners. <b>Make-up</b> <b>air</b> drawn from roof level had elevated respirable mass and ul-trafine number concentrations above ambient outdoor levels, suggesting inadvertent recircula-tion of foundry process emissions.

40|$|Buildings {{in a hot}} {{and humid}} climate usually are kept at a {{positive}} pressurization level to avoid infiltration induced issues such as mold growth within building envelopes. This dissertation combines existing models of infiltration and mold growth to predict the influence of pressurization level on the risk of mold growth. The simulation results indicate that a 3 meter high unpressurized building in College Station, TX with 22 ?C indoor temperature set-pint will experience an annual increase in mold index, and 1. 5 Pa positive pressurization should theoretically eliminate the long-term risk of an increasing mold index on all walls. The model also indicates that only 1 Pa pressurization is required if the same building is moved to Fort Worth, TX and no pressurization is required if it is moved to Atlanta, GA. Furthermore, a field experiment indicates that the conventional pressurization system fails to pressurize each floor of the eight-floor Harrington Tower building equally due to stack effect; extra <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> is required to compensate the leaked air through the over-pressurized floors which results in extra energy consumption.

One notable application {{in recent years has been}} for combustion airs preheat of fired heaters in petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants. Another recent development has been a waste heat recovery boiler using heat pipes. This device has a number of advantageous features. Field operational experience of several units in service has been excellent...|$|E
40|$|Equations {{are derived}} {{in this paper}} for {{predicting}} the airborne concentration of particles and microbe-carrying particles in non-unidirectional airflow cleanrooms during manufacturing. The equations are obtained {{for a variety of}} ventilation systems with different configurations for mixing fresh and recirculated air, air filter placements, and number and efficiency of air filters. The variables in the equations are air supply rate, airborne dispersion rate of contamination from machinery and people, surface deposition of particles from air, particle concentration in fresh makeup air, proportion of <b>make-up</b> <b>air,</b> and air filter efficiencies. The equations are amenable to relatively simple modification for the study of different cleanroom ventilation systems. The use of these equations to investigate the effect of different configurations of ventilation systems and the relative importance of the equation variables on airborne concentrations will be reported in a further paper...|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates an {{original}} radon mitigation technique which uses solar-heated ventilation air to reduce radon and other indoor air pollutants. Providing energy-efficient <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> for combustion appliances and stack effect losses, the Solar Radon Reduction System (SRRS) improves {{indoor air quality}} through dilution, slight pressurization, and reduced radon infiltration. Solar heating of intake air produces net energy gain in cold seasons, and the SRRS blower provides summertime cooling during low outdoor temperatures. Research methodology includes synchronized hourly radon data collected at five test homes and a "control " maintained under closed conditions over five 10 -day test periods. The control closely correlated weather-related radon trends, particularly with leaky homes, and thus serves as an appropriate reference for simultaneous multi-home remediation measurement. Installed at six homes in northeast Iowa, the SRRS was found to significantly reduce winter-time radon at all homes with elevated levels {{by an average of}} 49 %...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a CFD analysis on thermal comfort and energy consumption effected by partitions in an air-conditioned building. CFD experiments {{are carried out}} to simulate variables of indoor air before/after installation or removal of partitions. Accordingly, the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) is determined {{as an indicator of}} thermal comfort while the cooling load of <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> is calculated for energy consumption. Some simulated results are validated by measurements with good agreement where a case study is conducted in an air-conditioned space of a library. With the proposed methodology, it can be recommended in a case study that the significant effects of partition on thermal comfort are observed in the regions where occupants feel warmer and in the regions where occupants feel uncomfortably cool after installing the partition while the energy consumption increases by 24 %. The installation of the partition at the desired location is not encouraged regarding to occupant's comfort and energy consumption without modification of the air-conditioning units...|$|E

ResCore is a self contained, manufactured, residential utility wall that provides complete rough-in of utilities (power, gas, water, and phone) and other functions (exhaust, combustion <b>make-up</b> <b>air,</b> refrigerant lines, etc.) to serve the kitchen, bath, utility, and laundry rooms. Auburn University, Department of Industrial Design faculty, students, supported {{by a team of}} graduate student researchers and the project`s advisory team, developed the ResCore. The project was accomplished through a research subcontract from the U. S. Department of Energy administered by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The ResCore wall system features a layered manufacturing technique that allows each major component group: structural, cold water, hot water, drain, gas, electric, etc. to be built as a separate subassembly and easily brought together for final assembly. The two structural layers are reinforced with bridging that adds strength and also permits firm attachment of plumbing pipes and other systems to the wall frame...|$|E
40|$|The Beckett Heat Recovery is {{a series}} of {{techniques}} for recovering low-grade waste heat from flue gas. Until the cost of fossil fuels began rising rapidly, flue gas below 600 F was considered economically unworthy of reclaim. This paper will describe the latest system installation at the John Deere WeIland Works. Partially funded by the Canadian and Ontario Governments in order to demonstrate new energy saving technology, the Beckett Model 2002 employs a heat exchanger which does double duty. During low demand periods, the unit is gas-fired and produces 150 psi steam at high efficiency. In the fall, the heat exchanger is converted to accept flue gas from the large original water tube boilers. The flue gas heats water, which preheats <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> and boiler feedwater. Several of the Beckett Systems presently operating use year-round heat recovery exchangers on constant loads. The newest development is the Series 2004 condensing system that reduces flue gas temperature to within 15 F of the heat sink medium...|$|E

40|$|Natural gas and {{electricity}} are expensive {{to the extent}} that annual fuel and power costs can approach the initial cost of an industrial boiler plant. Within this context, this paper examines several cost-effective efficiency advancements that were implemented during a recently completed boiler plant replacement project at a large semiconductor manufacturing complex. The "new" boiler plant began service in November, 1996 and consists of four 75, 000 lb/hr water-tube boilers burning natural gas and producing 210 psig saturated steam for heating and humidification. Efficiency advancements include: 1) Reheating of cleanroom <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> with heat extracted during precooling. 2) Preheating of combustion air with heat extracted from boiler flue gas. 3) Preheating of boiler feedwater with heat extracted from the exhaust of a nearby gas turbine. 4) Variable speed operation of boiler feedwater pumps and forced-draft fans. 5) Preheating of boiler make-up water with heat extracted from boiler blow-down. These efficiency advancements should prove of interest to industrial energy users faced with replacement of aging, inefficient boiler plants, rising fuel and power prices, and increasing pressures to reduce operating costs in order to enhance competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|Artículos en revistasAn {{experimental}} and numerical comparison of new full-scale atrium fire {{tests in the}} 20 m cubic atrium with four different heat release rates (1. 7 MW, 2. 3 MW, 3. 9 MW and 5. 3 MW) is presented. Different exhaust conditions (steady and transient extraction rates) and different <b>make-up</b> <b>air</b> configurations (symmetric and asymmetric) are assessed. Temperature measurements in the near (fire plume) and far field (close to the walls) have been recorded by means of 59 thermocouples. The smoke layer interface is also estimated {{by means of a}} thermocouple tree with 28 measurements using the least-square and the n-percent methods. The simulations have been conducted using FDS (version 6, Release Candidate 3). The comparison with the simulations shows average discrepancies lower than 32 % and 11 %, for the near and far field temperatures, respectively. A discrepancy lower than 5 % (1 m) is obtained by both methods for the smoke layer height when the steady state is reached. Finally, a slower response to an increment on the exhaust rate is predicted on the smoke layer, being more perceptible for high heat release rates. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
