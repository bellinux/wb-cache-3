40|$|Background: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> {{spectroscopy}} provides metabolic {{information about}} living tissues in a non-invasive way. However, {{there are only}} few multi-centre clinical studies, mostly performed on a single scanner model or data format, {{as there is no}} flexible way of documenting and exchanging processed <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy <b>data</b> in digital format. This is because the DICOM standard for spectroscopy deals with unprocessed data. This paper proposes a plugin tool developed for jMRUI, namely jMRUI 2 XML, to tackle the latter limitation. jMRUI is a software tool for <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy <b>data</b> processing that is widely used in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy community and has evolved into a plugin platform allowing for implementation of novel features. Results: jMRUI 2 XML is a Java solution that facilitates common preprocessing of <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy <b>data</b> across multiple scanners. Its main characteristics are: 1) it automates <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy preprocessing, and 2) it can be a platform for outputting exchangeable <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy <b>data.</b> The plugin works with any kind of data that can be opened by jMRUI and outputs in extensible markup language format. Data processing templates can be generated and saved for later use. The output format opens the way for easy data sharing- due to the documentation of the preprocessing parameters and the intrinsic anonymization - for example for performing pattern recognition analysis on multicentre/multimanufacturer <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy <b>data.</b> Conclusions: jMRUI 2 XML provides a self-contained and self-descriptive format accounting for the most relevant information needed for exchanging <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy <b>data</b> in digital form, as well as for automating its processing. This allows for tracking the procedures the data has undergone, which makes the proposed tool especially useful when performing pattern recognition analysis. Moreover, this work constitutes a first proposal for a minimum amount of information that should accompany any <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> processed spectrum, towards the goal of achieving better transferability of <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy studies...|$|R

40|$|Functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging {{has become}} a {{standard}} technology in human brain mapping. Analyses of the massive spatiotemporal functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging <b>data</b> sets often focus on parametric or non-parametric modelling of the temporal component, whereas spatial smoothing is based on Gaussian kernels or random fields. A weakness of Gaussian spatial smoothing is underestimation of activation peaks or blurring of high curvature transitions between activated and non-activated regions of the brain. To improve spatial adaptivity, we introduce a class of inhomogeneous Markov random fields with stochastic interaction weights in a space-varying coefficient model. For given weights, the random field is conditionally Gaussian, but marginally it is non-Gaussian. Fully Bayesian inference, including estimation of weights and variance parameters, {{can be carried out}} through efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Although motivated by the analysis of functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging <b>data,</b> the methodological development is general and can also be used for spatial smoothing and regression analysis of areal data on irregular lattices. An application to stylized artificial data and to real functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging <b>data</b> from a visual stimulation experiment demonstrates the performance of our approach in comparison with Gaussian and robustified non-Gaussian Markov random-field models.

The {{diffusion}} tensor {{model has}} been used to analyze <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> diffusion <b>data</b> and has been successful in both neuroscientific and clinical applications. We propose an enhancement of this model with a local connectivity parameter that better accords with the known structure of white-matter. In addition to providing diffusion tensor parameter estimation the calculation provides the probability that a given pixel is connected to one of its nearest neighbors. These probabilities can be used in further calculations to determine the probability of connectivity between different brain regions.

50|$|One {{widespread}} single-nucleotide polymorphism of the NQO1 gene (NQO1*2), found homozygous in 4% to 20% {{of different}} populations, has {{found to be}} connected with different forms of cancer and a lowered efficiency of some chemotherapeutics like mitomycin C.

Crystallographic and nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>data</b> show that the reason for this different behaviour is found in a flexible C-terminus of the protein leading to a destabilization of the whole protein.

This thesis deals with <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> investigations of the central nervous system in vivo and is based on four studies. In studies I-III in vivo proton <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy <b>data</b> were acquired in three animal models. These models were designed to monitor Alzheimer’s disease, spinal cord injury and premature aging. We wanted to quantify and evaluate the differences in metabolite levels in diseased animals in comparison with controls. In study IV, resting-state functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging was applied to investigate young and elderly human subjects. Three different pre-processing procedures were also evaluated. Furthermore, in this thesis we aimed to explore how <b>data</b> acquired with <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy and functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging can be extracted and analyzed using model free and model driven multivariate data analyses. The linear multivariate data analysis methods principal components analysis and partial least squares projections to latent structures were applied to <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy <b>data</b> acquired in rodents. Independent component analysis was applied to the resting-state functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging <b>data</b> acquired in human subjects.

In study IV we investigated the effects of preprocessing prior to independent component analysis. We found that global signal removal can enhance anti-correlation in resting-state functional connectivity networks.
