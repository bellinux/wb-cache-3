50|$|A modern {{theodolite}} {{consists of}} a <b>movable</b> <b>telescope</b> mounted within two perpendicular axes: the horizontal or trunnion axis and the zenith axis. A theodolite measures vertical angles as angles between the zenith, forwards or plunged—typically approximately 90 and 270 degrees. When the telescope is pointed at a target object, the angle {{of each of these}} axes can be measured with great precision, typically to milliradian or seconds of arc.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of linear optimal control and filtering theory to control a spinning spacecraft with <b>movable</b> <b>telescoping</b> appendages. The equations of motion are linearized about the desired final state. A feedback control system is designed to maintain this final state, with plant noise and measurement noise present in the system. Analytic results are obtained for special cases and numerical results are presented for the general case...|$|R
40|$|Some {{consequences}} of using continuously <b>movable</b> <b>telescopes</b> for optical astronomical image formation by aperture synthesis techniques are discussed. A simple derivation {{of the telescope}} motions is given for two cases. In the first, the telescopes move so as to lie on an ellipse which is continuously deforming with time as the source is tracked. In the second case, they lie on a straight line perpendicular {{to the line of}} sight to the star, and fixed-length optical fibers carry the light to the detector. The physical meaning of the resulting formulae and their consequences for the interferometer design are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The ISI (Infrared Stellar Interferometer), an {{interferometer}} {{operating at}} mid-infrared wavelengths will be discussed, including both the instrumentation and results of stellar measurements. The ISI operates in the 10 micron wavelength region using three <b>movable</b> <b>telescopes</b> and heterodyne detection with CO 2 laser local oscillators. Phase closure allows rather complete imaging {{of stars and}} their dust shells, including measurement of asymmetries. Measurements have been conducted of the emission of material from stars, some ejected at very high velocity, the size and change of size of some stars, stellar ellipticity, and stellar asymmetry. Material blown off from stars is often emitted in periodic shells, and frequently asymmetric...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{telescope}} (85-1, Tatel) {{was built}} in 1959 at a fixed location. It was used in Project Ozma in 1960 without Interferometer. In 1963, in anticipation of adding <b>movable</b> <b>telescopes</b> for interferometer, the second 85 ft telescope kit identical to 85-1 was ordered. The construction of the second telescope (85-2) was completed in 1964 along with a 1.5 mi track from 85-1. At that time, the 85-2 telescope was placed {{at the end of}} the track and cables were connected between the two telescopes. The GBI began operation that year as a two element interferometer in order to test large aperture synthesis arrays and study radio astrometry and interstellar scintillation.|$|R
40|$|The physics {{questions}} {{to be addressed by}} the next generation of high energy GammaRay experiments require astronomical observations with good angular resolution and to resolve spectral structures with the best possible energy and temporal resolution in the full energy range accessible to earth-bound detectors. We discuss the DUO project based on an installation of initially 3 MAGIC-type 17 m Cherenkov <b>telescopes</b> <b>movable</b> on the spokes of a 800 m diameter wheel-shaped array yielding an effective area of the order of 1. 000. 000 m 2 in its final stage when consisting out of 7 telscopes. The <b>movable</b> <b>telescopes</b> will allow for different operation modes: 1. small effective area, thus overlap and good angular and energy resolution, and 2. large effective area and good temporal resolution. We will give an overview of the physics potential of such a project. 1. Introduction The currently operating first generation of Cherenkov telescopes has succeeded in obtaining a series of spectacular physics [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of detumbling a randomly spinning spacecraft using externally mounted, <b>movable</b> <b>telescoping</b> appendages are studied both analytically and numerically. Two types of telescoping appendages are considered: (1) where an end mass is mounted {{at the end}} of an (assumed) massless boom; and (2) where the appendage is assumed to consist of a uniformly distributed homogeneous mass throughout its length. From an application of Liapunov's second method boom extension maneuvers can be determined to approach either of two desired final states: close to a zero inertial angular velocity state, and a final spin rate about only one of the principal axes. Recovery dynamics are evaluated analytically for the case of symmetrical deployment. Numerical examination of other asymmetrical cases verifies the practicality of using movable appendages to recover a randomly tumbling spacecraft...|$|R
50|$|The VLT {{consists}} of an arrangement of four large (8.2 metre diameter) telescopes (called Unit Telescopes or UTs) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer (VLTI), {{which is used to}} resolve small objects. The interferometer also includes a set of four 1.8 meter diameter <b>movable</b> <b>telescopes</b> dedicated to interferometric observations. The first of the UTs started operating in May 1998 and was offered to the astronomical community on 1 April 1999. The other telescopes followed suit in 1999 and 2000, thus making the VLT fully operational. Four 1.8-metre Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) {{have been added to the}} VLTI to make it available when the UTs are being used for other projects. These ATs were installed between 2004 and 2007. Today, all four Unit Telescopes and all four Auxiliary Telescopes are operational.|$|R
40|$|The observatory’s two facilities, a fast-tracking {{telescope}} and an optical interferometer, {{are the result}} of a strong science agenda supported by three enabling opportunities. The Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO) consists of a fast-tracking 2. 4 m telescope (shown in Figure 1) and a long-baseline optical interferometer 1 (see Figure 2 for an artist’s conception). Interferometry is a technique in which the light from two or more telescopes is coherently combined to form fringes that are later made into images. Animations that demonstrate the MRO interferometer (MROI) and optical interferometry are available online. 2 – 4 The method yields spatial resolutions dependent on the separation of the telescopes rather than their diameters. For the MROI, which will operate 10 <b>movable</b> <b>telescopes</b> at optical and near-infrared wavelengths separated by 7. 5 – 347 m, the angular resolution will range from 0. 3 to 30 milliarcseconds...|$|R
40|$|The time-optimal {{control of}} a spin-stabilized {{spacecraft}} with a <b>movable</b> <b>telescoping</b> appendage (boom) is considered analytically and numerically. The motion of a control mass {{at the end of}} the boom is determined such that the terminal time will be minimized for two-axis {{control of a}} symmetric spacecraft. The equations of rotational motion are linearized about the desired state of spin about the symmetry axis. The equations for the transverse angular velocity components have the form of a coupled two dimensional harmonic oscillator with boom motion as a control force. The control function which brings the system to the desired state is known to be a series of positive and negative pulses. If the initial state is such that the system can be driven to rest in a single switch, the responses, switching and final times, and required boom motion may be determined analytically. Some typical numerical results based on these solutions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new method to align and point small {{telescope}} systems. The method {{is based on}} synthesizing {{of the image of}} the batch of sky to which the telescope is pointing using a database star catalogue. An image of the sky is acquired which is processed and matched with the synthesized image. Point pattern matching is used first to identify some stars in both images, then normalized correlation matching is used to ensure and precisely match both of the acquired and synthesized images. An image processing and frame grabber board is used to draw stars of the synthesized image and to extract star centers as well as their areas. This process solved the main problem of polar alignment of small and <b>movable</b> <b>telescopes,</b> which was tedious and very time consuming. In addition, it is used in precise pointing. The system is composed of a small inexpensive CCD camera coupled to a wide field lens and a frame grabber and image processing board. As the images of the stars are used to control the telescope, neither precise timing nor precise encoders are required...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} gravity-gradient torques during boom {{deployment}} maneuvers of a spinning spacecraft are examined {{with a combination}} of numerical and analytical methods. It is assumed that the spacecraft consists of a rigid central hub and <b>movable</b> rigid <b>telescoping</b> booms where the booms extend only along the hub principal axes. For the special case of symmetric deployment the stability boundaries are determined and a stability chart is used to study the system behavior. Possible cases of instability during this type of maneuver are identified...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s the {{aperture}} synthesis interferometric imaging technique {{was extended to}} visible light and infrared astronomy by the Cavendish Astrophysics Group, providing the first very high resolution images of nearby stars. [...] In 1995 this technique was demonstrated on an array of separate optical telescopes for the first time, allowing a further improvement in resolution, and allowing even higher resolution imaging of stellar surfaces. Software packages such as BSMEM or MIRA are used to convert the measured visibility amplitudes and closure phases into astronomical images. The same techniques have now been applied {{at a number of}} other astronomical telescope arrays, including the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, the Infrared Spatial Interferometer and the IOTA array. A number of other interferometers have made closure phase measurements and are expected to produce their first images soon, including the VLTI, the CHARA array and Le Coroller and Dejonghe's Hypertelescope prototype. If completed, the MRO Interferometer with up to ten <b>movable</b> <b>telescopes</b> will produce among the first higher fidelity images from a long baseline interferometer. The Navy Optical Interferometer took the first step in this direction in 1996, achieving 3-way synthesis of an image of Mizar; then a first-ever six-way synthesis of Eta Virginis in 2002; and most recently [...] "closure phase" [...] as a step to the first synthesized images produced by geostationary satellites.|$|R
50|$|The Very Large Telescope (VLT) is a {{telescope}} facility {{operated by the}} European Southern Observatory on Cerro Paranal in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. The VLT consists of four individual telescopes, each with a primary mirror 8.2 m across, which are generally used separately but can be used together to achieve very high angular resolution. The four separate optical telescopes are known as Antu, Kueyen, Melipal and Yepun, which are all words for astronomical objects in the Mapuche language. The telescopes form an array which is complemented by four <b>movable</b> Auxiliary <b>Telescopes</b> (ATs) of 1.8 m aperture.|$|R
50|$|The primary observing {{instrument}} is the 64 m <b>movable</b> dish <b>telescope,</b> second {{largest in the}} Southern Hemisphere, {{and one of the}} first large movable dishes in the world (DSS-43 'Deep Space Station'-43 at Tidbinbilla was extended from 64 m to 70 m in 1987, surpassing Parkes). After its completion it has operated almost continuously to the present day. The dish surface was physically upgraded by adding smooth metal plates to the central part to provide focusing capability for centimetre and millimetre length microwaves. The outer part of the dish remains a fine metal mesh, creating its distinctive two-tone appearance.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device and {{a process for}} the duplication of X-ray masks by means of X-ray lithography, with which the precise adjustment and spacing of the 1 x master mask and copy or heat sink and copy are possible. According to the invention, the adjustment and spacing of the 1 x master mask and copy are performed {{by means of a}} <b>movable</b> autocollimating <b>telescope</b> and adjustable mask holders. The precise spacing of the heat sink and copy is enabled by a capacitive distance sensor on the heat sink. Copying processes for X-ray masks are necessary in particular for industrial applications since several copies of an X-ray mask are frequently required...|$|R
40|$|The U. C. Berkeley Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI) is {{a stellar}} {{interferometer}} {{operating in the}} 9 - 12 micron region {{and has been in}} operation from 1988 until the present. It utilizes heterodyne detection using CO 2 laser local oscillators and currently includes two 1. 65 m <b>movable</b> <b>telescopes</b> mounted in semi-trailers and baselines up to about 65 m in length. A third telescope is being integrated with the other two and within the next year will operate as an imaging interferometer providing data with three simultaneous baselines and a closure phase, and baselines up to about 75 m. During the past twelve years the ISI has been used extensively for studies of circumstellar material around evolved stars. Multi-epoch observations of a sample of prototypical sources have elucidated the location and time scales for dust formation around these stars. These time scales can be as short as approx. 10 years for Mira stars and as long as approx. 100 years for supergiants. For stars like Mira itself there is evidence for departure from spherical symmetry and episodes of dust formation and destruction. For some stars motion of dust has been observed [...] IK Tau is one example, and NML Cyg is another. The molecules Silane and Ammonia were observed for the extreme carbon star IRC + 10216 and the supergiant VY CMa pinpointing their location relative to the inner radius of the dust shell. Somewhat surprisingly, these molecules were found to form many stellar radii away from the inner radius of the dust shell, implying that they form by interactions with the surfaces of dust grains. Last year observations with the longest baselines lead to new precision diameters of o Ceti and α Orionis, and are continuing on a somewhat larger set of Mira variable and supergiant stars...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} a spin-stabilized {{spacecraft}} consisting of a rigid central hub {{and one or two}} <b>movable</b> offset <b>telescoping</b> booms (with end masses) is considered. The equations of rotational motion are linearized about either of two desired final states. A control law for the boom and mass position is sought such that a quadratic cost functional involving the weighted components of angular velocity plus the control is minimized when the final time is unspecified and involves the solution of the matrix Riccati algebraic equation. For three-axis control more than one offset boom (orthogonal to each other) is required. For two-axis control with a single boom offset from a symmetrical hub, an analytic solution is obtained; when this system is used for nutation decay the time constant is one order of magnitude smaller than previously achieved using non-optimal control logic. For the general case results are obtained numerically...|$|R

25|$|The abdomen has no {{appendages}} except {{from one}} to four (usually three) modified pairs of <b>movable</b> <b>telescoping</b> organs called spinnerets, which produce silk. Originally, the common ancestor of spiders had four pairs of spinnerets, with two pairs on the tenth body segment and two pairs on the eleventh body segment, located in the middle on the ventral side of the abdomen. The suborder Mesothelae is unique in having only two types of silk glands – {{thought to be the}} ancestral condition. All other spiders have the spinnerets further towards the posterior end of the body where they form a small cluster, and the anterior central spinnerets on the tenth segment are lost or reduced (suborder Mygalomorphae), or modified into a specialised and flattened plate called the cribellum (suborder Araneomorphae). The cribellum (usually separated into a left and a right half) produces a thread made up of hundreds to thousands of very fine dry silk fibers (about 10nm thick) around a few thicker core fibers, which then are combed into a woolly structure by using a group of specialized hairs (setae) on their fourth pair of legs. It is suspected their woolly silk is charged with static electricity, causing its fine fibres to attach to trapped prey. Once all araneomorph (modern) spiders had a cribellum, but today it only remains in the cribellate spiders (although it is sometimes missing even here), which are widespread around the world. Often, this plate lacks the ability to produce silk, and is then called the colulus; an organ that zoologists have not identified a function for. The colulus is reduced or absent in most species. The cribellate spiders were the first spiders to build specialized prey catching webs, later evolving into groups that used the spinnerets solely to make webs, instead using silk threads dotted with droplets of a sticky liquid (like pearls on a necklace) to capture small arthropods, and a few large species even small bats and birds. Other spiders do not build webs at all, but have become active hunters, like the highly successful jumping spiders.|$|R

The technique {{is based on}} pattern matching of a synthesized image to the actual acquired image of the sky. Synthesis of the image is based on getting coor dinates of the bright {{stars in the sky}} from a database star cata logue. Telescope kinematics are used to convert these coordinates to image coordinates after correcting for major astronomical er rors as well as for perspective distortion. Two algorithms have been used for pattern matching: point pattern matching and normalized correlation matching. This process solved the prob lem of polar alignment of small and <b>movable</b> equatorially mounted <b>telescopes,</b> which was tedious and very time consuming.

The effort described in this paper is concerned with the development of a fine guidance sensor that employs a high-density charge-coupled imaging device for producing position information signals by using star fields. Multiple star position information produces three-axis position error signals that are used to update inertial reference gyros. The sensor employs advanced position interpolation algorithms to enhance field-of-view resolution and to correct for optical aberrations inherent in spatially chopped star images resulting from the <b>telescope's</b> <b>movable</b> secondary mirror.
