3000|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} a pre-harvest labor shortage on the post-harvest labor and <b>output</b> commodity <b>markets,</b> we consider an economy that comprises two input <b>markets</b> and two <b>output</b> <b>markets.</b> Both <b>output</b> <b>markets</b> draw employment from each input labor market. The input markets are the pre-harvest and post-harvest labor <b>markets.</b> The <b>output</b> <b>markets</b> we consider are the U.S. pome (apple) and prunus (peach) commodity markets. We choose these industries because of their large total value of fresh production—almost $ 3.2 billion in 2013 —and their geographic spread across the contiguous states— 32 for pome and 20 for prunus (USDA-NASS). Therefore, our findings will apply to multiple states as well as being illustrative of the problem to the greater agricultural sector. We also focus on these industries because of their similarities in production and delivery techniques. However, the two industries differ in size, spoilage rates, and in demand characteristics thus allowing us to observe differential impacts from a pre-harvest labor shortage that would be hidden if we considered the fruit sector in aggregate. 1 [...]...|$|R

Their result {{is based on}} the standard linear demand function for differentiated products introduced by Bowley (1924) where decreased product differentiation is interpreted as more competitive pressure. In this paper I show that at an aggregate level this interpretation is problematic because equilibrium effects are dominated by a demand reduction effect. A slight modifiâ€¦cation of the standard demand function eliminates this effect.

We do not have prices for these undesirable by products, since they are not marketed. Consequently, we calculate a series of Malmquist productivity indexes, which do not require price information. Our benchmark scenario is a conventional Malmquist productivity index based on <b>marketed</b> <b>outputs</b> and purchased inputs only. Our comparison scenarios consist of environmentally sensitive Malmquist productivity indexes that include indicators of risk to human health and to aquatic life from chronic exposure to pesticides.

Leisure hours and home hours are countercyclical in all countries, and home output is not highly correlated with <b>market</b> <b>output.</b> Home sector variables are generally less persistent than market variables, and cross-country correlations related to home production tend to be lower than those related to market production.
