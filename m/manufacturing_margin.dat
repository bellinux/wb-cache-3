40|$|The thesis {{evaluates the}} impact of {{just-in-time}} (JIT) strategies on retailers and cut make and trim (CMT) manufacturers within the apparel supply chain. A simulation approach is adopted based on a case study within the apparel sector, involving a major high street retailer and a manufacturing supply chain. A range of procurement strategies are subsequently modelled (including manufacturing resource planning [MRPII], safety stock [SS]. ship to forecast [STF] and JIT) within manufacturers of differing scale, and varying levels of dependence on primary customers (major high street retail chains) and impact on the variation of demand against forecast are evaluated against {{a wide range of}} parameters; these include: net margin, delivery, manufacturing profit and impact on a manufacturing company's ability to satisfy its secondary customers (smaller retail outlets with less buying power). Analytical methods are used to evaluate performance measures within three perspectives: Primary and Secondary customers, and Suppliers (manufacturers). A further perspective is evaluated combining all three views. Findings indicate that JIT retail strategies, notably where power of the retailer is high {{and the power of the}} manufacturer is low (compared to the raw material supplier), necessitate inventory holding and biased work scheduling at a supply level, leading to reduced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>margin</b> and loss of secondary customers; the latter imposes hidden costs in attracting new custom, which is not evaluated in this thesis. The thesis concludes by comparing the variation of parameters across each of the four perspectives, and proposes recommendations for conventional JIT policy, based upon optimising benefits for all parties within the supply chain.

This will either reveal a sound business proposition that the investor may become interested in investing capital in return for equity, or an embarrassing lack of preparation {{on the part of}} the contestant (such as the contestant's lack of knowledge of the business' profits or margins), the uncovering of troubling facts (such as insufficient sales or <b>manufacturing</b> <b>margins)</b> or other reasons which may play a factor in the investors consequently rejecting the investment (such as the investor asking for a larger equity stake in the business than the contestant wants to give up, the contestant's valuation on the business being too high compared to its overall profits, the product not having any proprietary value or the investor's belief that they cannot add value to the business). A contestant may give a counteroffer to the investors, if they feel their offer is not sufficient compared to the contestant's initial offer, which may also be subject to rejection if the investor feels the contestant asking for too high a monetary amount and/or an insufficiently low equity.|$|R

40|$|Digital VLSI IC {{design and}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>margins</b> {{continue}} to increase in light of process variability, circuit reliability and wide operating conditions. In spite of the enhancements from the manufacturing and design sides, there are still substantial margins in terms of manufacturing yield, circuit area and power, and design turn-around-time due to the conservatisms {{in the design and}} <b>manufacturing</b> flows. These <b>margins</b> are extremely costly when the benefits from developing the next technology node are only approximately 20 % in circuit performance, power and density. To reduce the margins, accurate modeling and assessment of the impacts of variability and reliability are essential. Meanwhile, innovative manufacturing and design techniques must be developed based on comprehensive understanding of the benefits and costs of such new measures. This thesis presents techniques to mitigate variability and reliability margins which can be grouped into three main thrusts : (1) design for manufacturability and reliability, (2) signoff condition optimization, and (3) design-aware manufacturing optimization. In the design for manufacturability and variability thrust, this thesis presents two performance sensor designs for adaptive voltage scaling, which can be used to mitigate the impact of process variations. To reduce the reliability margins for time-dependent dielectric breakdown, this thesis presents a layout optimization technique and a design- dependent reliability analysis framework. In the signoff condition optimization thrust, this thesis presents analyses on the design overheads due to suboptimal signoff conditions in (i) circuit operating voltage and performance, (ii) circuit aging timing model, and (iii) wire parasitic resistance and capacitance models. Meanwhile, the tradeoffs between design quality and signoff margins, and methods to optimize signoff conditions are also included. In the design-aware manufacturing optimization thrust, this thesis presents three distinct techniques to improve manufacturing yield by considering the impact of manufacturing variations on design's timing and leakage power. First, the electrical process window provides a more accurate method to quantify the impact of lithography variability on circuit performance and leakage. Second, design-dependent monitoring provides a cost-effective way to estimate circuit parametric yield based on test-structures available {{in the early stages of}} a manufacturing flow. Finally, analysis on the impact of overlay error in double patterning lithography provides guidelines to reduce circuit performance variatio...|$|R
40|$|Registered in 2001, {{tenofovir}} disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has {{quickly become}} {{a mainstay of}} first line regimens {{for the treatment of}} HIV. Initially only available in developed countries at a cost of US$ 5 000 per person per year (ppy), Gilead’s Access Programme (GAP) has extended the use of the product to 2. 4 million patients in low and middle income countries. The programme has two components: distribution of the branded product at reduced prices and licensing partnerships with generic manufacturers. The licensing partnerships now supply 75 % of the market by volume, at a treatment cost of US$ 57 ppy (1 % of the branded cost). From Gilead’s perspective, GAP must be considered a huge success. It has enabled the company to maintain high prices in developed countries whilst reducing its input costs and deflecting criticism of its failure to provide essential medicines for the poor, hence risking the possibility of compulsory licensing. Over the period 2001 to 2011, TDF in its various forms has generated for Gilead more than US$ 31 billion revenue at a gross margin of 80 %, equivalent to a gross profit of US$ 25 billion. Analysis of the TDF value chain, from preparation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to sale of the formulated product, shows that <b>manufacturing</b> <b>margins</b> are highly skewed in favour of the originator, with the latter’s profit being US$ 3. 2 billion vs. US$ 4 million for API manufacturers and US$ 39 million for formulators (2011). The data argues for a more rational approach to drug pricing including possible regulation in developed countries and more sustainable margins for the generic producers. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determination of}} UK <b>manufacturing</b> industry profit <b>margins</b> using a panel of data from 1980 to 1991. In particular, we test whether industry concentration is important in shaping margins. Our results indicate that for both pooled cross-section data and for fixed effects models there is a robust positive correlation between industry margins and market concentration. However, the formulation of the margin matters for establishing this association. For those margins where a net revenue measure {{is used in the}} denominator of the margin then we are able to isolate the predicted relationship. However, for those margins that use gross revenue in the denominator the matter is more complex. Without controlling for a measure of material costs in the estimating equations then a simple concentration effect cannot be isolated...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} of the NBSR from HEU to LEU fuel is challenging due to reactivity constraints {{and the need}} to maintain an uninterrupted science program, the mission of the NBSR. The transition cannot occur with a full change of HEU to LEU fuel elements since the excess reactivity would be large enough that the NBSR would violate the technical specification for shutdown <b>margin.</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> LEU fuel elements to represent irradiated fuel elements would be cost prohibitive since 26 one-of-a-kind fuel elements would need to be manufactured.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Mexican <b>manufacturing</b> price cost <b>margins</b> (PCMs) for the period 1994 - 2003. Taking into account the sensitivity of each industry to the speed of the tariff reductions under NAFTA, the results show that PCMs immediately decreased once the second round of trade liberalization in Mexico had commenced in 1994. However, in subsequent years, no clear pattern emerges for these PCMs. Additionally, the paper accounts for the sensitivity of each industry to the initial level of its tariff and presents evidence showing that while NAFTA had an effect on the PCMs of the group of industries that liberalized in 10 years, no robust effect was found for the group of industries that liberalized in 5 years. The results on the group of industries that liberalized in 10 years suggest that NAFTA sharpened competition and exerted market discipline by forcing firms with market power to set prices closer to marginal costs. The findings on the group of industries that liberalized in 5 years suggest that additional factors may be also playing a role in the containment of their market power...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the impact of}} NAFTA on the Mexican economy primarily {{in relation to the}} perfomlance of the automobile indus. try (period 1993 - 2002), its impact on manuf; 1 cturing price cost margins (period 1994 - 2001) and its effect on inter-industry wage differentials (1994 - 2004). The first chapter describes Mexico's path to liberalization focusing on the trends of foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade flows in the post-NAFTA period. The second chapter studies the impact of trade on productivity and profitability of the Mexican automobile industry. The third chapter analyzes the dynamics of <b>manufacturing</b> price cost <b>margins</b> in the post-NAFTA period. The fourth chapter analyzes the effect of trade and FDI on inter-industry wage differentials. The main results of this thesis are: 1) productivity in the Mexican automobile industry did increase after NAFTA but this was due to the exiting of the least efficient firms from the industry. Furthermore, profitability in this industry decrease~ during the post NAFTA period. 2) NAFTA disciplined the Mexican manufacturing sector in the sense that price cost margins decreased gradually in the period under study. 3) Trade and FDI liberalization led to an increase in inter-industry wage differentials in the post NAFTA period.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{introduces}} a chipset to simplify receiver design and puts forth a design example based on GSM {{but can be}} extended to many open or closed air interface. Advances in analog converter technology now allow IF sampling which can greatly simplify receiver design. Advances in digital integrated circuits also advance {{the state of the}} art in terms of digital tuning and filtering. Together these two chips can replace many of the cumbersome stages of a traditional analog receiver with predictable and reliable performance. The superheterodyne receiver is still a workhorse in receiver technology. It has served its duty faithfully for many years now. However new technologies in receiver component designs are offering to extend the possibilities into the digital age. A typical receiver design may consist of two or three down conversions to provide the sensitivity and selectivity required of the individual receiver. With each down conversion, a local oscillator, mixer and filter are required. Each additional stage adds complexity, cost and difficulty of manufacture. sacrificing performance? Perhaps the real question is can performance be enhanced. One solution is to digitize the analog signals and do the processing in a DSP. Once in the digital domain, many creative and proprietary processes can take place to enhance and add value, while eliminating many of the manufacturing problems (alignment and component yield) that often increase the cost of <b>manufacturing</b> and reduce <b>margins.</b> Already, it is common practice to use an analog-todigital converter to form the detector and a DSP (digital signal processor) to process the data. However, this does not reduce the cost or complexity of the design (to digitize the baseband), it simply adds flexibility. What is needed is an analog to digital converter that can digitize closer to the antenna. Sampling at the antenna is not realistic since some amount of band select and filtering must occur prior to the ADC to minimize adjacent channel issues. However, sampling at the first IF is practical...|$|R
