40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the {{development}} of control systems for nano- positioning actuators using <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>Magnetostrictive</b> <b>materials</b> have large strokes and fast responses. However, they are less commonly used than other smart materials such as piezoceramics due to their highly nonlinear and hysteretic behaviour. It is necessary to arrive at an accurate model which can predict the material response at any magnetic field and load condition. Furthermore, due to the nonlinearity of the material, a closed-loop feedback system with a stabilizing controller is needed. Different hysteresis models for <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>materials</b> are implemented and compared. Since load-dependence {{is one of the main}} features of hysteresis for <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>materials,</b> load-dependent models are studied. An existing load- dependent model is implemented and compared with a new load-dependent hysteresis model which is developed by energy considerations. Passivity of the magnetostrictive system was shown using a physical argument. The results are used to develop a stabilizing controller. Using the properties of the Preisach model, an alternative approach for controller design is proposed. Tracking properties and stability of the controllers were shown. An experimental setup has been developed for data collection and model and controller evaluation...|$|R

30|$|Full field PST has the {{potential}} {{as a tool for}} the nondestructive evaluation of the microstructure of <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>materials.</b> The PST signal from the infrared measurements from our investigations reveals a magnetocaloric effect in Terfenol-D and magnetic interactions with microstructural defects. The observed PST variations were consistent with the expectation for the polycrystalline material used in this study. The PST signal was sensitive to the sample geometry which causes magnetic boundary effects and potentially intensifying magnetic field intensity leading to strong PST signal fluctuations near notches and edges. The proposed full-field technique is adequately sensitive for detection of material inhomogeneity or design verification of a nano-or microstructured magnetostrictive transducers or actuators. Although there are little to no information on data pertaining to the MCE effect of Terfenol-D, the proposed method provides insight for the MCE effect in <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>materials,</b> besides demonstrating ability in detecting geometry or <b>material</b> variability in <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>materials</b> and devices. In addition to absence of standard methods for characterizing properties of <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>materials,</b> it is a possibility that previously reported variability in magnetostrictive properties is from production methods of these polycrystalline materials that do not yield consistent properties. The ratios of rare earth metals in the alloy may not be uniformly distributed. However, geometrical effects and magnetocaloric effects are also involved as well. Future research will need to address how to decouple the thermal response to isolate the effects from the mechanical stresses between crystals produced by the magnetostriction and the magnetocaloric effect due to alignment of magnetic moments, both of which contribute to the observed thermal changes. Separating the two factors contributing to the temperature changes can allow the ability to understand the relative contribution of each component. This can perhaps be accomplished by measuring the strain simultaneously using a full-field method such as digital image correlation to correlate the regions of high strain with the temperature values measured. Understanding these sources of variability on the magnetostrictive response can lead to more accurate property characterizations and more precise engineering of magnetostrictive actuators and sensors.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{theoretical}} framework {{for analysis of}} indentation of magnetostrictives, based upon a linear material response model, is developed.
