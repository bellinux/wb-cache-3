Miller was assured by other CBS executives that Aubrey's silence meant things were fine– Kempton quoted a CBS producer telling Miller [...] "this {{has nothing to do with}} a good script or a bad script. It has to do with pleasing one man, Jim Aubrey. Don't ever forget it"– and Miller later learned of efforts by Aubrey to force him out. (A pilot for the show, known as Calhoun and County Agent, to star Jackie Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck, was shot and put on the fall schedule, but the series was canceled before it ever aired.) Miller quoted an independent producer: [...] "Aubrey's the most important man in television, in the history of television, <b>maybe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of entertainment.
