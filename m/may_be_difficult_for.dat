25|$|In the 1960s the German {{railways}} {{wanted to}} increase the speeds {{of some of their}} railway lines. One issue in doing so is signalling. German signals are placed too close to allow high-speed trains to stop between them, and signals <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> train drivers to see at high speeds.|$|E
25|$|The dialect groups differ {{mostly in}} phonology, vocabulary, and tonal inflection. Syntactic {{differences}} are minor. Central Slovak {{forms the basis}} of the present-day standard language.

25|$|One {{alternative}} method involves displaying {{to the user}} a simple mathematical equation and requiring the user to enter the solution as verification. Although these are much easier to defeat using software, they are suitable for scenarios where graphical imagery is not appropriate, and they provide a much higher level of accessibility for blind users than the image-based CAPTCHAs.

25|$|As well as {{the usual}} yellow and deep red colourings, many coccinellid species are mostly, or entirely, black, dark grey, gray, or brown, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> non-entomologists to {{recognise}} as coccinellids at all. Conversely, non-entomologists might easily mistake many other small beetles for coccinellids. For example, the tortoise beetles, like the ladybird beetles, look similar because they are shaped {{so that they can}} cling to a flat surface so closely that ants and many other enemies cannot grip them.|$|E
25|$|There {{is always}} a judge sitting at C, {{although}} for upper-level competition, there can be up to seven judges at different places around the arena— at C, E, B, K, F, M, and H— which allows the horse {{to be seen in}} each movement from all angles. This helps prevent certain faults from going unnoticed, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a judge to see from only one area of the arena.

25|$|Toastmasters has {{developed}} a series of procedures and materials for training its members and officers in basic leadership skills. Many districts hold training sessions for officers, known as Toastmasters Leadership Institute (originally called Toastmasters University), twice a year for club officers and for any other members who wish to attend. Divisions within districts are also encouraged to run smaller training sessions for club officers, especially in larger districts where it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> all club officers to attend a TLI session. Toastmasters conferences, also twice a year in each district, provide other opportunities to learn or present on leadership skills.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{children}} may be quite large at birth and appear normal but may have inguinal (in the groin) or umbilical (where the umbilical cord passes through the abdomen) hernias. Growth in height may be faster than normal but begins to slow {{before the end of}} the first year and often ends around age 3. Many children develop a short body trunk and a maximum stature of less than 4 feet. Distinct facial features (including flat face, depressed nasal bridge, and bulging forehead) become more evident in the second year. By age 2, the ribs have widened and are oar-shaped. The liver, spleen, and heart are often enlarged. Children may experience noisy breathing and recurring upper respiratory tract and ear infections. Feeding <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> some children, and many experience periodic bowel problems. Children with Hurler syndrome often die before age 10 from obstructive airway disease, respiratory infections, and cardiac complications.|$|E
500|$|Earnings {{management}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> {{individual investors}} to detect {{due to the}} complexity of accounting rules, although accounting researchers have proposed several methods. For example, research has shown that firms with large accruals and weak governance structures {{are more likely to be}} engaging in earnings management. [...] More recent research suggested that linguistics-based methods can detect financial manipulation, for example studies in 2012 found that whether a subsequent irregularity or deceptive restatement occurred is related to the linguistics used by top management in earnings conference calls.|$|E

500|$|Finally, {{symmetrical}} positions <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> {{the white}} player for psychological reasons. Watson writes {{that anyone who}} tries the Exchange French, [...] "even if he thinks he is playing for a win, assume a psychological burden. White has already ceded {{the advantage of the}} first move, and knows it, whereas Black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative." [...] Two famous examples of White losses in the Exchange French are M. Gurevich–Short and Tatai–Korchnoi. In M. Gurevich–Short, a game between two of the world's leading players, White needed only a draw to qualify for the Candidates Matches, while Black needed to win. Gurevich played passively and was outplayed by Short, who achieved the necessary win, qualified for the Candidates, and ultimately went on to challenge Kasparov for the World Championship. In Tatai–Korchnoi, the Italian IM fell victim to Korchnoi's whirlwind mating attack, losing in just 14 moves.|$|E
500|$|Graded by {{a medical}} board as only being fit for {{administrative}} duties, Kippenberger still harboured hopes {{of returning to}} the 2nd Division. However, he was named to replace Brigadier James Hargest, {{who had been killed}} in France in August, as commander of the New Zealand Reception Group. This organisation had been formed to arrange accommodation as well as social and medical services for New Zealand military personnel who were expected to be released from prisoner of war camps in Germany when the war ended. These personnel were to be evacuated to England to await repatriation to New Zealand. It was recognised that transition from the harsh life as a captive to normal life <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> some, and the Reception Group provided much needed support for these individuals. [...] He threw himself into his new role, setting up facilities and accommodation centres around Dover. The first former prisoners of war began arriving in late March 1945, and Kippenberger {{made it a point to}} personally meet with each group of arrivals. By the following October, the overwhelming majority of released personnel had been returned to New Zealand, negating the need for the Reception Group.|$|E

When the patient is less affected by the wicked ch'i, he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured.
