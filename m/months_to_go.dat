5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2014 and took {{fourteen}} <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into full production. The concept was contributed by Keiji Inafune, {{who wished to}} convey the idea of surviving in a world verging on human extinction. The developers first {{came up with the}} robots, whose anatomical design problems would later be solved by the insertion of cores – essentially robot souls – to explain their propulsion. Writer Joseph Staten resolved to create a simple story to enhance an emotional backdrop more grounded in complexity.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the brand}} {{extension}} separated both parties, The Rock and Hollywood Hogan feuded with Kevin Nash and Scott Hall. On the final SmackDown! before the brand extension, {{the team of}} Rock, Hogan and Kane defeated Nash, Hall and new nWo member X-Pac in a six-man tag match. The Rock left shortly after the WWF draft for three <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on a media tour to promote his movie, The Scorpion King.|$|E

25|$|By March 2012, Quintel was {{directing}} {{a crew of}} about 35 to develop each episode of Regular Show, which takes about nine <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> from idea to final product. Quintel has most recently worked for Cartoon Network Studios in Burbank, California developing episodes for Regular Show and provided his real voice to the 23-year-old blue jay Regular Show character Mordecai. In commenting on his voice acting, Quintel noted how he has an easy-going nature and never yells in real life, {{so he had to}} learn how to yell as the Mordecai character.|$|E
500|$|He had {{shrapnel}} wounds {{from his}} aircraft exploding, a ripped finger, and four compressed vertebra {{from the force}} of the ejection. Hidden in a clump of trees in his hole, surrounded by North Vietnamese less than [...] away, Hambleton decided that with only nine <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> until his retirement, he was going to survive and return home.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, the Red Sox, led by Jim Rice, Carl Yastrzemski, Fred Lynn and catcher Carlton Fisk, {{and managed}} by future Yankee coach Don Zimmer, were looking {{good for the}} World Series (a.k.a. [...] "Fall Classic") {{for the second time}} in the decade. They led the Yankees in the standings by 14 games in mid-July, with less than three <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in the regular season. The Yankees turned their season around just as the Red Sox seemed to collapse. By September 7, the Yankees had whittled down the 14-game deficit to only four games, just in time for a four-game series at Fenway Park in Boston. The Yankees won all four games in the series by a {{combined}} score of 42–9. This series became known as the [...] "Boston Massacre". On September 16, the Yankees held a -game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 12 of their next 14 games (and their last eight in a row) to overcome that deficit and finish in a first-place tie with the Yankees. A one-game playoff was scheduled in Boston to determine who would win the AL East pennant for 1978.|$|E
50|$|With {{just over}} a <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> until the vote, a 72-page book “The Wee Blue Book”, written by Campbell, was released. Within a month, the digital edition had been {{downloaded}} 550,000 times, in addition to 300,000 printed copies being distributed across Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|A three-game {{sweep of}} the St. Louis Cardinals to end July {{effectively}} pushed the Redbirds out of the pennant chase, and Danny Jackson's 12-0 rout of Cincinnati on August 29 left the Cards 10 games out and the Expos [...] out with one <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b>|$|R
50|$|Over 500,000 {{immigrants}} {{stayed in}} the UK for up <b>to</b> six <b>months</b> before moving onto America, with 4,000 leaving the docks every <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the new world. Whilst most only stayed in Southampton as a stopgap, 150,000 immigrants remained and settled throughout the UK, {{and many of them}} must have remained in Southampton.|$|R
500|$|Practical {{differences}} between the candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if Democrats held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed {{since the end of}} the war, and Union generals at the head of both tickets, the bloody shirt was of diminishing value in exciting the voters. With a few <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the election, the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the tariff. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a [...] "tariff for revenue only", Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock presidency would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said, [...] "The tariff question is a local question." [...] The ploy proved effective in uniting the North behind Garfield. In the end, fewer than two thousand votes, of the more than 9.2 million popular votes cast, separated the two candidates, but in the Electoral College Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155.|$|E
2500|$|Obama's {{expected}} {{opponent in}} the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004. In August 2004, with less than three <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before Election Day, Alan Keyes accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination to replace Ryan. A long time resident of Maryland, Keyes established legal residency in Illinois with the nomination.|$|E
2500|$|Clooney {{was raised}} a strict Roman Catholic, but said in 2006 {{that he does}} not know if he {{believes}} in Heaven, or even God. He has said, [...] "Yes, we were Catholic, big-time, whole family, whole group." [...] He began his education at the Blessed Sacrament School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. He attended St. Michael's School in Columbus, Ohio; then Western Row Elementary School (a public school) in Mason, Ohio, from 1968 to 1974; and St. Susanna School in Mason, where he served as an altar boy. The Clooneys moved back to Kentucky when George was midway through the seventh grade. In middle school, Clooney developed Bell's palsy, a condition that partially paralyzes the face. The malady went away within a year. In an interview with Larry King, he stated that [...] "yes, it goes away. It takes about nine <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away. It was the first year of high school, which was a bad time for having half your face paralyzed." [...] He also described one positive outcome of the condition: [...] "It's probably a great thing that it happened to me because it forced me to engage in a series of making fun of myself. And I think that's an important part of being famous. The practical jokes have to be aimed at you." ...|$|E

60|$|And it {{was only}} to wander still. Mantua he quitted {{in less than two}} <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Rome, in spite of the advice of his best friends. He vindicated the {{proceeding}} by a hope of obtaining some permanent settlement from the Pope. He took Loretto by the way, to refresh himself with devotion; arrived in a transport at Rome; got nothing from the Pope (the hard-minded Sixtus the Fifth); and in the spring of the next year, in the triple hope of again embracing his sister, and recovering the dowry of his mother and the confiscated property of his father, he proceeded to Naples.|$|E
60|$|He {{happened}} to be reading a book many hundreds of years old, which told of remedies {{for all kinds of}} diseases. Most of them, he knew, were merely invented by old women, who sought to prove themselves wiser than other people; but at length he came to something which caused him to sit up straight in his chair, and made his eyes brighten. This was the description of a balsam--which would cure every kind of sore or wound--distilled from a plant only to be found in a country so distant that it would take a man on foot two <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and come back again.|$|E

40|$|With {{less than}} a <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the European Parliament (EP) elections, {{campaign}}ing has barely begun in the Netherlands. Whether the campaign will address concrete EU policies or {{the future of the}} European Union remains to be seen, but this author argues that the outcomes will probably have less to with the parties’ stance on Europe than with the unpopularity of the incumbent parties and the ‘second order’ character of EP elections...|$|R
50|$|The first EliteXC event ("Destiny") was {{announced}} unnamed on November 13th, 2006. The fight card was finalized {{with less than}} one <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the debut event.

The show also featured the first female MMA event aired live on television between Gina Carano and Julie Kedzie.|$|R
5000|$|According to Spinks's lawyers, {{following}} Lewis's death Johnson {{and attorney}} Leonard Williams stopped the payments without telling him, {{which in turn}} caused Spinks' health insurance to lapse and bills totaling up <b>to</b> $50,000 a <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> unpaid.

50|$|The 1996 Hong Kong parody film Bodyguards of Last Governor, {{presents}} 'Christ Pattern' as the Governor of Hong Kong. In {{addition to}} the name, Pattern appears to be based heavily on Patten, matching his appearance, political affiliation (Conservative) and family (a wife and two daughters with him in Hong Kong). His role however is minor as the film depicts him being replaced with one <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the Handover. He is portrayed by Noel Lester Rands.|$|R

5000|$|By the 1880s Pope Leo XIII {{could see}} that this simple, {{profound}} way of life was spreading so he announced prayer intentions for every <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with the Daily Offering.

These intentions are prayed specifically for those who make a commitment to spreading the Gospel around the world. Today, the Pope still announces two monthly intentions.|$|R
