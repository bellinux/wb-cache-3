For example, a vertical <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna</b> requires a ground plane that often consists of an interconnected network of wires running radially away {{from the base of}} the antenna for a distance about equal to the height of the antenna. Sometimes a counterpoise is used as a ground plane, supported above the ground.|$|E
500|$|The inverted-L antenna is a <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna</b> {{bent over}} to run {{parallel}} to the ground plane. [...] It has the advantage of compactness and a shorter length than the λ/4 monopole, but the disadvantage of a very low impedance, typically just a few ohms. [...] The inverted-F antenna combines the advantages of both these antennae; it has the compactness of the inverted-L and the impedance matching capability of the F-type.|$|E

500|$|The inverted-F antenna is an {{evolution}} of the basic quarter-wave <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna.</b> [...] The wire F-type antenna was invented in the 1940s. [...] In this antenna the feed is connected to an intermediate point {{along the length of}} the antenna instead of to the base. [...] The base is connected to ground. [...] The advantage of doing this is that the input impedance of the antenna is dependent on the distance of the feed point from the grounded end. [...] The portion of the antenna between the feedpoint and the ground plane is essentially behaving as a short-circuit stub. [...] Thus, the designer can match the antenna to the system impedance by setting the position of the feed point (RF systems commonly have a system impedance of 50 Ω whereas a λ/4 monopole has an impedance of 36.5 Ω).|$|E

2500|$|A {{breakthrough}} {{came that}} summer when Marconi found that much greater range {{could be achieved}} after he raised {{the height of his}} antenna and, borrowing from a technique used in wired telegraphy, grounding his transmitter and receiver. With these improvements the system was capable of transmitting signals up to [...] and over hills. The <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna</b> reduced the frequency of the waves compared to the dipole antennas used by Hertz, and radiated vertically polarized radio waves which could travel longer distances. By this point, he concluded that a device could become capable of spanning greater distances, with additional funding and research, and would prove valuable both commercially and militarily. Marconi's experimental apparatus proved to be the first engineering-complete, commercially successful radio transmission system.|$|E
2500|$|On May 4, 2005, Mars Express {{deployed}} {{the first}} of its two 20-metre-long radar booms for its MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) experiment. [...] At first the boom did not lock fully into place; however, exposing it to sunlight for a few minutes on May 10 fixed the glitch. [...] The second 20 m boom was successfully deployed on June 14. [...] Both 20 m booms were needed to create a 40 m dipole antenna for MARSIS to work; a less crucial 7-meter-long <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna</b> was deployed on June 17. [...] The radar booms were originally scheduled to be deployed in April 2004, but this was delayed out of fear that the deployment could damage the spacecraft through a whiplash effect. Due to the delay it was decided to split the four-week commissioning phase in two parts, with two weeks running up to July 4 and another two weeks in December 2005.|$|E
2500|$|In {{radio and}} {{telecommunications}} a dipole antenna or doublet is {{the simplest and}} most widely used class of antenna. [...] The dipole is any one of a class of antennas producing a radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary electric dipole with a radiating structure supporting a line current so energized that the current has only one node at each end. [...] A dipole antenna commonly consists of two identical conductive elements such as metal wires or rods, which are usually bilaterally symmetrical. [...] The driving current from the transmitter is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is taken, between {{the two halves of}} the antenna. [...] Each side of the feedline to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the conductors. [...] This contrasts with a <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna,</b> which consists of a single rod or conductor [...] with one side of the feedline connected to it, and the other side connected to some type of ground. [...] A common example of a dipole is the [...] "rabbit ears" [...] television antenna found on broadcast television sets.|$|E

Several different antennas have been designed and built such as <b>monopole</b> <b>antennas,</b> patch antenna, loop antenna, patch and patch array antennas. These antennas were designed for the operation in the unlicensed ISM band, 2. 45 GHz. The antennas then were tested in the on body environment. The performance of the antenna combinations are determined by measuring the path gain between two on-body paths {{for a range of}} body postures. Measurement results show that the combination of <b>monopole</b> <b>antennas</b> performs best in most of the measurement cases compared to other combinations.

50|$|A <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna</b> can {{be thought}} of as a dipole antenna where one end of the dipole antenna now becomes the ground plane for said <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna.</b> By this line of {{conceptual}} thinking, one can easily reach the conclusion that the radiation emanating from a <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna</b> exists in half the space of similar dipole antenna. Therefore, the maximum gain is twice that, or an addition 3 dB, of the maximum gain of typical dipole. Hence the nominal value of maximum for a <b>monopole</b> <b>antenna</b> is about 5.15dBi.|$|E

40|$|<b>Monopole</b> <b>antennas</b> {{have several}} {{advantages}} {{but for their}} narrow bandwidth. Broadband planar <b>monopole</b> <b>antennas</b> have all {{the advantages of the}} monopole in terms of their cost, and ease of fabrication besides, yielding very large bandwidths. For many applications large bandwidth is required. Recently, many techniques to tailor and optimize the impedance BW of these antennas have been investigated. These include the use of bevels, slots and shorting posts. The radiation performance is also shown to be acceptable over a wide range of frequency. Various planar configurations such as circular, triangular, rectangular and annular ring monopoles have been studied. Combinations of shorting pin and optimization of the feed point location can achieve very compact configurations. Also these antennas can provide band-notching characteristics. These antennas have been reported to provide multi band characteristics too. More recently, it has been shown that, although the square monopole (SM) provides smaller BW than the circular monopole (CM), its radiation pattern suffers less degradation within the impedance BW. It has been observed that printed rectangular <b>monopole</b> <b>antennas</b> are small in size and simple in design and fabrication because of high operating frequency but its performance is very good for ISM band and multiband applications...|$|R
