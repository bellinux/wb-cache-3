40|$|Syftet med studien var att undersöka kommunsjuksköterskan omvårdnadsdokumentation om bensår i hemsjukvård. Som metod valdes journalgranskning. Resultatet visade att omvårdnadsdokumentationen brister på många sätt. Background: In Sweden, {{approximately}} 50 000 people {{suffers from}} slow-healing leg ulcers. The number of <b>municipal</b> <b>registered</b> nurses ́ has decreased in recent years. The <b>municipal</b> <b>registered</b> nurses ́ often hold {{function as an}} advisory consultant for the nursing staff and without participating in nursing care. This documentation is based on second-hand information from the nursing staff. Purpose: The aim was to investigate how <b>municipal</b> <b>registered</b> nurse care documents about leg ulcers in patients in home care practice. Method: An audit of patient journals was chosen to investigate how <b>municipal</b> <b>registered</b> nurse ́ care documents about leg ulcers in patients in home care practice. Results: The results are presented in five themes: contact cause, health and medical history, skin functions alternatively skin / tissue, skin action alternatively action / prescription skin / tissue and Ulcer case record. Beneath these themes the assessment of documentation was into incomplete, partially complete and complete. The result shows that the <b>municipal</b> <b>registered</b> nurse often documents in chronological order and not applying to the nursing process. The results also showed that the old documentation was not completed in the journal, which meant {{that it was difficult}} to follow a course of treatment. Discussion: The result shows that documentation in home care failures in many ways. <b>Municipal</b> <b>registered</b> nurse works as a consultant and is not involved in daily care. The documentation is based on second-hand information from the nursing staff and resulting in the documentation of leg ulcers is poor. Patient journals documentation was divided into different keyword, which means that it was difficult to follow the nursing process...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{municipal}} revolutions took place, and a {{large number}} of constitutional experiments were tried all over the country from the 13th century onward. Schemes which directed a gradual co-optation, two to choose four, these six to choose more, and so in widening circles from a centre of officialdom, found much favour throughout the Middle Ages. A plan, like the London plan, of two companies, alderman and council, was widely favoured in the 14th century, perhaps in imitation of the Houses of Lords and Commons. The mayor was sometimes styled the [...] "sovereign" [...] and was given many prerogatives. Great respect was paid to the [...] "ancients," [...] those, namely, who had already held municipal office. Not till the 15th century were orderly arrangements for counting [...] "voices" [...] arrived at in a few of the most highly developed towns, and these were used only in the small assemblies of the governingbody, not in the large electoral assemblies of the people. In London in the 13th century there was aregular system for the admission of new members to the borough [...] "franchise," [...] which was at first regarded not as conferring any form of suffrage but as a means to secure a privileged position in the borough court and in the trade of the borough. Admission could be obtained by inheritance, by purchase or gift, in some places by marriage, and in London, at least from 1275, by a <b>municipal</b> <b>register</b> of apprenticeship. The new freeman in return for his privileges was bound to share with the other burgesses all the burdens of taxation, control, &c., which fell upon burgesses. Personal service was not always necessary, and in some towns there were many non- resident burgesses. When in later times admission to this freedom came to be used as means to secure the parliamentary franchise, the freedom of the borough was freely sold and given.|$|E
