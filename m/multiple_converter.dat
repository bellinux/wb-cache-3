40|$|Electrical power {{converter}} subsystems are placed between an ac-mains bus and a load {{in order to}} condition the power being transferred, to protect the load and the ac source, and to provide uninterruptible power supply (UPS) features. One method of providing the required interface in, low to medium power applications (1. 0 to 150 kVA), is to connect <b>multiple</b> <b>converter</b> modules in parallel. This approach has the advantages of increased reliability, due to the redundancy of the system, and flexibility, since modules can be added or removed as needed. The successful performance of a parallel-connected system depends on (i) the modularity of the individual converter units, (ii) their response characteristics, and (iii) {{the quality of the}} power they produce. A single-phase converter module and a parallel connection circuit is proposed that meets these three objectives by using a fast control circuit for each converter, insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), a high switching frequency (10 kHz to 20 kHz), and a frequency modulated (FM) communication scheme.

40|$|Electrosurgery is used {{in modern}} {{surgical}} practice to cause various desirable clinical effects by invoking I 2 R heating in tissue. The ability to achieve a consistent clinical result is predicated {{on the ability of}} the electrosurgical instrument to deliver a well-regulated constant output power, capable of quickly responding to changes in tissue impedance. Yet, electrosurgical devices available today suffer from very poor transient output power regulation, with potential for improvement limited by inherent restrictions in the chosen system architectures. This thesis presents a revolutionary new approach to the design of electrosurgical power supplies by employing current-programmed mode (“CPM”) control strategies to inherently achieve the desired output characteristic: a constant power AC source with maximum voltage and current limits and with near-deadbeat regulation. CPM control of a full-bridge boost inverter and nonlinear carrier-control of a buck converter are presented as new methods of producing constant power source AC outputs. Analysis and small-signal models contained herein demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed constant power control schemes, showing that major sources of non-idealities include peak-to-average error, artificial ramp-induced error, and transient error. The nonlinear carrier controlled buck power source exhibits a transient error dependent {{on the size of the}} inductor, while the CPM controlled boost power source transient error is independent of the inductor size. A prototype ESG employing CPM control generates the ideal output characteristic and achieves near-deadbeat regulation of output power. Maximum voltage- and current-limits are invoked equally quickly. The standard deviation in per-cycle output power during arc cutting is less than 2 %, compared to greater than 25 % in the prior art. Histological analysis of ex vivo tissue samples shows a marked decrease in collateral tissue damage, proving a previously unknown correlation between high-speed output power regulation and thermally-induced tissue necrosis. Simultaneous control of <b>multiple</b> <b>converter</b> stages in the prototype demonstrates the ability to achieve high peak output voltages with low average power using a continuous output carrier: a significant simplification over the prior art...|$|E
40|$|Current-mode {{control is}} a {{commonly}} adopted method of regulation for pulse-width modulated (PWM) dc-dc power converters in industry, but is not well understood. The advantages of current-mode control over the voltage-mode control include inherent overload and short circuit protection, faster response, line-noise rejection, and <b>multiple</b> <b>converter</b> paralleling. Current-mode controlled system consists of (1) an inner-current loop and (2) an outer-voltage loop, which sets the reference voltage to the inner loop. To ensure stable operation of the multi-loop converter, all the sequential loops in the circuit should be stable with sufficient degree of stability. The research in this dissertation {{is focused on the}} relative stability of the inner-current loop in peak current-mode (PCM) controlled PWM dc-dc converters operating in CCM. The operating principle of peak current-mode control is presented. The inner-current loop dynamics of a peak current-mode controlled dc-dc converter is investigated using perturbation theory. Considering its mixed-signal (analog and digital) behavior, the current loop is modeled using sample-and-hold theory. Taking the discrete nature of the inner-current loop into account, a closed-loop transfer function for the current loop is derived in z-domain and an equivalent-hold approximation is used to derive an approximate closed-loop transfer function in the continuous s-domain using modified Pad´e approximation. A general expression for the loop gain of the inner-loop, independent of the converter topology, is derived. Using the loop gain, a measure of relative stability of the inner loop is developed. Expressions for amount of slope compensation required at maximum duty cycle, for the inner loop to be marginally stable and to achieve a specified margin of stability, are derived. Also, expressions for maximum duty cycle at a given amount of slope compensation, for the inner loop to be marginally stable and to obtain a specified margin of stability, are derived. The control current expressions for the inner loop of peak current-mode controlled converters without and with slope compensation are derived. A procedure to design the inner-current loop is developed. Saber Sketch simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the presented theory. The dynamic behavior of the inner-current loop of peak current-mode controlled PWM dc-dc buck converter operating in CCM is analyzed. The critical path power stage transfer functions, the relevant inner-current loop transfer functions, and the control-to-output transfer function of peak current-mode controlled PWM dc-dc buck converter operating in CCM are derived. The presented model is validated using experimental Bode plots...|$|E

This thesis addresses fundamental issues in the architectural design and hardware implementation of a digital controller for such multi-rail systems. A review of conventional digital controllers indicates that they are not specifically optimised for multi-rail applications. In some cases existing digital signal processors are used, which have superfluous features to those required for the simple control task. In other cases fixed-algorithm controllers are used, which are unsuitable for applications having <b>multiple</b> <b>converters</b> with individual control algorithm requirements. A new digital signal processor core that overcomes the shortcomings of existing controllers has thus been designed, implemented and evaluated. The requirements of computational, memory and program control elements have been analysed in relation to the algorithms to be executed and the power converter system to be controlled, where linear compensators for multi-rail DC-DC converter systems are considered in particular. This analysis has led to the design of an instruction set and a corresponding dual-datapath architecture. The proposed processor has been implemented using an FPGA and verified in a closed-loop power converter system.
