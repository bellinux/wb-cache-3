40|$|The {{objective}} {{in this study}} was to evaluate the effects of replacing concentrate by flor-de-seda hay under the levels of 0; 15; 30; 45 and 60 % on the fatty acids profile of goat milk. Five multiparus goats of the alpine origin were used with 106 days on lactation {{at the beginning of the}} trial, being milked twice daily (06 : 00 and 16 : 00 hs). The goats were allotted into a 5 x 5 Latin Square, consisted of five periods of 13 days which, in which the first 10 days were for adaptation of the animals to the new diet and the other three days used to collect the milk from the animals. It was identified the presence of 13 fatty acids, being 8 saturated, small, medium and large chain (C 6 to C 20), 3 monounsaturated of medium and long chain (C 14 to C 18) and 2 polyunsaturated of long chain (C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3). There was not detected any significant difference (P> 0. 05) on the variables evaluated but on <b>miristoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (P< 0. 05). The presence of CLA (linoleic conjugated acid) was not evident, although its precursors (C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3) were identified. It could be concluded that flor-de-seda hay can be included in the diet up to the level of 60 % without causing a depression on milk content of essential fatty acids...|$|E
