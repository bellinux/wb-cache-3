40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of high-skilled labor on the {{unemployment}} and wages of low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> in the Netherlands. Using annual panel data from the Netherlands’ Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (National Bureau of Statistics, CBS), a statistically significant negative impact {{of an increase in}} high-skilled labor on the livelihoods of low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> can be shown. An increase in high-skilled labor is associated with a significant decrease in the income share of the bottom tenth percentile of the population as well as a decrease in jobs for the low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> The data reveals a significant negative effect on the bottom 60 percent of earners and a disproportionate increase in the earnings share of the top 30 percent. This development can be explained by job market dynamics. Every high-skilled worker that enters the labor market displaces medium- and low-skilled workers into lower paid positions...|$|R
30|$|When task {{groups are}} {{considered}} in the estimation, they reduce the absolute level and the relative increase of the estimated wage premia of high-skilled workers. Despite this level effect, the relative increase of wage premia has followed a similar pattern. For high-skilled workers, wage premia have increased after the mid- 1990 s, but the rise has been smaller in size. However, {{the increase in the}} wage premium of <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> relative to low-skilled workers has halved when taking the effects of tasks into account. Both panels show the increase in wage premia relative to low-skilled and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> Figs.  4 and  5 above revealed already a decline of starting wages for low-skilled workers. The increase in wage premia of high-skilled workers may thus further imply a relative fall of demand and of wages for low-skilled workers. With respect to the timing, {{it should be noted that}} most of the increase of the wage premia has occurred after the mid- 1990 s. From the beginning of the 2000 s, however, real wages of high-skilled labor market entrants have fallen, but not as strong as those of low-skilled and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{coefficients}} on {{the cohort}} of arrival dummies also reveal an interesting result. There {{has been a}} quality upgrade since 1996 among low-skilled immigrant workers, but a quality downgrade among the high-skilled immigrant cohorts arriving from 1991 to 2005 in Spain. No changes in cohort quality are observed among <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> except for the 1991 – 1995 cohort, which was of higher quality.|$|R
30|$|The {{coefficients}} {{from the}} “years since arrival” dummies {{show how the}} immigrant-natives wage differential decreases over time. After 10 years in the country, the wage gap has narrowed by 12 percentage points for low-skilled workers and 14 percentage points for <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> While there is practically no difference in wage assimilation between low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> over time, high-skilled workers experience a higher wage convergence as their wage gap narrows 27 percentage points after a decade in the country. In addition, we find that full assimilation does not occur, as in Izquierdo et al. 2009, as a 12 percentage points wage differential remains for workers in jobs requiring no degree, 22 percentage points remains for workers in jobs requiring a high-school degree and 14 percentage points remain for workers in jobs requiring a college degree. After the first ten years in the country, the coefficients on the “years since migration” dummies either remain constant (for high-skilled workers) or begin to decrease (for medium- and low-skilled ones).|$|R

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} features of this model {{is that it can}} be used to investigate the implications of technological changes on worker displacement from previously performed tasks. In particular, routine tasks, which are mostly performed by <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> are those most subject to machine displacement, and therefore task-replacing technological changes can directly reduce wages of the medium-skilled group independent of changes in total output. As these workers lose comparative advantage in routine-intensive activities, they must be reallocated either to the highest or the lowest tails of the occupational distribution, leading to employment polarization.|$|R

5000|$|Using the US Census Bureau's {{definition}} of poverty, the working poverty rate {{seems to have}} remained relatively stable since 1978. [...] However, many scholars {{have argued that the}} official poverty threshold is too low, and that real wages and working conditions have actually declined for many workers over the past three or four decades. Social scientists like Arne Kalleberg have found that the decline in US manufacturing and the subsequent polarization of the labor market has led to an overall worsening of wages, job stability, and working conditions for people with lower skill levels and less formal education. From the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s, manufacturing jobs offered many low-skilled and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> stable, well-paying jobs. Due to global competition, technological advances, and other factors, US manufacturing jobs have been disappearing for decades. (From 1970 to 2008, the percentage of the labor force employed in the manufacturing sector shrank from 23.4% to 9.1%.) During this period of decline, job growth became polarized on either end of the labor market. That is, the jobs that replaced medium-pay, low- to medium-skill manufacturing jobs were high-paying, high-skill jobs and low-paying, low-skill jobs. Therefore, many low- to <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> who {{would have been able to}} work in the manufacturing sector in 1970 must now take low-paying, precarious jobs in the service sector.|$|R
30|$|Intuitively, each {{worker is}} endowed with {{either one of}} the {{following}} three types of skills—high, medium or low. Differences in comparative advantage among workers to perform different tasks together with the market prices of different tasks as well as wages for different skills, lead workers to endogenously decide the optimal allocation of skills to tasks. And in equilibrium, Acemoglu and Autor (2011) formally derive that the least complex set of tasks are supplied by the low-skilled workers, the intermediate set of tasks by the <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> and finally the most complex tasks will be provided by the high-skilled workers.|$|R

Our data also delineate greenfield FDI by sector, function and destination, allowing us to control for different motives and skill intensities for 17 developed countries for 2003 – 2005.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} the 2004 Eastern Enlargement to the European Union {{to obtain}} {{evidence on the}} employment effects {{of an increase in}} trade liberalisation. The Enlargement is thought to generate a trade-induced demand shock with no (or only limited) supply effects. Besides the variation over time induced by the Enlargement, identification of the effects is based on a Melitz (2003) type productivity term to differentiate firms by the extent of exposure to the demand shock. The idea is that the effects of the demand shock should be driven by differences in firm-level productivity from the period before the new member countries actually entered the EU. German linked employer-employee data allow to observe the relation of initial establishment productivity with employment changes over a long panel from 1995 to 2009. The estimates show that the Enlargement had a negative effect on establishment-level employment growth, which is driven by increased worker separations and increased job destruction. Besides the overall employment effect, the study focuses on effect heterogeneity across age and skill groups of the workforce. These estimates point to a skill bias in the effect of the Enlargement that disadvantages low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> in terms of higher worker separation and job destruction. In addition, lowskilled workers suffer fewer accessions by firms, where against <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> enjoy increased accessions and creation of new jobs. Besides this indication for a skill bias, there are no clear indications that point to an age bias in the employment effect of the Eastern Enlargement...|$|R
30|$|However, by {{consideration}} of the long-run development the picture indicates some kind of cyclicality in wage growth for high-skilled workers: wage growth and entry wages increased for cohorts entering the labor market after the mid- 1980 s. This changed by declining wage growth and entry wages in the early 1990 s. About a decade later, this pattern repeated with increasing wage growth from the mid- 1990 s and falling wage growth from the early 2000 s. In contrast to these patterns for the high-skilled, entry wages and wage growth for low-skilled workers have already started to fall from the early 1990 s onwards, and wage growth for <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> has shrunk continuously from the 2000 s.|$|R
3000|$|This cyclicality {{in wages}} and wage growth, {{promptly}} accelerating for cohorts entering {{the labor market}} in the mid- 1990 s and recapturing its former path after the millennium, still cannot completely explain the increasing wage gap between young and experienced workers (see Fig.  2 above). The cyclicality can be observed for both high-uni and high-fh-skilled workers, {{and there is no}} convergence to narrowing the wage gap between young and experienced workers in the late 1990 s. At the same time and in contrast to the higher-skilled groups, there is no clear cyclical movement for medium- and low-skilled workers: <b>medium-skilled</b> young <b>workers</b> had faced constant wages and wage growth in the 1990 s, which have declined after the millennium. For low-skilled workers, the corresponding fall in wages has begun already a decade earlier. Both developments are easy to reconcile with falling chances to obtain medium-paying jobs and increasing risks to get bottom-paying jobs as well as the cascading pattern across skill groups, starting by the millennium for <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> and about a decade earlier for low-skilled workers. Still, the increasing wage gap between young and experienced workers is difficult to explain in light of the increasing share of high-skilled workers and the declining share of <b>medium-skilled</b> and low-skilled <b>workers.</b> Hence, a further possible reason for the wage gap remains in a decline of wage premia for skills, i.[*]e. lower returns to education levels over time. 9 [...]...|$|R

In contrast, high-skilled, young, or old workers are less influenced by the business cycle. However, the sensitivity is even reversed for women, young, and old workers regarding their job-loss rates (flows from employment to unemployment). Additionally allowing for differences in cyclical sensitivity depending on job tenure, {{the results indicate that}} workers with a  short job tenure are the most influenced by the cycle while workers with a  long job tenure experience less pronounced swings.|$|R

40|$|We {{forecast}} {{the number of}} qualified workers required in the German federal state Thuringia until 2015 {{on the basis of}} the manpower requirement approach. Disaggregated by types of qualification, this method distinguishes between two sources of recruitment requirements: replacement demand for old workers and expansion demand to reflect structural changes of industry sectors and productivity growth. Both components are calculated from register data on employment covered by social security. Relative to current employment, recruitment requirements vary across occupations. A comparison of recruitment requirements for <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> with the structure of vocational training reveals potential mismatch between demand and supply of medium-skilled labor in the near future if the composition of apprenticeship programs remains unchanged.

40|$|Because of {{endogeneity}} problems {{very few}} studies have been able to identify the incidence of corporate taxes on wages. We circumvent these problems by using an 11 -year panel of data on 11, 441 German municipalities' tax rates, 8 percent of which change each year, linked to administrative matched employer-employee data. Consistent with our theoretical model, we find a negative effect of corporate taxation on wages: a 1 euro increase in tax liabilities yields a 77 cent decrease in the wage bill. The direct wage effect, arising in a collective bargaining context, dominates, while the conventional indirect wage effect through reduced investment is empirically small due to regional labor mobility. High and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> who arguably extract higher rents in collective agreements, bear a larger share of the corporate tax burden. ...|$|R
50|$|Research {{suggests}} that emigration causes {{an increase in}} the wages of those who remain in the country of origin. A 2014 survey of the existing literature on emigration finds that a 10 percent emigrant supply shock would increase wages in the sending country by 2-5.5%. A study of emigration from Poland shows that it led to a slight increase in wages for high- and <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> for remaining Poles. A 2013 study finds that emigration from Eastern Europe after the 2004 EU enlargement increased the wages of remaining young workers in the country of origin by 6%, while it had no effect on the wages of old workers. The wages of Lithuanian men increased as a result of post-EU enlargement emigration. Return migration is associated with greater household firm revenues.|$|R

These data allow us to compare the fraction of individuals in specific education-age group cells resulting from our imputations with those from the census data for comparable cohorts in 1984. The general picture that emerges is that IMP 2 and IMP 3 tend to overpredict the share of <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> and underpredict the share of high-skilled for all age groups, whereas they underpredict (overpredict) the share of low-skilled for the younger (older) age groups. The latter is also true for IMP 1. Compared with IMP 2 and IMP 3, IMP 1 gives rise to smaller deviations for the share of medium-skilled, whereas it overpredicts the share of high-skilled especially for the younger age groups. Overall, when balancing out the trade off between goodness of fit and data coverage, the more narrowly defined procedure IMP 1 performs best.|$|R
30|$|The {{magnitude}} and {{persistence of the}} negative wage effects of an occupational change in East Germany after reunification were analyzed in Fedorets (2011 b). The OLS regression estimates the correlation between occupational changes and wages as being significantly negative in 1991 and negative but insignificant in 1998. However, these numbers do {{not take into account}} the positive selectivity of the sample of those who have changed their occupation. In order to control for selectivity, post-reunification changes in economic structure—implying changes in demand for particular occupational groups—were used as basis for an instrument for occupational changes. The IV estimation reveals that the negative wage effect of an occupational change between 1990 and 1991 amounts to about 35 %. Wage losses due to occupational changes between 1990 and 1998, i.e. almost 10 years after reunification, amount to nearly 20 %. It could thus be shown that fundamental changes in the occupational structure in East Germany have caused persistent wage losses for <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R

30|$|To get a more {{detailed}} picture, {{distinguishing between}} education attainments can further reveal the adverse opportunities for high-skilled workers in recent years. As becomes {{obvious from the}} pattern, university graduates have faced a decreasing chance of working in top-paying jobs. The fraction declined from 81 % (1985) to 72 % (2010). A major part of this drop has occurred after the year 2000 and notably in support of medium-paying jobs. The shift is even more profound for high-fh-skilled workers, who have faced a drastic drop in top-paying jobs from 72 to 58 % between 2000 and 2010 in favor of medium-paying jobs. In line with this, the picture for <b>medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> shows that the chance of obtaining a medium-paying job has slightly fallen after the year 2000, concurrently with an increasing share in bottom-paying jobs. A similar pattern can also be derived for low-skilled workers. Their chances of obtaining a medium-paying job have constantly fallen, especially after 1995, {{and the risk of}} obtaining a bottom-paying job has increased and has surpassed the share of medium-paying jobs by 2010.|$|R
30|$|The {{empirical}} strategy is an enhancement of Kluve et  al. (2009). In particular,   18 demographic cells are distinguished, defined by sex, three education groups, and three age groups. The group of unskilled workers comprises those without a  high school degree (Abitur) and without a  vocational degree. <b>Medium-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are those with a  high school degree or a  vocational degree, and high-skilled workers, those with a  university degree. The age groups {{are defined as}} follows: young (16 – 25), medium-aged (26 – 49), and old (50 – 64). Because of the small cell sizes, the group of young and high-skilled is excluded from the analysis. We therefore end up with   16 demographic groups. In addition to this differentiation between demographic groups, we distinguish employed workers by their duration in the employment status, job duration, and duration in the same occupation. We group those with a  short duration of up to six months, medium duration between seven and   24 months and long duration with more than   24 months. Furthermore, we distinguish similar duration groups for state dependence in unemployment.|$|R

Thus, although {{the rate at which}} the gap narrows is greatest for the college educated, because the wage gap upon arrival is larger the higher the skill required, ten years after arrival lower skilled immigrants are faring relatively better than higher skilled ones when compared to similar natives. Moreover, it is also interesting to note that, for this cohort, the rate of convergence is lower for medium- than low-skilled workers, suggesting that having a high-school degree does not buy migrants much in terms of wage assimilation (relative to their native counterparts) in Spain.|$|R
