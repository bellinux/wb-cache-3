50|$|Sour {{cherries}} require similar cultivation {{conditions to}} pears, that is, they prefer a rich, well-drained, moist soil, although they demand more nitrogen and water than sweet <b>cherries.</b> <b>Trees</b> will do badly if waterlogged, but have greater tolerance of poor drainage than sweet varieties. As with sweet <b>cherries,</b> <b>Morellos</b> are traditionally cultivated by budding onto strong growing rootstocks, which produce trees {{too large for}} most gardens, although newer dwarfing rootstocks such as Colt and Gisella are now available. During spring, flowers should be protected, and trees weeded, mulched and sprayed with natural seaweed solution. This is also the time when any required pruning should be carried out (note that cherries should not be pruned during the dormant winter months). <b>Morello</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> fruit on younger wood than sweet varieties, and thus can be pruned harder. They are usually grown as standards, but can be fan trained, cropping well even on cold walls, or grown as low bushes.|$|R
