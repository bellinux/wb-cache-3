40|$|Boom cranes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{dynamically}} complicated types of cranes because they possess rotational joints as opposed to the linear tracks of bridge and gantry cranes. In addition, if the boom crane is placed on a mobile base, additional complexity is added to the system. However, <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> cranes have huge potential benefits as they can be quickly transported from one location to another. Furthermore, if they utilize their mobile base during lifting operations, then they can have an extremely large workspace. All cranes share the same limiting weakness; the payload oscillates when the crane moves. A command-generation approach is taken to control the payload oscillation. Input shaping is one such command-generation technique that modifies the original reference command by convolving it with a series of impulses. The shaped command produced by the convolution can then move the crane without inducing payload oscillation. Input shaping can accommodate parameter uncertainties, nonlinearities, multiple modes of vibration, and has been shown to be compatible with human operators. This thesis focuses on three aspects of <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> cranes: 1) dynamic analysis, 2) input-shaping control, and 3) experimental testing. A majority of the thesis focuses on analyzing and describing the complicated dynamics of <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> cranes. Then, various input-shaping controllers are designed and tested, including two-mode shapers for double-pendulum dynamics. In order to experimentally verify the simulation results, a small-scale <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> crane has been constructed. The details of the <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> crane and its important features are presented and discussed. Details of the software used to control the crane are also presented. Then, several different experimental protocols are introduced and the results presented. In addition, a set of operator performance studies that analyze human operators maneuvering the <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> crane through an obstacle course is presented. M. S.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} a tip-over {{stability of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> cranes with swinging payloads. Base and crane motion presents a tip-over problem. Attaching complex payloads further complicates the problem. They study {{began with a}} single-pendulum payload to analyze a tip-over stability characteristics under different conditions. A simple tip-over prediction model was developed with a goal of limiting a computational cost to a minimum. The stability was characterized by a tip-over stability margin method. The crane's tip-over stability was also represented by the maximum possible payload it can carry throughout the workspace. In a static stability analysis, <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> crane {{was assumed to be}} stationary, thus with no payload swing. The study provided basic understanding on the relationship between tip-over stability and boom configuration. In a pseudo-dynamic stability analysis, the method incorporated payload swing into the analysis by adding estimated maximum payload swing due to motions. To estimate the angles, differential equations of motions of payload swings were derived. The thesis extended the study to a double-pendulum payload. The maximum swing angles estimated in the single-pendulum case were directly applied to the double-pendulum case. To validate the analytical methods, a full dynamic multi-body simulation model of a <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> crane was developed. The predictions from the previous analysis were verified by the simulation results. The prediction model and the analytical methods in the thesis provide a significant tool for practical application of tip-over stability analysis on <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> cranes. The experimental results increase the confidence of the study's accuracy. M. S. Committee Member: Sadegh, Nader; Committee Member: Singhose, William; Committee Member: Whiteman, Wayn...|$|E

40|$|Millions of cranes {{are used}} around the world. Because of their wide-spread use in {{construction}} industries, boom cranes {{are an important}} class of cranes whose performance should be optimized. One limitation of most boom cranes is they are usually attached to a stationary base or a mobile base that is only used for initial positioning and not during operation. This limits the workspace of the boom crane significantly. If a boom crane was attached to a mobile base that could be safely used during lifting operations, then the boom crane workspace could be extended significantly. The problem with using cranes, and in particular mobile cranes, is the large oscillations of the payload that are typically induced when moving the crane. One control strategy {{that has been used}} to control oscillation on other types of cranes is called Input Shaping, a command filtering technique that reduces motion-induced vibration in oscillatory systems. This thesis develops a dynamics model for a <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> crane and analyzes the difficulty of controlling payload oscillation on a boom crane. Input shaping will shown to be effective for controlling oscillation on boom cranes. A new method for operating a boom crane in Cartesian coordinates will also be shown. This thesis will also detail the design of a small-scale <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> crane for experimental and research purposes. A substantial part of this thesis will also focus on the development of new input-shaping methods for nonlinear drive systems commonly found on boom and other types of cranes. An example application of a control system featuring input shaping for an industrial bridge crane will also be discussed. M. S.

40|$|To improve {{agricultural}} production, {{pest control}} is necessary. To achieve this objective, pesticide application {{is one of}} the most practiced methods. But, for a better coverage of the target, this technique requires small droplets to control pests efficiently. However, during crop spraying, important quantities of this droplet category are transferred to the environment, with negative impacts on air, soil, water and health. So, the different compartments ofthe environment will be polluted, especially in an intensive irrigated system. The need of prediction of spray drift has led to the development of a global approach that evaluates drift potential and plant retention in Tunisian context. The central component in this approach is a drift prediction model “DriftL”. It was developed using an advection-diffusion representation for diameter classes representing the spray and it includes evaporation simulation. Tests were set up in laboratory conditions with different nozzle settings in a wind tunnel to develop the model and under a <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> to evaluate plant retention. Both wind tunnel and <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> tests were used in a combined approach to evaluate the amount of droplets lost in the air (volatilization). Predictions of these approaches were finally compared to field test results with two spraying setups (spraying Volume Median Diameter of 127 and 322 µm). DriftL was compared to threeothers Drift models: DRIFTSIM, AgDrift and the model of the European group Forum for Coordination of Pesticide Fate Models and their Use (FOCUS). The Federal Biological Research Center for Agriculture and Forestry in Germany (BBA) drift tables are referenced in the literature and are widely used by the scientific community, so they were used as reference values for comparing the four model results. These comparisons showed that the combined laboratory and modeling approach give coherent results that could be used with few improvements to achieve a global balance of pesticide losses and provide farmers with a tool to decrease them...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Mobile boom cranes {{are used}} {{throughout}} the world to perform important and dangerous manipulation tasks. The usefulness of these cranes is greatly improved if they can utilize their mobile base during the lifting and transferring phases of operation. During such operations, the tip-over stability is degraded when the payload swings. This paper presents a stability study of such cranes with payloads that cause double-pendulum dynamics. As a first step, a static stability analysis of a single-pendulum boom crane is conducted to provide basic insights into {{the effects of the}} payload weight and crane configuration. Then, a semi-dynamic method is used to take the payload swing into account. Finally, the results of a dynamic stability analysis obtained by using a full dynamic multi-body simulation are compared to the outcomes of the previous approaches. The results of the semi-dynamic method and the full dynamic simulation are verified by experiments.

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>boom</b> cranes {{are used}} {{throughout}} the world to perform important and dangerous manipulation tasks. Given their mobility, these types of cranes can quickly be moved into position. Generally, their base is then fixed and stabilized before they start lifting heavy materials. The usefulness of these cranes can be greatly improved if they can utilize their mobile base during the lifting and transferring phases of operation. This ability greatly expands the workspace by combining base motion with the rotation, lifting, and luffing motions. Of course, the cranes lose some stability margin when a payload is attached. The stability is further degraded when the payload swings. This Master's Thesis presents a stability study of such cranes.

40|$|Heavy-lifting {{machines}} such as cranes {{are widely}} used at ports, construction sites, and manufacturing plants {{in a variety of}} material-transporting applications. However, cranes possess inherent flexible dynamics that make fast and precise operation challenging. Most cranes are driven by human operators, which adds another element of complexity. The goal of this thesis is to develop controllers that allow human operators to easily and efficiently control machines with flexible dynamics. To improve the ease of human operation of these machines, various control structures are developed and their effectiveness in aiding the operator are evaluated. Cranes are commonly used to swing wrecking balls that demolish unwanted structures. To aid the operator in such tasks, swing-amplifying controllers are designed and their performance are evaluated through simulations and experiments with real operators. To make maneuvering of these machines in material-transporting operations easier, input-shaping control is used to reduce oscillation induced by operator commands. In the presence of external disturbances, input shaping is combined with a low-authority feedback controller to eliminate unwanted oscillations, while maintaining the human operator as the primary controller of the machine. The performance and robustness of the proposed controllers are thoroughly examined via numerical simulations and a series of experiments and operator studies on a small-scale <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> crane and a two-ton dual-hoist bridge crane.

The DHPMS is controlled by active on/off valves, but unlike the digital pump-motors the DHPMS has multiple independent outlets; hence, the DHPMS can operate also as a transformer. In this experimental study, a proportional control of a <b>mobile</b> <b>boom</b> is compared with a displacement control when a six-piston DHPMS is used. In the proportional control, the system pressure is controlled by the DHPMS and a lift cylin-der with a proportional valve. In the displacement control, the cylinder fluid volumes are controlled directly using the DHPMS. Firstly, the systems under study are presented along with the con-trol methods. Then the control performance of the DHPMS is studied and finally, the energy losses in the systems are analysed. The results show the versatility of the DHPMS; it is capable of fast and accurate pressure control but also handles the direct flow control. According to the measurements, the losses are signifi-cantly smaller in the displacement controlled system thanks to the minimised throttling losses and the energy recovery. Nevertheless, the energy losses in the prototype DHPMS are rather high due to the leakage in the control valves and their low flow capacity, and therefore improvements in the design are needed...|$|E

Within the geological repository concept, the Boom clay formation itself {{is considered the}} primary barrier against radionuclide migration. It provides good sorption capacities, very low permeability, and chemically reducing conditions due {{to the presence of}} pyrite (FeS 2) Since the mobility and consequently also the dose contribution is highly related to the speciation of selenium, the knowledge on its behaviour in the far field of the Boom Clay formation is very important for the safety case of the future Belgian high level waste disposal program. In all previous studies, the interpretation of the behaviour of Se in Boom Clay conditions has always been based on circumstantial evidence such as solubility measurements or comparison with the spectroscopically identified speciation of Se in model systems [1 - 3]. Since pyrite (FeS 2) {{is one of the main}} minerals governing the redox conditions of the Boom Clay solid phases, it is expected that selenite will be reduced to Se 0 in the Boom Clay system, thereby effectively limiting the solution concentration to the solubility of Se 0, provided that there is no interaction with the <b>mobile</b> <b>Boom</b> Clay organic matter. Selenite was equilibrated with Boom Clay for 1 month, before phase separation into 4 size fractions (clay-rich, pyrite-rich, organic matter-rich, supernatant) was achieved using centrifugation. For the first time the solid phase reaction products for the interaction of selenite with the Boom Clay solid phase have been spectroscopically identified. Based on the XANES/EXAFS analysis, selenite is reduced to Se 0 on all solid phase size fractions of the Boom Clay, confirming the reduction of selenite to metallic selenium in the Boom Clay system. Despite of the low equilibrium concentration in the supernatant solution (5 x 10 - 6 M of Se) XANES measurements were possible and unexpectedly indicated the presence of a selenide phase (FeSe or an organic selenide), although Se 0 was observed on the respective solid phase fractions. 1.

The system’s basic principle was to combine the discrete flow supply control of parallel pumps with the discrete effective area control of a multi-chamber cylinder to produce a speed control resolution high enough for accurate velocity tracking and positioning. Some throttling was used in the return line to control the system with overrunning loads. The properties of the system were tested with a 1 -DOF boom mockup mimicking a medium-sized <b>mobile</b> machine <b>boom.</b> The test system revealed a feature that caused load acceleration to drop when the effective cylinder area was reduced during movement. Additionally, some delay was observed in accelerating the piston against the load force. These two system properties along with the discrete control method resulted in mediocre speed and position tracking in the system when movement was directed against the load force. The system was able to control restricting and overrunning loads as well as a large inertia mass with a low load force. The system’s energy losses were low considering that no pressure accumulators were used, but the throttling losses in the return line and the lack of energy recuperation leave room for improvement...|$|R

A new coping strategy has been developed {{with a view to}} limiting HWC and avoiding incident peaks at certain periods. The <b>booming</b> <b>mobile</b> phone sector and the popular use of text messages have provided an opportunity {{to assess the impact of}} real-time communication systems in HWC mitigation strategies. Preliminary tests were conducted in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with FrontlineSMS, a mobile data collection system. The overall system can be improved by using an Android application such as KoBoCollect on a smartphone enabling easier recording of georeferenced data. Once adopted, HWC early warning systems could be deployed at low cost, improving the global management and conservation of flagship species involved in HWC, such as the elephant.

40|$|AbstractQuick Response (QR) Codes are {{becoming}} {{a part of our}} lives. As <b>mobile</b> technologies are <b>booming,</b> QR codes are being used for various purposes, one of which is for mobile marketing. In this study, our goal was to investigate the current use and future intent of use of QR codes in mobile marketing among college students. We surveyed 241 college students in the beginning of 2013. The findings indicate that while more than 80 % of students recognized QR codes, only half of them had used QR codes before. Furthermore, while the interest in using QR codes is currently low, the likelihood of using them is slightly higher than the current interest. Therefore, we can simply conclude that we are more likely to see higher adoption levels of QR codes among the traditional-age college students in the future. However, we also believe that mobile marketers need to find ways to promote the use of QR codes, teach how to use them, and increase adoption levels if they want to benefit from this new technology...|$|R
40|$|Smartphones {{and other}} {{internet}} capable <b>mobile</b> devices are <b>booming</b> in pop-ularity. Pocket-sized computers are now another welcome distraction to stu-dents, {{both in and}} out of the classroom. Unfortunately, Math is not becoming any more fun to learn. The solution isn’t less technology in the classroom, but more of it. Mobile devices have proven to be great tools for entertain-ment and social networking, but now it’s education’s turn. I have created an iPhone Application which applies elements of game theory in a game designed to teach arithmetic. Factor Friends makes learning core Math and Computer Science concepts an engaging, multiplayer competition. By integrating social networking, Factor Friends becomes a shared learning experience for peers. The game also pairs opponents together who best match each other skills, which provides a natural learning curve and level progression. Gamification is used to not only turn Math into a game, but make it an integral part of the experience while keeping it fun. Concepts such as precedence, association, and reduction are the keys to earning more points, achievements, and even user created content. ...|$|R
40|$|Human-wildlife {{conflicts}} (HWCs) have drastically increased around conservation {{areas in}} Africa in recent decades, thus undermining the peaceful cohabitation of wildlife populations and rural human settlements. Mitigation packages include HWC reporting, {{which is often}} ineffective since the information conveyed is generally scattered and useless. The <b>booming</b> <b>mobile</b> phone sector and the popular use of text messages (SMS) have provided an opportunity {{to assess the impact}} of real-time communication systems in HWC mitigation strategies. This paper presents the results of preliminary tests conducted in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with FrontlineSMS, a mobile data collection system. With sets of 52 wildlife playing cards, any wildlife events from patrol reports to HWCs were easily translated into explanatory variables listed on forms. Sending written information as text messages was hampered by IT problems linked with the use of commercial 3 G USB modems. The overall system could be improved by using GPRD modems allowing a higher SMS flow and, at the informant level, by introducing ad-hoc SMS models to facilitate data capture on mobile phones. Once adopted, HWC early warning systems could be deployed at low cost. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Owing to <b>booming</b> <b>mobile</b> phone {{ownership}} {{and a short}} product innovation cycle, waste mobile phones are flooding China. In 2008, about 560 million mobile phones were produced and 634 million users subscribed to a mobile phone plan in China. These large numbers mean that the charging and disposal of mobile phones {{has the potential to}} have significant impacts on the environment. Thus the evaluation of material and energy consumption of mobile phones is an important task in the end-of-life management of electronic products. This paper uses material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to estimate the life cycle impacts of mobile phones in China from manufacturing energy, use phase and generation of waste mobile phones. Results indicate over the mobile phone life cycle, manufacturing accounts for 50 % of the total energy consumption, whereas the use phase accounts for only 20 %. Mobile phones and supporting infrastructures account for a rapidly increasing 0. 17 % of Chinese energy use. In 2008, around 77 million units of waste mobile phones were generated in China. To manage this energy use and recover valuable materials recommendations are made to increase lifespan, improve energy efficiency during use and ensure recycling.
