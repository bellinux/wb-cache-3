40|$|Cohabiting and <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> are {{analysed}} {{in presence}} of income uncertainty and precautionary saving. <b>Married</b> <b>couples</b> have legal con-straints on their relationship that {{force them to}} act cooperatively, while cohabitants are likely to act non-cooperatively. This makes risk sharing different for different couples; cohabitants share risk {{to a lesser extent}} than do <b>married</b> <b>couples,</b> and their savings decision is further distorted by strategic undersaving. The conclusion is therefore a kind of paradox, co-habitants who have abstained from marriage due to higher preferences for independence and equality are less equal than <b>married</b> <b>couples,</b> and they also act strategically to be able to increase assistance from their partner...|$|R

40|$|Summary-Dating and <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> show {{comparable}} {{levels of}} assortment for physical traits. <b>Married</b> <b>couples.</b> however, are more assorted on psychological traits.

Physical traits are apparently critical in initial partner selection; psychological traits are more important for long-term relationships. There is little evidence that couples become more similar in psychological traits over time, implying that existing similarities are due to initial assortment.
