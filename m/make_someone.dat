People consult healers and fortune tellers for help with relationships: to revive their romance, to end a marriage, to <b>make</b> <b>someone</b> fall in love, or to hurt someone. People also consult them to drive away negative energy, predict the future and dangerous events, to improve their health, or to bring positive energy. Cisneros grew closer to curanderismo after her firstborn, David, died after being thrown from a moving vehicle by a friend {{while he was in}} St. Joe in 1974. People close to Cisneros described her as a person who endured several tragic events growing up. One of her uncles committed suicide when she was young, and her brother drowned as a teenager. But, several others who were close to her maintained that after her son died, Cisneros started to show signs of insanity, became more protective of her children, and began visiting local curanderas.|$|E

25|$|Identity fusion, a {{psychological}} construct rooted in social psychology and cognitive anthropology, {{is a form}} of alignment with groups in which members experience a visceral sense of oneness with the group. The construct relies on a distinction between the personal self and the social self. The personal self refers to the characteristics that <b>make</b> <b>someone</b> a unique person (e.g., tall, old, intelligent), while the social self pertains to the characteristics that align the person with groups (e.g., American, fraternity brother, student council member, etc.). As the name suggests, identity fusion involves the union of the personal and social selves. When fusion occurs, both the personal and social selves remain salient and influential but the boundaries between them become highly permeable. In addition, the theory proposes that fused persons come to regard other group members as “family” and develop strong relational ties to them as well as ties to the collective. Therefore, fused persons are not just bound to the collective; they are tied to the individual members of the collective.|$|E

The post generated a discussion in the forums, which gaming outlets noted was civil; several users added their dissenting opinions of the pose, while others disagreed with the original poster's thoughts. Kaplan posted an apologetic response in which he announced Blizzard's plans to replace the pose, writing [...] "the last thing {{we want to do is}} <b>make</b> <b>someone</b> feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented". The decision was met with mixed reactions from the gaming community, with some gamers arguing that Blizzard yielded its creative control over the game, censoring its content to appease an offended user, while others praised Blizzard's willingness to listen to the community and adhere to standards for portraying a character according to their personality. Kaplan later expressed that the game's development team was not [...] "entirely happy with the original pose", and had internal creative struggles about its inclusion. The following week, a replacement pose was released, although it was described by one commentator to be [...] "different, butt not by much" [...] referring to the posterior cleavage of the original pose.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} effects of {{environment}} to the main character, Gregor Melekhov, in Mikhail Sholokov's And Quiet Flows The Don. Since Gregor lives in two different conditions of environment, the thesis writer is curious to know how Gregor Melekhov leads his life before the wars and what happens to him during the wars condition. From the discussion it is revealed that someone's different environment effect someone's character traits and <b>make</b> <b>someone's</b> react differently to each of it. Before the wars, Gregor lives in a comfortable life together with his family. Yet, this setting does not make him become a good person, he is passive, irresponsible, weak, and selfish. However, in the different environment, that is during the wars which can be considered bad since {{there is a lot of}} suffering and violence, Gregor reacts differently, Gregor becomes a brave, responsible, thoughtful, and unselfish person. Finally the thesis writer can conclude that settings influence much on Gregor Melekhov's character traits and the setting in the wars is the most influential setting that changes Gregor's character. The setting or environment can lead someone to be a good and mature person as Gregor. This also proves the power of setting which can <b>make</b> <b>someone's</b> character not stick on one particular type...|$|R
