However, {{the effect of}} these compounds on the orientation of flying mosquitoes in a choice situation and their effect on mosquito oviposition are not yet known. Here, we used a modified Y-tube olfactometer to test {{the effect of these}} compounds on the orientation of Aedes aegypti flying towards skin odor (human fingers), and we tested their effect on Aedes aegypti oviposition choice in a cage assay. In both behavioral situations we compared the effect to the well-documented repellent N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET). MDA, EA, and DEET inhibited Aedes aegypti from flying towards skin odor while BA had no such effect. Conversely, MDA had no effect on oviposition while EA, BA, and DEET deterred oviposition, with the strongest effect observed for BA. Thus, we confirm that EA and DEET are generally repellent, while MDA is repellent only in a host-seeking context, and BA is deterrent only in an oviposition context. These compounds appear of potential use in mosquito control programs...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{work which}} has {{resulted}} in the synthesis of cinnolines is reviewed. The strictly historical approach has been modified to accommodate a classification based upon the type of cinnoline involved. Preparative routes to 4 -chloro- 2 -amlnoacetophenone are described. Reaction between the acid chloride of 4 -chloro- 2 - phthallmldobenzoic acid and diethyl sodiomalonate followed by hydrolysis gives the pure amine via the acetamido-compound. A second route which utilises 4 -chloro- 2 -nitrobenzovl chloride and ethyl sodioacetoacetate leads to 4 -chloro- 2 -nitroaceto-phenone and thence to the amine, Diazotisation of 4 rohloro- 2 -aminoacetophenone and subsequent ring closure produces 7 -chloro-U-hydroxycinnoline. Nitration of 4 -Ghloro- 2 -acetamidoacetophenone has given the 5 -nitro-derivatlve with some of the 3 -nitro-isomer. Hydrolysis to the corresponding nitro-amines and diazotisation of these in sulphuric acid yields 6 -nitro- 7 -chloro- and 8 -nitro- 7 -chloro-U-hydroxycinnoline. In hydrochloric acid, however, the corresponding dichloro- 4 -hydroxycinnolines are formed, the replacement (nitro →chloro) taking place before cyclisation to the cinnoline. Attempts to prepare 4 -chloro- 2 -aminopropiophenone are described, and work on the projected synthesis of 7 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyclnnoline is reported. Widman's synthesis of 7 -methylcinnoline- 7 -carboxylic acid has been repeated; in general, the original results are confirmed but the acid is best purified via the ethyl ester. 4 -Methylcinnoline and the 6 - and 7 -chloro-compounds have been prepared by ring closure of the diazotised o-isopropenylanilines; these are formed by dehydration of the corresponding carbinols which arise from the o-amino-acetophenones or <b>methyl</b> <b>anthranilates</b> by a Grignard reaction. The 4 -methylcinnolines are characterised by their green picrates and red ethiodldes. The application {{of a wide variety of}} reactions to estimate the reactivity of the methyl group in 4 -methyl-cinnoline has had little success. Confirmation of enhanced reactivity and hence of the postulate that is N(_ 1) the basic centre of the molecule is provided by the formation of 4 -p-dimethylaminostyryl-l-ethylcinnollnlum iodides. Reduction of a number of cinnolines with sodium and alcohol has been carried out. Qualitative examination has shown partial conversion to the corresponding indoles of 4 -(4 '-hydroxyphenyl) oinnoline, the 3 -methyl compound and of 3 -methyl- 4 -P-anisylclnnollne; 3 -phenyl- 4 -p-anisylcinnoline and the deraethylated compound are virtually unchanged. 4 -Methylclnnoline and its 6 - and 7 -chloro-derivatives all give 3 -niethylindole as the final-product but data on the intermediate stages is incomplete. Estimation of the ammonia liberated in each case confirms the above findings. Attempts to repeat Stolle and Becker's synthesis of 3 -phenylcinnoline- 4 -carboxylio acid are reported...|$|R
40|$|The general biosynthetic pathway for {{tryptophan}} is known. However, {{little information}} has been gathered on how substrates and enzymes interact when phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (PRAI) and indole- 3 -glycerolphosphate synthase (IPGS) convert a substituted phenyl ring, PRA, into an indole moiety, IGP, via 1 -(O-carboxyphenylamino) - 1 -deoxyribulose- 5 -phosphate (CdRP). There has been no serious synthetic approach to develop methodology to produce a plethora of substrate and product analogues of CdRP. The studies described in this thesis cover methodology focusing on secondary aryl amine formation, using reductive amination, nucleophilic substitution and epoxide ring opening, leading to CdRP analogues. Reductive aminations with D-ribose failed to produce any aryl glycosylamine precursor, possibly due to the low nucleophilicity of aryl amines such as aniline. Removing the aromaticity and using cyclohexylamine produced secondary amines in moderate yield {{in the presence of}} benzylpentanal, and NaBH 3 CN, at a pH of 5. 5. This led to a successful reductive amination using <b>anthranilate</b> <b>methyl</b> ester. Secondary aryl amine synthesis via epoxide ring opening proved consistently reproducible. Using LiNTf 2 and high equivalents of cyclohexylamine or aniline in neat conditions opened protected epoxides. This has {{led to the formation of}} advanced secondary aryl amine synthons and the development of methodology leading to target compounds with functionality at the 1, 2 and 5 positions. Nucleophilic substitution using caesium base, high equivalents aniline at room temperature, gave a moderate yield of secondary aryl amines from sulfonyl and bromide good leaving groups. Raising the reaction temperature improved yields using low equivalents of aniline, with the optimal temperature being 50 °C. Ultimately using both the high equivalents of aniline or <b>anthranilate</b> <b>methyl</b> ester and warming the reaction in DMF gave the highest yields of secondary aryl amines. No overalkylated tertiary amine was isolated when a caesium base was used. Boc N-protection of 1 -phenylamino- 4 -pentene and asymmetric dihydroxylation gave the corresponding diol, which was phosphorylated giving the protected target 1, 4, 5 compound. The methodology leading to the protected target 1, 4, 5 compound synthesis provides a means to the synthesis additional of CdRP analogues...|$|R

50|$|The scheme {{involves}} {{first the}} conversion of ortho-trifluoromethyl aniline (1) to a quinolol. The compound is thus condensed with EMME (Ethoxy Methylene Malonic Diethyl Ester) and cyclized thermally (2).

The displacement of chlorine with <b>methyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> (4) then affords the coupled intermediate (5). An ester interchange of that product with glycerol leads to the glyceryl ester.

50|$|Synthesis {{starts with}} the {{reaction}} of the N-benzyl derivative from <b>methyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> with nitrous acid to give the N-nitroso derivative. Reduction by means of sodium thiosulfate leads to the transient hydrazine (3), which undergoes spontaneous internal hydrazide formation. Treatment of the enolate of this amide with 3-chloro-1-dimethylamkino propane gives benzydamine (5). Please note there is an error in this section: US3318905 states that the nitroso derivative is reduced with sodium hydrosulfite (sodium dithionite) and not with sodium hyposulfite (sodium thiosulfate), as shown in the above scheme and stated in text. An interesting alternative synthesis of this substance starts by sequential reaction of N-benzylaniline with phosgene, and then with sodium azide to product the corresponding carbonyl azide. On heating, nitrogen is evolved and a separatable mixture of nitrene insertion product and the desired ketoindazole # results. The latter reaction appears to be a Curtius rearrangement type product to produce an N-isocyanate #, which then cyclizes. Alkylation of the enol with sodium methoxide and 3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride gives benzydamine.|$|E

40|$|Volatile methyl esters {{are common}} {{constituents}} of plant volatiles with important functions in plant defense.

In vitro biochemical characterization after bacterial expression revealed three S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases with high specificity for anthranilic acid as a substrate.
