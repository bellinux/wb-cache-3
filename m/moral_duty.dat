But can collectives such as states actually hold <b>moral</b> <b>duties?</b> If answering this affirmatively: what does it actually mean to say that a state has <b>moral</b> obligations or <b>duties</b> of justice? In this paper I argue that states can be considered collective (institutional) agents which can hold <b>moral</b> <b>duties.</b> If a collective (for example a state) holds <b>moral</b> <b>duties</b> this entails duties for its individual members.

25|$|For {{most of the}} war, therefore, the Angevin armies {{were led}} into battle {{by a handful of}} senior nobles. The most {{important}} of these was Robert of Gloucester, the half-brother of the Empress. He was known for his qualities as a statesman, his military experience and leadership ability. Robert had tried to convince Theobald to take the throne in 1135; he did not attend Stephen's first court in 1136 and it took several summonses to convince him to attend court at Oxford later that year. Miles of Gloucester was another capable military leader up until his death in 1143; there were some political tensions between him and Robert, but the two could work together on campaigns. One of Matilda's most loyal followers was Brian Fitz Count, like Miles a marcher lord from Wales. Fitz Count was apparently motivated by a strong <b>moral</b> <b>duty</b> to uphold his oath to Matilda and proved critical in defending the Thames corridor.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{reasoned}} {{conclusion of}} this study... that the sense of guilt created by the Vietnam war {{in the minds of}} many Americans is not warranted and that the charges of officially, condoned illegal and grossly immoral conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield practices reveals that the loss civilian life in Vietnam was less great than in World War II and Korea and that concern with minimizing the ravages of the war was strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human life caused by different war will be objectionable to those who repudiate all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it remains a <b>moral</b> <b>duty</b> to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained. I hope that this book may help demonstrate that moral convictions are not the exclusive possession of persons in conscience opposed to war, and that those who in certain circumstances accept the necessity and ethical justification of armed conflict also do care about human suffering.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that industrialized or wealthy countries {{in particular have}} <b>moral</b> obligations or <b>duties</b> of justice to combat world poverty or to shoulder burdens of climate change. But what does it actually {{mean to say that}} a state has <b>moral</b> obligations or <b>duties</b> of justice? In this paper I discuss Toni Erskine’s account of moral agency of states. With her, I argue that collectives such as states can hold (collective) <b>moral</b> <b>duties.</b> However, Erskine’s approach does not clarify what <b>moral</b> <b>duties</b> of collectives entail for their members. I suggest that these duties entail corresponding (contributory) duties for the members of the collective.

In {{the second half of}} this thesis I aim to show that divine command theory should not only be taken seriously as a metaethical stance, but that it is in fact the correct moral theory with regards to the nature of our <b>moral</b> <b>duties.</b> I present background information and explain the concept of <b>moral</b> <b>duties</b> and their distinctness from moral values. Then I show that of all the possible accounts of the reality of our <b>moral</b> <b>duties,</b> divine command theory is the only tenable option.

Contemporary chronicler George Pachymeres accuses Maria of [...] "ignoring the <b>moral</b> <b>duty</b> to her late husband" [...] but in fact her decision was driven by her hatred towards her uncle Michael VIII, whom she considered a heretic, as well as by her desire to hang on to power.

Such claims are better seen as exercises of semiotic techniques to alter social meanings.

Where political authority uses the semiotic technique of announcing a legal - and by implication <b>moral</b> - <b>duty,</b> thereby altering social meaning as a means of bringing about the satisfaction of a compliance condition, it makes a claim whose literal falsehood (if false it be) does not derogate from the authority 2 ̆ 7 s legitimacy...|$|R

40|$|Viewed in its entirety, moral philosophizing, and {{the moral}} {{behavior}} of people throughout history, presents a curious puzzle. On the one hand, interpersonal duties display a remarkably stable core content: morality the world over enjoins people to keep their word; refrain from violence, theft and cheating; and help those in need. On the other hand, the asserted motives that drive people’s moral actions evince a dazzling diversity: from empathy or sympathy, to practical or prudential reason, to custom and honor, cultural identity, excellence and independence, faith and spirituality, narrative and beauty, and more besides. I term this twin phenomenon—a core of fixed <b>moral</b> <b>duties</b> driven by diverse motives—“moral motive pluralism. ” In this article, I marshal evidence to show the prevalence of the phenomenon. Contrary to widespread assumptions, across generations and cultures, diverse motives drive different people to perform their <b>moral</b> <b>duties.</b> But despite this diversity, each different motive impels conscientious compliance with the same core <b>moral</b> <b>duties.</b> I argue this phenomenon undermines key types of evidence commonly employed to justify popular moral philosophies, and provides us with reason to seriously consider certain sorts of ethical theories—especially “functionalist” accounts of morality.
