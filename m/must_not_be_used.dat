25|$|Flucytosine by {{mouth is}} used for the {{treatment}} of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida or Cryptococcus neoformans. It can also be used for the treatment of chromomycosis (chromoblastomycosis), if susceptible strains cause the infection. Flucytosine <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a sole agent in life-threatening fungal infections due to relatively weak antifungal effects and fast development of resistance, but rather in combination with amphotericin B and/or azole antifungals such as fluconazole or itraconazole. Minor infections such as candidal cystitis may be treated with flucytosine alone. In some countries, treatment with slow intravenous infusions for no more than a week is also a therapeutic option, particular if the disease is life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Court {{cases in}} recent years have {{addressed}} the legality of Taser use by police officers. In Bryan v. MacPherson, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a Taser had been used in a way that constituted excessive force and hence a violation of the Fourth Amendment. In the latter case Mattos v. Agarano, the same Court of Appeals found that in two situations involving Taser use, one in Drive Stun and one in dart mode, officers had used excessive force. According to an article in Police Chief magazine, this decision implies guidelines for the use of Tasers and other Electronic Control Devices in gaining compliance (in a setting where safety is not an issue), including that the officer must give warning before each application, and that the suspect must be capable of compliance, with enough time to consider a warning, and to recover from the extreme pain of any prior application of the Taser; and that Tasers <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on children, the elderly, and women who are visibly pregnant or inform the officer of their pregnancy.|$|E

50|$|The next {{question}} is: Which name should we use for that clade, Taringa or Aporodoris? The older name, Aporodoris, should have priority over the younger name, Taringa. Valdes and Gosliner (2001) {{argued that in}} this case, however, the ICZN Article 23.9 (not 23.9.2) applies and that the younger name {{should be regarded as}} valid. However, Article 23.9 actually does not apply here. According to Article 23.9, prevailing usage can be maintained only if two conditions are met (described in 23.9.1), one of which (23.9.1.1) is that the senior synonym <b>must</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as a valid name after 1899. Although Valdes and Gosliner (2001) thought that Aporodoris had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as a valid name since 1899, three new species names were created in Aporodoris since 1899 (see above), and several authors used the binomial Aporodoris millegrana as valid (Eliot 1910b; Pruvot-Fol 1954a; Bouchet and Tardy 1976). Therefore Aporodoris is a valid name, regardless of whether Taringa has <b>been</b> widely <b>used</b> or <b>not.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Scenario-based {{specifications}} <b>are</b> <b>used</b> for modeling highlycomplex, {{distributed systems}} {{in terms of}} partial runs (scenarios) the system shall have.

Some classes of MSC specifications can be transformed into Petri nets [7], but usually an implementation has to be checked against an MSC specification. Life-sequence charts (LSCs) [5] extend the MSC paradigm by adding behavioral preconditions, anti-scenarios, and annotations to scenarios and single actions for enforcin...|$|R

40|$|Reliably {{diagnosing}} pregnancy {{in women}} presenting with nonspecific abdominal pain can be lifesaving. If diagnostic tests are unreliable, however, valuable {{time and resources}} can be wasted pursuing unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions. After four false positive-urine pregnancy tests in one week, we began investigating the laboratory’s entire process involving the UPreg tests. We discovered that, as is common in resourcepoor settings, the laboratory repeatedly reused test tubes. We found that the false-positive tests resulted from performing the UPreg tests in test tubes that were improperly cleaned and, for the most part, had <b>been</b> <b>used</b> immediately beforehand to test women coming into the maternity ward. Sufficient residua from the pregnant women’s high ß-HCG levels had remained in the test tubes to cause subsequent false-positive results in our emergency ward patients. Although pregnancy can now be reliably diagnosed with inexpensive, disposable and simple tests, these tests <b>must</b> <b>not</b> only <b>be</b> <b>used</b> properly, but also, when used in the laboratory, be accompanied by appropriate cleaning and quality-control procedures.
