She says, “I think we should go. It is our turn to <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen.</b> There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116). However, along their way, they are unjustly detained by Kimeria the businessman, who reveals that he is colluding with the MP, and who afterwards rapes Wanja.|$|E
25|$|Practitioners {{traditionally}} {{believe that}} daily life depends on proper alignment {{and knowledge of}} one's ori. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters, it is taken to mean {{a portion of the}} soul that determines personal destiny and success. Ashe is the life-force that runs through all things, living and inanimate. Ashe is the power to <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen.</b> It is an affirmation that is used in greetings and prayers, as well as a concept of spiritual growth. Orisha devotees strive to obtain Ashe through iwa-pele or gentle and good character, and in turn they experience alignment with the ori, what others might call inner peace and satisfaction with life. Ashe is divine energy that comes from Olodumare, the creator deity and is manifested through Olorun, who rules the heavens and is associated with the sun. Without the sun, no life could exist, just as life cannot exist without some degree of ashe. Ashe is sometimes associated with Eshu, the messenger Orisha. For practitioners, ashe represents a link to the eternal presence of the supreme deity, the Orishas, and the ancestors.|$|E

500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one knew what I was looking for except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. For some reason he didn't want those musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When I go into the studio, I'm a magician. I <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen.</b> Whatever is working in that particular space at that particular time, I use, I take advantage of." ...|$|E
500|$|Cherepanov was {{eligible}} for the 2007 National Hockey League (NHL) Entry Draft after the 2006–07 season. [...] Throughout {{most of the season}} leading up to the draft, Cherepanov was the top ranked prospect in Europe. Prior to the draft, Cherepanov attended the NHL's Scouting Combine, allowing club's to evaluate his physical attributes and schedule interviews, if they needed additional information prior to his selection. Those attending the combine were struck by Cherepanov's apparent physical immaturity, pointing out his low number of bench press repetitions, and his [...] physique. [...] His performance during the interview portion of the event was more impressive, with team personnel impressed with his maturity and good attitude. [...] At the draft, Cherepanov was selected by the New York Rangers {{in the first round of}} the draft, 17th overall. [...] Some attributed Cherepanov's lower draft selection to concerns about his availability for the NHL, considering the lack of a transfer agreement between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) concerning Russian players. [...] Analyst Pierre McGuire believed that Cherepanov was a legitimate NHL prospect, stating [...] "He was built for the new-age NHL with his speed, his skill and his ability to <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> offensively." [...] Cherepanov was excited to be selected by the Rangers, saying [...] "I believe that New York is the center of the United States and I'm very happy to be selected by the New York Rangers." ...|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "magic" [...] {{is used to}} {{translate}} the Egyptian term heka, which meant, as James P. Allen puts it, [...] "the ability to <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> by indirect means". Heka {{was believed to be}} a natural phenomenon, the force which was used to create the universe and which the gods employed to work their will. Humans could also use it, however, and magical practices were closely intertwined with religion. In fact, even the regular rituals performed in temples were counted as magic. [...] Individuals also frequently employed magical techniques for personal purposes. [...] Although these ends could be harmful to other people, no form of magic was considered inimical in itself. [...] Instead, magic was seen primarily as a way for humans to prevent or overcome negative events.|$|E
2500|$|Let me {{take you}} back to the winter of 1938: then as a young man, full of hope and {{ambition}} to play cricket for my county, I travelled from my place of work in the City of London to a sports complex at Leytonstone where Jack O'Connor and Stan Nichols looked after the cricketing side of the organisation. Arranging to practice in the nets three evenings a week, under the direction ot these two fine Essex and England cricketers, seemed to be an excellent way in which to get noticed and known in Essex cricketing circles, especially as previously I had been playing my cricket outside the county.

She also acts as a confidant to Amy, since Amy always seems to be visiting her mother when something in her life has gone wrong and she needs advice and consoling. Specific to tragicomedy, Esme is Amy's teacher, giving her examples of how to live her life and how to give her love.|$|R

5000|$|Herbert Gold {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The New York Times in 1987: [...] "Like {{the ceiling of the}} hotel room, the narration is transparent, revealing a hallucinatory loneliness, a presence out of time, a soul floating in Middle and Eastern Europe. None of this is mere cafe surrealism or angst; one of Roth's achievements is to give a sense of strict accuracy; his story is a laconic scenario, with characters offered like facts." [...] Gold continued: [...] "Roth's swift style <b>makes</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> naturally; we see, hear, smell and believe. A joyous storyteller's gift remains precariously alive within the pessimism of decay and loss. Although the teller of the tale says 'there is no end there, no break - always continuity and connection,' his art is kind and draws us to a satisfying conclusion after the luridness of events." ...|$|R

The community does not have ideas about why road construction has been abandoned. The challenges that face Thulamela Municipality include corruption and nepotism, poor public communication, lack of consultation and poor level of communication. The lack of involvement by local government in the community through the Integrated Development Plan (IDP), makes it difficult for communities to participate.
