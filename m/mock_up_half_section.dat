The paper will discuss basic structures of ADaM data sets. It will also discuss how ADaM data sets are built from <b>Mock</b> <b>Up</b> tables. The paper will provide examples of <b>Mock</b> <b>Up</b> tables, ADaM data sets and SAS codes that generate final numbers of <b>Mock</b> <b>Up</b> tables from ADaM data sets. INSTRUCTION OF BDS The BDS is the standard domain structure in ADaM. The BDS is designed as one or more records per subject per analysis parameter per analysis time point. One of the main purposes of ADaM BDS is analysis-ready, meaning that all the numbers in the final report should be calculated with one procedure in SAS. The naming convention of BDS is ADxxxxxx...|$|R
5000|$|When Hughes {{was brought}} in to look at a scale <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> of the Excalibur's cabin, he was not pleased with the outcome and stated [...] "It's not what I expected". Hughes later had Raymond Loewy {{redesign}} the cabin to his liking. A complete life sized <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> of the Excalibur was eventually constructed with battery operated retractable landing gear. The gear mechanisms were tested on the <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> for design validation before production began. The powerplant itself was tested on a PV-1 Ventura which was nicknamed [...] "Vent-ellation" [...] for the occasion. The name [...] "Excalibur" [...] was later dropped as the new aircraft had nothing in common with the original L-044 design. The name [...] "Constellation" [...] was picked up as an unofficial nickname until the intervention of the military.|$|R

2500|$|In {{respect of}} {{constant}} resistance filters, the term <b>half</b> <b>section</b> has {{a somewhat different}} meaning to other kinds of image filter. [...] Generally, a <b>half</b> <b>section</b> is formed by cutting through {{the midpoint of the}} series impedance and shunt admittance of a full section of a ladder network. [...] It is literally <b>half</b> a <b>section.</b> [...] Here, however, there is a somewhat different definition. [...] A <b>half</b> <b>section</b> is either the series impedance (series half-section) or shunt admittance (shunt half-section) that, when connected between source and load impedances of R0, will result in the same transfer function as some arbitrary constant resistance circuit. [...] The purpose of using <b>half</b> <b>sections</b> is that the same functionality is achieved with a drastically reduced component count.|$|R
