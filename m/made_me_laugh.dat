2500|$|As {{had been}} prophesied in Mamre the {{previous}} year, Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, {{on the first}} anniversary of the covenant of circumcision. Abraham was [...] "an hundred years old", when his son whom he named Isaac was born; and he circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, [...] "God hath <b>made</b> <b>me</b> to <b>laugh,</b> so that all that hear will laugh with me." [...] Isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned, Abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion. During the celebration, however, Sarah found Ishmael mocking; an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of Isaac.|$|R

[...] "It is {{a comfort}} {{to think that}} we are going to get rid of him, O'Connor; he is enough to demoralize a whole brigade, to say nothing of a battalion, and the worst of it is he respects no one. I am as {{convinced}} as can be that it was he who fastened that baste of a bird in my shako the other day, and <b>made</b> <b>me</b> the <b>laughing</b> stock of the whole regiment on parade. Faith, I could not for the life of me make out what was the matter, there was a tugging and a jumping and a fluttering overhead, and I thought the shako was going to fly away. It fairly gave me a scare, for I thought the shako had gone mad, and that the divil was in it. I have often overlooked his tricks for your sake, but when it comes to his commanding officer, it is too serious altogether." ...|$|R
500|$|USA Today writer Whitney Matheson {{called the}} episode [...] "the funniest ep this season" [...] and that [...] "it also ranks {{as one of}} the best since Steve Carell's {{departure}} in 2011". She lauded Flannery's performance, writing that [...] "the actress has never <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> harder than on last night's episode". Mark Trammell of TV Equals called the episode [...] "excellent"; he was particularly pleased with the episode's humor. Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode four out of five stars and said that it allowed Meredith, who until the episode had been [...] "a mostly one-dimensional source of promiscuity jokes" [...] to have [...] "two dimensions for once". He also applauded Fischer's performance, writing that it [...] "would make for a terrific Emmy submission episode".|$|E

IGN writer Cindy White, although {{noting that the}} episode [...] "had some big obstacles to overcome" [...] with the absences of both Michael Scott and Pam Halpert," [...] concluded that the episode had a [...] "high rewatch factor." [...] She wrote, [...] "If my Christmas wish was to watch an episode of The Office that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> a lot, consider that wish granted." [...] She ultimately gave the episode 8.0/10. M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+". Margaret Lyons from New York wrote a mostly positively review, saying Christmas Wishes' filled me with holiday cheer, proving that there's still some juice left in this show," [...] before noting that [...] "There are still some issues left, too, though." [...] What Culture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer praised Mindy Kaling and Ed Helms' writing and directing work, and said, [...] "If {{this is what happens}} when cast members ... take the reins then the writing and directing duties should be kept in house much more often." ...|$|E

In 2008, she {{starred in the}} Doctor Who episode [...] "Midnight", playing an intergalactic Hostess alongside David Tennant's Tenth Doctor. In 2009, Ayola starred in the CBBC musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. She stated: [...] "The script <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud when I read it. [...] I also {{like the fact that}} there were a lot of correct boxes being ticked, but the writers and producer haven't been restrained by that. [...] "So, instead of bowing to this altar, they've said, 'Okay, we have this family that's half-black, half-white, half-American, half-British. We have a mix of boys and girls, one character who's mixed-raced and deaf – but we're not going to be restrained by any of that. We're not going to tiptoe around Martha's disability or anything.' I liked that. It wasn't some sort of reverential hands-off approach to what we're presenting." [...] She has also been cast in the film Dredd. She will join the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at the Palace Theatre, London from 24 May 2017, playing the role of Hermione Granger.|$|E

But she was vexed and angry with herself for not having seen this little mark, and for having herself lost all clue as to which was her child. I told her that as she had intended to change them she could have cared nothing for her own boy, and that her only object could have been to make money.|$|R

500|$|In October 1839, Ralph Waldo Emerson {{was seeking}} an editor for his transcendentalist journal The Dial. After several {{declined}} the position, he {{offered it to}} Fuller, referring to her as [...] "my vivacious friend." [...] Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835; of that meeting, he admitted [...] "she <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> more than I liked." [...] The next summer, Fuller spent two weeks at Emerson's home in Concord. Fuller accepted Emerson's offer to edit The Dial on October 20, 1839, and began work {{in the first week}} of 1840. She edited the journal for its first two years from 1840 to 1842, though her promised annual salary of $200 was never paid. Because of her role, she was soon recognized as one of the most important figures of the transcendental movement and was invited to George Ripley's Brook Farm, a communal experiment. Fuller never officially joined the community but was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there. In the summer of 1843, she traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, New York; while there, she interacted with several Native Americans, including members of the Ottawa and the Chippewa tribes. She reported her experiences in a book called Summer on the Lakes, which she completed writing on her 34th birthday in 1844. The critic Evert Augustus Duyckinck called it [...] "the only genuine book, I can think of, this season." [...] Fuller used the library at Harvard College to do research on the Great Lakes region, and became the first woman allowed to use Harvard's library.|$|E

[...] "I had been feeling bad for so long, I wanted to laugh." [...] But in December 1991, just nine months later, they divorced; the marriage, {{according}} to Holliday, [...] "ran out of steam." [...] She explained of Meadows: [...] "We just didn't know each other well enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|A third {{sequel to}} Gamesmanship, was {{published}} in 1958 under the title of Supermanship. Its publisher, Rupert Hart-Davis, privately wrote of the book, [...] "Gamesmanship <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> a lot, and its two successors were just good enough (all three still sell prodigiously), but the world has moved (deathwards, you may say) {{in the last ten}} years, and Potter hasn't budged an inch. In truth the joke is played out, but he won't face the fact. This manuscript consists of a bunch of marginal articles, written during the past six years and slung together with the minimum of care." [...] Some critics agreed. The New Yorker commented, [...] "his methods and the point of view behind them don't seem as funny or as sharp as they once did, possibly because they are no longer surprising, or possibly because he is getting a little tired of his own joke." [...] But Edmund Wilson remained a fan of Potter, praising [...] "the brevity and compactness of the presentation. As in any practical manual, the principles are stated and concisely illustrated. Nothing goes on too long." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith's comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. [...] "It was really great that in taking the movie, because I didn't plan on going back to work right away, but I was dying to work with Kevin. I never thought it would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can't do this right now. But it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny." [...] Initially, Lords had a topless scene in the movie, but refused since she would breastfeed in between the takes. Katie Morgan, another former pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.|$|E
2500|$|... 6.82 {{million people}} watched the episode. Coupled with that night's episode of King of the Hill, it won its {{hour in the}} 18-49 demographic. Since airing, the episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Rene Rosa of UGO wrote: [...] "When the self-referential jokes about the episode’s switch to HD were the things that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> the most, and they last only a few seconds, I realized something was not good. This may be 'The Sharpest. Episode. Ever.' but is definitely not the funniest. Still, there are some genuinely endearing bitter-sweet moments in the episode, [...] but still it’s not enough to drive the show into the un-chartable funny waters that it used to live in." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "If it seems like there's a lot going on, that's because there is. The episode could have easily been just one thing—Homer deals with his Vance inferiority complex, or he sets out to discover {{the truth of the}} election from the former principal, or it could have been entirely a flashback episode. But instead, The Simpsons tries to do all three, one for each commercial break. The show has been around for 20 years; I would imagine that there would be plenty to mine from digging deep into a simpler story line for 19 minutes. Instead, 'Take My Life, Please' crushes under the weight of its bloated plot—not to mention that the overexplanation of jokes wasn't helping matters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{major theme}} {{throughout}} {{the play is}} the contrast between Margaret and Henry, something which is introduced when they first meet. Henry thanks God for bringing Margaret to him, and exclaims [...] "For thou hast given me in this beauteous face/A world of earthly blessing to my soul,/If sympathy of love unite our thoughts" [...] (1.1.21–23). The irony here, much commented on by critics, is that this unity is exactly what does not happen – their thoughts never unite, and their contrasting and incompatible attitudes are seen time and again throughout the play. For example, after the false miracle, Henry is distraught and laments, [...] "O God, seest thou this and bear'st so long?" [...] (2.1.150), while Margaret's response is much more mundane; [...] "It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> to see the villain run" [...] (2.1.151). When Buckingham arrives to bring news to Henry of Eleanor's dabbling in necromancy, Henry's reaction is pious and sorrowful, [...] "O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,/Heaping confusion on their heads thereby" [...] (2.1.181–182). Margaret's response, however, is combative, using the news to forward her own agenda; [...] "Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest,/And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best" [...] (2.1.183–184). Later, when Horner and Thump are about to fight, Henry sees the contest as a sacred point of honour: [...] "A God's name, see the lists and all things fit;/Here let them end it, and God defend the right" [...] (2.3.54–55). Margaret however, is simply {{looking forward to a}} fight; [...] "For purposely therefore,/Left I the court to see this quarrel tried" [...] (2.3.52–53). Henry is [...] "fatally married to his polar opposite." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] when Abram was ninety-nine years old, God {{declared}} his new name: [...] "Abraham"– [...] "a father of many nations", {{and gave him}} the covenant of circumcision. God gave Sarai the new name [...] "Sarah", and blessed her. Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child [...] "Isaac" [...] (Hebrew yitschaq, [...] "laughter") and circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, [...] "God hath <b>made</b> <b>me</b> to <b>laugh,</b> [...] all that hear will laugh with me." [...] Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company. Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked.|$|R

Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh.</b> I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E
