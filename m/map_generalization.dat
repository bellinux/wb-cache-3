50|$|<b>Map</b> <b>generalization</b> is {{designed}} to reduce {{the complexities of the}} real world by strategically reducing ancillary and unnecessary details. One way that geospatial data can be reduced is through the selection process. The cartographer can select and retain certain elements that he/she deems the most necessary or appropriate. In this method, the most important elements stand out while lesser elements are left out entirely. For example, a directional map between two points may have lesser and un-traveled roadways omitted as not to confuse the map-reader. The selection of the most direct and uncomplicated route between the two points is the most important data, and the cartographer may choose to emphasize this.|$|E

40|$|Map {{data are}} usually {{derived from a}} source {{that is based on}} a {{particular}} scale of representation and hence are subject to a particular degree of <b>map</b> <b>generalization.</b> Attempts to display data at scales smaller than the source can result in spatial conflict, whereby map symbols become too close or overlap. Several <b>map</b> <b>generalization</b> operators may be applied to resolve the problem, including displacement. In this paper we address the problem of displacing multiple map objects in order to resolve graphic conflict. Each of n objects is assigned k candidate positions into which it can possibly move, resulting in a total of kn map realizations. The assumption is that some of these realizations will contain a reduced level of conflict. Generating and evaluating all realizations is however not practical, even for relatively small values of n and k. We present two iterative improvement algorithms, which limit the number of realizations processed. The first algorithm adopts a steepest gradient descent approach; the second uses simulated annealing. They are tested on a number of data sets and while both are successful in reducing conflict while limiting the number of realizations that are examined, the simulated annealing approach is superior with regard to the degree of conflict reduction. The approach adopted is regarded as generic, in the context of <b>map</b> <b>generalization,</b> in that it appears possible in principle to employ several <b>map</b> <b>generalization</b> operators combined with more sophisticated evaluation functions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Map</b> <b>generalization</b> is {{a process}} of {{producing}} maps at different levels of detail by retaining essential properties of the underlying geographic space. In this paper, we explore how the <b>map</b> <b>generalization</b> process can be guided by the underlying scaling of geographic space. The scaling of geographic space refers to the fact that in a geographic space small things are far more common than large ones. In the corresponding rank-size distribution, this scaling property is characterized by a heavy tailed distribution such as a power law, lognormal, or exponential function. In essence, any heavy tailed distribution consists of the head of the distribution (with a low percentage of vital or large things) and the tail of the distribution (with a high percentage of trivial or small things). Importantly, the low and high percentages constitute an imbalanced contrast, e. g., 20 versus 80. We suggest that <b>map</b> <b>generalization</b> is to retain the objects in the head and to eliminate or aggregate those in the tail. We applied this selection rule or principle to three generalization experiments, and found that the scaling of geographic space indeed underlies <b>map</b> <b>generalization.</b> We further relate the universal rule to Töpfer's radical law (or trained cartographers' decision making in general), and illustrate several advantages of the universal rule.
