40|$|A {{series of}} driving {{simulation}} pilot studies on various technologies for alertness <b>monitoring</b> (<b>head</b> position sensor, eye-gaze system), fitness-for-duty testing (two pupil-based systems), and alertness promotion (in-seat vibration system) {{has been conducted}} in Circadian Technologies’ Alertness Testbed. The results indicate that, all tested technologies show promise for monitoring/testing or preventing driver fatigue, respectively. However, particularly for fatigue monitoring, no single measure alone may be sensitive and reliable enough to quantify driver fatigue. Since alertness is a complex phenomenon, a multi-parametric approach needs to be used. Such a multi-sensor approach imposes challenges for online data interpretation. We suggest using a neural-fuzzy hybrid system for the automatic assessment of complex data streams for driver fatigue. The final system output can then be used to trigger the activation of alertness countermeasures...|$|E
40|$|<b>Monitoring</b> <b>head</b> {{position}} in persons with a {{traumatic brain injury}} may provide a means for independent powered mobility. Given the often limited residual functions of attending, visual processing, and motor control, the operation of an electric-powered wheelchair must be constantly monitored {{to ensure the safety}} of these users. Human-directed support is not always available and does not encourage independent mobility. The solution proposed for this problem is placement of a magnet on the rear of the person's head. Strategically placed linear analog Hall effect sensors that are fixed in a stationary headrest can then track the magnet; thus, accurately determining head positioning. With this proposed head tracking, a specialized interface to the electric-powered wheelchair controller can be used to ensure the person's head is attending the direction of travel asserted by a conventional, direction-sensing joystick...|$|E

We focused on the global transcriptome of serum samples of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients in comparison with healthy individuals. We compared gene expression patterns of 36 samples. Twenty-four participants including 16 HNSCC patients (from 12 patients we obtained blood samples 1 year posttreatment) and 8 control subjects were recruited. The Illumina HumanWG- 6 v 3 Expression BeadChip was used to profile and identify the differences in serum mRNA transcriptomes. We found 159 genes to be significantly changed (Storey’s P value < 0. 05) between normal and cancer serum specimens regardless of factors including p 53 and B-cell lymphoma family members (Bcl- 2, Bcl-XL). In contrast, there was no difference in gene expression between samples obtained before and after surgery in cancer patients. We suggest that microarray analysis of serum cRNA in patients with HNSCC should be suitable for refinement of early stage diagnosis of disease that can be important for development of new personalized strategies in diagnosis and treatment of tumours but is not suitable for monitoring further development of disease...|$|E

A total of 229 male Gulf War Veterans from the Ft Devens Cohort were categorized {{by a number of}} mTBIs reported. One-way ANOVA and chi-square test of independence were used to test for differences in total reported health symptoms and diagnosis of chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) or Kansas GWI criteria, two of the most common case definitions of GWI. A total of 72 veterans reported no mTBIs (31. 4 %), 26 reported one mTBI (11. 4 %), 25 reported two mTBIs (10. 9 %), and 106 veterans reported sustaining three or more mTBIs (46. 3 %). Veterans reporting two or more mTBIs (p < 0. 01) or three or more mTBIs (p < 0. 001) endorsed significantly higher rates of health symptoms than Veterans reporting no mTBIs. Significantly higher rates of CMI (p = 0. 035) and Kansas GWI criteria (p < 0. 001) were seen in the three or more mTBI group.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} satisfy the {{flexibility}} requirements of the fire fighting in some particular circumstances, a self-swinging control system with valve-controlled cylinder of the liquamatic fire water monitor was designed. The self-swinging control system was composed of water hydraulic cylinder, water hydraulic valve, water channel connection plate and mechanical feedback device. This controlled system was driven by the pressure water from the monitor body. The water hydraulic cylinder drives the <b>monitor</b> <b>head</b> to swing side by side, consequently, the cover areas of the jet water from the <b>monitor</b> <b>head</b> was increased. At the same time, the modeling and simulation analysis was carried out for the self-swinging control system using the AMESim software, the simulation {{results show that the}} self-swinging control system can self-swing in a particular frequency, and the frequency is increasing with the water pressure increasing...|$|R

Moreover {{it is known that}} linear growth in infancy is growth-hormone (GH) dependent. Therefore, aim of the study has been to compare head circumference measurements in children with hypopituitarism after L-thyroxine (L-T 4) therapy alone, before therapy with GH, and after GH was added to the therapy. Five infants (2 girls, 3 boys) with MPHD, diagnosed and treated before the age of 2 years and whose auxological parameters records during L-T 4 therapy alone were available, were retrospectively studied. Head circumference and length measurements were expressed as standard deviation score (SDS). Weight measurements were expressed as weight for length ratio percentage. Initially treated with L-T 4 alone for a mean period of 4, 5 months, there were neither positive effects on head circumference nor on linear growth. A significant catch-up growth was observed only employing GH therapy in addition to L-T 4 : mean head circumference SDS and length SDS increased respectively from - 2. 20 to - 0. 89 SDS and from - 4. 16 to - 0. 87 SDS after a mean period of 18 months of combined GH and L-T 4 therapy. Therefore, head circumference growth, in infancy, is growth hormone dependent as well as linear growth, and during GH treatment, <b>monitoring</b> <b>head</b> circumference growth is important as much as monitoring linear growth...|$|E
40|$|This paper, {{based on}} a real world case study (Limmat aquifer, Switzerland), compares inverse {{groundwater}} flow models calibrated with specified numbers of <b>monitoring</b> <b>head</b> locations. These models are updated in real time with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the prediction improvement is assessed {{in relation to the}} amount of monitoring locations used for calibration and updating. The prediction errors of the models calibrated in transient state are smaller if the amount of monitoring locations used for the calibration is larger. For highly dynamic groundwater flow systems a transient calibration is recommended as a model calibrated in steady state can lead to worse results than a noncalibrated model with a well-chosen uniform conductivity. The model predictions can be improved further with the assimilation of new measurement data from on-line sensors with the EnKF. Within all the studied models the reduction of 1 -day hydraulic head prediction error (in terms of mean absolute error [MAE]) with EnKF lies between 31 % (assimilation of head data from 5 locations) and 72 % (assimilation of head data from 85 locations). The largest prediction improvements are expected for models that were calibrated with only a limited amount of historical information. It is worthwhile to update the model even with few monitoring locations as it seems that the error reduction with EnKF decreases exponentially with the amount of monitoring locations used. These results prove the feasibility of data assimilation with EnKF also for a real world case and show that improved predictions of groundwater levels can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|Fugitive {{dust from}} {{quarrying}} and related extractive industry activities is a long-standing and intractable problem. Attempts to control emissions are directed by legislation and informed by statutory guidance, within the overall context {{of national and}} international air quality strategies. In many cases, local monitoring {{is a prerequisite for}} efficient development of dust suppression. In cases of dispute or of particular concern, it is often necessary to confidently attribute problem dust to one or more local source(s) – in effect to answer the fundamental question: whose dust is it? This contribution describes a method of dust source attribution developed by DustScan Ltd, which combines a simple and cost-effective technique for collecting ambient dust by direction, with multi-element analysis by plasma spectrometry. DustScan is a passive system for monitoring fugitive dust 360 ° around a replaceable sampling head. It uses a transparent, permanent adhesive, ‘sticky pad’ on a 70 mm diameter cylindrical <b>monitoring</b> <b>head.</b> Measurement of dust coverage on the sticky pads after monitoring uses a computer-based scanning system and bespoke software. The pattern of dusting on the sticky pad indicates the direction and scale of potential dust nuisance by direction. Given this information, samples may be taken according to suspected dust source, and subjected to a range of geochemical analyses including acid dissolution (HF-HNO 3) prior to analysis by ICPAES or ICP-MS. Rigorous blank correction procedures are essential to account for metallic components of the sticky pads themselves, but good results are obtained for a range of elements including Cu, As, Cd and Pb. Careful assessment of the data often allows sourcespecific elemental criteria to be established; the elemental fingerprints of dust type. In the simplest of cases, this is sufficient to identify the source of a problem dust, but more commonly some form of mixture deconvolution is required. Various intuitive graphical techniques have been successful in small-scale studies, but multivariate statistics and least-squares mass balance methods provide powerful tools for source attribution as the site database increases. Examples of the application of such techniques to a variety of extractive industry sites demonstrate the utility of the methods in the extractive industries and elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|Image {{quality is}} {{degraded}} by involuntary {{movement of the}} subject in an MRI scanner. It is fairly challenging in MRI of the brain to monitor the involuntary head movement accurately. Though {{there are a few}} techniques to monitor head movement of the subject for prospective motion correction, it is still an unsolved problem in MRI. In this study, head movement inside an MR scanner is monitored via measurement of changes in the voltage induced in head mounted coils by switched magnetic field gradients. The motion of a rigid body such as the human head is decomposed into two components: namely translation and rotation. There are three degrees of freedom (DOFs) for translational motion i. e. translation along the x, y and z axes and three rotational degrees of freedom for rotational motion i. e. rotation about the x, y and z axes. Head movement is monitored in a gradient field by measuring the change in induced voltage in head mounted coils. To calculate the change in induced voltage I follow two approaches: circular loops simulation, analytical as well as numerical calculations. I show that by using a standard method one can form a linear model to identify the position and orientation of the coils. An experimental arrangement is set up to check the validity of the analytical and numerical calculations. Experiments carried out with a rig of five coils verified that the changes in induced voltage in the coils is linear with respect to the changes in position of the coils. The linear model is also verified by comparing estimated positions obtained by using the coils to those found by image realignment of fast field echo (FFE) images using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). We experimentally evaluate the new approach for <b>monitoring</b> <b>head</b> movement inside an MR scanner, which exploits the linear variation of the voltages induced in a set of coils by time-varying magnetic field gradients with respect to small changes in position/orientation. This approach was tested by attaching five coils to a structured agar phantom and a healthy volunteer's head. The results suggest {{that it is possible to}} estimate the position and orientation with 0. 22 mm and 0. 24 ˚ root-mean-square error using this set-up. The new approach could be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. An experiment is also carried out by using free running EPI (Echo Planar Imaging) to track the head movement inside an MR scanner. There is a strong relation between head movement and EPI waveforms, the central point of the experiment is to track the head displacements via measuring induced voltage in the coils by using EPI waveforms during execution of free running EPI. The results obtained from the experiment reveal that the method is promising...|$|E
40|$|The Cerro Grande fire of 2000 had an {{enormously}} adverse impact on and around Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Immediately there were {{concerns about the}} potential for enhanced runoff/offsite transport of contaminant-laden sediments because of watershed damage. In response to this concern, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers installed a low-head weir in Los Alamos Canyon near the White Rock ''Y. '' However, the occurrence of fractured basalt at the surface and ponding of runoff behind the weir enhance the possibility of downward migration of contaminants. Therefore, three boreholes were drilled on the south bank of the channel by LANL to provide a means of monitoring the impact of the Cerro Grande fire and of the weir on water quality beneath the canyon. The boreholes and associated instrumentation are referred to as the Los Alamos Weir Site (LAWS). The three boreholes include a vertical hole and two angled holes (one at approximately 45 {sup o} and one at approximately 30 {sup o}). Since the basalt is highly fractured, the holes would not stay open. Plans called for inserting flexible liners into all holes. However, using liners in such unstable ground was problematic and, in the angled holes, required deployment through scalloped or perforated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) shield. The vertical hole (LAWS- 01), drilled to a total depth of 281. 5 ft below ground surface (bgs), was completed as a 278 -ft deep monitoring well with four screens: one targeting shallow perched water encountered at 80 ft, two in what may correspond to the upper perched zone at regional groundwater characterization well R- 9 i (1 / 4 mi. to the west), and one in what may correspond to the lower perched zone at R- 9 i. A Water FLUTe{trademark} system deployed in the well isolates the screened intervals; associated transducers and sampling ports permit <b>monitoring</b> <b>head</b> and water quality in the screened intervals. The second hole (LAWS- 02), drilled at an angle of 43 {sup o} from horizontal, is 156 ft long and bottoms at a depth of 106 ft bgs. The shallow perched water seen at LAWS- 01 (at 80 ft) was not encountered. A scalloped PVC shield was installed to keep the hole open while permitting flexible liners to contact the borehole wall. It was initially instrumented with a color-reactive liner to locate water-producing fractures. That was later replaced by an absorbent liner to collect water from the vadose zone. The third hole (LAWS- 03), drilled at an angle of 34 {sup o} from horizontal, initially had a length of 136 ft and bottomed at a depth of 76 ft bgs. However, the PVC shield rotated during installation such that scallops were at the top and rock debris repeatedly fell in, preventing liner insertion. While pulling the scalloped PVC to replace it with a perforated PVC shield that did not require orientation, the scalloped PVC broke and only 85 ft was recovered. The hole was blocked at that position and could not be drilled out with the equipment available. Thus, LAWS- 03 was completed at a length of 85 ft and a depth of 40 ft bgs. An absorbent liner was installed at the outset in preparation for the 2002 summer monsoon season. The entire monitoring site is enclosed inside a locked, 8 -ft-high chainlink fence for security. The liners used in the angled boreholes carry electrical wire pairs to detect soil-moisture changes. Surface-water data are provided by stream gages above and below the weir site. Depth of ponding behind the weir is provided by a gage installed just behind the structure...|$|E
