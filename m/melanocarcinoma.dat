40|$|Using {{a silver}} {{staining}} technique, nucleolar organiser regions {{were identified in}} routinely processed paraffin sections {{of a range of}} dermal melanotic lesions. The technique shows argyrophilic NOR associated proteins (AgNORs), which are seen in nuclei as black dots. Although the nuclei of <b>melanocarcinoma</b> in situ, <b>melanocarcinoma</b> per se, and lentigo maligna contained similar numbers of AgNORs, in melanocarcinomas a mean of 7. 9 AgNORs per nucleus was found, while in naevocellular naevi, this figure was 1. 2. The AgNOR method, which is unknown to most histopathologists, could perhaps be used quantitatively or semiquantitatively to assist in the diagnosis of melanotic lesions in the skin (and elsewhere) ...|$|E
40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} or <b>melanocarcinoma</b> {{arising from}} melanocytes {{is one of}} the most rapidly spreading malignant tumor of the skin can occur at all ages, but is a rare before puberty. Malignant melanoma is relatively common neoplasm that not long ago was considered almost uniformly deadly. The great preponderance of melanomas arises in the skin; other sites of origin include the oral and anogenital mucosal surfaces, esophagus, meninges and notably the eye. Breast is a very uncommon site for malignant melanoma; here, we present a case of malignant melanoma of male breast with nodal metastasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{malignant}} melanoma is a neoplasia that originates from melanocites. Its uncontrolled growing is manifested initially as a macula that, while evolutioning, conforms a strongly pigmented tumor, at times ulcerated and hemorrhaged, {{that tends to}} grow progressively in size, it has a high metastatic potential and an unfavorable prognosis. In this work, a case evaluated in the Coloproctology Service of the Universitary Hospital ¨Dr. Gustavo Aldereguia Lima¨, of Cienfuegos, is exposed, corresponding to an 87 year old female patient, with an exuberant perianal lesion, submitted to surgical intervention to better her life quality. Based in the histopathological study, it was diagnosed as <b>melanocarcinoma.</b> </strong...|$|E
40|$|THE lesions now {{generally}} {{described as}} tumours of retinal anlage occur in infants {{under the age}} of 12 months and are usually situated in the maxilla. The first case of retinal anlage tumour to be designated as such was reported by Halpert and Patzer (1947) and 6 more cases have since been recorded, but it has also become apparent that the melanotic epithelial odontome reported years before by Mummery and Pitts (1926), together with the pigmented ameloblastomas or adamantinomas subsequently recorded by other authors, should be considered in the same context. Moreover, there are cases of tumours of the jaws in infants described as <b>melanocarcinomas</b> or melanomas which would appear to warrant consideration. In all, there are 20 cases in the literature which have been reported under one or other of the designations already mentioned and which seem to fall into a single group. These cases comprise 14 tumours of the maxilla, 4 of the mandible, 1 of the skull and 1 of the epididymis, and an additional case of a maxillary tumour is reported here. The age, sex, site of tumour and designation of these cases are summarised in Table I...|$|R
40|$|Melanotic {{neuroectodermal tumor}} of in-fancy (MNETI) {{is also known}} as {{pigmented}} neuroectodermal tumor of infancy, melan-otic prognoma, retinal anlage tumor, pig-mented epulis of infancy and congenital <b>melanocarcinoma.</b> It is a rare neoplasm, occuring primarily in maxilla and mandi-ble of infants. Till 1990 about 200 cases had been recorded in world literature(l, 2). We report a case with this entity. Case Report A two and a half month old male infant presented with gradually increasing swell-ing in the upper jaw for one month. The swelling involved the alveolus of the upper left incisor region and measured 1. 5 x 1. 5 cm. It was firm in consistency and extend-ed into the hard palate. The overlying mu-cous membrane was uninvolved. Systemic examination revealed no other significant abnormality. X-Rays of the skull (PA and lateral views) showed a lytic lesion in the hard palate. Urinary level of vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) was elevated. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the lesion was done with a 10 ml disposable sy...|$|E
40|$|THE {{pigmented}} tumour of the jaw of infants, though rare, is {{well known}} to oral pathologists. Probably, it was first described by Krompecher (1918), who reported it as a congenital <b>melanocarcinoma.</b> Since then there has been considerable debate on the histogenesis of the lesion. Typically, the tumour arises in the jaws, especially the maxilla, of infants under 12 months of age. There have also been reports of tumours of similar histology arising {{in other parts of}} the body. Though two such specimens, one from the anterior fontanelle and the other from the mediastinum have been studied by electron microscopy (Misugi et al., 1965; Neustein, 1967), no details of the electron microscopy of oral tumours have been published. It has seemed important, therefore, to confirm the reported similarity between the extra-oral tumours and those of the jaws by examining the ultrastructure of a typical oral example. The results are reported here. Clinicalfeatures The patient was a female infant aged 7 weeks, with a swelling of the maxill...|$|E
40|$|Nitidine and Fagaronine, two benzophenanthridine alkaloids, {{have shown}} {{antitumor}} activity in animal studies. Nitidine exhibits activity against L 1210 and P 388 mouse leukemias and {{is reported to}} have curative activity against Lewis lung carcinoma. Fagaronine is known to prolong life in mice possessing P 388 leukemia. However, due to their acute toxicity, both nitidine and fagaronine have been dropped from the NCI screening program. ^ As part of an ongoing program to synthesize potential antineoplastic agents, the synthesis and antitumor evaluation of analogs of nitidine and fagaronine was undertaken. The focal point of these syntheses has been the condensation reaction between Schiff bases and anhydrides. This has culminated in the total synthesis of five indenoisoquinolinium analogs and four phenylisoquinolinium analogs of nitidine and fagaronine. In addition, a new route to 4 -phenylisoquinolinium salts was discovered. This research has also lead to the discovery of a new lead tetraacetate reaction where a carboxylic acid was shown to generate an alkyne and a tertiary alcohol in unprecedented fashion. ^ The target compounds have shown promising antitumor activity. The indenoisoquinoline analog of nitidine, a tumor panel compound, has shown significant antitumor activity against P 388 lymphocytic leukemia, L 1210 lymphoid leukemia, B 16 <b>melanocarcinoma</b> and M 5076 ovarian carcinoma. The analog is also an effective inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. The three tested indenoisoquinoline analogs of fagaronine have all displayed activity against P 388 lymphocytic leukemia. The tested phenylisoquinolinium analog of nitidine was cytotoxic but totally devoid of antitumor activity. The corresponding fagaronine analog is awaiting screening. ^ This study has shown that the indeno(1, 2 -c) isoquinolines, like the benzo c phenanthridines, also seem to require a flat molecular topology for antitumor activity. Methoxy substitution at the C- 10 position does not hinder the antitumor activity. ...|$|E
