25|$|The {{cardholder}} of a {{secured credit}} card is still {{expected to make}} regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the card issuer has the option of recovering {{the cost of the}} purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit. The advantage of the secured card for an individual with negative or no credit history is that most companies report regularly to the <b>major</b> <b>credit</b> bureaus. This allows building a positive credit history.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{there are}} {{security}} features {{present on the}} physical card itself {{in order to prevent}} counterfeiting. For example, most modern credit cards have a watermark that will fluoresce under ultraviolet light. Most <b>major</b> <b>credit</b> cards have a hologram.

25|$|Wilmington {{has become}} a {{national}} financial center for the credit card industry, largely due to regulations enacted by former Governor Pierre S. du Pont, IV in 1981. The Financial Center Development Act of 1981, among other things, eliminated the usury laws enacted by most states, thereby removing the cap on interest rates that banks may legally charge customers. Many <b>major</b> <b>credit</b> card issuers, including Bank of America (formerly MBNA Corporation), Chase Card Services (part of JPMorgan Chase & Co., formerly Bank One/First USA), and Barclays Bank of Delaware (formerly Juniper Bank), are headquartered in Wilmington. The Dutch banking giant ING Groep N.V. headquartered its U.S. internet banking unit, ING Direct (now Capital One 360), in Wilmington. The United Kingdom's HSBC has their American operations headquartered in Wilmington. Wilmington Trust is headquartered in Wilmington at Rodney Square. Barclays and Capital One 360 have very large and prominent locations located along the waterfront of the Christina River. In 1988, the Delaware legislature enacted a law which required a would-be acquirer to capture 85 percent of a Delaware chartered corporation's stock in a single transaction or wait three years before proceeding. This law strengthened Delaware's position as {{a safe haven for}} corporate charters during an especially turbulent time filled with hostile takeovers.|$|E
