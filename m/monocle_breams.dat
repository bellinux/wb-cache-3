40|$|Preferential use of {{one side}} of the body for {{cognitive}} or behavioural tasks (lateralization) is common in many animals, including humans. However, few studies have demonstrated whether lateralization is phenotypically plastic, and varies depending on the ecological context. We studied lateralization (measured as a turning preference) in the bridled <b>monocle</b> <b>bream</b> (Scolopsis bilineatus). This coral reef fish is commonly infected by a large, ectoparasitic isopod (Anilocra nemipteri) that attaches to the left or right side of its host's head. Fish that were parasitized showed no turning bias with respect to the side on which the parasite had attached. On average, however, parasitised fish were significantly more lateralized (i. e. had a strong side bias) than unparasitized fish. The extent of lateralization declined significantly when we experimentally removed the parasite. Our results indicate that lateralization can vary with the ecological context. One possible explanation is that lateralization shortens the response time until fish flee after encountering a predator. A stronger side bias might be advantageous for parasitized individuals to overcome their recently documented lower maximum swimming speed...|$|R
40|$|Ectoparasites {{can reduce}} {{individual}} fitness by negatively affecting behavioural, morphological and physiological traits. In fishes, there are potential costs if ectoparasites decrease streamlining, thereby directly compromising swimming performance. Few {{studies have examined}} the effects of ectoparasites on fish swimming performance and none distinguish between energetic costs imposed by changes in streamlining and effects on host physiology. The bridled <b>monocle</b> <b>bream</b> (Scolopsis bilineatus) is parasitized by an isopod (Anilocra nemipteri), which attaches above the eye. We show that parasitized fish have higher standard metabolic rates (SMRs), poorer aerobic capacities and lower maximum swimming speeds than non-parasitized fish. Adding a model parasite did not affect SMR, but reduced maximum swimming speed and elevated oxygen consumption rates at high speeds to levels observed in naturally parasitized fish. This demonstrates that ectoparasites create drag effects that are important at high speeds. The higher SMR of naturally parasitized fish does, however, reveal an effect of parasitism on host physiology. This effect was easily reversed: fish whose parasite was removed 24 h earlier did not differ from unparasitized fish in any performance metrics. In sum, the main cost of this ectoparasite is probably its direct effect on streamlining, reducing swimming performance at high speeds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two new, one {{known and}} three {{unidentified}} {{species of the}} nematode family Camallanidae are reported and described from the intestines of marine perciform fishes off the southwestern coast of New Caledonia, South Pacific: Camallanus carangis Olsen, 1952 from the forked-tailed threadfin bream Nemipterus furcosus (Nemipteridae), the yellowstriped goatfish Upeneus vittatus and the whitesaddle goatfish Parupeneus ciliatus (both Mullidae) (new host records); Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) variolae sp. n. from the white-edged lyretail Variola albimarginata (type host) and the blacktip grouper Epinephelus fasciatus (both Serranidae); Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) longus sp. n. from the twotone tang Zebrasoma scopas (Acanthuridae); Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. 1 (female tail with 2 terminal spikes on a digit-like projection) from the speckled sand-perch Parapercis hexophtalma (Pinguipedidae); Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. 2 (female tail with 1 spike on a digit-like projection) from the drab emperor Lethrinus ravus (Lethrinidae) and Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. 3 (female tail with a smooth digit-like protrusion) from the two-lined <b>monocle</b> <b>bream</b> Scolopsis bilineata (Nemipteridae). Camallanus paracarangis Velasquez, 1980 is synonymized with C. carangis. Several additional species of Camallanus from marine fish of the Indo-Pacific region may be synonymous with C. carangis as it has a poorly sclerotized left spicule and 3 small caudal projections on the tail of young (i. e., non-gravid) females. The fourth-stage larva of C. carangis is described for the first time. P. (S.) variolae differ...|$|R
40|$|Metabolic {{rates of}} aquatic organisms are {{estimated}} from measurements of oxygen consumption rates (Mo 2) through swimming and resting respirometry. These distinct approaches are increasingly used in ecophysiology and conservation physiology studies; however, {{few studies have}} tested whether they yield comparable results. We examined whether two fundamental Mo 2 measures, standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR), vary based on the method employed. Ten bridled <b>monocle</b> <b>bream</b> (Scolopsis bilineata) were exercised using (1) a critical swimming speed (Ucrit) protocol, (2) a 15 min exhaustive chase protocol and (3) a 3 min exhaustive chase protocol followed by brief (1 min) air exposure. Protocol 1 was performed in a swimming respirometer whereas protocols 2 and 3 were followed by resting respirometry. SMR estimates in swimming respirometry {{were similar to those}} in resting respirometry when a three-parameter exponential or power function was used to extrapolate the swimming speed–Mo 2 relationship to zero swimming speed. In contrast, MMR using the Ucrit protocol was 36 % higher than MMR derived from the 15 min chase protocol and 23 % higher than MMR using the 3 min chase/ 1 min air exposure protocol. For strong steady (endurance) swimmers, such as S. bilineata, swimming respirometry can produce more accurate MMR estimates than exhaustive chase protocols because oxygen consumption is measured during exertion. However, when swimming respirometry is impractical, exhaustive chase protocols should be supplemented with brief air exposure to improve measurement accuracy. Caution is warranted when comparing MMR estimates obtained with different respirometry methods unless they are cross-validated on a species-specific basis...|$|R
40|$|Survival {{depends on}} escape {{responses}} {{and when to}} flee a predator. As a result, factors affecting the escape performance of prey species, including parasite infection, may profoundly influence the outcome of predator–prey encounters. Several hypotheses predict the responses of prey to simulated predator attacks based on intrinsic characteristics such as individual reproductive value and flight costs: as predation risk and reproductive value increase, so should the distance at which an organism begins to flee an escaping predator (flight initiation distance; FID). Conversely, FID should decrease if the costs of fleeing are high. Despite providing testable hypotheses, rarely have these theories been used to predict the escape behaviour of parasitized individuals. The bridled <b>monocle</b> <b>bream,</b> Scolopsis bilineata, is parasitized by a large cymothoid isopod, Anilocra nemipteri, which attaches above the eye. In this species, ectoparasite infection is associated with increased energy costs and decreased endurance. We investigated the effects of infection on escape performance and FID. Maximum velocity, maximum acceleration, cumulative distance travelled and response latency did not differ between parasitized fish, unparasitized fish and fish that had their parasite experimentally removed. Parasitized fish were smaller, on average, than unparasitized individuals. Smaller, parasitized individuals allowed a threat to approach closer before fleeing (shorter FID) than larger parasitized or uninfected individuals. Since parasite infection has known effects on host growth and metabolism, we suggest that parasitism alters fish escape behaviour as predicted by two nonexclusive hypotheses: (1) by decreasing reproductive value (the asset protection hypothesis) and (2) by increasing the relative costs of fleeing (the economic hypothesis) compared with uninfected and large parasitized fish. The relative importance of each hypothesis in driving the trends observed remains to be tested...|$|R
