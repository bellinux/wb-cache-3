5|$|Organisms differ {{according}} {{to the number of}} constructed <b>molecules</b> <b>in</b> their cells. Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex organic <b>molecules</b> <b>in</b> cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Axons {{transmit}} {{signals to}} other neurons {{by means of}} specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to receptor <b>molecules</b> <b>in</b> the membrane of the target cell.|$|E

5|$|In 1864, Scottish {{organic chemist}} Alexander Crum Brown began to draw {{pictures}} of <b>molecules,</b> <b>in</b> which he enclosed the symbols for atoms in circles, and used broken lines {{to connect the}} atoms together {{in a way that}} satisfied each atom's valence.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, M.

40|$|The simple {{molecular}} connectivity {{indices are}} analysed {{for the information}} in the bond terms.

5|$|In an {{analogous}} manner to zirconium and hafnium, rutherfordium {{is projected to}} form a very stable, refractory oxide, RfO2.

5|$|Increased {{experimental}} precision {{combined with}} vastly improved scientific instrumentation was opening up exciting new fields.

5|$|Non-{{professional}} phagocytes {{are more}} limited than professional phagocytes {{in the type}} of particles they can take up.
