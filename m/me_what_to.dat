During a 1945 press conference while coach at Pittsburgh, Shaughnessy responded to criticism {{that he had been}} too conservative in a 6–0 win over [...] and taken too many risks in a 39–9 loss to Notre Dame. He said, [...] "You tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.

500|$|Eidelman's {{previous}} project had been creating {{a compilation of}} music from the past five Star Trek films, and he consciously avoided taking inspiration from those scores. [...] " [...] showed <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> stay away from, because I couldn't do James Horner [...] as well as James Horner," [...] he said. Since he was hired early on in production, Eidelman had an unusually long time to develop his ideas, {{and he was able}} to visit the sets during filming. While the film was in early production Eidelman worked on electronic drafts of the final score, to placate executives who were unsure about using a relatively unknown composer.|$|E

500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up listening to all of that great [...] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's {{one of those things where}} the film will tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E
500|$|With the {{new season}} of the J.League commencing in March 1995, Wenger set about {{assembling}} his squad and backroom staff. He hired former Valenciennes manager Boro Primorac, whom he had befriended during the match-fixing scandal, as his assistant. Alexandre Torres joined Nagoya after Wenger identified the defender by watching Brazilian football on the television, and the manager brought in Franck Durix and his former player Passi. Nagoya finished bottom of the J.League the season before Wenger's arrival, and continued their poor form into the following campaign, losing several matches in a row. In response to the situation, Wenger altered his managerial style, becoming less amicable with his players and openly questioning their desire. To boost morale, he took his squad to Versailles for their mid-season break, where they went through a rigorous, but creative, training regime. Players were expected to make decisions for themselves on the pitch, instead of relying on the manager; Wenger {{was reported to have}} shouted to his players [...] "Don't look at me to ask <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the ball!" [...] and [...] "Decide for yourself! Why don't you think it out?" [...] One player who greatly benefited from Wenger's guidance was Dragan Stojković, a midfielder whose disciplinary record improved considerably.|$|E
500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And {{it has nothing to do}} with me, except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E

500|$|U2 {{found that}} they were neither {{prepared}} nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and {{felt that they were}} not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of [...] "Mysterious Ways". During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar and held it out to Bono, saying, [...] "You tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> play and I'll play it. You want to play it yourself? Go ahead." [...] With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' [...] "desire to hold on to solid song structures". Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song [...] "One". While working on [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—The Edge played two separate chord progressions sequentially on guitar at Lanois' encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became [...] "One". It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing [...] "blank page approach" [...] to writing and recording together.|$|E
500|$|Unhappy {{with the}} quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band {{recorded}} another live album—titled Live Evil—during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "In My Eyes" [...] {{utilizes}} tingling synths. Colly {{said that}} Robyn is [...] "an encouraging den mother" [...] on the song, singing [...] "Little star, I got you. You'll be okay."

[...] The second track, [...] "Include Me Out" [...] {{was referred to as}} [...] "digitised stop-start funk". The song begins with the line, [...] "It is really very simple, just a single pulse repeated at a regular interval", which according to O'Neill described [...] "the main sonic trick employed on a lot of her dance-ready songs." [...] On the song, Robyn plays a party-starter that is [...] "repping matriarchs and cross-dressers alike" [...] with the line [...] "This one's for the granny, take a bow... Come on all you trannies, click your heels for me." [...] "Hang with Me", carries a [...] "fierce, club-wrecking beat", with [...] "relentlessly energetic bass" [...] and synth arpeggios. Lyrically, the song speaks of trust in a relationship, with lines such as [...] "Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said that the song views [...] "the perspective of someone who's a bit too tightly buttoned-up to let her defences down." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Love Kills" [...] was described as a [...] "discofied, sharp-edged" [...] song, with fierce vocals and [...] "haunting Pet Shop Boys flourishes." [...] "We Dance to the Beat" [...] is a techno song, with an [...] "apocalyptic, big-beat". It features a [...] "sort of spoken-word hype-up jam" [...] that was compared to [...] "Don't Fucking Tell <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>to</b> Do". The song features lines such as [...] "We dance to the beat of your brains not evolving fast enough" [...] and [...] "We dance to the beat of bad kissers clicking teeth." ...|$|E

They costarred again in three more hits, Love (1927), A Woman of Affairs (1928), and Queen Christina (1933).

Gauci explained, [...] "That's where I {{came out of my}} shell. I didn't have anyone telling <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Tune in Tokyo is just one part of what I want to do.

2500|$|... "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?" [...] {{was written}} by Al Jean and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). American actor Ed Asner guest starred in the episode as the newspaper editor that hires Homer. The character is based on Lou Grant, the character Asner played in the series The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. The episode features several other references to popular culture. For example, the song Homer sings upon being given the food critic job is set to the tune of [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] from the musical West Side Story. The restaurant Planet Springfield is a parody of Planet Hollywood, containing items such as the film script for The Cable Guy (1996), Herbie from The Love Bug (1968), a model of the RMS Titanic from Titanic (1997), an alien similar to those from Mars Attacks! (1996), models of a TIE fighter, an X-wing fighter and C-3PO from the Star Wars saga, as well as [...] "the coffee mug" [...] from the film Heartbeeps (1981) and [...] "the cane" [...] from Citizen Kane (1941), which is not a real prop.
