5|$|The {{chemistry}} of hafnium and zirconium is so similar {{that the two}} cannot be separated {{on the basis of}} differing chemical reactions. The melting points and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> in the {{chemistry of}} these twin elements.|$|E
5|$|A 2000 UK {{systematic}} review (York) found that water fluoridation {{was associated with}} a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences.|$|E

5|$|Aside from Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, master gunnery {{sergeant}} (MGySgt) and {{sergeant major}} {{are the highest}} enlisted ranks in the Marine Corps; however, there are far fewer master gunnery sergeants than sergeants major. One of the <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> between the two E-9 ranks is that master gunnery sergeants retain their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), while sergeants major are given a new MOS to reflect their general command focus. This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider of technical military leadership.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD has {{similarities}} with Linux, {{with two}} <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> {{in scope and}} licensing: FreeBSD maintains a complete operating system, i.e. the project delivers kernel, device drivers, userland utilities and documentation, as opposed to Linux delivering a kernel and drivers only and relying on third-parties for system software; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license {{as opposed to the}} copyleft GPL used by Linux.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> from them.|$|E

5|$|The {{phonology}} of the Irish language {{varies from}} dialect to dialect; {{there is no}} standard pronunciation of Irish. Therefore, {{this article focuses on}} phenomena that pertain generally to most or all dialects, and on the <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> among the dialects. Detailed discussion of the dialects {{can be found in the}} specific articles: Ulster Irish, Connacht Irish, and Munster Irish.|$|E
5|$|This {{similarity}} {{results in}} nearly identical chemical behavior {{and in the}} formation of similar chemical compounds. The chemistry of hafnium is so similar to that of zirconium that a separation on chemical reactions was not possible; only the physical properties of the compounds differ. The melting points and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> in the chemistry of these twin elements. Titanium is considerably different from the other two owing to the effects of the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to thallium in the boron group. Nihonium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium, and behave as a post-transition metal, although it should also show several <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> from them. Unlike all the other p-block elements, it may be able to involve its d-electrons in bonding, although these predictions are disputed.|$|E
50|$|The proof {{methodology}} {{is similar}} to that for Theorem 2; the <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> is to take node weights into consideration.|$|R
50|$|The <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> {{with other}} dialects {{is in the}} {{phonology}} (sound system and pronunciation). Voice quality differences are noticeably apparent.|$|R
50|$|Chemo-tropism is {{different}} from Chemotaxis, the <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> being that chemo-tropism is related to growth, while chemotaxis is related to locomotion.|$|R
5|$|Moscovium is an {{extremely}} radioactive element: its most stable known isotope, moscovium-290, has a half-life of only 0.8seconds. In the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest pnictogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as a heavier homologue of the pnictogen bismuth. Moscovium is calculated to have some properties similar to its lighter homologues, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, and to be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> from them. About 100 atoms of moscovium have been observed to date, all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from 287 to 290.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{are often}} {{compared}} with the social Hymenoptera (ants and various species of bees and wasps), but their differing evolutionary origins result in <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> in life cycle. In the eusocial Hymenoptera, the workers are exclusively female, males (drones) are haploid and develop from unfertilised eggs, while females (both workers and the queen) are diploid and develop from fertilised eggs. In contrast, worker termites, which constitute the majority in a colony, are diploid individuals of both sexes and develop from fertilised eggs. Depending on species, male and female workers may have different roles in a termite colony.|$|E
5|$|The <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> in life {{expectancy}} for women between {{developed and developing}} countries lie in the childbearing years. If a woman survives this period, {{the differences between the}} two regions become less marked, since in later life non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become the major causes of death in women throughout the world, with cardiovascular deaths accounting for 45% of deaths in older women, followed by cancer (15%) and lung disease (10%). These create additional burdens on the resources of developing countries. Changing lifestyles, including diet, physical activity and cultural factors that favour larger body size in women, are contributing to an increasing problem with obesity and diabetes amongst women in these countries and increasing the risks of cardiovascular disease and other NCDs.|$|E

5|$|There are two modern breeds of cocker spaniel, the English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel. They were bred as gun dogs; to {{use their}} sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler in order to flush birds into the air to be shot, and {{to use their}} eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to {{retrieve}} the bird with a soft mouth. The <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with a shorter back, a domed head and a shorter muzzle, while the English variety is taller with a narrower head and chest.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the Pliocene era between 2.5 and 5 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, M. palaeosinensis and M. anderssoni, {{have been found in}} eastern Asia. The first true fisher, M. divuliana, has only been found in North America. There are strong indications that M. divuliana is related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. M. pennanti has been found as early as the Late Pleistocene era, about 125,000 years ago. There are no <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> between the Pleistocene fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil evidence indicates that the fisher's range extended farther south than it does today.|$|E
5|$|While {{the series}} retells the real {{events of the}} gangland war, several {{inaccuracies}} have been pointed out and some deliberate fictionalizations have been made. The Purana Taskforce, as presented in this series, is not a portrayal of the real taskforce, as laws in Victoria do not allow real police officers, including those who previously served and were not sacked, to be portrayed by actors in the media. As a result, the characters presented are entirely fictional characters vaguely based on the real officers, leading to some <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> such as the series suggesting that a senior officer died due to a heart attack, which never in fact occurred.|$|E

5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. <b>Major</b> <b>differences</b> between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
5|$|The Strawberry Panic! manga, {{written by}} Sakurako Kimino and {{illustrated}} by Namuchi Takumi, was serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine between September 30, 2005 and February 28, 2007 with a new chapter released once a month. Two bound volumes {{have been published in}} Japan under MediaWorks' Dengeki Comics label. The first went on sale on March 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Shizuma on the cover, and the second volume came out on October 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Tamao on the cover. While the manga's story is unfinished, Strawberry Panic! has not made an appearance in Dengeki G's Magazine since the publication of the April 2007 issue on February 28, 2007. <b>Major</b> <b>differences</b> between the anime and manga center around the plot and character interaction. Characters have vastly different character designs, such as Shion Tōmori and Kaname Kenjō. The manga introduces the Etoile election early on while the anime waits until {{the latter part of the}} series for dramatic effect. The first volume was released in English on December 23, 2007, the second in March 2008, and the omnibus with two additional chapters in October 2010, published by Seven Seas Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} {{virtually}} {{the same in the}} DS version, but with some <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> in the introductory sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. He is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon the wind crystal. It tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three others like him, but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter. Going to a corner of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some of the kids. When Luneth intervenes, Arc runs away, heading for the village of Kazus.|$|E

50|$|Alaska {{magazine}} was originally titled the Alaska Sportsman Magazine, a name it retained until 1969. It operated much then {{as it does}} today, being sold through newsstand sales and subscriptions. The <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> in its early days {{was the fact that}} paper stock to print the magazine arrived via steamship, posing the threat of delays, and it operated out of a small basement. Another <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> is that the editorial and sales offices have moved to Alaska's economic center, the city of Anchorage.|$|R
