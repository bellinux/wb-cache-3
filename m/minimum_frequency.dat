5|$|The {{species can}} easily be {{identified}} from recordings of its echolocation call. The call consists of a component with constant frequency followed by a short one with changing frequency. The call takes 6.5 to 13.5ms, averaging 10.1ms, and the period between two calls is 22.7 to 86.3ms, averaging 42.7ms. The maximum frequency averages 94.2kHz, the <b>minimum</b> <b>frequency</b> averages 82.0kHz, and the call emits the most energy at a frequency of 93.2kHz.|$|E
25|$|For a given metal, {{there exists}} a certain <b>minimum</b> <b>frequency</b> of {{incident}} radiation below which no photoelectrons are emitted. This frequency is called the threshold frequency. Increasing {{the frequency of the}} incident beam, keeping the number of incident photons fixed (this would result in a proportionate increase in energy) increases the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted. Thus the stopping voltage increases. The number of electrons also changes because the probability that each photon results in an emitted electron is a function of photon energy. If the intensity of the incident radiation of a given frequency is increased, there is no effect on the kinetic energy of each photoelectron.|$|E
25|$|Franchises {{required}} the NYW to operate trains at a <b>minimum</b> <b>frequency</b> of two per hour, and it {{ran up to}} three times that frequency during rush hours. Trains were from one to six cars in length. Traffic grew from 2.9 million passengers per year in 1913 to 14.1 million in 1928. The completion of the Port Chester branch in 1929 allowed the New Haven to terminate passenger service on its Harlem River branch in 1930. Freight traffic on the line was very limited. The cost savings of not paying {{the high costs of}} using GCT were offset by the lower fares that the NYW charged. In no year of its operation was it able to cover the interest on its bonds, which had been guaranteed by the NH.|$|E

2500|$|Genetic {{polymorphism}} is {{the simultaneous}} occurrence {{in the same}} locality {{of two or more}} discontinuous forms in such proportions that the rarest of them cannot be maintained just by recurrent mutation or immigration, originally defined by Ford (1940). The later definition by Cavalli-Sforza & Bodmer (1971) is currently used: [...] "Genetic polymorphism is the occurrence in the same population of two or more alleles at one locus, each with appreciable frequency", where the <b>minimum</b> <b>frequency</b> is typically taken as 1%.|$|E

[...] Well known examples include (a, g, and n) versions of 802.11 Wi-Fi; WiMAX; ITU-T G.hn, DVB-T, the terrestrial digital TV broadcast system used in most of the world outside North America; and DMT (Discrete Multi Tone), the standard form of ADSL.|$|E

30|$|It was {{observed}} that the <b>minimum</b> meal <b>frequency</b> was only associated with stunting but not wasting and underweight and remained significant at multivariate level. Children who received the <b>minimum</b> meal <b>frequency</b> were less stunted compared with children who did not receive the <b>minimum</b> meal <b>frequency.</b> Disha et al. (2012) showed very weak association between feeding frequency and stunting and underweight in Ethiopia. Marriott et al. (2011) in their study, however, found an association between feeding frequency with underweight, but not with stunting. The association between feeding frequency and stunting {{in the present study}} is expected as the indicator is mutually inclusive of feeding of complementary food at 6 – 8  months which equally showed similar association with stunting.|$|R

2500|$|Central {{sensitization}} of the {{dorsal horn}} neurons that is evoked from C fiber activity {{is responsible for}} temporal summation of [...] "second pain" [...] (TSSP). This event is called ‘windup’ and relies on a frequency greater or equal to 0.33Hz of the stimulus. Windup is associated with chronic pain and central sensitization. This <b>minimum</b> <b>frequency</b> was determined experimentally by comparing healthy patient fMRI’s when subjected to varying frequencies of heat pulses. The fMRI maps show common areas activated by the TSSP responses which include contralateral thalamus (THAL), S1, bilateral S2, anterior and posterior insula (INS), mid-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and supplemental motor areas (SMA). TSSP events are also associated with {{other regions of the}} brain that process functions such as somatosensory processing, pain perception and modulation, cognition, pre-motor activity in the cortex.|$|E
