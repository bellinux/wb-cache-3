40|$|Abstract. The plasma {{spraying}} Al 2 O 3 + 13 wt. %TiO 2 ceramic coating was coated with organic-inorganic hybrid emulsion. The hybrid emulsion prepared through co-hydrolysis and copolycondensation reactions of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and methyltriethoxysilane (MTES), and <b>methylsilicone</b> resin was {{added in the}} emulsion to improve the film-forming properties. The morphologies, chemical compositions and hydrophobicity of the resulting surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 3 -dimensional stereoscopic microscope, energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX), Fourier transfer infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and water contact angle measurement. When the mole ratio of TEOS/MTES and the weight ratio of <b>methylsilicone</b> resin were 1 : 1 and 3. 5 wt. %, respectively, this surface displayed good film-forming properties. The contact angle was 130. 24 °, and the contact angle hysteresis was less than 10 °...|$|E
40|$|Ceramic foams, {{prepared}} by the pyrolysis of a foamed blend of a <b>methylsilicone</b> preceramic polymer and a polyurethane, exhibit excellent mechanical properties. The thermal evolution of process to produce from the foamed blend (weight ratio of 1 to 1) to ceramic foam was investigated from room temperature to 1400 degreesC. Firstly, the <b>methylsilicone</b> preceramic polymer was characterized with various techniques. Secondly, the weight decrease and the degradation gas from the unpyrolyzed foamed blend, the phase morphology change, the compositional change, and the dimensional change were investigated. The main variation of characteristics of the foamed blend was observed in the temperature range 400 to 600 degreesC, where the largest weight loss occurred in TGA, {{for most of the}} measurements. At these temperatures, the decomposition of the polyurethane phase is mostly completed, and the polymer-to-ceramic conversion of the silicone resin is under way. The phase-morphological analysis surprisingly showed that the polyurethane was dispersed as particles in a <b>methylsilicone</b> preceramic polymer matrix, although originally polyurethane was intended {{to be used as a}} sacrificial template matrix. The polyurethane domain particles gradually aggregated and tended to disappear as the temperature increased, and the ceramic foam walls and struts appeared to be dense (for pyrolysis temperature < 1400 degreesC). These features can be explained assuming that the preceramic polymer matrix deformed during the decomposition of the polyurethane and the polymer-to-ceramic conversion.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{study of}} {{diffusion}} coefficients of n-alkanes and {{other organic compounds}} in silicones is undertaken by gas-liquid chromatography. About 0. 3 % of stationary phase is coated on glass bead support so that the only significant source of peak spreading is due to slow liquid phase mass transfer. Diffusion coefficients are higher in higher molecular weight <b>methylsilicones</b> than in lower molecular weight. The anomaly is partially explained by the increase of free volume with increasing molecular weight. Partition coefficients of n-alkanes in the <b>methylsilicones</b> are independent of the molecular weights of the silicones. Chromatographic peaks for n-alkanes in <b>methylsilicones</b> become increasingly skewed as the molecular weight of the n-alkane increases. Diffusion coefficients in phenyl, fluoro and cyanosilicones are strongly dependent on the steric hindrance of the substituent groups of the silicones and the molecular {{size and shape of}} the penetrants. Three equations for the dependence of the diffusion coefficients of n-alkanes on the physical properties of the penetrant-polymer system are investigated by linear regression. It is found that the best fit through the 158 data points is obtained when the densities and the percent phenyl content of silicones are included in the regression equation. It suggests the diffusion process is dependent on the free volume and steric hindrance of the silicones studied, and is independent of intermolecular attraction between the polymer and the penetrant...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion Is slower in phenylsilicones In {{proportion}} to the exponent of the phenyl content and in all silicones is slower in {{proportion to}} the exponent of the density. Diffusion is anomalous in cold chromatographic grade silicones, especially with long-chain n-alkanes, yeilding skewed peaks and, in the methyl-sillcones, high diffusion coefficients. The anomaly is less apparent above 150 °C and with low mole-cular weight <b>methylsilicones.</b> Butler and Hawkes (1) reported that diffusion of /i-alkanes in the polydimethylsilicone SE- 30 (mol. wt. 4 x 10 s) is faster than in the lower molecular weight polydimethylsilicone SF- 96 - 200 (mol. wt. 1. 1 x 104). The investigation of diffusion coefficients of /i-alkanes and other organic compounds in polydimethysilicones has been continued with commercial polydimethylsilicones of intermediate molecular weights, along with three phenylmethylsilicones of varying phenyl content and molecular weights, two fluoropropylsilicones of different molecular weights and a cyanosilicone. The gas chromatographic system for measuring diffusion coefficients is exactly the same as in (1). During this investiga-tion it was realized that data obtained from the gas chromato-graph for very volatile samples are unreliable because of blow-back of volatile samples from the injection system into the carrier gas feed stream. The extra dispersion is unaccounted for in the determination of diffusion coefficients. Therefore, data obtained in this work and in the previous work for samples with partition coefficients less than thirty are disregarded. Data on the silicones, obtained from the suppliers, are listed in Table I and the silicone structures are illustrated in Figure 1. The diffusion coefficients are listed in Tables II-X and the rt-alkane diffusion coefficients are plotted against their parti-tion coefficients in Figures 2 - 9...|$|R

40|$|A special {{synthetic}} reaction {{has been}} developed, in which vapor of the reactant {{interacts with the}} high temperature plasma generated by laser ablating a graphite target. By selecting chained <b>methylsilicone</b> as reactant, a series of methylsilsesquioxanes products with various structural configurations have been obtained. Among them, two products, which were separated by sublimation in high vacuum and recrystalization, were characterized by X - ray crystal diffraction as (CH 3 SiO 1. 5) (n) (n = 8, 10). Both of them are found to have three - dimensional cage structure. In addition, other products with double ring structure were detected by GC - MS analysis.

The analytical technique used permitted samples corresponding to a single refuelling procedure to be analyzed. Sampling on an adsorbent tube was followed in the laboratory by thermal desorption and capillary gas chromatography. All prominent hydrocarbons were well separated on a <b>methylsilicone</b> phase.

Retention index data for a <b>methylsilicone</b> column and basic mass spectral data are given for all compounds. Retention index in combination with molecular mass and structure-specific fragment ions greatly facilitates qualitative analysis.

40|$|Free soluble {{carbohydrates}} {{of different}} wine samples {{were analyzed by}} GC-MS as their trimethylsilyloximes using a <b>methylsilicone</b> column. Besides alpha,alpha-trehalose, several beta-glucosylglucoses such as cellobiose, sophorose, laminaribiose and gentiobiose were the main disaccharides identified. With the exception of gentiobiose, these disaccharides are now reported {{for the first time}} in wine. Lactose (4 -O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-glucose), previously described in this product, was also tentatively identified. Several free glycosides: beta-ethyl-glucoside and seven glyceryl-glycosides (including glucosides and galactosides) were also identified {{for the first time in}} wine. On the contrary, disaccharides in grape juice were mainly constituted of fructose derivatives, including sucrose, and no glycosides were detected. Although the total amount of disaccharides was different in white wines (< 50 mg/L) from those in rosé and red wines (80 - 130 mg/L), the chromatographic profile was noticeably similar in all wine samples. The method here reported allows the identification of several carbohydrates which have not been previously detected in wines and could contribute to increase the understanding of enzymatic activity during winemaking.

Sample preparation included hexane extraction, clean-up with sulphuric acid, Florisil and copper and separation from pesticides by column chromatography with silica gel. Analyses were performed using <b>methylsilicone</b> and phenyl-methylsilicone capillary columns. A GC-ECD and a computer-assisted GC-MS performing {{selected ion monitoring}} (SIM) were employed. Quantification was based on standards prepared by combining Aroclor formulations and on mixtures prepared with selected biphenyls of different degree of chlorination (7 PCB mix). Recovery tests conducted with an internal standard added to the samples before extraction yielded values between 79 and 102 %. The precisions obtained on quadruplicate samples by using the combination HRGC-LRMS with Aroclor standards and with the 7 PCB mix were 18 % and 15 %, respectively. Imprecision was mainly due to uncertainties in measuring areas of low-intensity SIM peaks. With HRGC-ECD precisions were better than 7 %. A systematic overestimation was observed with HRGC-ECD, probably due to inclusion of interfering compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of organic pollutants in water requires that samples be collected, transported to a laboratory, extracted (usually with {{large volumes of}} hazardous chlorinated solvents), and analyzed using chromatographic techniques. Such limitations make rapid determinations in the field (e. g., for emergency response and/or for survey investigations) very expensive with analytical turnaround times requiring several days. Similar limitations exist for the collection and analysis of organic pollutants in air. An alternative approach is being developed at the Energy {ampersand} Environmental Research Center (EERC) that has been demonstrated to yield good sensitivities (ppb to ppm) and be easily adapted for rapid (less than 30 minutes) and inexpensive field surveys. This new approach {{is based on the}} preconcentration of organic pollutants in optically clear sorbent media followed by measurement with either ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy or Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). Investigations using sorbent media including <b>methylsilicone</b> gums (for UV spectroscopy) and `Parafilm` (for FT-IR) have shown that quantitative determinations of aromatic fuel components, such as benzene and alkylbenzenes (BTEX), can be achieved using UV spectrometry, and of common solvents (e. g., chloroform and other chlorinated solvents) can be achieved using FT-IR. Sample concentration and spectroscopic steps can be performed in a few minutes using the combination of solid-phase sorption followed by spectroscopic measurements. This work has demonstrated that the approach can yield low-ppm to low-ppb detection limits for organic pollutants in water without the negative influences of water matrix components (e. g., dissolved humic material) that prohibit the use of direct spectroscopic measurements...|$|E
40|$|Silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) ceramic foams, {{produced}} by the pyrolysis of a foamed blend of a <b>methylsilicone</b> preceramic polymer and polyurethane (PU) in a 1 / 1 wt. % ratio, exhibit excellent physical and mechanical properties. The proposed process allows to easily modify the density and morphology of the foams, making them suitable for several engineering applications. However, {{it has been shown}} that, due to residual carbon present in the oxycarbide phase after pyrolysis, the foams are subjected to an oxidation process that reduces their strength after high temperature exposure to air (12 h 1200 C). A modified process, imploying the same silicone resin preceramic polymer but a much lower PU content (silicone resin/PU= 5. 25 / 1 wt. % ratio), has been developed and is reported in this paper. Microstructural investigations showed that carbon rich regions deriving from the decomposition of the polyurethane template are still present in the SiOC foam, but have a much smaller dimension than those found in foams with a higher PU content. Thermal gravimetric studies performed in air or oxygen showed that the low-PU containing ceramic foams display an excellent oxidation resistance, because the carbon-rich areas are embedded inside the struts or cell walls and are thus protected by the dense silicon oxycarbide matrix surrounding them. SiOC foams obtained with the novel process are capable to maintain their mechanical strength after oxidation treatments at 800 and 1200 C (12 h), while SiOC foams obtained with a higher amount of PU show about a 30 % strength decrease after oxidation at 1200 C (12 h). # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|TRACER EXPERIMENTS ARE USED INCREASINGLY IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TO DESCRIBE TRAJECTORIES OF AIR MASSES,ESPECIALLY FOR POLLUTION CONTROL STUDIES. IN THE LAST YEARS THE NEED TO FOLLOW UP TRACED PLUMES FOR DISTANCES OF SEVERAL HUNDRED KILOMETERS HAS MOTIVATED RESEARCH FOR NEW TRACERS, HAVING A FAVOURABLE BALANCE BETWEEN COST OF THE RELEASED TRACER AND QUANTITY NECESSARY TO PRODUCE A MEASURABLE CONCENTRATION AT THE DESIRED DISTANCE. THE PERFLUORINATED DERIVATIVES OF SOME CYCLIC HYDROCARBONS HAVE PROVED EXCELLENT FEATURES IN THIS RESPECT BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY LOW BACKGROUND CONCENTRATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND OF THEIR HIGHLY SENSITIVE GC-ECD MEASUREMENT. THIS PAPER REPORTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SIMPLE METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF TWO PERFLUOROCARBONS PERFLUOROMETHYLCYCLOHEXANE (C 7 F 14) AND PERFLUORODI- METHYLCYCLOHEXANE (C 8 F 16) DOWN TO 5 X 10 - 14 VOLUME FRACTION IN AIR (0. 05 PPT). THE METHOD INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING STEPS: A) SAMPLING OF 5 - 10 L OF AIR ON A 160 X 6 MM (3 MM I. D.) COLUMN, CONTAINING 200 MG OF GRAPHITIZED CARBON BLACK. B) DESORPTION FOR 6 MIN AT 250 C IN A SMALL OVEN. C) CRYOGENIC TRAPPING AT - 100 C IN A FUSED SILICA CAPILLARY. D) INJECTION IN THE GC BY FLASH HEATING OF THE CAPILLARY.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al XVI Scientific Meeting of the Spanish Society of Chromatography and Related Techniques, celebrado en Sevilla (España) del 2 al 4 de noviembre de 2016. Glycosyl-inositols are {{constituted}} {{by one or}} several (up to four) galactosyl residues and an inositol or a methyl-inositol. These compounds are especially abundant in legumes {{but they can be}} found in seeds of other plants such as buckwheat or pine nuts. Several bioactive properties, mainly associated with insulin resistance, have been attributed to them. Up to now, HPLC and GC [1, 2] have been used for glycosyl-inositol analysis, but no comprehensive method is available for the characterization of these compounds, probably {{due to the lack of}} enough adequate standards. GC-MS can provide valuable qualitative and quantitative information for the characterization of these compounds along with other soluble carbohydrates, after derivatisation and avoiding tedious fractionation processes. Linear retention indices (IT) are only available for a very few glycosyl-inositols and a systematic study of their mass spectra (MS) is also lacking. Therefore, the aim of this work was to correlate the chemical structure of different glycosyl-inositols with their IT values and MS data in an attempt to help in further identification of unknown compounds. Several glycosyl-inositols with different structures (derived from chiro-, myo-, and methyl-inositols, and also mono-, di- and triglycosyl- compounds) from plant extracts (buckwheat, chickpea and grasspea) were considered as standards. Different saccharides were used for comparative purposes. These compounds, previously derivatised, were analysed by GC-MS using a <b>methylsilicone</b> capillary column. Regarding GC retention, galactosyl-cyclitols derived from chiro-inositol eluted before those derived from myo-inositol. Moreover, galactosyl-cyclitols (degree of polymerization (DP 2) eluted within sucrose and raffinose, digalactosyl-cyclitols (DP 3) within raffinose and stachyose and trigalactosyl-cyclitols (DP 4) were eluted within stachyose and verbascose. MS data revealed a lower abundance of ion at m/z 361 for glycosyl-cyclitols compared to saccharides. Ratios of m/z ions 133 / 129, 260 / 265 and 375 / 361 were proposed for the first time in this work to distinguish glycosyl-inositols from glycosyl-methyl-inositols, as they allowed the unequivocal characterization of them. Results have afforded the characterization of different non-previously identified glycosyl-cyclitols appearing in chickpeas, adzuki beans and leaves of Coriaria myrifolia and Coriaria ruscifolia.
