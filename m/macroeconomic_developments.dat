50|$|Garrett’s {{aggressive}} strategy grew ISC at {{an astonishing}} rate, transforming {{it from a}} struggling small electronics company to a nationally recognized industrial conglomerate {{in less than a}} decade. Net sales increased from $5.7 million in 1964 to $165.2 million in 1970 and total assets from $4.1 million to $120.4 million in the same period. In 1970, ISC was listed {{for the first time on}} the prestigious Fortune 500 list of America’s largest companies. As the 1970s progressed, however, Garrett’s strategy faced stiff headwinds. Conglomerates had fallen out of favor with investors, who preferred companies to focus on a single industry, and with the Nixon Administration, which was concerned about mass layoffs after acquisitions. As the Vietnam War winded down, U.S. defense spending also started to decrease. The first and second oil crises as well as the recessions of 1973-1975 and the early 1980s further diminished ISC's prospects. As a result of these <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>developments</b> and the divestiture of underperforming divisions, ISC's revenues fell from $233.25 million in 1974 to $104.3 million in 1982 - the year Garrett died at age 64.|$|E

Subsequently, he served as a consultant to a number of American companies and to the managing director of the IMF, Horst Koehler. In 2004, McCormack joined the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) as a senior economic advisor and published several papers on a variety of economic issues, including concerns about a developing housing bubble, related derivative issues, and monetary policy concerns.

5000|$|The table also list {{each member}} states' Medium-Term {{budgetary}} Objective (MTO) for its structural balance, and its current target year for achieving this MTO. Until the MTO has been achieved, all states {{are obliged to}} adhere to an adjustment path towards this country-specific target, where the structural balance must improve at least 0.5% points per year. The MTO depicts the most adverse structural balance per year the country can afford, when targeting that debt-to-GDP ratios first decline to below 60% and subsequently remain stable below this level for the next 50 years while adjusting for the forecast change of aging related costs. Beside existence of the debt dependent minimum limits for the MTO dictated by the Fiscal Compact, there is also existence of two other calculated minimum limits for the MTO determined by a formula ensuring respectively [...] "a safety margin to respect the nominal 3%-limit during economic downturns" [...] and [...] "long-term sustainability of public finances {{taking into account the}} forecast for future adverse aging related costs". The final country-specific MTO minimum limit will be determined as the one respecting all of the three determined minimum limits (note: those non-eurozone states neither having entered ERM-II nor ratified a submission to Title III of the Fiscal Compact, are only required to respect the first two calculated minimum limits), and this final limit will be recalculated by the European Commission once every third year (most recently in October 2012). Subsequently, and as a final step, each state have the prerogative still to set its MTO at a level being stricter than the one calculated by the European Commission, but can not set it at a limit being worse. The states will communicate their final MTO selection in their annual Stability and Convergence Report, in which the attached target year for obtaining the selected MTO will also be revealed/updated according to the latest <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>developments</b> and success of the previously implemented fiscal policies by the concerned state.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews <b>macro{{economic}}</b> <b>developments</b> in the Greek {{economy in}} 1995 and early 1996.

Inflation continued to decelerate gradually through 1995, but picked up somewhat in the early months of 1996 reflecting in part one-off exogenous factors.
