40|$|Abstract. Polyactic fibers have {{superior}} biodegradability, moisture absorption, resiliency and processibility {{and can be}} used {{in various}} fields especially in blood filtration. Polyactic can be <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> into nonwoven fabrics. To predict the fiber diameter of the polyactic <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> nonwoven fabric, the air drawing model of polyactic was established. The predicted fiber diameter tallies well with the measured fiber diameter. Computer simulations {{of the effects of the}} processing parameters on the fiber diameter were performed with the help of the air drawing model. The simulation results show that smaller polymer flow rate, larger initial air velocity and larger die-to-collector distance can all produce finer fibers while too large initial air velocity and too large die-to-collector distance contribute little to the air drawing of polyactic melts...|$|R

5000|$|Staple {{nonwovens}} {{are made}} in 4 steps. Fibers are first spun, cut to a few centimeters length, and put into bales. The staple fibers are then blended, [...] "opened" [...] in a multistep process, dispersed on a conveyor belt, and spread in a uniform web by a wetlaid, airlaid, or carding/crosslapping process. Wetlaid operations typically use 0.25 to 0.75 in long fibers, but sometimes longer if the fiber is stiff or thick. Airlaid processing generally uses 0.5 to 4.0 in fibers. Carding operations typically use ~1.5" [...] long fibers. Rayon {{used to be a}} common fiber in nonwovens, now greatly replaced by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene. Fiberglass is wetlaid into mats for use in roofing and shingles. Synthetic fiber blends are wetlaid along with cellulose for single-use fabrics. Staple nonwovens are bonded either thermally or by using resin. Bonding can be throughout the web by resin saturation or overall thermal bonding or in a distinct pattern via resin printing or thermal spot bonding.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Melt</b> <b>blowing</b> is {{a typical}} {{nonwoven}} process for producing superfine fibers. In this process, the high velocity hot air jets attenuate the polymer melt into superfine fibers. Therefore, the fiber diameter is strongly affected by the air flow field. Dual slot die {{is one of the}} widely used <b>melt</b> <b>blowing</b> dies. Hot air emits from the two slots symmetrically. What will happen to the polymer drawing if the air jets are unsymmetrical? In this paper, the unsymmetrical air flow field of the dual slot die in <b>melt</b> <b>blowing</b> process is simulated numerically. The distributions of air velocity and air temperature are obtained. The polymer drawing model is then solved with the aid of the simulation results of air velocity and air temperature. The diameter and transverse displacement of the threadline along the spinline is achieved. The result shows that the threadline diameter of unsymmetrical air flow field is larger than that of the symmetrical air flow field and the threadline tends to deflect because of the unsymmetrical air jets.
