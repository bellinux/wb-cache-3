5000|$|Gridiron's {{incision}} (<b>Mc</b> <b>Burney's</b> incision) - Described in 1894 by McBurney, {{used for}} appendectomy. An oblique incision {{made in the}} right lower quadrant of the abdomen, classically used for appendectomy. Incision is placed perpendicular to the spinoumblical line at <b>Mc</b> <b>Burney's</b> point, i.e. at the junction of lateral one-third and medial two-third of spino-umblical line.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Several {{radiological}} {{studies have}} suggested that the base of the Appendix often does not correspond with <b>Mc</b> <b>Burney’s</b> point. The aim of our study is to assess the value of using CT localization of the appendicocaecal junction to guide placement of the appendicectomy incision. Design & Method: 32 consecutive patients, booked for open appendicectomy were prospectively included in this study. Coronal and axial CT scans with IV contrast were studied to assess site of the appendicocaecal junction. This information was used to guide placement of the incision. Results: 28 out of 32 patients studied, the appendicocaecal junctions were accurately identified. It was noted that the final incision sites were cephalad to <b>Mc</b> <b>Burney's</b> point in 8, at the point in 3 and caudal in 17. In 1 patient, it was necessary to extend the incision medially by 2  cm to retrieve the distal Appendix which had been detached through the site of rupture. Conclusion: <b>Mc</b> <b>Burney’s</b> point often does not correspond {{to the base of the}} appendix. We propose that using CT imaging to guide the appendicectomy incision is safe, facilitates locating the Appendix at surgery, minimizes incision size and decreases the need to extend it...|$|R
5000|$|Lanz {{incision}} - A {{variation of}} the traditional <b>Mc</b> <b>Burney's</b> incision, which was made at McBurney's point on the abdomen: The Lanz incision is made {{at the same point}} along the transverse plane and deemed cosmetically better. It is typically used to perform an open appendectomy. Variations exist on the method used to locate the incision. Some surgeons advocate that the incision is made approximately 2 cm below the umbilicus centered on mid clavicular-midinguinal line. Others imply use of McBurney's point to center the incision (1/3rd of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus).|$|R
40|$|Personal {{experience}} {{based on}} a clinical case {{of a young woman}} with acute abdominal pain referable to acute appendicitis is presented. The surgical procedure was performed through a <b>Mc</b> <b>Burney</b> incision and revealed the rupture of mesenteric cysts; removal of the cysts was carried out without intestinal resection. Post-operative course was uneventful and 2 years follow-up showed no recurrence. Mesenteric cysts are an uncommon pathology, mainly in adult ages. After an analysis of the incidence and etiology, the pathological features and types of clinical presentation are discussed. Diagnosis in asymptomatic cases is usually made in search of other diseases. Complications are rare: rupture, infection and intestinal obstruction. In such cases, the clinical presentation is usually attributable to the main causes of acute abdomen, unless ultrasonography or CT scan are performed. When mesenteric cyst is diagnosed, a laparoscopic approach should be performed, even if in emergency traditional surgery is justified. Total excision of the cyst is necessary to avoid recurrence and obtain a correct pathologic evaluation. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{management}} of acute appendicitis during pregnancy {{is not fully}} established, especially regarding the choice between open and laparoscopic surgery during the third trimester. We report herein {{the case of a}} major uterine variecele hemorrhage during a laparoscopic appendectomy in a 27 -year old pregnant patient at 33 weeks of amenorrhea. After conversion to a Pfannenstiel incision, the baby was delivered, the bleeding stopped and the appendectomy completed. While both mother and child fully recovered, this «near miss» complication underlines the challenges linked to the {{management of}} acute appendicitis during pregnancy. Based on a literature review, we propose an algorithm favoring the laparoscopic approach during the first and second trimesters, and the open approach during the third trimester (especially after the 26 th week of amenorrhea). In case of unclear pre-operative diagnosis, a laparoscopy should be conducted even during the third trimester with a <b>Mc</b> <b>Burney</b> conversion when the diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed. </p...|$|R

He went on to graduate school at Columbia University in New York where he was enrolled in a combined MBA-law degree program, from which he graduated in 1969. While working toward his degrees, Berger continued to devote time to weightlifting, training at the <b>Mc</b> <b>Burney</b> YMCA in midtown New York, and competing as a light-heavyweight.

The considerable differences in these playwrights access to the theater world can be revealed in an analysis of gender and genre in their plays. Additionally, a comparison of gossip, reveals that Burney and Sheridan used satire throughout The School for Scandal and The Witlings, with the hope of ridding London of its scandalmongers. Burney wanted to expose London of gossipmongers to show that the literati elite were snobs among London society. Sheridan had a satirical perspective on gossip to reveal that the refined women lowered their own status through spreading gossip throughout London...|$|R

Appendectomy is practiced worldwide as emergency aswell as elective procedure. We, in our series performed appendectomy in emergency successfully in 75 cases (30 males and 45 females) in the age group of 11 - 63 years with a small transverse incision(2. 5 to 3. 5 cm long) in the right lower abdomen starting just on the lateral border of rectus muscle andextended laterally in the line of <b>Mc</b> <b>Burney’s</b> point. The only muscle in the operation field was rectusthat was retracted medially. No other muscle was cut/split. The time taken to complete the operationwas 22. 3 minutes (16 to 45 min). Post-operative analgesics used were 2. 23 dose per patient (2 - 5 doses). Post-operative hospital stay was 2. 3 days (2 - 7 days). There was no mortality and negligiblemorbidity in the form of wound infection (n= 02), anterior abdominal wall haematoma (n= 01).
