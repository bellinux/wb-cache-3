5|$|In , a 2010 {{documentary}} film narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Youkilis noted: It's something that I probably won’t realize until <b>my</b> <b>career</b> is over, {{how many people}} are really rooting for me and cheering for me. And it's not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.|$|E

5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around <b>my</b> <b>career</b> this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|This {{was by far}} {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} I have ever taken on in <b>my</b> <b>career,</b> and I could not be more honored {{to be a part of}} such an amazing and historical event.

I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the ones}} that {{hit me in the}} head later on in <b>my</b> <b>career</b> were a lot more {{detrimental}} than the one that hit me in the chest.

It's not a full-blown epilepsy attack, but more of a dizzy spell, sort of a blackout type. Only in the last 12 months has this been identified. Medication has fixed it up.|$|E

25|$|In {{search of}} sanctuary, I have found {{my way to}} that country, the nobility of whose traditions, and whose ever-present charm, have already been as balm to my soul.

That finished me. After that, I didn't want to be there. I thought of other things I wanted to do in life.

25|$|In <b>my</b> <b>career</b> when I {{prosecute the}} worst of the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only {{appropriate}} punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even against the death penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. Our next congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E
25|$|I {{really wanted}} to show people you can win all kinds of ways. I always coached the way I've wanted to be coached. I know Lovie has done the same thing.

I know I {{probably}} didn't {{get a couple of}} jobs in <b>my</b> <b>career</b> because people could not see my personality or the way I was going to do it.... For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... We all know that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E
25|$|Simon {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II. He said in his 1990 {{autobiography}} that he was first assigned to the Mounted Beach Patrol at Long Beach Island, off Barnegat, New Jersey, for a year before being sent to boot camp near Baltimore, Maryland, for basic training. Afterward, he reported for duty with the Combat Art Corps in Washington, D.C., part of the Coast Guard Public Information Division. He was stationed there in 1944 when he met New York Post sports columnist Milt Gross, who was with the Coast Guard Public Relations Unit, and the two became roommates in civilian housing. Pursuant to his unit's mission to publicize the Coast Guard, Simon created a true-life Coast Guard comic book that DC agreed to publish, followed by versions syndicated nationally by Parents magazine in Sunday newspaper comics sections, under the title True Comics. This led to his being assigned to create a comic book aimed at driving Coast Guard recruitment. With Gross as his writer collaborator, Simon produced Adventure Is <b>My</b> <b>Career,</b> distributed by Street and Smith Publications for sale at newsstands.|$|E
