We present a new data driven retrieval approach, previously used in planetary atmosphere studies, to extract the <b>molecular</b> <b>abundances</b> and temperature structure from brown dwarf spectra. The feasibility of the approach is first demonstrated on a synthetic brown dwarf spectrum. Given typical spectral resolutions, wavelength coverage, and noise properties precisions of tens of percent can be obtained for the <b>molecular</b> <b>abundances</b> and 10 s- 100 s K on the temperature profile. The technique is then applied to the well studied brown dwarf, Gl 570 D. From this spectral retrieval the spectroscopic radius is constrained to be 0. 75 - 0. 83 R_J, (g) to be 5. 13 - 5. 46 and T_eff to be between 804 and 849 K. Estimates for the range of abundances and allowed temperature profiles are also derived. The results from our retrieval approach are in agreement with the self-consistent grid modeling results of Saumon et al (2006). This new approach will allow us to address issues of compositional differences between brown dwarfs and possibly their formation environments, disequilibrium chemistry, missing physics in current grid modeling approaches as well as a many other issues.

In the region of surface density less than 10 ^ 2 g cm^- 2 (distance from the star ≳ 10 AU in the minimum- mass solar nebula), cosmic rays are barely attenuated even in the midplane of the disk and produce chemically active ions such as He^+ and H_ 3 ^+.

We derive <b>molecular</b> <b>abundances</b> and compare them with other Galactic and extragalactic sources by means of a principal component analysis. We detect 317 emission lines from a total of 45 molecular species, including 15 isotopic substitutions and six vibrationally excited variants. Our LTE/NLTE fit find kinetic temperatures from 20 to 350 K, and densities between 10 $^ 5 $ and 10 $^ 7 $ cm$^{- 3 }$. The spectrum is dominated by vibrationally excited HC$_ 3 $N, HCN, and HNC, with vibrational temperatures from 300 to 450 K. We find high abundances of HC$_ 3 $N, SiO, H$_ 2 $S, and c-HCCCH and a low CH$_ 3 $OH abundance. A principal component analysis shows that NGC 4418 and Arp 220 share very similar <b>molecular</b> <b>abundances</b> and excitation, which clearly set them apart from other Galactic and extragalactic environments. The similar <b>molecular</b> <b>abundances</b> observed towards NCG 4418 and Arp 220 are consistent with a hot gas-phase chemistry, with the relative abundances of SiO and CH$_ 3 $OH being regulated by shocks and X-ray driven dissociation.

The temperature structure and distribution of the main atmospheric constituents are calculated {{in the limit of}} an atmosphere that rotates as a solid body with an equatorial rotation rate of 1 km/s. Such motion mimics a uniform zonal wind which resembles the equatorial superrotation structure found by three dimensional circulation models. The uneven heating of this tidally locked planet causes, even in the presence of such a strong zonal wind, large temperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside, of up to 800 K. This would result in important longitudinal variations of some <b>molecular</b> <b>abundances</b> if the atmosphere were at chemical equilibrium.

We identify the existence of a pressure level of transition between two regimes, which may be located between 100 and 0. 1 mbar depending on the molecule.

The results suggest that the starless cores can be divided into two categories: stable starless cores that are in approximate equilibrium and will not evolve to form protostars, and unstable pre-stellar cores that are proceeding toward gravitational collapse and the formation of protostars. The starless cores might be formed from the interstellar medium as objects {{at the lower end of}} the inertial cascade of interstellar turbulence. Additionally, we identify a thermal instability in the starless cores. Under par ticular conditions of density and mass, a core may be unstable to expansion if the density is just above the critical density for the collisional coupling of the gas and dust so that as the core expands the gas-dust coupling that cools the gas is reduced and the gas warms, further driving the expansion.
