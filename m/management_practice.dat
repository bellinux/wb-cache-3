5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good <b>management</b> <b>practice.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: No single {{project is}} {{identical}} {{to one another in}} the construction industry. Furthermore, many construction projects are suffering from tighter budget, shortened schedule and higher client satisfaction level. To overcome these, project managers and engineers are willing to apply various best <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> to their projects. However, it is non-trivial to select the most appropriate practices for their projects. In many cases, it is much more important to find the appropriateness of the <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> than just to use the practices. Although many researchers are focusing on the development of new <b>management</b> <b>practices,</b> there is little research on matching between the circumstances of projects and the developed <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} provide a structured process to suggest the best <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> for individual construction projects by developing a computerized system where an individual project is matched with the most optimal <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> to increase the value of the project. At this stage of writing, the authors have developed a computerized system to effectively find out the best suitable <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> for individual projects. By maximizing the usages of this system, it would facilitate the application of the best <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> in the industry...|$|R
25|$|While WSS {{improvements}} were ongoing, {{the traditional}} water management approach did {{not account for}} domestic and industrial wastewater treatment and non-point sources pollution control resulting in the environmental degradation of water bodies. These systems were viewed as separate and the management strategy did not account for treatment facilities, local streams, and overall water quality within them. The philosophy is evolving however, and water resources <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> is becoming more of an integrated approach taking into account a multi-sectoral approach looking at water supply, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), drainage and irrigation as one entity. According to pollution control work presented {{by a team of}} researchers at the British Hydrological Society symposium in 2008, {{there is a need to}} consider the sewer system, the WWTP, and the river as one system. These developments in the Bogotá water management system offer multiple opportunities to incorporate integrated methodologies both now and in the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} sewage sludge is {{controlled}} under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, <b>management</b> <b>practice,</b> and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants {{and those that do}} not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect public health and the environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.|$|E
2500|$|The octopus {{is usually}} clearly marked, the {{convention}} is a yellow hose and yellow second stage though a luminescent green is sometimes favoured. Many dive equipment manufacturers provide secondary regulators marked exactly to this standard and [...] "tune" [...] them {{specifically to the}} role of octopus. The octopus second stage is usually stowed in an easily located, accessible position and is easily detachable from the device that holds it. Most recreational agencies recommend or specify that this position be in the [...] "Golden Triangle" [...] drawn between a divers chin and nipples. The octopus hose is usually made long enough (1.2 metres (4ft)) so that the divers are not inconveniently crowded against one another when the octopus regulator is in use. [...] The procedure to provide the octopus is that the donor diver hands over the octopus – but if he/she does not notice the buddy’s distress, the out of air diver has been taught to take the stowed octopus. [...] An advantage with this method is that donor handover is consistent in both octopus handover and for handover of any independent bailout device such as a removable pony bottle. [...] As part of the pre-dive checks, the procedure of handing-over or accessing the octopus in out-of-air emergency and the octopus location should be reviewed by the team. In recreational diving, if good gas <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> has been followed, either buddy should have sufficient air to allow them both to make a safe ascent to the surface, even if the emergency occurs {{at the end of the}} dive.

The WMS is an international research programme that evaluates the differences in <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> across different countries and firms; through the WMS, 34 countries and over 10, 000 firms have been studied to measure and explain <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> This study evaluated 31 manufacturing firms and found that South Africa, like other developing countries, ranks low on the quality of <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> <b>Management</b> <b>practices</b> evaluated include lean operations, performance monitoring, target setting and talent management. In South African manufacturing firms, performance monitoring receives the greatest emphasis whilst talent management receives the least emphasis. There is a significant variation in <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> across manufacturing firms in South Africa, with a long-tail of poorly managed firms that bring the overall management score of South Africa down.

Considering this in view a trial was conducted from 1997 - 1999 cropping season at two locations. Four wheat varieties and one local were used in factorial combination with two management levels (research and farmers`). Different wheat varieties showed significant yielding potential across two locations. Improved and local varieties performed better under research <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> Higher grain yield of wheat was observed from improved <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> compared to farmers` <b>practices.</b> Improved <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> gave higher marginal rate of return 57. 51 % of wheat.
