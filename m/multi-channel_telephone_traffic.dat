40|$|Abstract: This paper empirically {{evaluates the}} {{relative}} importance of embodied versus disembodied idea flows in explaining income gaps and idea gaps. Trade is used as a measure of embodied idea flows and <b>telephone</b> call <b>traffic</b> a measure of disembodied flows. Since both trade and <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> may be endogenous, this paper uses the geographic, linguistic, and colonial components of trade and <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> as instruments to identify their effects on income and total factor productivity (TFP). The results provide little support for the embodied object models when both trade and <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> are included in the regressions. <b>Telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> has a quantitatively much large effect on income per worker and TFP than trade...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{prediction}} accuracy of busy <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> which is influenced by multiple factors, this paper proposes a combined forecasting model which takes the influence of multiple factors into consideration and combines three models ——wavelet transform, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) model, LSSVM is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Correlation analysis is firstly applied to the busy <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> data to obtain the key factors which influence the busy <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic.</b> Then wavelet transform is used to decompose and reconstruct the <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> data to get the low-frequency and high-frequency components. The low-frequency component is loaded into ARIMA model to predict, while the high-frequency component and the obtained key factors are loaded into PSO-LSSVM model to predict. Finally the forecasting result is achieved by the superposition of predictive values. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed model has higher prediction accuracy and strong generalization ability...|$|R

40|$|Rural {{telephony}} {{has historically}} been a recurring subject of concern for most large developing countries.

The financial implications of wiring a vast area for low <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> causes most <b>telephone</b> service providers to ignore or delay offering telephone service to those regions.

40|$|The US posts a {{large and}} growing deficit in {{international}} telephone services, a phenomenon often blamed on the accounting rate system. Using data for international calls between the US and 148 foreign destinations between 1991 and 1997, this paper finds that the increasing payment deficit for the US is associated with decreasing accounting rates. In other words, the international revenue settlement is related more to imbalances in <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> than to accounting rates. The econometric model shows that growing asymmetries in teledensity, market concentration, and income levels between the US {{and the rest of}} the world explain the imbalances. Therefore, the appropriate solution to the payment deficit in telephone services is to focus on long-term economic factors that determine the flow of traffic.

This work produces a model useful for capacity analysis. Focusing on the reverse link, this is achieved by modelling <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> using Gaussian assumptions to generate a CDMA blocking probability that is adapted into Erlang B formula for capacity calculations. A program written in MATLAB is used to realise the blocking probability formula with graphical outputs that is a tool for dimensioning.
