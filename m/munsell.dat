25|$|First {{published}} in 1905, the <b>Munsell</b> color system became {{the foundation for}} a series of color models, providing objective methods for the measurement of color. The <b>Munsell</b> system describes a color in three dimensions, hue, value (lightness), and chroma (color purity), where chroma is the difference from gray at a given hue and value.|$|E

25|$|Pure {{pigments}} reflect {{light in}} a very specific way that cannot be precisely duplicated by the discrete light emitters in a computer display. However, by making careful measurements of pigments, close approximations can be made. The <b>Munsell</b> Color System provides a good conceptual explanation of what is missing. <b>Munsell</b> devised a system that provides an objective measure of color in three dimensions: hue, value (or lightness), and chroma. Computer displays in general are unable to show the true chroma of many pigments, but the hue and lightness can be reproduced with relative accuracy. However, when the gamma of a computer display deviates from the reference value, the hue is also systematically biased.|$|E
25|$|The {{creators of}} HSL and HSV {{were far from}} the first to imagine colors fitting into conic or spherical shapes, with neutrals running from black to white in a central axis, and hues {{corresponding}} to angles around that axis. Similar arrangements {{date back to the}} 18th century, and continue to be developed in the most modern and scientific models. A pair of the most influential older models are Philipp Otto Runge’s 1810 Farbenkugel (color sphere), and the early-20th-century <b>Munsell</b> color system. Albert <b>Munsell</b> began with a spherical arrangement in his 1905 book A Color Notation, but he wished to properly separate color-making attributes into separate dimensions, which he called hue, value, and chroma, and after taking careful measurements of perceptual responses, he realized that no symmetrical shape would do, so he reorganized his system into a lumpy blob.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Munsell’s</b> {{original}} {{description of}} his system. [...] A Color Notation was published before he had established the irregular shape of a perceptual color solid, so it describes colors positioned in a sphere.|$|R
2500|$|Several color solids before <b>Munsell’s</b> plotted {{luminosity}} {{from black}} {{on the bottom}} to white on the top, with a gray gradient between them, but these systems neglected to keep perceptual lightness constant across horizontal slices. [...] Instead, they plotted fully saturated yellow (light), and fully saturated blue and purple (dark) along the equator.|$|R
25|$|On the HSV colour wheel, the {{complement}} of blue is yellow; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture {{of red and}} green light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory (RYB) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour {{is considered to be}} orange (based on the <b>Munsell</b> colour wheel).|$|E
25|$|The CIE {{assembled}} {{a committee to}} study the matter and accepted the proposal to use the latter approach, which has the virtue of not needing spectrophotometry, {{with a set of}} <b>Munsell</b> samples. Eight samples of varying hue would be alternately lit with two illuminants, and the color appearance compared. Since no color appearance model existed at the time, it was decided to base the evaluation on color differences in a suitable color space, CIEUVW. In 1931, the CIE adopted the first formal system of colorimetry, which is based on the trichromatic nature of the human visual system. CRI is based upon this system of colorimetry.|$|E
25|$|HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) are two {{alternative}} {{representations of}} the RGB color model, designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to more closely align with the way human vision perceives color-making attributes. In these models, colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice, around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top. The HSV representation models the way paints of different colors mix together, with the saturation dimension resembling various shades of brightly colored paint, and the value dimension resembling the mixture of those paints with varying amounts of black or white paint. The HSL model attempts to resemble more perceptual color models such as NCS or <b>Munsell,</b> placing fully saturated colors around a circle at a lightness value of 1/2, where a lightness value of 0 or 1 is fully black or white, respectively.|$|E

Typically, the relative luminance is normalized so that the [...] "reference white" [...] (say, magnesium oxide) has a tristimulus value of Y = 100.
