50|$|Population {{recovery}} for this species has relied largely on captive breeding. In 1987, the first captive breeding and reintroduction {{project for the}} <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was initiated in Zoo Negara in Malaysia (a country where the wild <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> population declined by over 90% from the 1980s to 2005) from a small young group of five males and five females received from Singapore Zoo and Johor Zoo. From these 10 individuals, the captive population increased to over 100 individuals by 2005. Therefore, with {{the decline in the}} wild <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> population in Malaysia since the 1980s, the captive, free-flying population has steadily risen.|$|E

50|$|The Lake Birds exhibit {{includes}} painted storks, Black-headed ibis, egrets, swans, pelicans, Black-crowned night heron, and <b>milky</b> <b>storks.</b>|$|R
50|$|A 3-story tower {{supports}} bird-watching. Prominent birdlife in {{the park}} include <b>milky</b> <b>storks,</b> blue-eared kingfishers and Buffy fish owls.|$|R
50|$|Zoo Negara has bred over 200 highly {{endangered}} <b>milky</b> <b>storks.</b> The zoo {{is currently}} working with the local Wildlife Department on a release program for these birds. Other breeding achievements include hornbills and the freshwater crocodile - false gharial.|$|R
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> (Mycteria cinerea) is a medium, almost {{completely}} white plumaged stork species found predominantly in coastal mangroves {{in parts of}} Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} Ibis genus, with the binomial name Ibis cinereus, but is now categorised as belonging to Mycteria due to large similarities in appearance and behaviour to the three other storks in this genus (the wood stork, yellow-billed stork and painted stork). Phylogenetic studies based on DNA hybridization and cytochrome oxidase b have demonstrated that the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> shares a clade with other Mycteria, and forms a sister pair of species with the painted stork.|$|E
50|$|Young captive milky storks {{can become}} sexually mature from {{three months of}} age, but breeders at this age appear {{precocious}} and inexperienced; so that actual breeding age is probably slightly older. In its natural habitat, young storks begin to leave their natal breeding grounds at 3-4 months of age. Especially in captivity, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is further found to occasionally breed with the painted stork. One hybrid of a male lesser adjutant and female <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was also hatched at Jurong Bird Park, Singapore.|$|E
50|$|In South Sumatra, it {{is found}} to breed {{alongside}} lesser adjutants, black-headed ibis and various heron species. In Cambodia, <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> have been reported breeding alongside painted storks, lesser adjutants and spot-billed pelicans in flooded forest around Tonle Sap during the early dry season in January and February. Colonies here are situated in mangrove backswamps 1-4 km from the coast in dense Archostichum ferns or dead trees.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the park}} is the largest {{breeding}} colony of <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> in the world, {{and one of the}} largest colonies of lesser adjutant. Other threatened birds in the park include the Storm's stork, white-winged duck, Nordmann's greenshank and Far Eastern curlew. The total bird population of the park has been estimated to be up to one million, while during winter up to 100,000 migratory birds stop over for rest.|$|R
50|$|Another common tactile {{feeding method}} in this stork is direct probing of its bill around deep {{holes in the}} mud. With {{partially}} open mandibles, the bird inserts and partially withdraws its bill from the mud for 5-32 seconds per hole. The bill is often inserted into the mud three quarters up the bill length, but sometimes along the full or up to the eyes. Other foraging methods observed in this stork are prey herding mechanisms typical of other Mycteria species. One of these is foot stirring, whereby the stork stands on one leg and disturbs the river bed with {{the foot of the}} opposite leg; which may drive aquatic prey from places inaccessible to the <b>storks.</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>storks</b> also forage in flocks at high prey density, whereby they cooperatively flush fish in shallow water to divert them to their half-open bills; as has been observed in Java. <b>Milky</b> <b>storks</b> also often feed in aggregations alongside other wading bird species such as lesser adjutant and egrets. This stork occasionally detects aquatic prey by direct visual searching.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is {{well-known}} among Indonesian locals and is readily distinguished by {{them in the}} field from other waders; although it has at least historically been commonly (and sometimes illegally) harvested for meat and eggs. Like many other wading bird species, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is also sometimes considered a minor pest in the aquaculture industry by feeding on commercial fish and shrimps. This stork is however officially protected in Malaysia and Indonesia [...] and has been listed on Appendix I of CITES since 1987.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult is}} readily {{recognisable}} {{in the field}} by its white head feathers, yellow-orange bill and pink legs. It is distinguished from other waders such as egrets and lesser adjutants by its extensively white body plumage and black wing coverts. However, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> resembles and may therefore {{be confused with the}} partly sympatric Asian Openbill and various white egret species. Nevertheless, the egrets are smaller and completely white, and the Asian Openbill is also smaller and distinguished from the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> by the grey bill. In the northern part of its range around Vietnam, milky storks occasionally occur in sympatry with the closely related and morphologically similar painted storks. However, the painted stork is distinguished from the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> in adult plumage by the former’s black and white breast band and wing coverts, pink inner secondaries, more restricted bare head skin, and generally brighter soft part colouration.|$|E
50|$|A <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> {{in flight}} {{features}} on the logo of Sembilang National Park. It has also commonly appeared on calendars and posters in public awareness campaigns in Sumatra.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is home to}} Babirusa, both {{species of}} {{endangered}} Anoa - miniature water buffaloes - and 155 bird species, of which 37 are endemic to Sulawesi. Birds in the park include the maleo, lesser adjutant, woolly-necked stork, collared kingfisher, Yellow-crested cockatoo, vinous-breasted sparrowhawk, Sulawesi black pigeon and Nicobar pigeon. The park also provides habitat to a population of 170 endangered <b>milky</b> <b>storks.</b> Primates in the park include the spectral tarsier and the vulnerable booted macaque.|$|R
50|$|Sembilang National Park is a {{national}} park covering 2,051 km2 along {{the east coast of}} Sumatra, Indonesia. The park is dominated by swamps as peat forests, like the neighbouring Berbak National Park, and both parks are Ramsar wetlands of international importance. The park is considered to have the most complex shorebird community in the world, with 213 species recorded, and supports the world's largest breeding colony of <b>milky</b> <b>storks.</b> From Palembang to the Sembilang National Park needs one hour drive plus one and a half hour by boat and then one hour overland.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{the global}} {{population}} was fewer than 2200 individuals, {{which is a}} reduction from approximately 5000 in the 1980s. In Malaysia, population counts decreased steadily from over 100 individuals in 1984 to less than 10 by 2005 (by over 90%), so that the population here faces local extinction. Of the current world population estimate, there are probably about 1600 individuals in Sumatra, less than 500 on Java, and less than 100 on the southeast Asian mainland. The Cambodian population is very small, numbering 100-150 individuals; and {{although it may be}} relatively stable, rapid declines are expected if serious threats persist. Due to the substantial population declines across its range, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork’s</b> population status was elevated to Endangered from Vulnerable in 2013 by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> {{is usually}} silent during non-breeding. At nests, {{individuals}} utter a falsetto “fizz” call during the Up-Down display. The young utter a froglike croak when begging for food.|$|E
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> {{probably}} undertakes short {{seasonal migration}} outside the breeding season, but {{little is known}} of the timing and path of such movements. Local migrations by milky storks (and several other wader species) {{may be caused by}} onset of drought in the dry season. In Cambodia however, it disperses during the wet season from Tonle Sap lake probably to the coast. Milky storks are reported migrating from Sumatra to Java, and across the Sunda Straits, in September and October. Although these apparent migrations are not extensively mapped, <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> flocks are reported to range over 200 km in a day.|$|E
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> {{previously}} ranged {{more widely}} throughout Southeast Asia. For example, it was formerly widely distributed along {{the coasts of}} the Malaysian Peninsula, but is now restricted to Matang Mangrove Forest in Perak.|$|E
50|$|The nests are sturdy, bulky {{structures}} measuring about 50 cm {{in diameter}} and predominantly comprising medium live sticks of Avicenna species on which many leaves are still attached. These nests resemble those of the grey heron and the white ibis but are slightly more robust and comprise thicker twigs. However, other nests found have been small and flimsy structures that resemble those of doves. When collecting nesting material, <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> break off live branches from trees by grasping the branch with their bill and flying upwards a short distance, {{which appears to be}} a difficult task and sometimes unsuccessful. If the stork does not manage the free the branch, it moves on to another one. Nest building continues even with young in the nest.|$|R
50|$|The storks are carnivorous, {{taking a}} range of reptiles, small mammals, insects, fish, {{amphibians}} and other small invertebrates. Any plant material consumed is usually by accident. Mycteria storks are specialists in feeding on aquatic vertebrates, particularly when prey in concentrated by lowering water levels or flooding into shallows. On marine mudflats and mangrove swamps in Sumatra <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> feed on mudskippers, probing the burrow with the bill and even the whole head into the mud. The characteristic feeding method involves standing or walking in shallow water and holding the bill submerged in the water. When contact is made with prey the bill reflexively snaps shut in 25 milliseconds, {{one of the fastest}} reactions known in any vertebrate. The reaction is able to distinguish between prey items and inanimate objects like branches, although the exact mechanism is unknown.|$|R
50|$|Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary is {{a heavily}} forested area {{straddling}} Ratanakiri, Mondulkiri, and Kratie provinces in eastern Cambodia set aside by the Cambodian {{government as a}} wildlife preserve. With an area of 250,000 hectares, {{it is home to}} a variety of endangered wild animals such as banteng, tiger, gaur, dholes and sun bear, as well as leopards, Eld's deer, sambar deer, muntjacs and wild pigs. In addition, a number of rare birds are present: surveys have confirmed the presence of green peafowl, greater and lesser adjutant storks, sarus cranes, oriental pied hornbills, giant ibises, white-shouldered ibises, <b>milky</b> and wooly-necked <b>storks,</b> and vulture sp. (slender-billed and white-rumped), which are increasingly rare in most of South and Southeast Asia.|$|R
50|$|In Peninsula Malaysia, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is more {{exclusively}} marine {{than the}} congeneric painted stork. However, the two species’ ranges {{are said to}} overlap in the marshy plains of Cambodia, where they probably use the same habitats.|$|E
50|$|The milky stork’s {{range is}} {{restricted}} to Southeast Asia, where it is widely but patchily distributed. It occurs in Sumatra (its global stronghold), Java, Sulawesi, eastern Malaysia, Cambodia, southern Vietnam (where it probably largely recolonised after the war of 1963-75), Bali, Sumbawa, Lombok and Buton. It historically occurred in southern Thailand, but is now very likely extinct here. One perfect adult male <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> specimen from Setul in Peninsula Thailand taken from 1935 was later found among collections of the Zoological Reference Collection at the National University of Singapore, suggesting that the species was formerly resident here. The discovered specimen was the first, and probably also the last <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> to be reported from Thailand, although this stork probably still occasionally visits Thailand as a vagrant. It is also vagrant elsewhere to countries such as Bali and Sumbawa, and is resident on Sumatra, Java and Sulawesi (all within Indonesia). The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was first reported on Sulawesi {{when a group of}} five apparently resident individuals was sighted there in 1977. The island of Madura may also support an important population after 170 individuals were sighted there in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Particularly for captive individuals, {{there is}} {{the risk of a}} loss of genetic {{integrity}} through hybridization with painted storks in captivity or in the wild in the northern parts of the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> range where it may co-occur with the painted stork.|$|E
50|$|Common comfort {{movements}} in the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> include allopreening between breeding partners and head shaking. Individuals perched near incubating partners also carrying out head rubbing, whereby the stork oils the bare head skin on its preen gland and then rubs its head on its plumage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was {{essentially}} eliminated from Vietnam through widespread destruction of mangrove swamps during the Southeast Asian War in 1963-75. Subsequent large-scale reforestation may however {{have led to}} some recolonization; although the species has also suffered long-term effects of herbicide application in Southern Vietnam in later years.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{successful}} <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> reintroduction {{was carried out}} in Kuala Selangor Nature Park in 1998 with the release of 10 captive-bred individuals here. [...] Matang Mangrove Forest in Malaysia has been a popular candidate reintroduction site because this area is considered a suitable <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> habitat in terms of shelter, breeding and feeding grounds; and there are apparently minimal threats from predators and parasites. The area is also protected and systematically managed, and raw materials are sustainably harvested here. However, captive individuals released into their natural habitat face new potential threats such as susceptibility to disease, lack of ability to hunt for food and defend territory, and lack of ability to effectively detect and evade potential predators. These released individuals may also harbour disease and parasites that could harm wild populations.|$|E
50|$|This stork has various natural predators. In South Sumatra, monitor lizards, {{especially}} Varanus salvator, {{have been}} reported to predate <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> eggs and juveniles. Crocodiles Crocodilus porosus also sometimes eat young milky storks. In Matang Mangrove Forest in Malaysia, brahminy kites, water monitor lizards and common palm civets Paradoxurus hermaphroditus are potential (nest) predators and probably contribute to low survival here. In captivity in Malaysia, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> may also be potentially threatened by the crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), which is a potential predator of stork eggs and chicks, and whose range has gradually expanded here. This monkey could swim across to nest sites surrounded by water, as they have done for captive grey herons. On Pulau Rambut, potential predators include reticulated python, cat snakes (especially Boiga dendrophila and Brahminy kite. White bellied sea eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster and monitor lizard are also reported to predate chicks here.|$|E
50|$|The park, {{as part of}} the Selangor River estuary, is home to {{a number}} of large bird species such as milky storks and herons as well as primates, namely silver leaf monkeys and long-tailed macaques. The area was a {{breeding}} ground of an endangered <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> species before the program was suspended. An abandoned aviary still {{stands in the middle of}} the park.|$|E
50|$|Another {{potential}} threat to the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is contamination of its natural habitat with elevated concentrations of ions of metals such as copper, zinc and lead. Sources of this observed contamination include use of agrochemicals in Kuala Gula, corrosion and runoff from jetties and boats coated with these metals, and aquaculture development. On Pulau Rambut, breeding colonies might also be threatened by increasing sea pollution.|$|E
5000|$|Before it was {{established}} that the yellow-billed stork was {{closely related to the}} American woodstork, the former was classified as belonging to the genus Ibis, together with the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> and painted stork. However, the yellow-billed stork has actually long been recognised as a true stork [...] and along with the other 3 related stork species, it should not strictly be called an ibis.|$|E
50|$|Some 160 {{species can}} be found inside the park, {{including}} the banteng, barn swallow, black-naped oriole, black racket-tailed treepie, crested serpent-eagle, crested treeswift, dollarbird, hawksbill turtle, Indian muntjac, Java sparrow, Javan lutung, large flying fox, leopard cat, lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, <b>milky</b> <b>stork,</b> Pacific swallow, red-rumped swallow, rusa deer, sacred kingfisher, savanna nightjar, stork-billed kingfisher, water monitor, wild boar, yellow-vented bulbul and the critically endangered Bali myna.|$|E
5000|$|Like other storks, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> habitually soars on {{thermals}} {{to travel}} between areas. Flocks {{of up to}} a dozen birds can be seen soaring on thermals at great heights between 10:00 and 14:00. At breeding colonies and feeding grounds, flight is contagious in that take-off by one bird is quickly followed by others. [...] Average flapping rate has been estimated at 205 beats per minute.|$|E
