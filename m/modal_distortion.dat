50|$|Modal {{dispersion}} is a distortion mechanism {{occurring in}} multimode fibers and other waveguides, {{in which the}} signal is spread in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal {{is not the same}} for all modes. Other names for this phenomenon include multimode distortion, multimode dispersion, <b>modal</b> <b>distortion,</b> intermodal distortion, intermodal dispersion, and intermodal delay distortion.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} phase conjugate {{correction of}} <b>modal</b> <b>distortion</b> {{of a single}} mode beam on double-passing a passive highly multimode fibre. Phase conjugation is achieved in a self-pumped photorefractive BaTiO 3 crystal which conjugates only the e-polarised input component. We show {{that only a small}} fraction of the multimode fibre output is required to faithfully conjugate the single mode input beam. This technique enables the demonstration of a novel non-reciprocal transmission device, which for example has immediate application in gain-grating holographic resonator designs with multimode fibres as the active gain medium...|$|E
40|$|Correction of modal {{dispersion}} of light transmitted through multimode optical fibres {{has been the}} subject of extensive research to date. At low optical powers photoconductive crystals are typically used to produce phase conjugate correction at the output end of the fibre in doublepass schemes [1]. Double-pass correction schemes vary in their approach to overcome the apparent problem that only one (the e-polarised) polarisation state of the scrambled output from the fibre, can undergo phase conjugate correction. We report the results of our study on the implementation of phase conjugate correction of <b>modal</b> <b>distortion</b> in highly multimode, (300 micron diameter), short (~ 1 m) passive optical fibres using a non-polarisation preserving phase conjugation scheme [2] and its application to a non-reciprocal transmission element. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the set-up used to demonstrate phaseconjugate non-reciprocal transmission characteristics in multimode fibres. An initial vertically polarised Gaussian input beam from an Ar-ion laser is launched into fibre A where it becomes polarization and modally scrambled as it travels along fibre A's length. nie optical power coupled into fibre B, and hence the forward transmission factor is dependent on the distance, z, between fibres A and B. The field from fibre B is then sent to a NPPPC consisting of a self-pumped BaTiO 3 crystal. Previous work has shown that the field reflected from such a NPPPC consists of a phase conjugate part which will all couple back from fibre B to A in the reverse direction and a non-phase conjugate part which will have the same transmission characteristics as the forward travelling wave leading to different transmissions for the forward and backward direction. <br/...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple method for the {{detection}} of Bessel beams with arbitrary radial and azimuthal indices, and then demonstrate it in an all-digital setup with a spatial light modulator. We confirm that the fidelity of the detection method is very high, with modal cross-talk below 5 %, even for high orbital angular momentum carrying fields with long propagation ranges. To illustrate the versatility of the approach we use it to observe the modal spectrum changes during the self-reconstruction process of Bessel beams after encountering an obstruction, as well as to characterize <b>modal</b> <b>distortions</b> of Bessel beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence...|$|R
40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{progress in}} power-scaling of ultra-short pulse (USP) lasers and their growing use in industrial applications call for flexible and robust beam delivery systems (BDS) over several meters with no temporal or <b>modal</b> <b>distortions.</b> Inhibited coupling (IC) hypocycloid Kagome hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF) has recently {{proved to be}} an excellent solution for guiding these USP. In order to reduce further the attenuation of such fiber and then to increase the BDS capabilities, we report on an optimized IC Kagome HC-PCF exhibiting record loss level (8. 5 dB/km at 1030 nm) associated with a 225 nm wide 3 -dB bandwidth and low bend sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for detecting locations of damages in thin walled structural components made of fiber reinforced composites (FRC). Therefore, {{the change of}} harmonic distortion, which is found by current research to be very sensitive to delamination, under resonant excitation will be derived from FEM-simulation. Based on the linear modal description of the undamaged structure and the damage-induced nonlinearities represented by a nonlinear measure, two spatial damage indexes have been formulated. The main advantage of this novel approach is that {{the information about the}} defect is represented mainly by changes in the <b>modal</b> harmonic <b>distortion</b> (MHD), which just needs to be measured in one (or few) structural points. The spatial resolution is given by the pairwise coupling of the MHD with the corresponding mode shapes...|$|R

40|$|The article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} efficient analysis of the statistics of initial and corrected shape distortions in space structures. Two approaches for improving efficiency are considered. One is an adjoint technique for calculating distortion shapes: the second is a <b>modal</b> expansion of <b>distortion</b> shapes in terms of pseudo-vibration modes. The two techniques are applied {{to the problem of}} optimizing actuator locations on a 55 m radiometer antenna. The adjoint analysis technique is used with a discrete-variable optimization method. The modal approximation technique is coupled with a standard conjugate-gradient continuous optimization method. The agreement between the two sets of results is good, validating both the approximate analysis and optimality of the results...|$|R
