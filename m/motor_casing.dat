500|$|Tufan Hashemi said Roksan {{sought to}} create {{equipment}} that would excel in high-quality musical reproduction {{and capable of}} involving the listener on an emotional level. Product characteristics were to include precision and transparency of the sound. Moghaddam, acting as chief designer, {{set out to find}} solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in the belt-driven suspended sub-chassis turntable design of Edgar Villchur, where the sub-chassis and tonearm are free to rotate. Moghaddam believed that the design generated undesirable torsional modes. One such torsional mode is said to be caused by [...] "groove drag" [...] – dynamic forces exerted by the stylus on the record as it tracked it. Moghaddam chose to attenuate the torsion by mounting the turntable-drive <b>motor</b> <b>casing</b> on its own bearing. The motor, mounted separately and tethered to a spring, is allowed limited rotation about its own axis; because the load varied with groove modulations, the increases in drag would thus be dampened by the spring-loaded motor, and the platter acceleration mitigated. In the words of Tufan Hashemi, Roksan Audio's managing director: [...] "We argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read, as the record itself would be floating. We said that the record surface should remain stationary and solid but in complete isolation {{from the rest of the}} deck, and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it." ...|$|E

50|$|Carbon in {{the form}} of charcoal, carbon black, graphite, etc., can be and {{sometimes}} is used as a fuel in sugar formulations. Most often, however, a small amount of carbon is used as an opacifier, making a visible smoke trail. The carbon acts as a heat sink, keeping a portion of the heat of combustion located in the propellant rather than having it transferred quickly to the <b>motor</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Reloadable rocket motors are {{specified}} {{in the same manner}} as single-use model rocket motors as described above. However, they have an additional designation that specifies both the diameter and maximum total impulse of the <b>motor</b> <b>casing</b> in the form of diameter/impulse. After that, there is a series of letters indicating the propellant type. However, not all companies that produce reloadable motor systems use the same designations for their motors.|$|E
50|$|These {{developments}} {{will probably}} later {{make their way}} back into the Ariane programme. The incorporation of the ESC-B with the improvements to the solid <b>motor</b> <b>casing</b> and an uprated Vulcain engine would deliver 27000 kg to LEO. This would be developed for any lunar missions but the performance of such a design may not be possible if the higher Max-Q for the launch of this rocket poses a constraint on the mass delivered to orbit.|$|E
50|$|One drive {{technique}} uses piezoelectric ceramics {{to push a}} stator. These piezoelectric motors use {{three groups}} of crystals—two locking, and one motive that permanently connects to either the <b>motor's</b> <b>casing</b> or stator (not both). The motive group, sandwiched between the other two, provides the motion. These piezoelectric motors are fundamentally stepping motors, with each step comprising either two or three actions, based on the locking type. These motors are also known as inchworm motors Another mechanism uses surface acoustic waves (SAW) to generate linear or rotational motion.|$|R
40|$|We {{have built}} the first commercially-made low {{frequency}} acoustic microscope, measured its characteristics, and explored its utility for NDE of composites and other aerospace materials.

We obtained samples of rocket <b>motor</b> <b>casings</b> from the Navy, and structural parts from Navy and Air Force contractors, and demonstrated successful detection of defects in several cases of real interest...|$|R
50|$|Reloadable composite-propellant motors {{are also}} available. These are commercially {{produced}} motors requiring {{the user to}} assemble propellant grains, o-rings and washers (to contain the expanding gases), delay grains and ejection charges into special non-shattering aluminum <b>motor</b> <b>casings</b> with screw-on or snap-in ends (closures). The advantage of a reloadable motor is the cost: firstly, because the main casing is reusable, reloads cost significantly less than single-use motors of the same impulse. Secondly, assembly of larger composite engines is labor-intensive and difficult to automate; off-loading this task on the consumer results in a cost savings. Reloadable motors are available from D through O class.|$|R
50|$|The {{disaster}} drew unfortunate {{comparisons to}} the Challenger shuttle accident three months earlier, {{which was also}} {{the victim of a}} solid rocket motor malfunction. However, the Titan incident was found to have a rather different cause as it had not suffered O-ring burn through, but instead the culprit was a small air pocket between the SRM propellant and its metal <b>motor</b> <b>casing.</b> This allowed hot exhaust gases to burn through the casing and eventually rupture the SRM. The loss of two photoreconnaissance satellites in a row also badly hampered US efforts to acquire intelligence on Soviet activities.|$|E
50|$|Unacceptable wind {{conditions}} had forced a 24-hour postponement of the launch, but the vehicle was successfully launched on May 13, 1964, at 12:59:59.7 UTC (05:59 am MST). A ground commanded abort signal terminated {{thrust of the}} launch vehicle (by rupturing the Algol <b>motor</b> <b>casing),</b> ignited the launch escape and pitch control motors, and separated the command module from the service module. Some structural damage was incurred by the command module aft heat shield because of recontact with the booster at thrust termination. At approximately 44 seconds, the tower jettison motor was ignited and satisfactorily separated the launch escape tower from the command module.|$|E
50|$|Castable {{composite}} {{solid rocket}} motors were invented by Jack Parsons at Caltech in 1942 when he replaced double base propellant with roofing asphalt and potassium perchlorate. This made possible slow-burning rocket motors of adequate size and with sufficient shelf-life for jet-assisted take off applications. Charles Bartley, employed at JPL (Caltech), substituted curable synthetic rubber for the gooey asphalt, creating a flexible but geometrically stable load-bearing propellant grain that bonded securely to the <b>motor</b> <b>casing.</b> This made possible much larger solid rocket motors. Atlantic Research Corporation significantly boosted composite propellant Isp in 1954 {{by increasing the}} amount of powdered aluminium in the propellant to as much as 20%.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMany Navy applications of composites, including ships' superstructures, submarine air flasks, and missile rocket <b>motor</b> <b>casings,</b> require high strength and reliable materials.

The objective was to break the (inevitable) weak fibers and minimize the effects of the associated stress concentration, subsequently limiting the clustering of fiber failures.

50|$|Current efforts {{concerning}} solid propulsion {{focus on}} the development of technologies for future <b>motor</b> <b>casings</b> and the investigation of the physics of solid rocket motors, especially pressure oscillations. Both of these goals are pursued via demonstrators. The “Pressure Oscillation Demonstrator eXperimental” (POD-X) is dedicated to the investigation of combustion physics and has already made a test firing, yielding valuable information into solid propulsion combustion processes. The “Fibre Reinforced Optimized Rocket Motor Case” (FORC) is dedicated {{to the development of the}} dry fibre winding combined with automated dry fibre placement and subsequent resin infusion technology for the manufacturing of large carbon fibre reinforced polymer solid rocket motor cases, including the production of a full-scale and representative test article featuring an outer diameter of 3.5 meters. As of September 2016, multiple sub-scale specimens have already been produced during the process development for FORC. Furthermore, the test article is in the manufacturing phase, with extensive mechanical load and pressure testing scheduled before the end of the year.|$|R
5000|$|While most of {{the chassis}} {{components}} are identical to the 1098/1198, the motor was an all new design in 2008.

5000|$|Sometimes, only {{a single}} weight and cable is used. Such an {{arrangement}} is colloquially named a [...] "yo-weight." [...] When the final stage is a solid rocket, the stage may continue to thrust slightly even after spacecraft release. This is from residual fuel and insulation in the <b>motor</b> <b>casing,</b> outgassing even without significant combustion. In a few cases, the spent stage has rammed the payload. [...] By using one weight without a matching counterpart, the stage eventually tumbles. The tumbling motion prevents residual thrust from accumulating in a single direction; instead, the stage's exhaust averages out to a much lower value {{over a wide range}} of directions.|$|E
50|$|Full Body Spinner - Taking {{the concept}} of the spinner to the extreme, a full body spinner (AKA shell spinner or tuna can spinner) rotates the entire outer shell of the robot as a stored energy weapon. Other robot {{components}} (batteries, weapon <b>motor</b> <b>casing)</b> may be attached to the shell to increase the spinning mass while keeping the mass of the drive train to a minimum. Full body spinners require time to spin the weapon up to speed, typically cannot self-right, and can be unstable (BattleBots competitor Mauler being an infamous example). The 1995 US Robot Wars heavyweight co-champion Blendo was the first effective full body spinner. A variant, the ring spinner, features a narrower spinning ring surrounding the robot; these designs have the advantage of being invertible. BattleBots 2016 competitor The Ringmaster {{is an example of a}} ring spinner.|$|E
40|$|In view {{of their}} {{excellent}} combination of strength and toughness, maraging steels (18 Ni 250 grade) are widely used for the fabrication of large sized solid rocket <b>motor</b> <b>casings.</b> Gas tungsten arc welding is commonly employed to fabricate these thin walled metallic casings, as the technique is not only simple but also provides the desired mechanical properties. However, sometimes, radiographic examination of welds reveals typical unacceptable indications requiring weld repair. As a consequence, {{there is a significant}} drop in weld efficiency and productivity. In this work, the nature and the cause of the occurrence of these defects have been investigated and an attempt is made to overcome the problem. It has been found that weld has a tendency to form typical Ca and Al oxide inclusions leading to the observed defects. The use of calcium fluoride flux has been found to produce a defect free weld with visible effect on weld bead finish. The flux promotes the separation of inclusions, refines the grain size and leads to significant improvement in mechanical properties of the weldment...|$|R

40|$|A {{thermal barrier}} for {{extremely}} high temperature applications {{consists of a}} carbon fiber core and one or more layers of braided carbon fibers surrounding the core. The thermal barrier is preferably a large diameter ring, having a relatively small cross-section. The thermal barrier is particularly suited for use {{as part of a}} joint structure in solid rocket <b>motor</b> <b>casings</b> to protect low temperature elements such as the primary and secondary elastomeric O-ring seals therein from high temperature gases of the rocket motor. The thermal barrier exhibits adequate porosity to allow pressure to reach the radially outward disposed O-ring seals allowing them to seat and perform the primary sealing function. The thermal barrier is disposed in a cavity or groove in the casing joint, between the hot propulsion gases interior of the rocket motor and primary and secondary O-ring seals. The characteristics of the thermal barrier may be enhanced in different applications by the inclusion of certain compounds in the casing joint, by the inclusion of RTV sealant or similar materials {{at the site of the}} thermal barrier, and/or by the incorporation of a metal core or plurality of metal braids within the carbon braid in the thermal barrier structure...|$|R
