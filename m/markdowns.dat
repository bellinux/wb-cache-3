50|$|As of February 2011, Barneys {{no longer}} sells Prada with the {{exception}} of shoes and menswear because of disagreements concerning prices and inventory control. Prada wanted to lease a space, but control its own inventory and <b>markdowns</b> under a concession model. Barneys declined.|$|E
50|$|Because it {{is still}} a new field, {{authoritative}} data on the benefits of demand optimization is not widely available, although suppliers offer case studies of early adopters which claim rapid return on investment, especially in the optimization of the timing and level of price <b>markdowns.</b>|$|E
50|$|On March 28, 2008, UBS AG {{said it was}} marking {{down the}} value of auction rate {{securities}} in brokerage accounts from a few percentage points to more than 20%. The <b>markdowns</b> reflected the estimated drop in value of the securities because the market had frozen, while UBS didn't offer to buy the securities at the new lower prices.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} other {{lightweight}} markup languages extend <b>Markdown</b> by adding features (such as tables, footnotes, definition lists, and <b>Markdown</b> inside HTML blocks) not available in the original <b>Markdown</b> syntax. Among these are <b>Markdown</b> Extra, MultiMarkdown, and the Pandoc <b>Markdown</b> extension.|$|R
5000|$|PHP <b>Markdown</b> - {{a library}} package that {{includes}} the PHP <b>Markdown</b> parser and its sibling PHP <b>Markdown</b> Extra with additional features.|$|R
50|$|<b>Markdown</b> Extra is a {{lightweight}} markup language based on <b>Markdown</b> implemented in PHP (originally), Python and Ruby. It adds features not available with plain <b>Markdown</b> syntax. <b>Markdown</b> Extra is supported in content management systems, for example Drupal, TYPO3 and MediaWiki.|$|R
50|$|A recent {{trend has}} been to use Demand Optimization {{software}} to establish the most desirable timing and level of markdown. Optimization techniques {{can be used to}} determine where the best combination of revenue realization and terminal inventory is going to come from, for example, comparing a tactic of low-level <b>markdowns</b> from early in the season against one of later, deeper reductions.|$|E
50|$|Carnival glass {{originated}} as a glass called 'Iridill', produced {{beginning in}} 1908 by the Fenton Art Glass Company (founded in 1905). Iridill {{was inspired by}} the fine blown art glass of such makers as Tiffany and Steuben, but did not sell at the anticipated premium prices and was subsequently discounted. After these <b>markdowns,</b> Iridill pieces were used as carnival prizes.|$|E
50|$|A U.S. {{consumer}} math course {{might include}} {{a review of}} elementary arithmetic, including fractions, decimals, and percentages. Elementary algebra is often included as well, {{in the context of}} solving practical business problems. The practical applications typically include: changing money, checking accounts, budgeting, price discounts, markups and <b>markdowns,</b> payroll calculations, investing (simple and compound interest), taxes, consumer and business credit, and mortgages.|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} in {{practice}} that retailers liquidate unsold perishable goods via clearance pricing. <b>Markdown</b> money is frequently used between manufacturers and retailers in such a supply chain setting. It {{is a form of}} rebate from a manufacturer to subsidize a retailer's clearance pricing after the regular season. Two forms of <b>markdown</b> money are percent <b>markdown</b> money, in which the <b>markdown</b> money is limited to only a certain percentage of the retail price <b>markdown,</b> and quantity <b>markdown</b> money, which is essentially a buyback contract or returns policy with a rebate credit paid to the retailer for each unsold unit after the regular season. We show both forms of <b>markdown</b> money contracts can coordinate the supply chain and we discuss their strengths and limitations.

50|$|Implementations of <b>Markdown</b> are {{available}} for over a dozen programming languages; in addition, many platforms and frameworks support <b>Markdown.</b> For example, <b>Markdown</b> plugins exist for every major blogging platform.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} <b>Markdown</b> implementation interprets constructs like [...] as {{a request}} to emphasize [...] "long". Many users found this confusing, so many later implementations such as PHP <b>Markdown</b> and Python <b>Markdown</b> do not implement middle word emphasis with underscores.|$|R
50|$|Merchandising {{helps to}} {{understand}} the ordinary dating notation for the terms of payment of an invoice. Codified discounting solves pricing problems including markups and <b>markdowns.</b> It helps to find the net price of an item after single or multiple trade discounts and can calculate a single discount rate that is equivalent {{to a series of}} multiple discounts. Further, it helps to calculate the amount of cash discount for which a payment qualifies.|$|E
5000|$|Although not {{obligated to}} do so, auction-running broker-dealers {{may provide a}} {{secondary}} market for auction rate securities between auctions. If such a market develops, securities can be traded between interested clients at a discount from par value with accrued interest. However, auction-running broker-dealers are generally reluctant to facilitate secondary trading at a discount from par, {{due to the fact}} that in doing so they would necessitate <b>markdowns</b> to the value of other clients' holdings.|$|E
5000|$|For some institutions, {{this also}} {{triggered}} a margin call, such that lenders that had provided the funds using the MBS as collateral had contractual rights {{to get their}} money back. [...] This resulted in further forced sales of MBS and emergency efforts to obtain cash (liquidity) {{to pay off the}} margin call. <b>Markdowns</b> may also reduce the value of bank regulatory capital, requiring additional capital raising and creating uncertainty regarding the health of the bank.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Markdown</b> is a {{lightweight}} markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is {{designed so that}} it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. <b>Markdown</b> is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of <b>Markdown</b> contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of <b>Markdown</b> appeared over the years to answer these issues.|$|R
40|$|Many {{researches}} on deteriorating inventory model {{have been}} developed in recent years. This paper develops deteriorating inventory model with price-dependent demand and uses <b>markdown</b> policy to increase profit. Two examples are used to explain the model and some interesting results are derived. <b>Markdown</b> policy can increase total profit, but the best <b>markdown</b> time and price depend are case dependent...|$|R
50|$|The {{timing and}} level of <b>markdowns</b> in a selling season is {{critical}} to maximising return on sales. This is often measured as revenue realization: {{the proportion of the}} potential original selling price achieved. For example, a revenue realization of 50% means that only half the potential full-price sales value was achieved {{by the end of the}} season. It is also important in minimizing terminal inventory, i.e. the amount of merchandise left when the season is finished.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{traditional}} model, garments and lines are compiled into fixed inventories {{for a particular}} season before delivery to store; the price of those garments is fixed, and remains relatively static until clearance-sale <b>markdowns</b> are employed {{to make way for}} new stock. The Fast Fashion model is more flexible, and the concept of seasons is often sub-divided, with mini-collections being delivered to stores on a more regular basis. This is designed to mitigate some of the impact of season-ending clearance sales (and the associated markdown cost implications).|$|E
50|$|On December 3, she won two {{gold medals}} in the 200-metre {{butterfly}} and in the 400-metre medley. And {{at the same time}} she achieved the world record with substantial <b>markdowns,</b> making her the first swimmer to go down in the 2 minutes in the 200-metre butterfly. In both races, of great parallelism, she had to go back to its main rival, the Hungarian Katinka Hossz√∫, that topped the duels during the majority of the competitions, at times reaching top marks, and who was surpassed twice in the demolisher final developed by Mireia, that managed to maintain the progression of herbeats.|$|E

50|$|MultiMarkdown is a {{lightweight}} markup language created by Fletcher T. Penney {{and based on}} <b>Markdown.</b> It supports more export-formats and implements some added features currently not available with plain <b>Markdown</b> syntax.|$|R
50|$|Web2py also {{includes}} two markup libraries: the markdown2 text-to-HTML filter, which converts <b>Markdown</b> markup to HTML on the fly; and markmin which {{is inspired by}} <b>markdown</b> but supports tables, html5 video/audio and oembed protocol.|$|R
5000|$|In reality, {{however, the}} [...] "Plan of {{external}} management and financial recovery on Atommash OJSC {{for the period}} from 29.11.1995 to 29.05.1997" [...] {{did not lead to}} stabilization. Jobs were cut dramatically, wages were not paid, social tensions were spreading across the entire Volgodonsk city. While the assets of Atommash (through write-offs) and their value (through <b>markdowns)</b> have been reduced sharply, accounts payable, which were growing exponentially, started looking significant in comparison. As a result of the obviously inefficient external management on Atommash OJSC, the Arbitrary Court of Rostov Oblast made a decision to recognize the company bankrupt. Formally, Atommash OJSC was forcibly liquidated as a legal entity on 25.11.1999.|$|E
50|$|Unauthorized marking down prices with a {{computerized}} inventory system or dishonest behavior on {{a computerized}} cash register will generate on several store reports. Item <b>markdowns,</b> overrides, line item voids, suspended transactions, hand-keyed merchandise, refunds outside of normal transaction perimeters, cash over/shorts, and other reports will identify dishonest behavior {{if the person}} viewing the reports knows what to look for. A lot of companies hire a third-party company to run algorithms on their cash register reports to look for specific patterns and behaviors that will identify dishonest behavior. When dishonest behavior is identified, Loss Prevention is notified to investigate if the behavior is intentional theft, policy violation or an inadvertent error that can be solved with additional training.|$|E
50|$|Governor of Rostov Oblast Vladimir Chub {{used the}} letter of MinAtom of Russia ‚Ññ03-2739 from 12.09.1996 in Stepanov's interests. In his appeal ‚Ññ1/6049 to the General Director of the Federal Service for Bankruptcy Proceedings Peter Mostovoy, Chub asks to write off, through the {{reduction}} of capital surplus, specific fixed assets and objects under construction of Atommash OJSC for an amount of 878 billion rubles. This led to a reduction of company's assets, the book value of which has already been drastically discounted. Governor Vladimir Chub had no authority to address the General Director of FSBP Mostovoy with a request to approve <b>markdowns</b> and write-offs of assets, which were a legitimate property of thousands of rightful shareholders, of which Russian Federation with its 30% share was the biggest.|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} taken is very simple: a literate module or calclet {{is simply}} Python code with comment sections written in <b>Markdown.</b> In the generated documentation, the comment sections become uncommented <b>Markdown,</b> and the Python code is transformed to <b>Markdown</b> code blocks. There {{are also a}} few commands for including text blocks, data, and images from the documentation section of an ActivePaper. For a usage example, see code/python-packages/example_module code/example_calclet code/generate_report To use this framework in your own ActivePapers, link code/python-packages/literate_python into it. Then write a calclet similar to generate_report for generating a complete documentation of your work in <b>Markdown</b> format. You can then use pandoc to generate documentation in other formats...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{also the}} format the <b>Markdown</b> {{formatter}} uses to indicate code. Some variations of <b>Markdown</b> support [...] "fenced code blocks" [...] that span multiple lines of code, starting (and ending) with three backticks in a row (...) [...]|$|R
50|$|Fountain (which got {{its name}} from Fountain Avenue, the famous Hollywood shortcut) was {{inspired}} by John Gruber‚Äôs <b>Markdown,</b> and has its origins in two different and non-related projects: Scrippets, developed by John August and Nima Yousefi, and Screenplay <b>Markdown,</b> developed by Stu Maschwitz.|$|R
5000|$|In Ratigan's final CNBC {{broadcast}} {{from the floor}} of the NYSE he reported on what he called [...] "an important story developing" [...] that Goldman Sachs and [...] "a variety of European banks," [...] in his assessment and that of his guests, essentially [...] "perpetrated securities fraud" [...] and an [...] "insurance fraud scam" [...] against AIG [...] - [...] and, by extension, the government and taxpayers funding that insurance company's [...] "bailout" [...] - [...] by insuring their questionable investment vehicles and, upon their devaluation, making claims on them to be paid by AIG [...] "at 100 cents on the dollar" [...] despite all of the <b>markdowns</b> [...] "being forced upon every other" [...] entity including the government, banks, shareholders, bond holders, taxpayers and homeowners.|$|E
50|$|The {{implications}} for stock/inventory {{management of the}} two approaches can be profound. Where little or no duality exists, and so each variant is a separate product, users (at both the head-office and tills) will often be presented with extensive lists of style, size, colour variants which are not optimised to provide either overall product summaries or matrix displays for easier assessment of stock, sales, orders etc. Consequently it can be onerous and error prone to assess {{the performance of the}} style overall (e.g. for <b>markdowns,</b> sell through etc.), or to compare styles to each other. Generally speaking a matrix will be far faster for entering stock by size and colour as well as assessing variants (i.e. sizes/colours) for re-order and transfer purposes. Likewise, at the point of sale, if only extensive size/colour lists are presented in order to identify a missing barcode or for stock lookup purposes, then this can be time consuming and subject to a high level of human error, which then leads to inaccurate stock and sales data.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{initiatives}} {{that made the}} Apple Store successful, for instance the [...] "thought that people would show up in stores because they were fun places to hang out, {{and that they would}} buy things listed at full-but-fair price" [...] did not work for the J.C. Penney brand and ended up alienating its customers who were used to heavy discounting. By eliminating the thrill of pursuing <b>markdowns,</b> the ‚Äúfair and square every day‚Äù pricing strategy disenfranchised JC Penney‚Äôs traditional customer base. [...] Johnson himself was said [...] "to have a disdain for JC Penney‚Äôs traditional customer base." [...] When shoppers weren‚Äôt reacting positively to the disappearance of coupons and sales, Johnson didn‚Äôt blame the new policies. Instead, he offered the assessment that customers needed to be ‚Äúeducated‚Äù as to how the new pricing strategy worked. He also likened the coupons beloved by so many core shoppers as drugs that customers needed to be weaned off." [...] While head of J. C. Penney, Johnson continued to live in California and commuted to work in Plano, Texas by private jet several days a week.|$|E
50|$|<b>Markdown</b> {{also uses}} {{indentation}} {{as part of}} the formal syntax of the language. Indentation is required in <b>Markdown</b> when creating certain source code representations of block quotations as well as when creating sections of source code to be rendered as the code itself.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} set of pricing science applications {{addresses the}} pricing issues confronting traditional retail sales. These include <b>markdown</b> pricing, promotions pricing and shelf pricing.
