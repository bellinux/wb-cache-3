40|$|Ascribing {{function}} to sequence {{in the absence}} of biological data is an ongoing challenge in bioinformatics. Differentiating the toxins of venomous animals from homologues having other physiological functions is particularly problematic as there are no universally accepted <b>methods</b> <b>by</b> which to <b>attribute</b> toxin function using sequence data alone. Bioinformatics tools that do exist are difficult to implement for researchers with little bioinformatics training. Here we announce a machine learning tool called ‘ToxClassifier’ that enables simple and consistent discrimination of toxins from non-toxin sequences with > 99 % accuracy and compare it to commonly used toxin annotation methods. ‘ToxClassifer’ also reports the best-hit annotation allowing placement of a toxin into the most appropriate toxin protein family, or relates it to a non-toxic protein having the closest homology, giving enhanced curation of existing biological databases and new venomics projects. ‘ToxClassifier’ is available for free, either to download ([URL] or to use on a web-based server ([URL]...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the multiple attribute decision making problems with intuitionistic fuzzy information, in which the information about attribute weights is incompletely known, and the attribute values take the form of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In order to get the weight vector of the attribute, we establish an optimization model based on the basic ideal of traditional grey relational analysis (GRA) <b>method,</b> <b>by</b> which the <b>attribute</b> weights can be determined. Then, based on the traditional GRA method, calculation steps for solving intuitionistic fuzzy multiple attribute decision-making problems with completely known weight information are given. The degree of grey relation between every alternative and positive ideal solution is calculated. Then, a relative relational degree is defined to determine the ranking order of all alternatives by calculating the degree of grey relation to both the positive-ideal solution (PIS). Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|With {{a profusion}} of network applications, traffic {{classification}} {{plays a crucial role}} in network management and policy-based security control. The widely used encryption transmission protocols, such as the Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocols, lead to the failure of traditional payload-based classification methods. Existing methods for encrypted traffic classification cannot achieve high discrimination accuracy for applications with similar fingerprints. In this paper, we propose an attribute-aware encrypted traffic classification method based on the second-order Markov Chains. We start by exploring approaches that can further improve the performance of existing methods in terms of discrimination accuracy, and make promising observations that the application attribute bigram, which consists of the certificate packet length and the first application data size in SSL/TLS sessions, contributes to application discrimination. To increase the diversity of application fingerprints, we develop a new <b>method</b> <b>by</b> incorporating the <b>attribute</b> bigrams into the secondorder homogeneous Markov chains. Extensive evaluation results show that the proposed method can improve the classification accuracy by 29 % on the average compared with the state-of-theart Markov-based method...|$|R
