25|$|In 1728 Robert Gillow began {{trading in}} Lancaster as a joiner, builder, house carpenter, {{furniture}} maker and overseas merchant. By {{the summer of}} 1731 he had entered into a partnership with a fellow catholic, George Haresnape, which had ended by 1735. By 1734 six other names appeared on their staff list. Gillows notably made heavy use of <b>mahogany</b> <b>wood,</b> which is indigenous to the Americas, from the early 1730s. In the early 1740s, Gillow owned a twelfth share of the ship Briget, which he partially used to import mahogany from the West Indies. The success of the firm was partly due to his ability to directly import mahogany; by 1742 Gillow was exporting finished mahogany furniture back to the West Indies.|$|E
