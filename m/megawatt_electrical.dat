5000|$|Parallel to the {{development}} of the ABWR, General Electric also developed a different concept, known as the simplified boiling water reactor (SBWR). This smaller 600 <b>megawatt</b> <b>electrical</b> reactor was notable for its incorporation—for the first time ever in a light water reactor—of [...] "passive safety" [...] design principles. The concept of passive safety means that the reactor, rather than requiring the intervention of active systems, such as emergency injection pumps, to keep the reactor within safety margins, was instead designed to return to a safe state solely through operation of natural forces if a safety-related contingency developed.|$|E
50|$|The plant, {{owned and}} {{operated}} by CENG, a joint venture between Exelon and Électricité de France, has two 2737 megawatt thermal (MWth) Combustion Engineering Generation II two-loop pressurized water reactors. Each generating plant (CCNPP 1&2) produces approximately 850 <b>megawatt</b> <b>electrical</b> (MWe) net or 900 MWe gross. Each plant's electrical load consumes approximately 50 MWe. These are saturated steam plants (non-superheated) and are approximately 33% efficient (ratio of 900 MWe gross/2700 MWth core). Only the exhaust of the single high-pressure main turbine is slightly superheated by a two-stage reheater before delivering the superheated steam in parallel to the three low-pressure turbines. Unit 1 uses a General Electric-designed main turbine and generator, while Unit 2 uses a Westinghouse-designed main turbine and generator. The heat produced by the reactor is returned to the bay, which operates as a cooling heat-sink for the plant.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Conventions in the {{electric}} power industry == In {{the electric}} power industry, <b>megawatt</b> <b>electrical</b> (MWe or MWe) refers by convention to the electric power produced by a generator, while megawatt thermal or thermal megawatt (MWt, MWt, or MWth, MWth) refers to thermal power produced by the plant. For example, the Embalse nuclear power plant in Argentina uses a fission reactor to generate 2109 MWt (i.e. heat), which creates steam to drive a turbine, which generates 648 MWe (i.e. electricity). Other SI prefixes are sometimes used, for example gigawatt electrical (GWe). The International Bureau of Weights and Measures, which maintains the SI-standard, states that further information about a quantity should not {{be attached to the}} unit symbol but instead to the quantity symbol (i.e., Pthermal = 270 W rather than P = 270 Wth) and so these units are non-SI. In compliance with SI the energy company DONG Energy uses the unit megawatt for produced electrical power and the equivalent unit megajoule/s for delivered heating power in a combined heat and power station such as Avedøre Power Station.|$|E

40|$|The {{exit from}} nuclear and fossil-fuel energy sources quires {{alternative}} energy sources to be tapped. Concentrating solar power (CSP) {{has proven to be}} an e�cient source of renewable power. In order to operate solar power plants, it is necessary to understand its e�ciency and energy yield in detail. If the direct normal irradiance (DNI) is only known for one or a few points in the solar �eld, errors can occur in the plant simulation and the plant control. The solar collectors, that provide the heat to the power block, cover approximately one square kilometer for 50 <b>megawatt</b> <b>electrical</b> turbine power. In this area, high variations of DNI can occur. For example, in parabolic trough fields four sub fields have their individual heat transfer fluid (HTF) flow control. Hence, the power plant control requires further information about inhomogeneous irradiance. In consideration of the fact, that the power plant operator wants to maximize the profit he needs to know, how the power plant will perform within the next 0 - 15 minutes. Forecasting in this range is called "nowcasting". For nowcasting applications it is beneficial to create irradiance maps with cameras, that observe the sky, to document the current irradiance for every coordinate of the observed area, since the operator is able to preact to short term di�erences in the DNI, which lower the power plant's energy outcome. There is a shadow camera system at Plataforma Solar de Almer��a (PSA), which is used to validate the nowcasting system. The system detects the cloud's shadows on the ground. It was extended from two to six cameras, that enable a 360 � view around the installed tower power plant. Besides, the camera calibration was applied and older results were improved, so that an area of four square kilometers is evaluated. The cameras are recording series of two exposure times in 15 seconds intervals to ensure a high temporal resolution. There is also a sensor grid on the ground, measuring the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and DNI. Its measured irradiance data was implemented to the shadow camera system. By using the shadow camera's sensor information, a relation between image information and incident irradiance was build. Therefore, it is possible to determine irradiance values for shaded regions, that are just de�ned by their image information. Plain view images (orthogonal images) are created for the evaluated area. By analyzing three time stamps, it is possible to detect shadow information. The shadow's structure is described by applying global thresholds. Also, the pixel difference is build between a shadowless and the investigated time stamp. Ultimately, these differences are used to define a DNI difference and generate irradiance maps for the evaluated area. Those resulting irradiance maps can be generated for each time stamp, if camera and irradiance data is given. It was possible to evaluate an entire day. The method's results are evaluated and its accuracy is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The HGPA well, {{located on}} the Lower East Rift Zone of Kilauea Volcano, was drilled in 1976. It is {{completed}} {{to a depth of}} 1966 m 1768 m below sea level and has a bottom hole temperature of approximately 360 C. The well is capable of producing approximately 50, 000 kghr of geothermal fluid 43 steam, 57 brine at wellhead pressure of 1172 kPa and is currently providing steam to a 3 <b>megawatt</b> <b>electrical</b> generator facility. During earlier testing periods and the present extended production 20 months as of the present date from the well, a number of chemical and isotopic analyses have been conducted on the geothermal fluids discharged. The results of these analyses suggest that the geothermal system sampled by HGPA is in some respects analogous to those observed at seafloor spreading centers such as Galapagos or the midAtlantic Ridge. Chemical data and isotopic data are given. During early production testing stable isotopic analyses were performed for hydrogen and oxygen; radio isotopic analyses of carbon dioxide and aqueous tritium were performed at this time as well. More recently a limited number of stable isotope analyses have also been conducted for reduced and oxidized sulfur species. Tritium H and carbon 14 analyses have placed very broad limits on the age of the fluids present in the HGPA reservoir; tritium data obtained after extended well flow tests have yielded values indicating an age of at least 50 years and tritium levels present after an extended pumpdown test of modern water indicated that circulation within the reservoir in the immediate vicinity of the well bore is on the order of at least years rather than months. Two carbon 14 analyses conducted on the well discharge several years apart yielded activities of approximately 20 of modern carbon indicating a maximum age of about 12, 000 years, This age is considered to be an upper limit primarily because the contribution of magmatic carbon of zero activity to the total produced is currently unknown. Stable isotope analyses of hydrogen and oxygen conducted on the early fluids produced by the well indicated that the source of the meteoric component of the reservoir fluids was from an altitude of a few thousand feet higher than that at which the well was located and that relatively little oxygen isotopic exchange had occurred between the reservoir rock and the geothermal fluids. It is highly probable that the fluids sampled for these analyses were heavily contaminated by surface water pumped into the well during quench operations; however, more recent analyses of these isotopes have not been performed to confirm this interpretation. Sulfur isotopic analyses have been conducted on several samples of hydrogen sulfide from the steam phase, aqueous sulfate, and pyrite and anhydrite collected from the HGPA core samples. The results of these analyses are presented in Table 2, It is apparent that the sulfur isotopic ratios for the reduced and oxidized sulfur species are quite divergent suggesting that the reduced and oxidized species may have different sources. It is also noteworthy that there has been an apparent change in the hydrogen sulfide d 34 S values with time. ...|$|E
