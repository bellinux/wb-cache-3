5|$|Looking for a {{near term}} solution, McNamara once again turned to ARPA, asking it to {{consider}} the Zeus system in depth. The agency returned a new report in April 1962 that contained four basic concepts. First was the Zeus system in its current form, outlining what sort of role it might play in various war fighting scenarios. Zeus could, for instance, be used to protect SAC bases, thereby requiring the Soviets to expend more of their ICBMs to attack the bases. This would presumably <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> damage to other targets. Another considered the addition of new passive electronically scanned array radars and computers to the Zeus, which would allow it to attack dozens of targets at once over a wider area. Finally, in its last concept, ARPA replaced Zeus with a new very high speed, short range missile designed to intercept the warhead at altitudes as low as , by which time any decoys or fireballs would be long gone. This last concept became Nike-X, an ad hoc name suggested by Jack Ruina while describing the ARPA report to PSAC.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Fay {{supported}} President Lyndon B. Johnson in {{the establishment}} of the Guadalupe Mountains National Park in West Texas near the New Mexico border. Both acquisitions had long been strongly promoted by Democratic U.S. Senator Ralph Yarborough. Previously, Texas had only one national park: Big Bend along the Rio Grande in the southwestern part of the state. Fay found himself allying with liberal Democrat Yarborough, whereas his opponent, Sadler, and the Texas Republican U.S. Senator John G. Tower were opposed to the additional park lands. Sadler took the view that the acquisition of lands from private individuals would <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> property tax revenues needed to provide the local share of financing of public schools as well as declining funds to the state Permanent School Fund.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{admitted}} {{his team}} had underachieved during the season, but took criticism of failing to challenge Manchester United {{in the league and}} progressing further in the UEFA Champions League as a [...] "compliment to the club". He spoke in favour of moving FA Cup ties midweek to prevent fixture congestion, because the current system was too demanding for the big clubs: [...] "In England a team that goes for the FA Cup automatically has a problem in the championship, especially if they play in the Champions League. There are then so many games something has to be sacrificed and I have sacrificed points in the championship to the FA Cup." [...] When asked whether reducing the number of teams in the UEFA Champions League would help, Wenger commented it [...] "...would <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> money and no one with the wages we pay can accept a drop in income. As for cutting the Premiership – they have done that in France and now those teams not involved in the cups are complaining." ...|$|E

2500|$|Haltom {{turned his}} {{attention}} to developing a system that could operate with shorter timings, thereby allowing the individual cars to be smaller while preserving the same overall route capacity. Smaller cars would <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> weight at any given point, which meant smaller and less expensive guideways. To eliminate the backup at stations, the system used [...] "offline" [...] stations that allowed the mainline traffic to bypass the stopped vehicles. He designed the Monocab system using six-passenger cars suspended on wheels from an overhead guideway. Like most suspended systems, it suffered from the problem of difficult switching arrangements. Since the car rode on a rail, switching from one path to another required the rail to be moved, a slow process that limited the possible headways.|$|E
2500|$|The year {{is divided}} into a wet season from June to September—as summer warmth over Inner Asia creates a low {{pressure}} zone that draws in moist air from the Indian Ocean—and a dry season from October to June as cold temperatures in the vast interior creates a high pressure zone causing dry air to flow outward. [...] April and May are months of intense water stress when cumulative effects of the long dry season are exacerbated by temperatures rising over [...] in the tropical climate belt. Seasonal drought further intensifies in the Siwaliks hills consisting of poorly consolidated, coarse, permeable sediments that do not retain water, so hillsides are often covered with drought-tolerant scrub forest. In fact much of Nepal's native vegetation adapted to withstand drought, but less so at higher elevations where cooler temperatures <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> water stress.|$|E

2500|$|Does {{the retreat}} of the {{sacrificial}} order <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> violence? [...] Not at all; rather, it deprives modern societies {{of most of}} the capacity of sacrificial violence to establish temporary order. [...] The [...] "innocence" [...] of the time of the ignorance is no more. On the other hand, Christianity, following the example of Judaism, has desacralized the world, making possible a utilitarian relationship with nature. [...] Increasingly threatened by the resurgence of mimetic crises on a grand scale, the contemporary world is on one hand more quickly caught up by its guilt, {{and on the other hand}} has developed such a great technical power of destruction that it is condemned to both more and more responsibility and less and less innocence. So, for example, while empathy for victims manifests progress in the moral conscience of society, it nonetheless also takes the form of a competition among victims that threatens an escalation of violence.|$|E
2500|$|On February 14, 2013, US Airways Group and AMR Corporation {{announced}} that the two companies would merge to form the largest airline in the world. In the deal, shareholders of AMR would own 72% of the new company and US Airways Group shareholders would own the remaining 28%. The combined airline would carry the American Airlines name and branding, while US Airways' management team, including CEO Doug Parker, would retain most operational management positions. The headquarters for the new airline would also be consolidated at American's current headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. [...] On August 13, 2013, the United States Department of Justice along with attorneys general from six states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit seeking to block the merger, arguing that it would <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> competition and higher prices. Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, states where either American or US Airways maintained a large presence, were among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, as was Tennessee.|$|E

6000|$|First take [...] "some x are y". Here WE {{understand}} [...] "are" [...] to mean [...] "are, as {{an actual}} FACT"--which of course implies that some x-Things EXIST. But THEY (the writers {{of these other}} treatises) only understand [...] "are" [...] to mean [...] "CAN be", which does not at all imply that any EXIST. So they <b>mean</b> <b>LESS</b> than we do: our meaning includes theirs (for of course [...] "some x ARE y" [...] includes [...] "some x CAN BE y"), but theirs does NOT include ours. For example, [...] "some Welsh hippopotami are heavy" [...] would be TRUE, according to these writers (since the Attributes [...] "Welsh" [...] and [...] "heavy" [...] are quite COMPATIBLE in a hippopotamus), {{but it would be}} FALSE in our Game (since there are no Welsh hippopotami to BE heavy).|$|E
60|$|And yet (strangely enough) though men fuss {{more about}} the worldly symbols, they <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> by them. It is the mark of {{religious}} forms that they declare something unknown. But it is the mark of worldly forms that they declare something which is known, and which {{is known to be}} untrue. When the Pope in an Encyclical calls himself your father, {{it is a matter of}} faith or of doubt. But when the Duke of Devonshire in a letter calls himself yours obediently, you know that he means the opposite of what he says. Religious forms are, at the worst, fables; they might be true. Secular forms are falsehoods; they are not true. Take a more topical case. The German Emperor has more uniforms than the Pope. But, moreover, the Pope's vestments all imply a claim to be something purely mystical and doubtful. Many of the German Emperor's uniforms imply a claim to be something which he certainly is not and which it would be highly disgusting if he were. The Pope may or may not be the Vicar of Christ. But the Kaiser certainly is not an English Colonel. If the thing were reality it would be treason. If it is mere ritual, it is by far the most unreal ritual on earth.|$|E
60|$|These pages {{contain a}} weak and unhandsome attack on Wotton, who doubtless had {{discovered}} that {{the presentation of the}} Premonition previously to the reconciliation as publicly completed, but after it had been privately agreed on, between the Court of Rome and the Senate of Venice, would embarrass the latter: whereas, delivered as it was, it shewed the King's and his minister's zeal for Protestantism, and yet supplied the Venetians with an answer not disrespectful to the king. Besides, what is there in Wotton's whole life (a man so disinterested, and who retired from all his embassies so poor) to justify the remotest suspicion of his insincerity? What can this word <b>mean</b> <b>less</b> or other than that Sir H. W. was either a crypt-Papist, or had received a bribe from the Romish party? Horrid accusations!--Burnet was notoriously rash and credulous; but I remember no other instance in which his zeal for the Reformation joined with his credulity has misled him into so gross a calumny. It is not to be believed, that Bedell gave any authority to such an aspersion of his old and faithful friend and patron, further than that he had related the fact, and that he and the minister differed in opinion as to the prudence of the measure recommended. How laxly too the story is narrated! The exact date of the recommendation by Father Paul and the divines should have been given;--then the date of the public annunciation of the reconciliation between the Pope and Venetian Republic; and lastly the day on which Wotton did present the book;--for even this Burnet leaves uncertain.|$|E
