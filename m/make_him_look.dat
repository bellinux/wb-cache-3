5|$|In {{the first}} Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban, {{published}} in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin's character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made {{it long enough}} to cross his nose. Kenshin's hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword {{to make it easier}} to draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck scarf.|$|E
5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E

5|$|One {{year since}} the {{documentary}} has aired, the crew has returned to gain more footage for the DVD bonus features. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are about to get married. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), after being humiliated with his talent show audition tape going viral on the internet, has found a job at his alma mater Cornell University in the Admissions Office. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) has helped expand Athlead, now named Athleap, opening a branch in Austin, Texas. Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) is enjoying retirement in Florida and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) tries to get Stanley's replacement Malcolm (Malcolm Barrett) fat on chocolates to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Stanley. After being fired by Dwight, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) bought a bar and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) started a career as an author in New York City. Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) has moved to Poland. Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) had faked his death but was then revealed to be a wanted fugitive, so Dwight replaced him with former employee Devon White (Devon Abner). Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) is preparing to run for a State Senate seat and is now Phillip's godfather. Andy, Darryl, Stanley, Toby, and Nellie return to Scranton for the wedding {{as well as a}} panel for the documentary.|$|E
5|$|Todd's {{identical}} twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), {{whom he had}} never known, is physically altered and brainwashed {{to believe that he}} is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa's brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder.|$|E
25|$|In the Tom and Jerry cartoon The Lonesome Mouse (1943), Jerry finds a {{portrait}} of Tom and draws on it to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Hitler. However, this scene is often cut from Cartoon Network airings.|$|E

5000|$|Carlo Gervasi says Bobby's {{eye patch}} <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Hathaway, {{referring}} to Ogilvy and Mather's famous [...] "man {{with an eye}} patch" [...] advertising campaign for C. F. Hathaway Company.|$|R
25|$|Even {{the cast}} poked fun at their alter egos. On October 30, 2006, {{three of the}} series' cast members, {{appearing}} in their characters (Ferrera as Betty, Mabius as Daniel, and Newton as Amanda), gave New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick a 'makeover' to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more like quarterback Tom Brady in a spoof that was featured on ESPN's Monday Night Countdown.|$|E
25|$|According to NBC, the set for {{the show}} has had two major changes over the years. When the show first started in 1991, it was very basic with white walls, {{in an effort to}} capture the feel of fellow talk show Donahue, Jerry's haircut and glasses even seeming to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Phil Donahue. The general look of this set was carried over when the series first moved to Chicago in September 1992, with an unpolished, open air look and bright colored shapes.|$|E
25|$|Kvachkov {{was adamant}} to entreats of his {{supporters}} {{to run for the}} Duma mandate, which would set him free (elected representatives receive immunity from legal prosecution of any kind, whether it's criminal or civil). Kvachkov thought that it would <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> guilty. He continuously insisted that there was no wrongdoing in his actions, even if it was he who stood behind the assassination masterplan, so he shouldn't look for a way to avoid jail time. However, a group of major nationalist groups nominated Kvachkov for the race without even asking his permission.|$|E
25|$|Ui's father whose {{youthful}} appearance <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> {{more like}} her little brother. He is severe and strict, although {{when he is}} pensive, little rats appear atop his head much like his daughter with the baby chicks.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} episode of the series Static Shock, one of the outfits Virgil {{considers}} as his superhero costume resembles Black Vulcan's but includes pants. Richie rejects it, saying the outfit <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like [...] "a battery commercial".|$|R
6000|$|... "No, grandmamma, I forgot that. I {{tried to}} open the door. He called out not to disturb him. I said, 'It's only me,' and {{he opened the door}} directly. What <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> so pale, mamma? Is he ill?" ...|$|R
25|$|Toradora! is an anime {{television}} series {{adapted from the}} light novel series of the same title written by Yuyuko Takemiya and illustrated by Yasu. The series was directed by Tatsuyuki Nagai and produced by J.C.Staff, Masayoshi Tanaka serving as the character designer and Mari Okada serving as the primary scriptwriter. The series follows Ryūji Takasu, {{a high school student}} whose eyes <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like an intimidating delinquent, and Taiga Aisaka, a diminutive girl in his class who is known for her negative attitude towards nearly everyone. The two of them spend their days of high school with their three close friends named Minori Kushieda, Yūsaku Kitamura and Ami Kawashima.|$|E
25|$|Australia was 151 {{for seven}} – {{and the man}} wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong enjoyed {{working with}} Oliver, but Louis' second wife, pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong, {{urged him to}} seek more {{prominent}} billing and develop his newer style away from the influence of Oliver. Lil had her husband play classical music in church concerts to broaden his skill and improve his solo play and she prodded him into wearing more stylish attire to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> sharp and to better offset his growing girth. Lil's influence eventually undermined Armstrong's relationship with his mentor, especially concerning his salary and additional moneys that Oliver held back from Armstrong and other band members. Armstrong and Oliver parted amicably in 1924. Shortly afterward, Armstrong received an invitation to go to New York City {{to play with the}} Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, the top African-American band of the time. Armstrong switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section. His influence upon Henderson's tenor sax soloist, Coleman Hawkins, can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period.|$|E
50|$|A {{frilled lizard}} who first appears in Louis' dream in the prologue. He then {{appears in the}} {{epilogue}} where he asks Larry the echidna if his frill <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> scary, or if he is just kidding himself. He is voiced by Jess Harnell.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Mr. Hackit, 'and my wife makes Mr. Barton a good stiff glass o' brandy-and-water, when {{he comes}} into supper after his cottage preaching. The parson likes it; it puts a bit o' colour into 'is face, and <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> a deal handsomer.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Brown Magic", {{an episode}} of The Cleveland Show, Cleveland Brown and his six-year-old stepson Rallo Tubbs both perform a magic show, with Rallo acting like a toy dummy. During the comedic act, Rallo {{explains}} that his puppet costume <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like a [...] "black Chucky".|$|R
500|$|Krusty's {{design has}} {{undergone}} several subtle changes {{since the early}} years. For the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Krusty's design was permanently enhanced and {{he was given a}} different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags under his eyes in order to distinguish him from Homer. In the episode [...] "Lisa's Wedding", which is set fifteen years in the future, Krusty's design was significantly altered to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> considerably older and was based on Groucho Marx.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Sasuke's {{appearance in}} Part II, Kishimoto's main {{objective was to}} <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> cool. For this, he tried several outfits, such as wrapping him in Shimenawa to evoke the design Orochimaru, then Sasuke's master. He also tried other clothing such as a turtleneck and a military uniform to show [...] "cleanliness". However, he ended up choosing Japanese-style clothes with a Chokutō-style sword. For the film , Kishimoto gave Sasuke a new, young adult design, with [...] "even sharper" [...] facial features.|$|E
500|$|With Final Destination cast, filming {{took place}} on Long Island for the plane scene and Vancouver Island for the {{additional}} scenes. [...] Unfortunately, the cast members were filming other projects during production, so filming schedules had to be moved repeatedly in order {{for all of the}} cast to appear. [...] Sawa restrained his appearance in The Guilty during production, and even commented that [...] " [...] had to share a trailer with Bill Pullman because it was bigger and would <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more famous". Smith, who was a regular in Dawson's Creek, had to hold episodes for the film.|$|E
5000|$|Kyuu's sister-in-law. At first, Ageha {{thinks she}} and Kyuu are dating, which makes her jealous as Ran {{has a great}} figure and is {{described}} as beautiful. However, she is really good friends to Kyuu and <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> after her baby twins when she's shopping. Her children's names are Rui and Mari.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! you'll soon see. If {{there is}} any fun in him, they will soon cast him off; but now he is new, {{and he has not}} found them out yet, and they do dearly like to say Sir Gerald; so Johnny is {{regularly}} thrown out, and that is what <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> sulky." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Lovel is brown,--with blue eyes; {{but it is}} {{the shape}} of his face that is so perfect,--an oval, you know, that is not too long. But it isn't that <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> as he does. He looks as though {{everybody}} in the world ought to do exactly what he tells them." ...|$|R
500|$|The Silver Samurai, {{rendered}} by Weta Digital, {{was based}} on a model that had been 3D printed and chrome painted using electrolysis. Stunt performer Shane Rangi, wearing a motion capture suit, stood on stilts while filming as the Silver Samurai. Rangi's performance was then used to animate the digital character. Hill said the main challenge was creating the Silver Samurai's highly reflective surface, [...] "He's pretty much chrome. We were worried {{that he was going to}} look incredibly digital and that it was going to be very hard to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> solid and real and not just like a mirrored surface." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, the Japanese {{publishers}} of Rurouni Kenshin released the kanzenban edition. In the fifth kanzenban, Watsuki redesigned {{the character of}} Sanosuke in a draft version. To emphasize his hate of the Meiji Government, Watsuki drew the Japanese kanji for [...] {{on the back of}} Sanosuke's jacket in the original series, but on the kanzenban redesign, the tattoo is located inside his clothes. Unlike in the manga where Sanosuke uses an oversized zanbatō as a weapon, Watsuki gave him a more historically authentic zanbatō; a sword notably thinner and longer in design. He also gave him an armor-like cloth to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more as a warrior.|$|E
500|$|Meeting {{the rest}} of Pam's family and friends, Greg still feels like an outsider. Despite efforts to impress the family, Greg's {{inadvertent}} actions make him {{an easy target for}} ridicule, disdain and anger: He accidentally breaks Debbie's nose during a volleyball mishap; uses a malfunctioning toilet that floods the Byrnes' back yard with sewage; sets the wedding altar on fire and inadvertently leads Jack to think he is a marijuana user. He also feels inferior to Kevin, Pam's ex-fiance who, unlike him, receives nothing but warmth and friendliness from Jack. Later, Greg loses Jinx and replaces him with a feral cat whose tail he spray paints to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Mr. Jinx while desperately seeking Jack's approval.|$|E
50|$|Happosai: Happosai's special {{attacks are}} a small projectile, his Happo-Fire Burst and {{extending}} his battle aura (which <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> several times larger). His stage is a giant statue of Principal Kuno. Happosai is unplayable without a code, and only appears as the final boss if the player chooses Pantyhose in Single Player mode.|$|R
