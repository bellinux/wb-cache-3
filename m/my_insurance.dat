There was a rich widow disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows. She yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers. I knelt at her feet in gratitude and adoration. She blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into close contact with those supplied me, temporarily, by Grandjean. I know not how the entanglement took place, but so it was. I arose with a shining pate, wigless; she in disdain and wrath, half buried in alien hair.

Surrounding ships were notified by wireless and in three hours the first steamer came, but cannot get near owing to the storm raging and the reef which we are on. There are now seven ships near. When the tide went down, two-thirds of the boat was high and dry. We are expecting the lights to go out at any minute, also the fires. The boat might go to pieces, for the force of the waves are terrible, making awful noises {{on the side of the}} boat, which has quite a list to port. No one is allowed to sleep, but believe me dear Dorrie it might have been much worse. Just hear there is a big steamer coming. We struck the reef in a terrible snowstorm.

5000|$|Prior to the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway, track {{president}} Humpy Wheeler spent $250,000 {{to grind}} out bumps that were well-known at the track in {{a process known as}} levigation. The intent was to smooth out the surface and create more side-by-side racing. The results were dismal, as the smooth surface put excessive stress the tires, leading to premature failures. The race saw a then NASCAR-record 22 caution periods (16 were for spins or crashes, stemming from the tire issues). When the series returned in the fall for the UAW-GM Quality 500, additional levigation to the track was done in an effort to correct the problems, but it only made the issues worse. A total of 15 cautions flew during the race, 13 of which were blamed on the tires and the surface. It was believed that 42 of the 43 teams faced tire issues on the night.

The survey confirms that every day, people are being forced to make life-and-death decisions: Pay the health care premiums or buy the life-saving prescription? Chip away at credit card debt or skip the required care for a serious chronic condition? Nearly everyone is dissatisfied with health care costs—including almost three-quarters of people with insurance.

30|$|In this study, I {{contribute}} {{new evidence}} to {{the literature on the}} career effects of leaving school in an economic downturn. Previous work has focused mainly on wages and earnings, occupational prestige, and likelihood of promotion. I document here that leaving school in an economic downturn also persistently reduces the probability of access to non-monetary forms of compensation as measured by employer-sponsored health and life <b>insurance.</b> <b>My</b> findings are driven mainly by men, and this is consistent with previous work that has identified stronger career effects of leaving school in an economic downturn for men than women. Specifically, in my preferred IV specification I find that a 1 percentage point increase in the school-leaving state unemployment rate leads to a 1.7 % reduction in the probability of access to employer-sponsored health insurance among men. Although this effect dissipates across time, it is statistically distinguishable from zero 18  years after school-leaving.|$|R

The major goal of the present work was to evaluate patients' priorities using the brief ICF-HNC as a starting point. A priorities assessment checklist consisting of 15 statements was created based on the 14 validated categories of the brief ICF-HNC. In a cross-sectional study, patients were requested to select up to 5 items that were especially important to them. The checklist was sent by mail to 465 patients at different time points of cancer follow-up and handed out to 56 patients with recent HNC diagnosis.
