The pre-1987 engines had an oil filter adapter with 3/4 (cylinder block end) and 13/16 threads (which used a GM oil filter common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac V8 engines) while the 1987-06 engines were originally {{fitted with a}} 20mm <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> filter (later revised in 1991 for the common 3/4 threaded Mopar and Ford V8 oil filter; the oil filter adapter was redesigned where the oil filter is positioned 90 degrees offset adjacent to the starter motor - a Ford V8 oil filter {{can be used in}} place of the short filter increasing oiling capacity).|$|E

50|$|The {{trapezoidal}} <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> form {{is similar}} to the Acme thread form, except the thread angle is 30°. It is codified by DIN 103. Although metric screw threads are generally more prevalent worldwide than imperial threads, the Acme thread is very common worldwide, and may be more widely used than the trapezoidal <b>metric</b> <b>thread.</b> This is not surprising, as manufacturers today are usually capable of making whichever threads (metric or imperial) are best for any given application (based on customer expectations or tooling availability). It may be that the tooling for Acme threads has been so dominant (compared to trapezoidal metric) that customers tend to want Acme threads for power screws regardless of metric standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|E

50|$|The Swiss-designed Thury {{screw thread}} (alternatively called the Filière Suisse (FS) screw thread) is a <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> {{standard}} {{that was developed}} {{in the late nineteenth century}} for screws used in scientific and horological instruments. The thread is named after Marc Thury, an engineer and professor at the University of Geneva who contributed heavily to the standard's development.|$|E
5000|$|The design {{principles}} of ISO general-purpose <b>metric</b> screw <b>threads</b> ("M" [...] series threads) are defined in international standard ISO 68-1. Each thread {{is characterized by}} its major diameter, D (Dmaj in the diagram), and its pitch, P. ISO <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> consist of a symmetric V-shaped thread. In {{the plane of the}} thread axis, the flanks of the V have an angle of 60° to each other. The thread depth is 0.614 × pitch. The outermost [...] and the innermost [...] of the height H of the V-shape are cut off from the profile.|$|R
50|$|However, internationally, {{the metric}} system was eclipsing inch-based {{measurement}} units. In 1947, ISO was founded; and in 1960, the metric-based International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Système International) was created. With continental Europe {{and much of}} the rest of the world turning to SI and ISO <b>metric</b> screw <b>thread,</b> the UK gradually leaned in the same direction. The ISO <b>metric</b> screw <b>thread</b> is now the standard that has been adopted worldwide and is slowly displacing all former standards, including UTS. In the U.S., where UTS is still prevalent, over 40% of products contain at least some ISO <b>metric</b> screw <b>threads.</b> The UK has completely abandoned its commitment to UTS in favour of ISO <b>metric</b> <b>threads,</b> and Canada is in between. Globalization of industries produces market pressure in favor of phasing out minority standards. A good example is the automotive industry; U.S. auto parts factories long ago developed the ability to conform to the ISO standards, and today very few parts for new cars retain inch-based sizes, regardless of being made in the U.S.|$|R

5000|$|During this era, in {{continental}} Europe, the British and American threadforms {{were well}} known, but also various <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> standards were evolving, which usually employed 60° profiles. Some of these evolved into national or quasi-national standards. They were mostly unified in 1898 by the International Congress for the standardization of screw threads at Zurich, which defined {{the new international}} <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> standards as having the same profile as the Sellers thread, but with metric sizes. Efforts {{were made in the}} early 20th century to convince the governments of the U.S., UK, and Canada to adopt these international thread standards and the metric system in general, but they were defeated with arguments that the capital cost of the necessary retooling would drive some firms from profit to loss and hamper the economy. (The mixed use of dueling inch and metric standards has since cost much, much more, but the bearing of these costs has been more distributed across national and global economies rather than being borne up front by particular governments or corporations, which helps explain the lobbying efforts.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Löwenherz thread form {{is unique}} in having a thread pitch angle of 53° 8′ (53.1333°), which is a smaller angle than the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> form but a larger angle than the Thury thread form. The unusual angle was chosen so that the pitch would be {{approximately}} equal to the thread's triangular height; however, the design was later truncated (flattened) at the roots and crests of the thread {{by a factor of}} one-eight the pitch, so the pitch is about 25% larger than the height, and the thread's depth is about 75% the length of its pitch. The Löwenherz fastener is specified for 31 diameters at irregular intervals ranging from 1mm to 40mm, each with a single corresponding pitch. (This further differentiates the Löwenherz thread from the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>thread,</b> where screws must be specified by both their diameter and pitch because multiple pitches exist for a single diameter.) Löwenherz fasteners are assembled using standard metric wrenches or sockets, and often the hex size for bolt heads and nuts is repeated (so 17mm wrenches can be used on both 9mm and 10mm Löwenherz hardware).|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{a popular}} screw {{standards}} {{for nearly a}} century, both the Thury thread and the BA thread have largely {{been replaced by the}} ISO <b>Metric</b> <b>thread</b> form. Today the Thury thread is today rare outside out antiques due to the relative abundance of other standard sized fasteners. For example, the British Association 0BA, the Löwenherz 6mm and ISO M6x1.0 fasteners have identical pitch and diameter to the Thury size 0 (however, they are not interchangeable because they differ in thread geometry).|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason for}} {{adopting}} 26 tpi, is brass tube has a relatively similar wall thickness {{irrespective of the}} outside diameter of the tube, therefore as BSW thread depths {{are determined by the}} threads per inch, a lower tpi would reduce the strength of the tube or cut right through it. Brass tube threads can be confused with the British Standard Cycle thread, one of which that is most common is also 26 tpi.

5000|$|Knuckle threads {{with a flat}} 30 degree flank {{thread angle}} are {{standardized}} in DIN 405 for inch pitches and diameters ranging from 8mm to 200mm. [...] A more recent standard DIN 20400 uses <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> pitch and lists diameters from 10mm to 300mm. [...] As DIN is a German organization, many instances of the DIN thread charts write numbers with a comma as the decimal point. For a thread pitch p, the crest and root rounding radius is slightly less than p/4, and approximately the middle third of each thread flank is flat.|$|E
50|$|An {{adapter ring}} has a female M42×0.75 <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> {{on one side}} and a {{corresponding}} lens mount of the camera body on the other side. A T-adapter consists of an inner ring with T-mount thread and an external ring with corresponding lens mount. The T-ring and the T-2 ring are identical to each other. Both of them have the inner and outer ring. The two rings (inner and outer) are held together by 3 peripheral screws on the external ring. Loosening these screws allows rotation between the lens and the camera body. This is especially useful when the camera body is attached to telescopes or microscopes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and fine threads, {{there is another}} division of extra fine, or “superfine” threads, with a very fine pitch <b>thread.</b> Superfine pitch <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|R
