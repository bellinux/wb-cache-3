50|$|Under his leadership, Equity Broadcasting {{operated}} 24 {{full power}} stations, 37 Class A stations and 67 low power stations. Morton created EBC’s C.A.S.H.

50|$|Owned by Tamer Media, KWBQ is {{sister to}} MyNetworkTV {{affiliate}} KASY-TV and both stations share studios on Washington Street in northeastern Albuquerque. Nexstar Media Group provides technical, engineering and accounting services for KWBQ through a shared services agreement, though {{the station is}} otherwise operated separately from KRQE as Tamer handles <b>master</b> <b>control,</b> <b>programming,</b> advertising sales and retransmission consent negotiations. Syndicated programs seen on KWBQ include The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, How I Met Your Mother, Modern Family, Grace Under Fire, Seinfeld and The Office. Following the cancelation of The Daily Buzz in April 2015, KWBQ began to air local news from KRQE from 7-9 a.m. The station {{can also be seen}} on Comcast Xfinity channel 6 and in high definition on digital channel 214.|$|R
25|$|In 1961, Burroughs Corporation {{introduced}} the B5000 with the MCP, (<b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Program)</b> operating system. The B5000 was a stack machine designed to exclusively support high-level languages with no machine language or assembler, {{and indeed the}} MCP was the first OS to be written exclusively in a high-level language ESPOL, a dialect of ALGOL. MCP also introduced many other ground-breaking innovations, such as being the first commercial implementation of virtual memory. During development of the AS/400, IBM made an approach to Burroughs to license MCP to run on the AS/400 hardware. This proposal was declined by Burroughs management to protect its existing hardware production. MCP is still in use today in the Unisys ClearPath/MCP line of computers.|$|E
500|$|Boxleitner also portrays Tron/Rinzler, a {{security}} program originally developed by Bradley to monitor ENCOM's <b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Program</b> and later reassigned by Flynn {{to defend the}} Grid, who was overpowered and re-purposed by Clu as a masked command program wielding an identity disk that splits into two, in flashback sequences via the same treatment as Bridges' younger self for Clu. Anis Cheurfa, a stunt actor, portrayed Rinzler, while Boxleitner provided the dialogue. Rinzler is named after author and Lucasfilm Executive Editor J.W. Rinzler.|$|E

40|$|The {{battlefield}} simulation {{is often}} {{faced with a}} bewildering array of conflicting stresses and challenges. Communication is currently slower and more costly than computation. Expert System technologies such as production rule systems allow one to acquire and represent the collection of heuristic rules in computer compatible form. The system also include <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> that determine {{the order in which}} these rules should be applied against the monitored system performance to amve at appropriate system control. These expert systems are used in two nodes, both as an intelligence assistant to the expert, amplifying the capacity and quality of his work, and as a surrogate for an expert when he is not available. An Expert support System (ESS) designed and developed for combat simulation has been enumerated in this article. The quality and the reliability of the inferred tactical situation is improved by using PROLOG. This formal A 1 language is used for validating and checking sensor detections for consistency and logical plausibility. The supremacy of PROLOG for creating and interrogating a data base helps maintaining a reasonably coherent feature of the tactical situation. The perils and pitfalls of tackling with expert systems have also been underscored. 1...|$|R
50|$|Western Illinois University {{had been}} {{surveying}} tower sites, south of Macomb, {{since the late}} 1960s for a planned university television station and relocation of the university's FM station, WIUM, 250 ft guyed radio tower, erected in 1956. The tower was located next to Sallee Hall, {{in the middle of}} the university's rapidly expanding campus. After examining a number of sites south of Macomb, in 1976 WIU selected a tower site on land bequeathed to the university by Jack Horn, regional Coca-Cola bottler. In 1977, WIU and Convocom agreed to co-locate the television station, WIUM-TV and supporting microwave relay network on this same tower. Construction of a new 500 ft tower was completed in 1980 and WIUM's transmitters were relocated to the site in 1981. Two microwave relay towers were constructed in 1983 between Peoria and Quincy at Cuba, Illinois and Carthage, Illinois for <b>master</b> <b>control,</b> PBS <b>program</b> feeds, local program feeds, and TV studios at WIU in Macomb and at WGEM-TV in Quincy.|$|R
2500|$|Under Unix, the {{operating}} system consists of many utilities along with the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>program,</b> the kernel. The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the file system and other common [...] "low-level" [...] tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously. To mediate such access, the kernel has special rights, reflected in the division between user space and kernel space.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, {{computer}} software engineer extraordinaire and former ENCOM employee Kevin Flynn {{owns and operates}} a video arcade called Flynn's. During his time at ENCOM he wrote several video games {{and was about to}} start his own enterprise when Ed Dillinger, a colleague, stole Flynn's ideas and passed them off as his own, earning himself a meteoric rise through ENCOM's ranks to Senior Executive VP, and the authority to fire Flynn to cover up his larceny. In the nearly three years since Flynn's dismissal, he has made attempts to obtain evidence of Dillinger's crime by hacking into the ENCOM mainframe, but despite his shrewdness Flynn keeps getting caught by ENCOM's <b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Program</b> ("MCP" [...] for short), an AI software program which was originally a chess program created by Dr. Walter Gibbs, ENCOM's co-founder. But with Dillinger's modifications, the MCP has become sentient and power-hungry, unlawfully annexing personal, corporate, and even government and military programs, assimilating them to itself to increase its own capabilities; the MCP informs Dillinger of its plans to subjugate both the Pentagon and the Kremlin, and expresses interest in China with its request for Chinese language files, {{going so far as to}} blackmail Dillinger himself into compliance by threatening to publicly reveal records of his theft.|$|E

50|$|The Burroughs Corporation (which later {{merged with}} Sperry/Univac to form Unisys) offered an {{alternative}} to S/360 with their Burroughs large systems B5000 series. In 1961, the B5000 had virtual memory, symmetric multiprocessing, a multiprogramming operating system (<b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Program</b> (MCP)), written in ALGOL 60, and the industry's first recursive-descent compilers as early as 1963.|$|E
5000|$|The B1000 is {{distinguished}} from other machines {{in that it}} had a writeable control store allowing the machine to emulate any other machine. The Burroughs MCP (<b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Program)</b> would schedule a particular job to run. The MCP would preload the interpreter for whatever language was required. These interpreters presented different virtual machines for COBOL, Fortran, etc.|$|E
