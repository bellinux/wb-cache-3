5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better <b>maps</b> <b>of</b> Mars to be {{made using}} the data from these missions, and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed <b>maps</b> <b>of</b> the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These maps are available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.|$|E
