In addition, Becker {{was in the midst}} of a drug problem and both, they later recalled, seemed depressed. Though Fagen imagined they might [...] "stick it out for a while," [...] he admitted to Robert Palmer of The New York Times, in an article published on June 17, 1981, that the group had indeed separated. [...] "Basically, we decided after writing and playing together for 14 years, we could use a change mondaire as the French say," [...] he told Palmer. After their split, Fagen worked on a song for the soundtrack of the film Heavy Metal, which got him back in the studio. He began working towards a solo album shortly thereafter. [...] "Working on it has been interesting. The fact that it's not a Steely Dan album has freed <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> certain image, a preconceived idea of how it'll sound," [...] he said at the time. Fagen had hoped to record music on his own [...] "a year or so" [...] prior to the duo's breakup. The album was originally slated to be titled Talk Radio.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{describes}} herself as a [...] "singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star" [...] and maintains that honest songwriting {{is very important to}} her. She told Marie Claire: [...] "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable." [...] Kristen Wiig commented that [...] "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." [...] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." [...] The New York Times labeled her [...] "the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent [...] "clichés". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.|$|E
500|$|The Shadow of the Glen, {{based on}} a story about an unfaithful wife, was {{attacked}} in print by the Irish nationalist leader Arthur Griffith as [...] "a slur on Irish womanhood". Years later Synge wrote: [...] "When I was writing The Shadow of the Glen some years ago I got more aid than any learning could have given <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> chink in {{the floor of the}} old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen." [...] This encouraged more critical attacks alleging that Synge described Irish women in an unfair manner. Riders to the Sea was also attacked by nationalists, this time including Patrick Pearse, who decried it because of the author's attitude to God and religion. Pearse, Arthur Griffith and other conservative-minded Catholics claimed Synge had done a disservice to Irish nationalism by not idealising his characters. However, later critics have attacked Synge for idealising the Irish peasantry too much. A third one-act play, The Tinker's Wedding, was drafted around this time, but Synge initially made no attempt to have it performed, largely because of a scene in which a priest is tied up in a sack, which, as he wrote to the publisher Elkin Mathews in 1905, would probably upset [...] "a good many of our Dublin friends".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} between the wars, feminists fought {{discrimination}} and establishment opposition. In Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, Woolf describes {{the extent of the}} backlash and her frustration at the waste of so much talent. By now, the word [...] "feminism" [...] was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such. In 1938, Woolf wrote of the term in Three Guineas, [...] "an old word ... that has much harm in its day and is now obsolete". When Rebecca West, another prominent writer, had been attacked as [...] "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment [...] "I myself {{have never been able to}} find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> doormat, or a prostitute." [...] Woolf's writing also examined gender constructs and portrayed lesbian sexuality positively.|$|E
2500|$|Cardi B {{was born}} Belcalis Almanzar, on October 11, 1992, to a Trinidadian mother and Dominican father. She {{was raised in}} the Highbridge {{neighborhood}} located in the South Bronx section of New York City. Growing up she {{spent a lot of time}} at her grandmother's place in Washington Heights, Manhattan, to which she credits why she has [...] "such a thick accent". As a youth, Cardi B was a member of the Bloods street gang, claiming to have been a [...] since the age of 16. She went on to attend Renaissance High School For Musical Theater & Technology, a small specialty school collocated on the Herbert H. Lehman campus. During her teenage years, she was employed at an Amish Market supermarket in Lower Manhattan, which was the last job that she held before turning to stripping at the age of 19. Upon being fired from Amish Market, she was recommended by her former manager to work at a strip club. She has said she became a stripper to escape poverty and domestic violence, having been in an abusive relationship at the time. Cardi B has also said becoming a stripper was positive for her life in many ways: [...] "It really saved <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lot of things. When I started stripping I went back to school." [...] Due to her new sudden career path and the expectations it held, Cardi B turned to cosmetic surgery, getting breast implants and buttock augmentation. Cardi B said at the time she was involved in an abusive relationship with her then boyfriend, whom she lived with in a small Bronx apartment. She says stripping was her only way out, a way to earn enough money to escape her dire situation and get an education. Nonetheless, she ended up dropping out of college. In 2013, Cardi B began to gain notoriety due to several of her videos going viral on social media, namely Vine and her official Instagram page.|$|E
2500|$|The Irish Times {{stated that}} [...] "it is an {{unprecedented}} development that {{the mainstream media}} have been prevented from publishing privileged remarks in the Dáil due {{to the threat of}} legal action". However it also added that Deputy Murphy's Dáil speech was still available on the Oireachtas website, and that the website Broadsheet.ie had ignored a request by solicitors to remove a copy of her speech. Broadsheet.ie rejected the request by referring to Article 15.12 of the Irish Constitution In response, Denis O’Brien’s legal representative said the High Court ruling “covers what could be reported about what was said in the Dáil by Catherine Murphy” and again put us ‘on notice’. Unfortunately, the judge in the case never revealed the terms of the injunction. In a statement Catherine Murphy said: “I am a public representative. Information came to <b>me,</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of reliable sources, that is, without doubt, in the public interest. I have a duty to put that information into the public domain and I fully intend to fulfill my democratic mandate.”}} - this states [...] "All official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof and utterances made in either House wherever published shall be privileged." [...] 15: CONSTITUTION AND POWERS ARTICLE 15 ... 12 All official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof and utterances made in either House wherever published shall be privileged.}} Former Attorney General Michael McDowell indicated that parliamentary privilege does not grant [...] "absolute impunity", but that he expected it would apply in this case. In the High Court the following Tuesday (June 2, 2015), Mr Justice Donald Binchy stated that it was [...] "never intended nor could it have been intended that any order of this court would impact upon entitlements of deputies to speak as they see fit or the entitlement of the media to report on those utterances", but added that it was [...] "entirely understandable" [...] that RTÉ had sought court clarification on this.|$|E
