40|$|One {{important}} {{mechanism of}} drug resistance in acute leukemia is the overexpression of the multi-drug resistance (MDR 1) gene that encodes a 170 -kDa membrane protein called P-glycoprotein. To estimate the incidence {{and role of}} MDR 1 gene expression in patients with acute leukemia, we investigated the expression of MDR 1 by using the RT-PCR method in blast cells from 40 cases of de novo acute leukemia. We found a high frequency of MDR 1 gene expression: 10 out of 20 with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 8 out of 17 with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), {{and none of the}} 3 with de novo acute <b>mixed</b> <b>leukemia,</b> were MDR 1 mRNA-positive. No correlation between cluster designation (CD) surface markers (CD 19, CD 7, CD 13, CD 33, CD 34, CD 14, HLA-DR) and MDR 1 gene expression in AML was found. The complete remission rate was correlated with MDR 1 gene expression. Among 40 evaluable patients examined, 17 % (3 of 18) with MDR 1 mRNA-positive reached complete remission versus 77 % (17 of 22) with MDR 1 mRNA-negative (p= 0. 044).

In contrast to other types of childhood acute <b>leukemias,</b> <b>mixed</b> lineage <b>leukemia</b> presents with a dismal prognosis and despite the avail-ability of advanced treatment methods cure rates have stagnated over the last years. <b>Mixed</b> lineage <b>leukemia</b> is charac-terized {{by the presence of}} MLL fusion proteins that are the result of chromosomal translocations affecting the MLL gene at 11 q 23. These events juxtapose the amino-terminus of the histone methyltransferase MLL with a variety of different fusion partners that destroy normal histone methyltransferase function of MLL and replace it by heterologous functions contributed by the fusion partner. The resulting chimeras are transcriptional regulators that take control of targets nor-mally controlled by MLL with the clustered HOX homeobox genes as prominent examples. Recent studies suggested that MLL fusion partners activate transcription by two different mechanisms. Some of these proteins are themselves chro-matin modifiers that introduce histone acetylation whereas other fusion partners can recruit histone methyltransferases. In particular, histone H 3 specific methylation at lysine 79 catalyzed by DOT 1 L has been recognized as a hallmark of chro-matin activated by MLL fusion proteins. Interestingly, several frequent MLL fusion partners seem to coordinate DOT 1 L activity with a protein complex that stimulates the elongation phase of transcription by phosphorylating the carboxy-ter-minal repeat domain of RNA polymerase II.

40|$|In {{the blood}} system, {{knowledge}} on {{the regulation of}} hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their immature progeny has provided roadmaps of differentiation. Such information can also have a value to understand the etiology of hematological cancers, since clinical heterogeneity and prognostic therapeutic outcomes have been proposed to associate with the specific developmental stage from which the transformed cells originate. Chromosomal rearrangements involving the mixed lineage leukemia- 1 (MLL 1) gene result in chimeric fusion proteins that can act as transcriptional regulators, and represents a family of recurrent initiating events in human leukemia. MLL 1 translocations can result in diseases with different phenotypic representation, but the underlying reason for why seemingly similar translocation products can cause myeloid, lymphoid or <b>mixed</b> <b>leukemia</b> remain unknown. Various hematopoietic progenitor cells {{can serve as a}} candidate cells for transformation and we addressed this issue of “leukemia initiating competence” in article I, where we developed a conditional (doxycycline inducible) transgenic mouse model of the human chimeric transcription factor Mixed Lineage Leukemia-Eleven Nineteen Leukemia (MLL-ENL). Prospective isolations of hematopoietic progenitor cells at distinct stages of differentiation, followed by their adoptive transfer under continuous fusion gene expression permitted us to monitor their leukemia-initiation and competence. In our work, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) could initiate from several different progenitor subsets. Our study highlighted the importance of using highly defined cell types, as developmentally close myeloid progenitor subpopulations showed dramatically different leukemic competence. HSCs however, were resistant to leukemic transformation and displayed reduced proliferative and repopulating capabilities. In addition, we failed to observe lymphoid leukemia development, which is consistent with most experimental mouse models trying to assess MLL-fusion mediated transformation. This seemingly discrepant finding when compared to human leukemias might be the result of underlying factors such as the instructive/permissive nature of MLL-fusions and/or the normal differentiation potential of the target cell. To this end, we in article II demonstrated that leukemia competence in the mouse was lost upon definitive lymphoid commitment, as only very early lymphoid progenitors (DN 1 T cells and BLPs) could develop leukemia; in those cases by evoking a latent myeloid potential of the target cells which ultimately resulted in AML. We further demonstrated that not only could co-occurring mutations impact on the latency of leukemia development, but also that the sequence by which the mutations are acquired can have significant influence on the lineage representation of the developing leukemia. As a final part of this work, we assessed the impact of transdifferentiation on leukemia initiation and found that C/EBPB-mediated transdifferentiation could result in acquisition of leukemia competence in otherwise leukemia incompetent lymphoid committed cells. As transdifferentiation recently has been proposed for therapeutic approaches, these results raise concerns regarding their general feasibility. Finally, in article III, we evaluated the impact of the ribosomal stress pathway on leukemia initiation, a mechanism that potentially could represent a general approach to target oncogenic cells. We demonstrated that genetic targeting of the 5 S RNP-MDM 2 -TRP 53 ribosomal stress pathway delays leukemia initiation significantly, but did not provide significant survival advantages in already established leukemia. Therefore, the ribosomal stress pathway holds limited therapeutic value for AML treatment...|$|E

All tumors found in leukemic animals were classified by gross pathology, morphology, and immunophenotype, as well as the incidence of known common virus integration sites (VISs) in MuLV-induced myeloid malignancies (i. e., Evi 1, Evi 11 /Cb 2, Evi 12, Fli 1, and c-Myb). Interestingly, male mice were more susceptible than females to the induction of leukemia by Cas-Br-M MuLV. Seventy-four of the Cas-Br-M MuLV-inoculated mice developed a severe splenomegaly, sometimes in association with a thymoma. Although most of the immunophenotyped Cas-Br-M MuLV tumors were of myeloid origin (58 %), numerous T-cell leukemias (21 %) and <b>mixed</b> myeloid/T-cell <b>leukemias</b> (21 %) were found.
