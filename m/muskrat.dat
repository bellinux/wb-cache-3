5|$|Mussie's {{name is a}} {{diminutive}} form {{of the name of}} its reported location: <b>Muskrat</b> Lake, a large, deep lake near the village of Cobden, Ontario, and about 75 miles northwest of Ottawa. <b>Muskrat</b> Lake is home to another paranormal phenomenon: local legends state that an Atomic Energy of Canada bus driver saw an extraterrestrial spacecraft landing on a spot atop a hill and leaving. There is indeed a dark-colored, circular outline on this hill where grass does not grow, with no widely accepted cause.|$|E
50|$|The term “Rats” {{refers to}} <b>muskrats,</b> whose {{population}} was once abundant in Mauricie. Some Canadian censuses of the 19th century included statistics regarding {{the number of}} captured <b>muskrats</b> in each family. The Abenaki designated the river “Moskwastekw” (River <b>muskrats).</b> Finally, the French version of the designation prevailed in popular usage.|$|R
50|$|Burrowing animals, such as <b>muskrats,</b> {{would cause}} leaks by digging holes. Indiana canals had leaks from {{burrowing}} crawfish. Canal companies would often post bounties for <b>muskrats,</b> e.g. the Middlesex Canal.|$|R
40|$|<b>Muskrats</b> (Ondatra zibethicus) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) {{were exposed}} {{experimentally}} by various routes to a chlamydial agent (designated strain M 56) originally isolated during a die-off of <b>muskrats</b> and snowshoe hares which occurred in Saskatchewan during 1961. Both species were susceptible to experimental infection. Whereas M 56 was highly lethal for snowshoe hares (18 deaths/ 19 exposed), {{it was less}} virulent for <b>muskrats</b> (6 deaths/ 20 exposed) ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>muskrat</b> (Ondatra zibethicus), {{the only}} species in genus Ondatra and tribe Ondatrini, is a {{medium-sized}} semiaquatic rodent native to North America {{and is an}} introduced species in parts of Europe, Asia, and South America. The <b>muskrat</b> is found in wetlands {{over a wide range}} of climates and habitats. It has important effects on the ecology of wetlands, and is a resource of food and fur for humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a large, unusual creature in <b>Muskrat</b> Lake {{has been the subject}} of anecdotes since 1916. The creature's name was originally cited as Hapyxelor, alternately spelled Hapaxelor, but changed simply to Mussie, short for The Monster of <b>Muskrat</b> Lake, sometime later. Humphries, a man from Cobden, was a well-known proponent of Mussie's existence. Around the area, many people's knowledge of the creature come from his vehement, albeit inconsistent, tales of observing it once.|$|E
5|$|While much wetland habitat {{has been}} {{eliminated}} due to human activity, new <b>muskrat</b> habitat {{has been created}} by the construction of canals or irrigation channels, and the <b>muskrat</b> remains common and widespread. They are able to live alongside streams which contain the sulfurous water that drains away from coal mines. Fish and frogs perish in such streams, yet muskrats may thrive and occupy the wetlands. Muskrats also benefit from human persecution {{of some of their}} predators.|$|E
40|$|After {{acclimatization}} <b>muskrats</b> {{spread over}} almost all Lithuania and increased to about 40 000 {{individuals in the}} 1980 s. But since then the number of <b>muskrats</b> has decreased to about 2000 individuals. We used BINPAS (Bioinvasion Impact/Biopollution Assessment System) for terrestrial ecosystems, which is usually using for water ecosystems, {{to assess the impact}} of Ondatra zibethicus on native species and communities, on habitats, on ecosystems and the biopollution level (BPL). The impact of <b>muskrats</b> varied between different regions of Lithuania. Widespread and high numbers of <b>muskrats,</b> and strong biopollution of ecosystem functioning were identified in four regions of Lithuania – Nevėžis and Nemunas Rivers, Šalčia River, Varėnė river, Vištytis Regional Park...|$|R

5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the <b>Muskrat</b> Lake area search for Mussie in the lake; none have yet captured evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one suggests {{that it can be}} caught by a fishing rod.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are {{extremely}} harmful to fur-bearing rodents, such as coypu and muskrats. Coypu can be completely extirpated {{in shallow water}} bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faecal contents, and 71% of <b>muskrat</b> houses were destroyed by jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E
5|$|Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 {{terrestrial}} vertebrate {{species and}} 28 fish species. The most common large animals are mule deer and elk, but other mammals present include moose, black bears, cougar, coyote, yellow-bellied marmot, beaver, porcupine, Canadian lynx, mountain goat, pika, river otter, <b>muskrat,</b> pronghorn, mink, bobcat, marten, and timber wolves.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{agricultural}} production within the Grand Prairie region U. S. A. {{has resulted in}} drainage of most natural wetlands within the landscape. Semi-aquatic species {{that are associated with}} these habitats have shifted much of their distribution to riparian habitats that have unstable flow regimes and inundation times that could be related to position within watersheds. <b>Muskrats</b> (Ondatra zibethicus) are an economically important furbearer species in this region and occur in small streams and agricultural ditches throughout the Midwest. However, information regarding space use and survival of <b>muskrats</b> in these highly altered habitats is lacking. I examined predation risk, survival, home ranges, and space use of <b>muskrats</b> within small streams and agricultural ditches in a human-dominated agricultural landscape in east-central Illinois from 2007 - 2009. To evaluate predation risk of riparian <b>muskrats,</b> I monitored displacement times of radiomarked individuals during flooding events in relation to landscape position. I used known-fate models and an information-theoretic approach to examine effects of age, season, hydrology, and riparian width on weekly survival rates. As expected, <b>muskrats</b> positioned farther from headwaters were displaced longer, and exposed to predation fro...|$|R

5|$|In some European countries, such as Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, the <b>muskrat</b> is {{considered}} an invasive pest, as its burrowing damages the dikes and levees on which these low-lying countries depend for protection from flooding. In those countries, it is trapped, poisoned, and hunted to attempt to keep the population down. Muskrats also eat corn and other farm and garden crops growing near water bodies.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats have {{sometimes}} been a food resource for North Americans. In the southeastern portion of Michigan, a longstanding dispensation allows Catholics to consume <b>muskrat</b> as their Friday penance, on Ash Wednesday, and on Lenten Fridays (when the eating of meat, except for fish, is prohibited); this tradition {{dates back to}} at least the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park also {{provides}} habitats for eastern woodland mammals. Black bear and white-tailed deer inhabit the woods, as do Virginia opossum, raccoon, American mink, <b>muskrat,</b> North American river otter, fox, and bobcats. The endangered red wolf has been reintroduced to eastern North Carolina, including Pettigrew State Park.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 100 {{species of}} mammal {{are known to}} inhabit, or to have {{recently}} inhabited, the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters. This includes a few species that were introduced in the 20th century; the coypu was introduced for farming in the 1990s, and the <b>muskrat</b> {{was introduced in the}} early 20th century into the Russian Far East and was subsequently first recorded in Korea in the Tumen River basin in 1965. The Siberian tiger and Japanese sea lion have probably been extirpated from Korea, but are still included in standard lists of Korean mammals.|$|E
5|$|Author Michael Bradley {{and friend}} Deanna Theilmann-Beann searched for Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology. With their sonar, they found two creatures they {{hypothesized}} could be two marine mammals, three metres long. Bradley concluded {{that at least}} one creature compatible with Mussie's description lived in the lake, though he did not investigate the creatures further. Scientists have also surveyed the area and found nothing, though the definitive nonexistence of a Mussie-like creature is difficult to establish because some of the trenches in <b>Muskrat</b> Lake extend to over 60 metres.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{developed}} at the shores of Lake Cahuilla. These include Anodonta californiensis and possibly Pisidium casertanum. Anodonta shells are sometimes found within their own tunnels. They were probably used by inhabitants as a food source or to make shell beads. Gastropods identified include Amnicola longinqua, Gyraulus parvus, Helisoma trivolvis, Physella ampullacea, Physella humerosa and Tryonia protea. These taxa were relatively abundant at {{the shores of the}} lake. Ostracods include Cypridopsis vidua, Cyprinotus torosa and Limnocythere ceriotuberosa. Sponges have been identified in fossil deposits as well. One mammal found in the lake was the <b>muskrat,</b> Ondatra zibethicus.|$|E

5|$|Minimum {{processing}} requirements {{also became}} {{an issue in the}} Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). Dunderdale announced {{in a speech to the}} St. John's Board of Trade in May 2013, that the loan guarantee for the <b>Muskrat</b> Falls project nearly fell apart because of MPRs. She said that the federal government tried to pressure her into eliminating MPRs at the eleventh hour of the loan guarantee negotiations to help secure the trade deal. Dunderdale said that while she was willing to look at minimum processing requirements, she was not willing to tie it to the loan guarantee.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are found}} {{over most of}} Canada and the United States and {{a small part of}} {{northern}} Mexico. They were introduced to Europe {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century and have become an invasive species in northwestern Europe. They mostly inhabit wetlands, areas in or near saline and freshwater wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds. They are not found in Florida, where the round-tailed <b>muskrat,</b> or Florida water rat (Neofiber alleni), fills their ecological niche.|$|E
5|$|Mussie, {{also known}} as Hapyxelor or Hapaxelor, is a cryptid, an animal whose {{existence}} {{is the subject of}} folklore but has not been proven, that is rumored to live in <b>Muskrat</b> Lake in the Canadian province of Ontario. The creature's age, gender, and physical appearance are not agreed upon; it is variously described, for example, as a walrus or as a three-eyed Loch Ness Monster-like creature. It is also not agreed upon whether Mussie is a single creature or a species.|$|E
