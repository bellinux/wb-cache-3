5|$|From {{the point}} of view that the goal of <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> to {{classify}} and characterize, the representation theory of the Lorentz group is since 1947 a finished chapter. But in association with the Bargmann–Wigner programme, there are (as of 2006) yet unresolved purely mathematical problems, linked to the infinite-dimensional unitary representations.|$|E
5|$|In September 2004, {{the school}} was {{designated}} a music and mathematics specialist school, which means it receives additional funding for those subjects. In 2007, {{the school was}} invited to become a High Performing Specialist School, and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status. As <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to be included under the first specialism. The Judd School is now a music with English and science with mathematics specialist school.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the main}} objects {{of study in}} {{discrete}} <b>mathematics</b> <b>are</b> discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous <b>mathematics</b> <b>are</b> often employed as well.|$|R
25|$|The 20th century saw {{mathematics}} {{become a}} major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in <b>mathematics</b> <b>were</b> awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{first year}} lecturers' perceptions of mathematics topics and skills {{needed in the}} respective courses that they teach and their perceptions of students' preparedness for these topics. Surveys and interviews with lecturers were conducted at a regional university in Australia and showed many lecturers regarded that little <b>mathematics</b> <b>was</b> needed in their courses and that <b>mathematics</b> <b>was</b> compartmentalised into specific courses. However, when <b>mathematics</b> <b>was</b> evidenced, lecturers often perceived their students having poor skills and some have adjusted their courses accordingly. ...|$|R
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what <b>mathematics</b> <b>is,</b> and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{practical}} applications have motivated {{the development of}} mathematical theories, which then {{became the subject of}} study in pure mathematics, where <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> vitally connected with research in pure mathematics.|$|E
25|$|Logicism {{is one of}} {{the schools}} of thought in the {{philosophy}} of mathematics, putting forth the theory that <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> an extension of logic and therefore some or all <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> reducible to logic. Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead championed this theory fathered by Gottlob Frege.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mathematics</b> has <b>been</b> {{taught at}} the University since its establishment. The first Professor of <b>Mathematics</b> <b>was</b> Morris Pell, one of the University's three {{foundation}} professors. Pell gave the first lecture in mathematics on 13 October 1852, {{two days after the}} University's inauguration, to all 24 students at the time. At least two years of <b>mathematics</b> <b>were</b> still required of all the University's students at the time of Pell's retirement in 1877.|$|R
25|$|Applied <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> {{closely related}} to other {{mathematical}} sciences.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{aesthetics}} concerning <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> mathematicians' views towards the possible uses of mathematics for purposes deemed unethical or inappropriate. The best-known exposition {{of this view}} occurs in G.H. Hardy's book A Mathematician's Apology, in which Hardy argues that pure <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> superior in beauty to applied mathematics precisely because it cannot be used for war and similar ends.|$|E
25|$|Lakatos' {{philosophy}} of <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> sometimes {{regarded as a}} kind of social constructivism, but this was not his intention.|$|E
25|$|Logicism is {{the thesis}} that <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> {{reducible}} to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic. Logicists hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that our knowledge of <b>mathematics</b> <b>is</b> just part of our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, logic is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary logical truths.|$|E

5|$|This is the begriffliche Mathematik (purely {{conceptual}} <b>mathematics)</b> that <b>was</b> {{characteristic of}} Noether. This style of <b>mathematics</b> <b>was</b> consequently adopted by other mathematicians, {{especially in the}} (then new) field of abstract algebra.|$|R
