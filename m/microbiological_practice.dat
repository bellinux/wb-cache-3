40|$|We sought here {{to review}} the present {{definition}} of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) by comparing the routine phenotypic methods with a genotypic procedure that considers different morphotypes. Our phenotypic characterization of CNS isolates included routine identification with biotype and antibiotype. The genotypic diagnosis was based on longer incubation periods with the consideration of all morphotypes and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis techniques. We prospectively selected 61 episodes of suspected CR-BSI by CNS occurring during 1 year, based {{on the presence of}} a compatible clinical setting and the isolation of one or more CNS from blood and catheter tip. Of these episodes, 47 (77 %) were identified as true episodes of CR-BSI based on the presence of microorganisms of the same genotype in the blood and on the catheter tip. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, negative predictive, accuracy, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio values obtained by different phenotypic microbiological approaches to establish the diagnosis of CR-BSI were as follows: identity at species level (78. 7 %, 85. 7 %, 94. 9 %, 54. 5 %, 80. 3 %, 5. 51, and 0. 25, respectively); identity of species and biotype (59. 6 %, 92. 9 %, 96. 6 %, 40. 6 %, 67. 2 %, 8. 34, and 0. 44, respectively); identity of species and antibiotype (61. 7 %, 92. 9 %, 96. 7 %, 41. 9 %, 68. 8 %, 8. 64, and 0. 41, respectively); and identity of species, biotype, and antibiotype (48. 9 %, 92. 9 %, 95. 8 %, 35. 1 %, 59 %, 6. 85, and 0. 55, respectively).

40|$|Anaerobic {{infections are}} common {{and can cause}} {{diseases}} associated with severe morbidity, but are easily overlooked in clinical settings. Both the {{relatively small number of}} infections due to exogenous anaerobes and the much larger number of infections involving anaerobic species that are originally members of the normal flora, may lead to a life-threatening situation unless appropriate treatment is instituted. Special laboratory procedures are needed for the isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of this diverse group of bacteria. Since many anaerobes grow more slowly than the facultative or aerobic bacteria, and particularly since clinical specimens yielding anaerobic bacteria commonly contain several organisms and often very complex mixtures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, considerable time may elapse before the laboratory is able to provide a final report. Species definition based on phenotypic features is often time-consuming and is not always easy to carry out. Molecular genetic methods may help in the everyday clinical <b>microbiological</b> <b>practice</b> in laboratories dealing with the diagnostics of anaerobic infections. Methods have been introduced for species diagnostics, such as 16 S rRNA PCR-RFLP profile determination, which can help to distinguish species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Actinomyces, etc. that are otherwise difficult to differentiate. The use of DNA-DNA hybridization and the sequencing of special regions of the 16 S rRNA have revealed fundamental taxonomic changes among anaerobic bacteria. Some anaerobic bacteria are extremely slow growing or not cultivatable at all. To detect them in special infections involving flora changes due to oral malignancy or periodontitis, for instance, a PCR-based hybridization technique is used. Molecular methods have demonstrated the spread of specific resistance genes among the most important anaerobic bacteria, the members of the Bacteroides genus. Their detection and investigation of the IS elements involved in their expression may facilitate following of the spread of antibiotic resistance among anaerobic bacteria involved in infections and in the normal flora members. Molecular methods (a search for toxin genes and ribotyping) may promote {{a better understanding of the}} pathogenic features of some anaerobic infections, such as the nosocomial diarrhoea caused by C. difficile and its spread in the hospital environment and the community. The investigation of toxin production at a molecular level helps in the detection of new toxin types.

40|$|Industrial Biotechnology and Applied Microbiology is an {{optional}} 128 h-course for Chemistry and Biology {{students at the}} Faculty of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. This course is usually attended by 25 students, working in teams of two. The curriculum, with 8 lab exercises, includes an oil bioremediation practice covering an insight of bioremediation processes: the influence of pollutants on autochthonous microbiota, biodegrader isolation and biosurfactant production for bioavailability understanding. The experimental steps are: (A) evaluation of microbial tolerance to pollutants by constructing pristine soil microcosms contaminated with diesel or xylene and (B) isolation of degraders and biosurfactant production analysis. To check microbial tolerance, microcosms are incubated during one week at 25 - 28 ºC. Samples are collected at 0, 4 and every 48 h for CFU/g soil testing. An initial decrease of total CFU/g related to toxicity is noticed. At {{the end of the}} experiment, a recovery of the CFU number is observed, evidencing enrichment in biodegraders. Some colonies from the CFU counting plates are streaked in M 9 -agar with diesel as sole carbon source.

40|$|Bacterial whole genome {{sequencing}} holds promise as a disruptive technology in clinical microbiology, {{but it has}} not yet been applied systematically or comprehensively within a clinical context. Here, over the course of one year, we performed prospective collection and whole {{genome sequencing}} of nearly all bacterial isolates obtained from a tertiary care hospital's intensive care units (ICUs). This unbiased collection of 1, 229 bacterial genomes from 391 patients enables detailed exploration of several features of clinical pathogens. A sizable fraction of isolates identified as clinically relevant corresponded to previously undescribed species: 12 % of isolates assigned a species-level classification by conventional methods actually qualified as distinct, novel genomospecies on the basis of genomic similarity. Pan-genome analysis of the most frequently encountered pathogens in the collection revealed substantial variation in pan-genome size (1, 420 to 20, 432 genes) and the rate of gene discovery (1 to 152 genes per isolate sequenced). Surprisingly, although potential nosocomial transmission of actively surveilled pathogens was rare, 8. 7 % of isolates belonged to genomically related clonal lineages that were present among multiple patients, usually with overlapping hospital admissions, and were associated with clinically significant infection in 62 % of patients from which they were recovered. Multi-patient clonal lineages were particularly evident in the neonatal care unit, where seven separate Staphylococcus epidermidis clonal lineages were identified, including one lineage associated with bacteremia in 5 / 9 neonates.

Objective: Determination of the antibody titre levels of HCV provides information of dental health professionals with adequate protection against the HCV antigen. Background: Dental health care workers have an occupational risk hazard of acquiring blood-borne viral pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). The risk is maximised due to constant contact of blood from performing dental procedures on patients who may in turn be carrying the virus via needle-stick injuries and open wounds. HCV can be prevented by strict adherence to standard <b>microbiological</b> <b>practices</b> and techniques and the routine use of appropriate barrier precautions to prevent skin and mucous membrane exposure when handling blood and other body fluids of all patients in health care settings. Materials and Method: The cohort study included 85 dental professionals (M= 42, F= 43) who were currently pursuing or had pursued their under graduation and/or post graduation in dentistry. Subjects were informed about the study and a written consent form was obtained. 2 ml of blood was collected intravenously and transferred to a vaccutainer tube.

Inflammatory markers are recognized to play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of sepsis. This is partly due to low specificity of clinical symptoms and conventional inflammatory signs for the diagnosis of sepsis but also to a lack of correlation with the severity of the inflammatory response. Elevated serum PCT levels indicate systemic inflammation reliably.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis is about the politics and the possibilities of aetiology. Firstly, the possibilities. Does an infectious disease have one, single pathogenic cause or many, interacting causes? In the medical microbiological sciences, there is no definitive answer, one way or another, to this question: there, the conditions of aetiological possibility exist in a curious tension. Ever since {{the birth of the}} 'germ theory of disease' and the concomitant birth of the singular aetiological object, these conditions have allowed for the co-existence of a very different, and far less well understood kind of object: the multifactorial object. That SARS was caused by one, singular viral agent, a coronavirus (CoV), is now entrenched as microbiological fact. And yet, the curious thing about SARS is that the history of the 2003 outbreak is littered with moments at which the possibility of the multifactorial object presented itself to, and was actively considered by, medical microbiologists. So how did we get here - to SARS-CoV, an infectious disease that could be understood and storied in this, the most singular of ways? And what happened along the way to deny the multifactorial aetiological object any kind of existence at all? In an attempt to grapple with these questions, the thesis seeks to recover the possibility of the multifactorial object through a deep, ethnomethodological reading of the moments at which it flared up precise/y as a possibility for medical microbiologists investigating the outbreak. What emerges from that recovery operation is a sense that the multifactorial object was never actually ruled out or disproved in any way, but rather, was vanished. Put another way, the suggestion is that various medical <b>microbiological</b> <b>practices</b> and interventions, whilst establishing singularity, were serving, at the same time, to create an illusion of multifactorality's non-existence; an illusion behind which the issue of multifactorality, its possibility, could be discarded without ever having to be resolved, one way or the other. In the closing sections of this thesis a move is made towards suggesting that SARS-Co V, the singular disease, was the product of a choice-, a choice that was made to explore one aetiological possibility at the expense of another. And that is where the politics comes in. For if politics, the realm of the political, can be taken to arise in situations where various possibilities exist but not all possibilities can be chosen, then it follows that what this thesis provides is an opportunity to foreground the politics bound up with the practical doing of aetiology. As a result, and based on the experience of attempting to recover the vanished multifactorial object from the 2003 SARS outbreak, the thesis concludes with an attempt to inhabit the present {{in such a way as}} to make it possible to think, in a little more detail, about where aetiology, as understood by medical microbiologists, might be heading in the future: might recent shifts in practical, everyday, seemingly innocuous microbiological technique, have begun to make it easier to coax the multifactorial object out into a space of visibility? Might those shifts actually herald the crossing of an epistemological threshold in the medical sciences? And might the conditions of aetiological possibility be changing, and changing in ways that would drastically alter what it meant to speak of a 'disease', an 'infection' and a 'pathogen'...|$|R
40|$|Laboratorians {{working with}} {{infectious}} agents {{are subject to}} laboratoryacquired infections through accidents or unrecognized incidents. The degree of hazard depends upon the virulence of the biological agent concerned and host resistance. Laboratory-acquired infections occur when microorganisms are inadvertently ingested, inhaled, or introduced into the tissues. The primary laboratory hazard associated with enteric pathogens such as Shigella and E. coli O 157 :H 7 is accidental ingestion. Biosafety Level 2 (BSL- 2) practices are suitable for work involving these agents, which are a moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. BSL- 2 requirements: • Laboratory personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic agents and are directed by competent scientists; • Access to the laboratory is limited when work is being conducted; • Extreme precautions are taken with contaminated sharp items; • Certain procedures in which infectious aerosols or splashes may be created are conducted using protective clothing and equipment. A. Standard <b>Microbiological</b> Safety <b>Practices</b> The safety guidelines listed below apply to all microbiology laboratories regardless of biosafety level. Limiting access to laboratory Biohazard signs or stickers should be posted near all laboratory doors and on all equipment (incubators, hoods, refrigerators, freezers) used for laboratory work.

40|$|Abstract: The aim was {{to compare}} the {{detection}} frequency of periodontopathogens by using the Pado Test 4. 5 and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique in chronic periodontitis patients. Thirty patients with chronic periodontitis were tested cross-sectionally with DNA/RNA oligogenomic probe method (IAI Pado Test 4. 5) and DNA/DNA whole genomic probe (checkerboard) method. Samples were taken by two paper points at the deepest site {{in each of the}} four quadrants and pooled into one sample for each of the two methods. The samples were sent to the two laboratories (IAI, Zuchwil, Switzerland, and Oral Microbiology Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Sweden) and were analyzed in a routine setting for the presence and amount of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola. While Pado Test 4. 5 detected the four periodontal pathogens in 11 (36. 7 %) of the patients, the checkerboard method showed presence in all patients (100 %) using the lower score (Score 1 corresponding to 10 4 bacterial cells) and 16 (53. 3 %) using a higher treshold (score 3 corresponding to between> 10 5 and 10 6 cells). The results of the present study showed low agreement for a positive microbiological outcome using the two diagnostic methods. It was also concluded that <b>microbiological</b> analysis in <b>practice</b> should include a larger number of bacterial species to better serve as markers for a diseased associated flora in chronic periodontitis cases...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Storing sugar {{extracts}} {{as thick}} juice, {{a form of}} sucrose syrup, is common practice in the sugar industry. Even under good storage <b>practices,</b> <b>microbiological</b> problems can sometimes occur. Improving control of these microflora-related problems requires greater understanding of microbial dynamics of thick juice storage. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to identify the microflora associated with thick juice degradation in order to define better process controls. Materials and Methods: Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis (CLA) (both targeting 16 S-rDNA) as well as classical culture-based methods were used to characterize bacterial communities present in non-degraded and heavily degraded thick juice samples. Based on results obtained by these approaches, specific PCR primers were designed for routine detection of the most predominant species. Results and Discussion: Both CLA and T-RFLP revealed that Tetragenococcus halophilus was the most consistent and predominant taxon present in both degraded and non-degraded samples that were examined. Classical plating on rich medium confirmed the presence of this halophilic Tetragenococcus species. Other microorganisms were also detected in both types of samples, but none were present as consistently or nearly as abundantly as T. halophilus. These results report the first association of T. halophilus with a sugar-rich environment. Based on its high density, we believe that this organism potentially plays a role in thick juice degradation. Therefore, PCR primers were designed and verified to specifically detect this species in thick juice matrices to further elucidate its presence and putative role in thick juice degradation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Storing sugar {{extracts}} {{as thick}} juice, {{a form of}} sucrose syrup, is common practice in the sugar industry. Even under good storage <b>practices,</b> <b>microbiological</b> problems may occur. Improving control of these microflora-related problems requires {{greater understanding of the}} microbial dynamics of thick juice storage. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} map the population dynamics during storage and identify the microflora associated with thick juice degradation in order to define better process controls. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis (CLA) (both targeting 16 S-rDNA) as well as classical culture-based methods were used to characterize bacterial communities present in non-degraded and heavily degraded thick juice samples. Based on the results obtained by these approaches, a nylon membrane-based DNA array targeting 16 S rDNA sequences was developed for all bacterial species detected. For signal amplification, the target DNA was amplified using universal primers that anneal to conserved sequences flanking diagnostic domains, simultaneously labeled, and subsequently hybridized to the array. Detection was performed using the anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate and CDP-Star substrate. Both CLA and T-RFLP demonstrated that Tetragenococcus halophilus was the most consistent and predominant taxon present in both degraded and non-degraded samples that were examined. Classical plating on rich medium confirmed the dominance of this halophilic Tetragenococcus species, but revealed also other osmophilic bacteria possibly pernicious during sugar production including Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Kocuria spp., Aerococcus viridans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and other Tetragenococcus species. In order to monitor the bacterial population dynamics during thick juice storage, a specific thick juice macro-array was developed covering these bacteria. Using the array, a diverse microbial population was found at the beginning of storage, which evolved to dominance of Tetragenococcus species mostly accompanied by Staphylococci. Based on its high density, we believe that Tetragenococcus halophilus potentially plays a role in thick juice degradation.

40|$|Abstract Background HIV {{and other}} blood borne infections can be {{transmitted}} {{through the use of}} improperly sterilized and disinfected sharp equipments. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted from January to June, 2010 to assess the potential risk of HIV transmission in barbering practice in Ethiopia from public health and microbiological perspectives. Barbers in barbershop were interviewed using pre-designed questionnaires and check lists were used to evaluate barbering <b>practice.</b> <b>Microbiological</b> data from tips of the sharpener before and after the barbering was collected and processed as per the standard procedure. Results One hundred and twenty three barbering sessions and barbers were observed in which 106 (86. 2 %) were males. Ninety six (78 %) of the respondents knew that HIV could be transmitted by sharing non-sterile sharp instruments. Among the total participants 59 (48 %) had the correct knowledge of what sterilization mean and 111 (94. 1 %) of them believed its importance in their work place. Barbers had a mean knowledge score of 6 [*]±[*] 1. 5 out of a score of 10 regarding sterilization and disinfection {{as well as in the}} transmission of HIV in their work place. Three (2. 5 %) barbers were disagreed that unsterilized blade can transmit skin diseases and 26 (21. 3 %) of them believed disinfection is enough to avoid microbes from sharp objects. Ninety two (76. 7 %) barbers were using sterilization in their establishment. According to Likert scaling almost all sterilization and disinfection procedures were riskily practiced and respondents had poor level of knowledge. No significant association was found to influence the decontamination and sterilization of barbering equipments except monthly income, pre and post colony count of microbes identified. The isolation of normal skin flora in the pre-and post- sterilization and disinfectant procedures and less average percent colony reduction showed that sterilization and disinfectant practices in barbershop were generally poor that proofed proper sterilization and/or disinfection techniques were unfavorable. Conclusion This study has revealed the presence of potential risk of HIV and other blood borne disease transmission among the barbers of the study areas. Thus continuous and intensified public health strategies on health education, training, supervision and monitoring are needed to facilitate the adoption of effective methods of sterilization and/or disinfection. </p...|$|R
