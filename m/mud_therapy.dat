OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of mud-bath therapy (MBT) in addition to usual treatment compared to usual treatment alone in patients with bilateral knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: An economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a 2 weeks cycle of MBT in addition to their usual treatment or to continue routine care alone. The European Quality-of-Life Questionnaire- 5 Dimensions (EQ- 5 D) questionnaire was administered at baseline, 2 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Direct healthcare resource consumption data up until 12 months were derived from a daily diary given to patients and returned at prescheduled follow-up visits. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients were included (MBT = 53, control = 50). Overall, patients in the MBT group accrued on average 0. 835 (± 0. 10 standard deviation, SD) quality adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to 0. 753 (± 0. 11 SD) in the control group (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Average direct costs per patient (€ 303 vs € 975, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) were higher in the control group, primarily because of hospitalization for total knee replacement and use of intra-articular hyaluronic acid. Bootstrapping replications of costs and QALYs sample distributions consistently indicated that the MBT therapy combined with standard therapy represents a dominant strategy vis-à-vis standard therapy alone. The probability of MBT being cost-effective at standard cost-effectiveness thresholds (e. g. 20, 000 €/QALY) is 100 %. CONCLUSION: The results of this cost-effectiveness analysis support the use of the <b>mud</b> bath <b>therapy</b> as mid-term complementary therapy in the management of knee OA.

Whether nonpharmacological thermal therapies promote the endurance of loaded inspiratory muscles in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear. The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of two thermal interventions on endurance time (ET) and plasma IL- 6 concentration following an IRB challenge. Methods: This study was a randomized, parallel-group, unblinded clinical trial in a single-center setting. Forty-two patients (aged 42 – 76  years) suffering from mild to severe COPD participated in this study. Both groups completed 12 sessions of the <b>mud</b> bath <b>therapy</b> (MBT) (n= 22) or leisure thermal activity (LTA) (n= 19) in a thermal spa center in Italy. Pre- and postintervention spirometry, maximum inspiratory pressure, and plasma mediators were obtained and ET and endurance oxygen expenditure (VO 2 Endur) were measured following IRB challenge at 40 % of maximum inspiratory pressure. Results: There was no difference in ΔIL- 6 between the intervention groups. But, IRB challenge increased cytokine IL- 6 plasma levels systematically. The effect size was small. A statistically significant treatment by IRB challenge effect existed in ET, which significantly increased in the MBT group (P= 0. 003). In analysis of covariance treatment by IRB challenge analysis with LnVO 2 Endur as the dependent variable, ΔIL- 6 after intervention predicted LnVO 2 Endur in the MBT group, but not in the LTA group. Adverse events occurred in two individuals in the MBT group, but they were mainly transient. One patient in the LTA group dropped out. Conclusion: MBT model improves ET upon a moderate IRB challenge, indicating the occurrence of a training effect. The LnVO 2 Endur/ΔIL- 6 suggests a physiologic adaptive mechanism in respiratory muscles of COPD patients allocated to treatment. Both thermal interventions are safe.

The therapeutic effects of mineral waters are determined by their anion and cation content, the presence of undissociated salts and also by the presence of oligoelements. Additionally, the effects of a mineral waters are connected with physical constants: osmotic pressure and temperature. Many researches showed activity of the mineral waters on intestinal autonomic nerves and plexus (CIA), motility, exocrine, endocrine and paracrine digestive secretions and therapeutic properties belonging to evidence based medicine. <b>Mud</b> and bath <b>therapy</b> are effective in treatment of osteoartrhitis. During and after mud-therapy effects on diencephalic-pituitary-adrenal axis were displayed, producing increase of endogenous opioids and cortisol.

Balneotherapy of lumbar syndrome includes: individual baths, swimming in the pool, hydrokinesitherapy, underwater massage, underwater extension, <b>mud</b> <b>therapy,</b> mud baths. The therapy should be closely monitored for optimal efficacy and {{it is necessary to}} examine: functional status of the lumbosacral region, general functional status (level of activity), lower extremities, pain measurement, use of non-steroid anti-rheumatic and analgesic agents. In order to follow-up the effects of therapy and establish the prognosis it is important to perform: detailed anamnesis, anthropometrics measurements, socio-epidemiological research, clinical examinations.

40|$|One {{could argue}} that {{balneotherapy}} and <b>mud</b> <b>therapy</b> would have not lasted 2, 000 years or so If they were not effective. No doubt a long history cannot be taken per se as scientific proof of efficacy. Some empiricism is still present in the field: the concept of spa itself is quite confounding, whereas spring waters are used for leisure purposes but also for non-acute patient therapy and late phases of clinical recovery. These confounding elements ultimately feed the opinion of those who aprioristically reject any potential beneficial effect of balneotherapy: instead, it should at least generate questions that deserve scientific answers. Clinical practices sequentially integrating pharmacological therapy with those natural principles for which a sufficient scientific demonstration is available, would probably cut the costs of public health, generating widespread advantages for the community. Recently, it has become evident that mineral waters may have intrinsic pharmacological properties. Of the numerous salts dissolved in thermal waters that might show pharmacological properties, for certain hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) contained in sulfurous waters {{is the one that}} has obtained greater scientific attention, to which should be added the extensive scientific effort recently dedicated to H 2 S as a cellular gasotransmitter, independently from its natural sources.

The mean age of the subjects was 61. 7 years (62. 0 years for women and 61. 1 years for men). Based on the 5 SD heightweight classification, devised by the Centre for Physical Anthropology at the University of Tartu, the subjects were divided into five classes (1 – small height and weight; 2 – medium height and weight; 3 – big weight and height; 4 – big weight, small height; 5 – small weight, big height). The results showed that knee OA was more prevalent in women than men. 39. 8 % of the subjects were obese. Leptomorphic females and males prevailed among the subjects (28. 5 % and 26. 8 %, accordingly). Therefore, the height is also one factor which is associated with knee OA. Females had more problems with their knees than males. The group of small females had more problems with both knees, but pycnomorphic females complained more about knee pain in the last month before the study. Therefore, they used more analgesics.

40|$|Background: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection {{is one of}} the most debilitating conditions which have affected nearly 32 million people across the globe. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the standard care given to the HIV positive individuals. But the patient adherence to ART is found to be very less as per previous studies. Complementary and alternative medicine is becoming a pillar in the rehabilitative efforts for many living with HIV/AIDS. Aim: To evaluate the effect of naturopathy and yoga intervention on CD 4 counts of HIV patients. Methods: Ninety-six patients prediagnosed as HIV positive were enrolled after obtaining written consent and treated with naturopathy and yoga interventions like hydrotherapy, diet therapy, <b>mud</b> <b>therapy,</b> counseling, etc., for various durations at National Institute of Naturopathy Sanatorium. They were grouped into four groups (G 1 : 1 - 7 days, G 2 : 8 - 15 days, G 3 : 16 - 30 days, G 4 : > 30 days) based on duration of stay. CD 4 count of each individual was recorded pre- and post-stay. Results: All analyses were conducted using R package version 3. 01. Dependent sample t-tests were conducted to examine the significance at 95 % confidence interval. Of the 96 patients, male patients constitute 55. 2 % and female patients 44. 8 % with mean age 34. 74 received 1 - 180 days (mean 28. 75, standard deviation: 14. 16) treatment. Significant increase in the CD 4 count was observed in two out of the four groups (G 2 : P = 0. 052, and G 4 : P = 0. 00038, respectively). Conclusion: An increasing trend in the CD 4 count was observed that was proportional to the length of the stay of participants at the HIV sanatorium. This indicates the possibility of lifestyle changes can bring positive outcomes in people living with HIV/AIDS when used as an adjuvant with ART care. The lack of control group is a major limitation of this study. No attempt was made to study the subjective changes in the quality of life, viral load, etc., However, larger controlled studies are warranted for conclusive results...|$|E
40|$|Clays are {{frequently}} used in complementary and alternative medicine, including balneotherapy. Therapeutic muds {{are used for}} topical administration of mineral medicinal waters {{in the treatment of}} illnesses of the locomotor apparatus, including osteoarthritis and rheumatologic diseases. Clays are used in muds as vehicles of the mineral medicinal water, to obtain inorganic gels with rheological and thermal properties suitable to be topically applied. Despite their demonstrated longevity, the use of clays in therapeutic muds greatly requires comprehension of the attributes that sustain their use. Whit these premises, clay samples currently used in several spa centers of southern European/Mediterranean countries were studied to asses their identity, purity, richness and safety. Two of the studied samples were selected for posterior studies because of their superior quality. Preparation procedures of therapeutic muds have been orally transmitted since ancient times, being accepted that muds require a ???maturation??? process to achieve the desired therapeutic results. As a first step in the comprehension of this procedure, the influence of ???maturation??? on the structure and properties of concentrated suspensions prepared with pharmaceutical grade clays (selected as model materials because of their known quality attributes) was studied. Rheological properties of the studied systems were related to aggregation states and networking mechanisms. These behaviour patterns found during maturation were used in subsequent steps of the thesis. In particular, the two selected clays from spa centers were used to prepare thermal muds with mineral medicinal water from thermal spring of Graena (Cortes y Graena, Granada, Spain). Muds were matured for three months and characterized over time for those properties considered relevant in view of their topical administration and possible mechanisms of action. It is accepted that heat plays a fundamental role in the beneficial effects of thermal <b>mud</b> <b>therapy</b> together with the possible transfer across the skin barrier of chemical elements presented in muds.

The objective of the study: to evaluate the results of treatment in patients with CSA in a Slaviansk balneological health resort. Materials and methods. The research included 117 patients, who were treated at the rheumatological clinic, and then underwent rehabilitation in health resort, which has continental sulfide lake muds and brines with highly minerali­zed chloride-sodium composition. Among the patients under the study, there were 61 % of males and 39 % of females with an average age of 35 years. Both genders did not differ in the duration of illness (median of 7 years) and the degree of activity of the pathological process. Seropositivity for rheumatoid factor is detected in 2 % of patients, and by the presence of antibodies to cyclic citrulline peptide — in 70 %. During the resort stage, in 91 % of cases of СSA, Chlamydia trachomatis was found in prostatic secretions, scrapings from the urethra, cervix, vaginal walls, 83 % reported positive serological tests for chlamydial infection. Results. Analysis of the results showed that in 3 % of cases the effect was absent, in 14 % there was a slight improvement, in 50 % — an improvement and in 33 % — a significant improvement. The effectiveness of sanatorium stage of rehabilitation for women was higher, and due to increasing degree of disease activity, the positive results were getting worse. A significant adverse effect on the efficiency of sanatorium and health resort treatment activity has the presence of sacroiliitis and cardiac pathology in patients. Differences in the effectiveness of rehabilitation of patients depends on the types of the autonomic (vegetative) neural system (“vegetative passport”), in particular, in comparing eutonics and sympathotonics, sympathotonics and vagotonics. Prior drug treatment did not affect the results of the health resort rehabilitation of patients, a correlation between the effectiveness of treatment of patients in the hospital and nursing home was not revealed. The results of rehabilitation {{of patients with}} CSA were affected by the use of the sulfosalicylate in sanatorium. There was noted the influence of drugs on the effect of baths and laser beams, but a correlation with the concurrent use of drugs for peloids effects or electric and magnetic fields was not found. Mud baths caused an increased efficiency due to electroprocedures and peloids, besides, were further intensifying magnetic field’s effect. Health resort mud treatment exceeded the efficiency of balneoprocedures. Thus, in 7 % of patients treated with the bath, there was no effect, 25 % has a slight improvement, 32 % — an improvement and 36 % — a significant improvement. In turn, peloidotherapy gave positive results in all cases, and in 8 % a slight improvement was established, in 55 % — an improvement and in 37 % — a significant improvement. Meanwhile, in patients, who received baths, there was a higher degree of the pathological process activity. We emphasize that in terms of such indicators, as joint index, the severity of tendovaginitis, enthesopathies, spondylopathies, sacroiliitis, urogenital, eye, skin and heart lesions, patients, who received peloids and bath treatment, are not much different among themselves. Any specific contraindications for CSA patients’ staying in balneological health resort have not been established. Conclusions. In CSA, the positive results of rehabilitation of patients is higher for women, and the effectiveness of sanatorium and health resort treatment depends on the presence of sacroiliitis and cardiomyopathy and is reduced in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and its systolic dysfunction, but can be enhanced by the concomitant administration of sulfasalazine. There is the connection between the effect of rehabilitation and the use of natural and preformed physical factors, which are potentiating their interaction, and besides, electroprocedures are advisable to use in parallel peloids or baths, but in case of magnetic field — only with <b>mud</b> <b>therapy...</b>|$|E
