The main treatments were row widths (0. 76 m and 0. 38 m) whilst the sub-treatments were intra-row spacings (0. 12 m, 0. 18 m and 0. 24 m), giving {{a total of six}} plant population densities (54, 824, 73, 099, 109, 649, 146, 198 and 219, 298 plants/ha) with four replicates each. The crops were harvested at 30 - 35 % DM and ensiled in PVC type silo for 100 days. Grain, DM and stover yield per unit area increased significantly with increasing plant population due to increasing radiation interception.

To calibrate the model a combination of the genetic coefficients that characterize the phenology and morphology of the dry bean crop was used to obtain the best possible fit between predicted and observed anthesis and physiological maturity dates, leaf area index (LAI), total dry matter (TDM), yield components, and grain yield for the 0. 6 <b>m</b> <b>row</b> spacing.
