50|$|Magnetic viscosity: When an {{external}} field H is changed, and then kept {{at a new}} value, the induction B first changes almost at once, then some smaller change of B follows in a time; for a permanent magnet typically the time dependence is B(t) = B(t0) − S·ln(t/t0), where t is time since H change, t0 is some reference time, and S is a constant of the process (but not of the material, as it varies with magnitude of the H and its change); a theory describing this kind of time dependency was developed by Louis Néel (J. de Phys. et Radium, 11, 49 (1950)) and by Street and Wooley (A Study of <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Viscosity,</b> Proc.

For incompressible turbulence (Kolmogorov turbulence), {{we find that}} the growth rate is proportional to the square root of the hydrodynamic Reynolds number, Re 1 / 2.

40|$|Summary. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>viscosity</b> of 334 Upper Tertiary and pre-Bruhnes Quaternary {{volcanic}} rocks {{from the}} Massif Central (France) and the Steens Mountain (Oregon), and of 40 basaltic cores from DSDP leg 37 has been investigated. Thellier’s viscosity index follows a {{log normal distribution}} with mean values equal to 6 and 3. 5 per cent for subaerial and submarine rocks respectively. For subaerial rocks, the average intensity of the viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) acquired in the Earth’s field since the be-ginning of the Bruhnes polarity epoch (t = 0. 7 Myr) {{is estimated to be}} equal to one-quarter of the average intensity of the primary remanence. Alternating field demagnetization of VRMs acquired in low fields for acquisition times t ranging from 2 day to 32 month indicates the resistance to alternating fields is quite different from sample to sample and increases linearly with log t. NBel’s diagnostic parameter of domain structure of the grains involved in <b>magnetic</b> <b>viscosity</b> shows that hard VRM is carried by single-domain grains and soft VRM carried by multidomain particles. Single domain particles carrying hard VRM in subaerial volcanic rocks are almost equant magnetite intergrowths with size near the superparamagnetism threshold, resulting from high temperature oxidation of titanomagnetite. Soft VRM is carried by low Curie point homogeneous titanomagnetite. Unlike his single domain theory, Nkel’s multidomain theory of <b>magnetic</b> <b>viscosity</b> does not account quantita-tively for the resistance of VRM to alternating fields. ...|$|E

The resulting magnetic stresses, along with viscosity, drive the star toward uniform rotation. This magnetic braking has important dynamical consequences in many astrophysical contexts. For example, merging binary neutron stars can form "hypermassive" remnants supported against collapse by differential rotation. The removal of this support by magnetic braking induces radial fluid motion, {{which can lead}} to delayed collapse of the remnant to a black hole. We explore the effects of <b>magnetic</b> braking and <b>viscosity</b> on the structure of a differentially rotating, compressible star, generalizing our earlier calculations for incompressible configurations.
