40|$|Objectives: Test {{the effect}} of deviant peer {{modeling}} on theft as conditioned by verbal support for theft and number of deviant models. Methods: Two related randomized experiments in which participants were {{given a chance to}} steal a gift card (ostensibly worth $ 15) from {{the table in front of}} them. Each experiment had a control group, a verbal prompting group in which confederate(s) endorsed stealing, a behavioral <b>modeling</b> <b>group</b> in which confederate(s) committed theft, and a verbal prompting plus behavioral <b>modeling</b> <b>group</b> in which confederate(s) did both. The first experiment used one confederate; the second experiment used two. The pooled sample consisted of 335 undergraduate students. Results: Participants in the verbal prompting plus behavioral <b>modeling</b> <b>group</b> were most likely to steal followed by the behavioral <b>modeling</b> <b>group.</b> Interestingly, behavioral <b>modeling</b> was only influential when two confederates were present. There were no thefts in either the control or verbal prompting groups regardless of the number of confederates.

Methods: Two kinds of rat models of deficiency of kidney-yang were induced by adenine intragastric administration (model Ⅰ) and hydrocortisone intramuscular injection (model Ⅱ). One hundred rats were randomly divided into normal control <b>group,</b> <b>model</b> Ⅰ <b>group,</b> low-dose <b>model</b> Ⅱ <b>group,</b> medium-dose <b>model</b> Ⅱ <b>group</b> and high-dose <b>model</b> Ⅱ <b>group.</b> After <b>model</b> establishment, contents of serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urine creatinine (UCr) were detected by automatic biochemistry analyzer; freezing point method {{was used for}} 24 -hour urinary osmotic pressure (Uosm) testing and kaolinite method was used to detect the content of urinary 17 -hydroxycorticosteroid (17 -OHCS). Expression of aquaporin- 1 in renal tissue was observed by using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: The rats of <b>model</b> <b>groups</b> had the characteristics of kidney-yang deficiency syndrome. The contents of SCr and BUN were significantly higher in model Ⅰgroup than in normal control <b>group</b> and three <b>model</b> Ⅱ <b>groups</b> (P< 0. 05), and UCr and Uosm were significantly lower (P< 0. 05). The level of urinary 17 -OHCS and expression of aquaporin- 1 in renal tissue were decreased in the <b>model</b> Ⅰ <b>group</b> (P< 0. 05) {{as compared with the}} normal control group. Compared with the normal control group, the content of SCr was increased and urinary 17 -OHCS was decreased in the medium-dose <b>model</b> Ⅱ <b>group,</b> but the expression of aquaporin- 1 was increased in three <b>model</b> Ⅱ <b>groups</b> with a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|AIM: To {{establish}} a rat ethanol gastritis model, we evaluated {{the effects of}} ethanol on gastric mucosa and studied the preventive effects of geranylgeranylacetone on ethanol-induced chronic gastritis. METHODS: One hundred male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups: normal control group, undergoing gastric perfusion of normal saline (NS) by gastrogavage; <b>model</b> control <b>group</b> and 2 <b>model</b> therapy <b>groups</b> that underwent gastric perfusion with ethanol (distillate spirits with 56 % ethanol content) by gastrogavage for 4 wk. Low or high doses of geranylgeranylacetone were added 1 h before ethanol perfusion in the 2 <b>model</b> therapy <b>groups,</b> while {{the same amount of}} NS, instead of geranylgeranylacetone was used in that <b>model</b> control <b>group.</b> The rats were then sacrificed and stomachs were removed. The injury level of the gastric mucosa was observed by light and electron microscopy, and the levels of prostaglandin 2 (PGE 2), endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured by radioimmunoassay and the Griess method. RESULTS: The gastric mucosal epidermal damage score (EDS; 4. 5) and ulcer index (UI; 12. 0) of the <b>model</b> control <b>group</b> were significantly higher than that of the normal control group (0 and 0 respectively, all P = 0. 000). The gastric mucosal EDS and UI of the 2 <b>model</b> therapy <b>groups</b> (EDS: 2. 5 and 2. 0; UI: 3. 5 and 3. 0) were significantly lower than that of the <b>model</b> control <b>group</b> (all P < 0. 01). There was no statistically significant difference between the low-dose and high-dose <b>model</b> therapy <b>groups.</b> The expression value of plasma ET- 1 of the <b>model</b> control <b>group</b> was higher than that of the normal control group (P < 0. 01) and the 2 <b>model</b> therapy <b>groups</b> (all P < 0. 01). The expression values of gastric mucosal PGE 2 and serum NO of the <b>model</b> control <b>group</b> were lower than those of the normal control group (all P < 0. 05) and the 2 <b>model</b> therapy <b>groups</b> (all P < 0. 05). The thickness of the gastric mucous layerand the hexosamine content in the <b>model</b> control <b>group</b> were significantly lower than that in the normal control group (all P < 0. 01) and the 2 <b>model</b> therapy <b>groups</b> (all P < 0. 05). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy observation showed that in the <b>model</b> control <b>group,</b> the epithelial junctions were vague, the intercellular joints disappeared and damage of the intracellular organelles were significantly worse than those in the normal control group. However, in the 2 <b>model</b> therapy <b>groups,</b> damage to the intercellular joints and organelles was ameliorate relative to the <b>model</b> control <b>group.</b> CONCLUSION: Administration of geranylgeranylacetone was correlated with a more favorable pattern of gastric mucosa damage after ethanol perfusion.

40|$|Aim. The aim is {{to conduct}} a {{comparative}} analysis of {{the composition of the}} terrestrial fauna of the Tethys desert-steppe region of the Palearctic. Materials and methods. The work was based on the materials collected in different republics and regions of the Caucasus and the south of the European part of Russia during 50 years (from 1961 to 2016) which are kept in various domestic and foreign institutions. Catalogs on the studied <b>model</b> <b>groups</b> were also used to conduct the research. In making the dendrograms, a cluster analysis based on the Jaccard coefficient was used. Results. A detailed analysis was carried out by <b>model</b> <b>groups</b> of the animals of the Eastern and Western Thethys complexes of the desert-steppe region of the Palearctic. Comparative analysis has shown that a significant number of species and genera of the discussed territories is characterized by an exceptionally high ratio of endemic species and superspecies taxa. Indicators of endemism in <b>model</b> <b>groups</b> fluctuate depending on the population's ability to resettle. High endemism of faunas of darkling beetles, ground beetles, click beetles and land snails in the Eastern Tethys complex was noted. Conclusion. The Caucasus (in a new interpretation) is characterized by a high percentage of endemism for the studied <b>model</b> <b>groups.</b> A large number of the common Tethys genera and species in all <b>model</b> <b>groups</b> attests to their fundamental role in the overall composition of the biota against the background of powerful autochthonous centers of species-formation and, most importantly, the formation and functioning of the Palaearctic desert-steppe belt as the Tethys ocean reduced.  </p...|$|R
