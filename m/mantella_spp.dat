50|$|In the United Kingdom, the British Dendrobatid Group (BDG) {{was set up}} in 1989 by Bob Davies and Malcolm Peaker. Despite its name, the BDG was an {{international}} group of people concerned with one objective: the conservation and captive breeding {{of a small group of}} South American frogs belonging to the Dendrobates, Phyllobates and related genera such as <b>Mantella</b> <b>spp.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Brightly colored Malagasy poison frogs, <b>Mantella</b> <b>spp.,</b> {{sequester}} lipophilic, basic alkaloids from arthropod prey {{for their}} own chemical defense. Consequently, microsympatric prey diversity is expected to influence alkaloid diversity observed in poison frogs. Twenty-two specimens of three Mantella species from four localities in moist forests of southeastern Madagascar were analyzed individually via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealing that they contain over 80 known alkaloids. Frogs within a locality possessed significantly similar alkaloid content and diversity, while frogs from areas that varied in disturbance, elevation, and/or species showed greater differences. Based on dietary data, the larger frog species Mantella baroni consumed more and larger prey, and showed greater diversity in skin alkaloids than significantly smaller Mantella bernhardi. Additionally, frogs from the most pristine locality had {{the greatest number of}} alkaloids, whereas individuals from the most disturbed localities had the least. In a comparison of frog alkaloid profiles over a 10 - to 14 -yr period, alkaloid turnover, and thus presumably alkaloid-source arthropod turnover, was high in a disturbed locality and low in the pristine primary forest locality. We demonstrate that the nonlethal transcutaneous amphibia...|$|E
