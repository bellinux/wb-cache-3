50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the CD-RW technology, a standard for magneto-optical recordable and erasable CDs called CD-MO was introduced in 1990 and set in the Orange Book, part 1, and was basically a CD with a <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>recording</b> layer.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains a}} fairly comprehensive {{study on the}} characteristics of <b>magneto-optical</b> (MO) <b>recording</b> media. The primary aspects which are investigated consist of magnetic, magneto-optic, magneto-transport properties, and observations of domains. The main materials which have been examined are amorphous rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) Tbₓ(FeCo) ₁₋ₓ and multilayered Co/Pt and Co/Pd thin films. The samples were fabricated in several industrial and academic laboratories under different deposition conditions and deposited on different underlayers and substrates. The instrumentation used in this study include: a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), a polar Kerr effect and extraordinary Hall effect loop tracer, an optical magnetic domain analyzer, and the magnetoresistance/resistivity probes. The magneto-optical property studied here is polar Kerr rotation. The magnetic properties investigated include saturation magnetization, coercivity, anisotropy energy constant, anisotropy field, and exchange coupling constant. The magneto-transport properties include resistivity, magnetoresistance and extraordinary Hall effect with four different geometries. In the domain observations, the domain nucleation, growth and collapse phenomena were investigated. In addition, the degree of jaggedness of various domain structures has been characterized by measuring the fractal dimension. Moreover, the domain distribution is analyzed in the demagnetized state both for the sample demagnetized by an in-plane magnetic field and the sample demagnetized by a perpendicular field. At the same time, both states were also studied in light of the initial magnetization curves obtained by measurements of polar Kerr effect, extraordinary Hall effect, and magnetoresistance. The domain density as a function of domain size as well as the minimum domain size can be inferred from the initial magnetization curves...|$|R

These methods {{can be used}} to accurately measure polarization rotation and ellipticity, the reflection and transmission coefficients, the wavelength dependence of birefringence, Kerr rotation and ellipticity; the dielectric tensor of magneto-optical (MO) media, as well as the optical constants and thickness of thin film stacks. A series of optical, <b>magneto-optical</b> and magnetic <b>recording</b> media have been studied. A variable angle, multi-wavelength ellipsometer, and a MO Kerr spectrometer were used for these measurements. A general-purpose computer program has been used to analyze the experimental data. The in-plane and vertical birefringence of polycarbonate plastic substrates of optical disks have been measured for wavelengths between 360 nm and 860 nm, which covers the full range of interest for blue {{as well as for the}} current red and infrared recording. A dielectric tensor database for MO thin film materials of (BiDy) ₃(FeGa) ₅O₁₂ garnet, MnBi, multilayered Co/Pt, amorphous TbFeCoTa, fcc cobalt, and Heusler alloy PtMnSb has been established in the wavelength range of 400 - 780 nm. These materials are then evaluated based on the intrinsic MO figure of merit. In the area of hard disk magnetic recording, the optical constants of nickel phosphorous (NiP) coated substrate, CoNi/NiP magnetic film on NiP coated substrate, and the carbon overcoating layer have been obtained at several wavelengths.

40|$|The {{amount of}} digital {{information}} increases at an astonishing rate. This trend {{is not likely}} to change in the coming years, as technology is still well away from the fundamental limits in handling information. Information can be created, processed, relayed, and it can be stored in a physical way in a medium for future retrieval. One of the possibilities to store information is to write (and read) it by an optical beam in a magnetic medium: <b>Magneto-Optical</b> (M. O.) <b>recording.</b> M. O. media have several distinct merits when they are used as removable media, where resistance agains environment conditions is imperative. Several M. O. drives applying 5 ¼" or 3 ½" M. O. -disks have meanwhile appeared on the personal computer market. To achieve substantial increase of the information density on such disks, the light spot that is used for reading and writing has to become smaller. As the spot is focussed to the diffraction limit this can only be achieved by applying a shorter wavelength. The performance of the current generation of M. O. disks based on RE-TM materials decreases at short wavelenghts (300 - 500 nm), and therefore other media are needed. After 1985 research on Co/Pd and Co/Pt multilayers started on a world-wide scale, as these layers had many merits: high magneto-optical output around a wavelength of 300 nm, high corrosion resistance and strong perpendicular orientation of the magnetization due to interface anisotropy. Solely the Curie temperature was too high (350 - 400 °C for a medium with high M. O. output), resulting in degradation of the medium after many read/write cycles. One of the methods to reduce the Curie temperature of a multilayer is to reduce the Curie temperature of the magnetic layers therein by alloying them with another element. The moment of the magnetic layers should preferably remain high, and regarding magnetic phase diagrams we chose the magnetic element Ni to alloy with Co. This thesis deals with the preparation and characterization of CoNi/Pt multilayers with either 50 or 60 at. % Ni in the magnetic layers. In Chapter 2 : M. O. multilayer theory, the M. O. Kerr effect is introduced and a model for the M. O. effects of arbitrary stacked structures is presented. The influence of polarized Pt on the large Kerr rotations at short wavelengths is treated. The magnetic properties and the Curie temperature of Co/Pt multilayers are reviewed in order understand the critical parameters and their dependence on the layer structure and deposition process. The chapter concludes with an overview of possible additions to the Co layers. In Chapter 3 : Experimental methods, first the sputter process is introduced, then the UHV-sputter system that was set-up to produce the multilayers is described. Further the magnetic and structural measurement techniques that were used are briefly discussed. Besides the sputter system, the magneto-optical measurement set-up was one of the major technological projects performed during this work. Therefore it is treated seperately in Chapter 4 : M. O. measurement set-up. Operating principle, construction and merits of the new set-up are reviewed. It features spectroscopic Kerr rotation and ellipticity measurements, and using the build-in sample heater Curie temperatures can be measured. Chapter 5 : Tayloring of magnetic and magneto-optic properties summarizes measurement results on CoNi/Pt multilayers. It is shown that the layers have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in a large layer thickness range, and that the highest anisotropy corresponds to the lowest internal stress. The coercivity could be increased up to 200 kA/m (with an hysteresis loop that was almost rectangular) by applying a high sputter gas pressure, whereas the application of a bias voltage to the substrate table resulted mainly in lower coercivities. The reversal mechanism is domain wall motion, where the domains are hampered by many small pinning sites, which probably origin at boundaries of columns that extend throughout the multilayer. The Curie temperature was lowered compared to Co/Pt multilayers with the same layer thicknesses, but for samples that show a good magneto-optic performance the Curie temperature was always at the high side (around 300 °C). Application of a Pt seedlayer under the multilayer increased coercivity, which we attribute to the higher roughness, and the anisotropy, which is attributed to the improved (111) orientation of the multilayer. Spectroscopic M. O. measurements and simulations finalize this chapter. Large Kerr rotations were found when the Pt layers were very thin, typically thinner than 8. 8 Å. This correlates to the magnetic moment of the CoNi layers, which also becomes higher with decreasing spacing. This ferromagnetic coupling is needed to achieve high M. O. output. The Pt layers can be made thinner without consequences: due to the lower magnetic moment of CoNi layers, the multilayer remains perpendicular magnetized when the Pt layer thickness is reduced (even at 2. 9 Å Pt!). The figure of merit of our best CoNi/Pt sample is comparable to that of Co/Pt multilayers in the wavelength range 375 - 520 nm By excursions around the parameters of this sample an even better performance is expected to be found...|$|R

In a novel approach we attempted to combine the features of CorPt multilayers with those of low Curie temperature NirPt multilayers to.. develop low Curie temperature PtrCorPtrNi multilayers.

The final application is a novel technique for determining the entire dielectric tensor of materials used for <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>recording.</b> The incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect is employed to study nonmagnetic surface layers which form on ferrite recording heads. Calculations based on the Smith model show a correlation between the inert-layer thickness and the incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect. Experimental results confirm the shift in the angular position of the signal peak. {{in agreement with the}} theory for finite inert-layer thickness. An unambiguous determination of the inert-layer thickness for ferrite materials is prevented because of a periodic dependence of the peak angle on the inert-layer thickness. Jones-matrix algebra is used with the Smith model to quantitatively determine the effects of obliquely-incident rays on the reflectance and magneto-optical readout signals for various magneto-optical media structures. The most antireflective structure is found to be very sensitive to incident-angle effects. Structures with moderate reflectance (> 10 %). however. are not significantly affected by incident-angle effects. Finally. a technique for the determination of the optical and magneto-optical constants from multiple incident-angle measurements of reflectance and Kerr rotation is presented. The experimental system employs a Helium-Neon laser and a rotating differential detection system.

40|$|The {{birefringence}} of {{bare and}} coated substrates for <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>recording</b> is experimentally investigated using ellipsometry at the wavelengths of 632. 8 nm and 780 nm. The rotation and ellipticity of the polarization {{state of the}} reflected or transmitted light is measured for different incident angles and different orientations of the incident linear polarization. The measured data is then fitted by a computer program which solves the Maxwell equations for the plane-wave propagation in a multilayer structure and minimizes the error between the measured and calculated data by adjusting the unknown parameters of the multilayer. This approach enables us to determine orientations of the three principal axes in the substrate and the corresponding refractive indices. A special feature of our ellipsometers is that a glass hemisphere is placed {{in contact with the}} substrate, which eliminates the refraction of the incident light and enables a maximum propagation angle of 70 degrees (with respect to the normal) in the substrate. This increases the sensitivity of the measurement. Certain anomalies were observed, which we believe are associated with the presence of grooves on these substrates...|$|E
