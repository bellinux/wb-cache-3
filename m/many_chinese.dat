5|$|Despite {{the many}} western {{travelers}} coming into China {{to live and}} trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} decades, Singapore grew {{to become an}} important port in the region. Its success was due to several reasons including {{the opening of the}} Chinese market, the advent of ocean-going steamships, the dramatic reduction in the time and cost of shipping goods to Europe after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and the production of rubber and tin in Malaya. Its status as a free port provided a crucial advantage over other colonial port cities in Batavia (now Jakarta) and Manila where tariffs were levied, and it drew <b>many</b> <b>Chinese,</b> Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to Singapore. The later opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. By 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around 80% of the cargo transported by steamships. The main commercial activity was entrepôt trade which flourished under no taxation and little restriction. Many merchant houses were set up in Singapore mainly by European trading firms, but also by Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian, American and Indian merchants. There were also <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> middlemen who handled most of the trade between the European and Asian merchants.|$|E

5|$|In ancient China {{lists of}} {{different}} plants and herb concoctions for pharmaceutical purposes {{date back to}} at least {{the time of the}} Warring States (481 BC-221 BC). <b>Many</b> <b>Chinese</b> writers over the centuries contributed to the written knowledge of herbal pharmaceutics. The Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) includes the notable work of the Huangdi Neijing and the famous pharmacologist Zhang Zhongjing. There were also the 11th century scientists and statesmen Su Song and Shen Kuo who compiled learned treatises on natural history, emphasising herbal medicine.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{continued}} to crop up. <b>Many</b> <b>Chinese</b> Malayan youths {{drafted into the}} army to stave off communist attacks fled the country; most participants were English- and not Chinese-educated. To the Malays, this indicated that the Chinese had no particular loyalty towards Malaya and justified ketuanan Melayu, heightening similar perceptions caused by the apparent racial dichotomy between those in fierce opposition to the communists and those supporting the MCP.|$|E
5|$|The first gambier {{and pepper}} {{plantations}} {{appeared in the}} Riau Islands in the 1730s, after the Buginese warrior and second Yamtuan Muda of Riau, Daing Chelak, brought Chinese coolies from Malaya to Riau {{for the purpose of}} gambier cultivation, which was then widely used for medication among the locals. Another exodus of Chinese migrated to Riau in 1740 following unrest which erupted in Batavia, during which <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> were massacred. Chinese settlement in Riau continued into the 18th century, the majority of them coming from the Chaoshan area in Guangdong province, along with a sizeable minority from the southern parts of Fujian province.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the census}} data, almost 80 percent of Chinese Indonesians are Buddhist or Christian (Catholic and Protestant). Chinese Indonesians {{tend to be}} more Christian than other Chinese ethnic groups of Southeast Asia due to a complex of {{historical}} reasons. Throughout the 20th century Chinese religion and culture was forbidden and persecuted in Indonesia, forcing <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> to convert to Christianity. The first wave of conversions occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, and the number of ethnic Chinese Christians during this period quadrupled. The second wave followed after the government withdrew Confucianism's status as a recognized religion in the 1970s. Suharto endorsed a systematic campaign of eradication of Confucianism. Jakarta is home to largest Chinese Christians, meanwhile Medan is home to the largest Buddhist Chinese in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being the}} capital city, Kota Kinabalu {{is also the}} main {{industrial}} and commercial centre for Sabah. The economy {{is dominated by the}} primary sector of industry. Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation and economic development, this sector of the economy is slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more tertiary-based industry has become more apparent, especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> work as shopowners.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by the Japanese, {{in an attempt}} to prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative overland road named Burma Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, Burma, transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese when referring to Southeast Asia). Following the request, the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment notice on 7 February 1939.|$|E

Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan. Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army. In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> raw materials.|$|E
5|$|In the West, A.auricula-judae {{was used}} in folk {{medicine}} {{as recently as the}} 19th century for complaints including sore throats, sore eyes and jaundice, and as an astringent. Although it is not widely consumed in the West, it has long been popular in China, to the extent that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early twentieth century. Today, the fungus is a popular ingredient in <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> dishes, such as hot and sour soup, and also used in Chinese medicine. It is also used in Ghana, as a blood tonic. Modern research into possible medical applications has variously concluded that A.auricula-judae has antitumour, hypoglycemic, anticoagulant and cholesterol-lowering properties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Chinese</b> Buddhist monks came to Japan to help {{further the}} spread of Buddhism as well. Two 7th-century monks in particular, Zhi Yu and Zhi You, visited the court of Emperor Tenji (r. 661–672), whereupon they {{presented}} a gift of a south-pointing chariot that they had crafted. This 3rd century mechanically driven directional-compass vehicle (employing a differential gear) was again reproduced in several models for Tenji in 666, as recorded in the Nihon Shoki of 720. Japanese monks also visited China; {{such was the case}} with Ennin (794–864), who wrote of his travel experiences including travels along China's Grand Canal. The Japanese monk Enchin (814–891) stayed in China from 839 to 847 and again from 853 to 858, landing near Fuzhou, Fujian and setting sail for Japan from Taizhou, Zhejiang during his second trip to China.|$|E

5|$|The Kangchu system {{facilitated}} {{the growth of}} the gambier and pepper plantations and developed Johor's and Singapore's economies in the 19th century. The development of Johor's inland towns were attributed to the efforts by the various Kangchu, who were responsible for drawing the settlement plan for the coolies living within the plantation they were working on, from which new towns were formed. The Chinese immigrant population in Johor and Singapore grew in size during this period; Riau also experienced a similar growth during the 18th century. As a result of mass immigration by the Chinese into Johor, the Chinese quickly outnumbered the Malays in the state, although <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> coolies relocated to Singapore or other parts of Malaya as the gambier and pepper industry declined in the 20th century. Several towns and other places in Johor and Singapore, built upon sites of former gambier and pepper plantations, are named after former features of the Kangchu system, and are largely populated by ethnic Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The Yongzheng Emperor succeeded the Kangxi Emperor after {{a crisis}} that pitted many of the Kangxi Emperor's sons against one another. Many Manchu nobles who had sided with the Yongzheng Emperor's rivals during the {{succession}} struggle were still members of the Deliberative Council. To avoid alienating these grandees, the Yongzheng Emperor still made new appointments to the Council and consulted it on various military matters, but he also worked to undermine its power. To bypass the Council, he created smaller parallel bodies which he found more reliable and less entrenched. Slowly, he transferred deliberative powers to these more trusted ministers. Around 1730, these informal institutions crystallized into the Grand Council. Unlike the Deliberative Council, whose membership was almost exclusively Manchu, the Grand Council counted <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> among its ranks. This more ethnically mixed privy council served as the empire's main policymaking body {{for the rest of}} the Qing dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Nanking had been quicker and easier than the Japanese had foreseen; they lost only 1,953 {{soldiers}} in battle, plus 4,994 wounded. Japan's casualties were undoubtedly dwarfed {{by those of}} China, though no precise figures exist on how <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> were killed in action. The Japanese claimed to have killed up to 84,000 enemies during the Nanking campaign whereas a contemporary Chinese source claimed that their army suffered 20,000 casualties. Masahiro Yamamoto noted that the Japanese usually inflated their opponent's body counts while the Chinese had reason to downplay the scale of their loss. Ikuhiko Hata estimates that 50,000 Chinese soldiers were killed in combat during the entire battle whereas Jay Taylor puts the number at 70,000 and states that proportionate {{to the size of}} the force committed, such losses were greater than those suffered in the devastating Battle of Shanghai. On the other hand, Chinese scholar Sun Zhaiwei estimates Chinese combat losses at 6,000 to 10,000 men.|$|E

5|$|East Polynesians {{were the}} first people to reach New Zealand about 1280, {{followed}} by the early European explorers, notably James Cook in 1769 who explored New Zealand three times and mapped the coastline. Following the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 when the country became a British colony, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia. Due to restrictive policies, limitations were placed on non-European immigrants. During the gold rush period (1858-1880s) large number of young men came from California and Victoria to New Zealand goldfields. Apart from British, there were Irish, North Germans, Scandinavians, Italian and <b>many</b> <b>Chinese.</b> The Chinese were sent special invitations by the Otago Chamber of Commerce in 1866. By 1873 they made up 40 percent of the diggers in Otago and 25 percent of the diggers in Westland. From 1900 there was also significant Dutch, Dalmatian, Italian, and German immigration together with indirect European immigration through Australia, North America, South America and South Africa. Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased. In 2008–09, a target of 45,000 migrants was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service (plus a 5,000 tolerance).|$|E
5|$|From one {{settlement}} in year 1, the Han Dynasty's {{involvement in the}} Minyue region grew into several counties. There were <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> counties in the area by the 4th century AD. The Minyue had been culturally assimilated {{by the time the}} Han Dynasty collapsed, and Chinese civilization was undergoing a transition to the Three Kingdoms period of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. Political upheaval in the north, such as Wang Mang's usurpation, had caused Han migrants to resettle in the south. The Han Dynasty's military expansion widened its commercial ties in addition acquiring large amounts of new territories. The empire's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue spoke of its vast size that it bordered the ancient kingdoms of Southeast Asia. Economic ties with the Han and subsequent dynasties affected the trajectory of maritime trade of Southeast Asia, where goods have been excavated made in styles resembling that of the ancient Han Chinese. Maritime trade and the Silk Road also linked China with Ancient Rome, India, and the Near East.|$|E
5|$|Gambier {{and pepper}} farming were mainly {{confined}} to the Bintan (formerly spelled as Bentan) and Galang Islands. Similar to the Kangchu system in Johor, gambier and pepper plantations were established on grants of land by the Yamtuan Muda of Riau, who would issue land permits (Surat Sungai) to the Kangchu who would direct {{the operations of the}} plantation and workers within the settlement. In the early and middle 19th century, <b>many</b> <b>Chinese</b> settlers and merchants from Riau relocated their businesses to Singapore, and established trading links between Riau and Singapore. These settlers and merchants still maintained trading links with Riau, as the Kangchu from Riau often shipped their produce to Singapore for free trade to evade taxes imposed by the Dutch colonial government. Like Singapore, competition for the gambier and pepper trade between the Teochews and Hokkiens in Riau led to communal tensions and sporadic violence in Riau during the 1840s and 1850s. In the early 20th century, the Chinese abandoned gambier and pepper plantations in favour of other agricultural practices, as the worldwide prices for gambier experienced a drastic drop in value and many pepper plants fell prey to a disease plaguing the archipelago.|$|E
