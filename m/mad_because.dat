When the Kree Liberation Force set forth to invade Earth, {{they found the}} floating mutilated corpse of the Surfer near Earth's moon. Mar-Vell says {{that he and his}} comrades concluded that the Surfer had been driven <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> of his lack of need for oxygen and clawed open his chest in order to expose his lungs to the atmosphere, but died of shock.|$|E

That never made me <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> it was business on their part just as it was business for me to mislead the spies. I rarely have been able to keep the same set of betting commissioners for any length of time. A few bets and my commissioners were pointed out and watched." ...|$|E

500|$|After audiences {{began to}} view Van Winkle as a novelty act and a pop star {{rather than a}} {{legitimate}} rapper, his popularity began to decline. Detroit-based rapper Eminem states that when he first heard [...] "Ice Ice Baby", [...] "I felt like I didn't want to rap anymore. I was so <b>mad,</b> <b>because</b> he was making it real hard for me." [...] Van Winkle lost some credibility among hip hop fans, but later began to regain some success, attracting a new audience outside of the mainstream audience that had formerly accepted him, and then rejected him. [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] {{continues to be the}} song that Van Winkle is best known for internationally, although Van Winkle states that his American fans like his newer music better.|$|E
500|$|During their dinner, Avery tells Jack {{some day}} {{he will be}} as great as a man as former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, to which Jack replies [...] "I do like jelly beans", a {{reference}} to Reagan's real-life love of the candy. During one scene of [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter", Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) [...] tells the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff [...] "I know you're all secretly <b>mad,</b> <b>because</b> we finally have a black Disney princess", which is {{a reference to the}} 2009 Disney animated film The Princess and the Frog in which the princess character, Tiana, is the first black princess in the Disney Princess franchise. In her speech, Liz says that she wants to be with a man who [...] "will just shut their mouth" [...] when watching the ABC show Lost.|$|E
500|$|... "Wake Up Dead" [...] {{features}} lyrics which {{describe a}} man who has been cheating on his wife or girlfriend and is sneaking into his house, knowing that if his wife finds out about his other lover, she will kill him. Mustaine said that [...] "Wake up Dead" [...] was written about him cheating on a girl with whom he was living. He stayed with her because he was homeless at the time and needed a place to stay. Unfortunately, {{he was in love with}} another girl and thought the one he lived with would be <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> he was cheating on her. He had to leave her because he thought she had intentions to kill him. [...] "The Conjuring", according to author Bob Larson, simulates a Satanic ceremony, and makes references about being the devil's advocate and his salesman. Mustaine explained the song is about black magic and contains instructions for hexes. However, because the subject matter appears incompatible to his conversion to Christianity, the song has not been played live since 2001.|$|E

50|$|Rice coupled his aural assaults with {{psychological}} torture on {{audiences in}} Den Haag, the Netherlands, by shining {{in their faces}} exceedingly bright lights that were deliberately placed just out of reach. As their frustration mounted, Rice states that he:...continued to be friendly to the audience, which made them even <b>madder,</b> <b>because</b> they were so mad and I didn't care! They were shaking their fists at me, and I thought that at any minute there'd be a riot. So I took {{it as far as}} I thought I could, and then thanked them and left.|$|R
6000|$|The Scripture tells us, that [...] "oppression makes a {{wise man}} mad."

500|$|Liverpool {{made their}} European debut in 1964–65, {{competing}} in the European Cup reaching the semi-finals. In the second round the club was drawn against the formidable Anderlecht. Immediately before the match, Shankly decided to experiment with the Liverpool kit. Liverpool played in red shirts with white shorts and white sock with red top but Shankly and Ian St John had {{the idea of an}} all-red kit that would give the impression the players were taller. Liverpool played in all-red only for European matches but quickly adopted the colour permanently. Three days after winning the FA Cup, Liverpool defeated European champions Internazionale 3–1 at Anfield in the semi-final first leg with a performance that was saluted by Inter's coach Helenio Herrera. The second leg at the San Siro, however, was according to Shankly [...] "a war", which Liverpool lost 3–0 and so were knocked out of the competition 4–3 on aggregate. Eleven years later, Shankly maintained that two of Inter's goals were illegal. Even today, the Liverpool website describes the match by saying that [...] "(Liverpool were) only denied at the semi-final stage due to a dishonest referee in Milan". According to Kelly, however, video evidence shows that the two disputed goals were actually legitimate. Shankly said after the defeat in Milan that the Inter fans were going <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> they were [...] "so pleased to have beaten Liverpool" [...] and insisted that this proved the high standard [...] "you (the team) have raised yourselves up to".|$|E
500|$|Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) {{noted that}} the [...] "red reality" [...] is real because she shows up in that world first, {{and in the other}} the next day. Dr. Evans helps Michael with the case in the [...] "green reality", while Lee insisted that the picture Evans noted is fake. Michael and Hannah speak about Kate in the [...] "red reality", when he finds out that her sister had died earlier. Michael thinks that she must be on the cocaine because of that. He shows Rex what they use to do together, Rex is {{depressed}} and mad, while Rex walks off claiming that he is studying for a Spanish test at school. Later, they go to a man's house who has a video camera at his house. This helps Michael with the case in the [...] "green reality". Vega and Michael continue on the case, and Michael goes to the house. Vega says nothing is there, while Michael thinks to his [...] "green reality", and looks in the bathroom for evidence, which was shaving cream in the cabinet. They speak to Cameron Fuller and Darin Knox, who committed the crime. Evidence was that a drink was dropped on the person who had fallen in the lake. Soon after, Dr. Wild finds evidence from the camera that Kate and her friend had done the crime. She finally confesses to it. They speak in both realities about the story of how it came to the current life. Michael speaks to Rex, again. Rex claimed that he was <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> the racquet was Hannah's, and that it helped him deal with her death in the [...] "green reality". Rex goes to the tennis court and apologized to Cole who forgives him.|$|E
2500|$|He played angry, often [...] "manufacturing" [...] {{things to}} make him <b>mad,</b> <b>because</b> he felt {{it gave him a}} {{competitive}} edge. After the Bears lost to the Lions in their first match-up of 1969, Lions rookie running back Altie Taylor told reporters that Butkus was overrated. The next time the teams played that season, Butkus responded by chasing Taylor out of bounds after a play and causing him to jump into the stands at Wrigley Field.|$|E

He came for it every day, and was real <b>mad</b> once <b>because</b> I had given a lot of it to the dog, and couldn't let him have but a pint." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{how can one}} {{explain a}} change in sun and moon and everybody's soul?" [...] cried Rosamund, in despair. [...] "Must I confess we had got so morbid as to think him <b>mad</b> merely <b>because</b> {{he wanted to get}} married; and that we didn't even know it was only because we wanted to get married ourselves? We'll humiliate ourselves, if you like, doctor; we're happy enough." ...|$|R
2500|$|Some of the feud's {{highlights}} involved Al Boasberg, who {{is credited}} with helping Benny refine his character into (arguably) America's first stand-up comedian. Boasberg was well known behind the scenes as a top comedy writer and script doctor, but he seldom received recognition in public. He worked, uncredited, on many films (including the Marx Brothers' hits A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races). Steaming <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> of his long battles for recognition, Boasberg {{was said to have}} delivered a tirade that ended up (in slightly altered form) in an Allen-Benny feud routine: ...|$|E
2500|$|Truex {{was happy}} with his team's performance, [...] "I'm so proud of the team – all {{the guys on the}} team and {{everybody}} at MWR. Clint (Bowyer) and Brian (Vickers) were up front all day long. This just says a lot about everything that everybody at MWR has done over the off season – working hard, giving us good race cars. We got off in the mid-part of the race, but had the race strategy at the end and a fast enough car to stay up there.” Earnhardt regretted colliding with team-mate Jeff Gordon, “I’m <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> I screwed myself on pit road speeding. I’m pretty upset about that. Otherwise, I feel bad about running into Jeff’s car. I had a good day other than that. I had a good time. … I feel bad about what happened with Jeff, but damn, we were just racing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'Mad Song' {{is often}} {{regarded}} as Blake's first satire. Harold Bloom, who feels {{it is the}} most [...] "Blakean" [...] poem in Poetical Sketches refers to it as an [...] "intellectual satire" [...] on both the concept of mad songs (six of which appeared in Percy's Antiques, which describes madness as being a peculiarly English theme) and the world which the singer seeks to leave. Frye is also an admirer of the poem and argues that [...] "a maddened world of storm and tempest is the objective counterpart of madness in the human mind; and the madman is <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> he is locked up in his own Selfhood or inside, and cannot bear to see anything. In order to have his world a consistently dark one, he is compelled to rush frantically around the spinning earth forever, keeping one jump ahead of the rising sun, unable even to sleep in his everlasting night." [...] Alexander Lincoln likens the poem to 'Song: [...] "How Sweet I roam'd from field to field"' insofar as both deal with [...] "states of mental captivity described from within." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the climax}} he files {{a case in}} the police station and court about his well getting stolen. At first he is held as a <b>mad</b> man, <b>because</b> a well, a solid {{structure}} can't be stolen. But then Mukund presents the proofs on the paper about the well being dug. The court has to accept the proof and declare that the well was indeed stolen. Mukund wins the Lawsuit.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the success}} of [...] "Kiss My Trance" [...] in 2008, The Subs started to tour with live shows. They soon {{established}} a solid stage reputation, as energetic live performances and a raw punk attitude became their trademark. Frontman Papillon’s movement on stage {{is often referred to}} as that of a <b>mad</b> professor, <b>because</b> of the combination of knob twisting the hi-tech gear and sometimes-crazy climbing habits and risky stage dives.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Cashel, {{with sudden}} bitterness. [...] "What did YOU care what company I kept? You're <b>mad</b> with me <b>because</b> I made your cousin {{look like a}} fool, I suppose. That's what's the matter." ...|$|R
2500|$|Coonan {{revealed}} {{that in the}} run-up to his departure, Carl becomes a [...] "bit of a lone wolf" [...] after giving up trying to win Kirsty back, and said he has no friends because he has threatened everyone. Coonan shares scenes with actresses Samantha Womack, who plays Ronnie Mitchell, and Rita Simons, who plays Roxy Mitchell, but the actor explained that both characters realise that Carl is [...] "a bit too dark to get involved with" [...] and he is [...] "probably going a bit <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> he can't get Kirsty back". It was reported on 1 December 2013 that Roxy would [...] "seek solace" [...] in Carl after her marriage is annulled, but Shane Richie, who plays Roxy's ex-husband Alfie Moon, said Roxy is doing it because she has [...] "her freedom back—and she'll be throwing it in Alfie's face", despite being warned off Carl by Ronnie and Phil. Soaplife said that Roxy is [...] "hooked on the excitement of being with Carl." [...] Ronnie and Carl then start a feud, and it was reported that it would [...] "come to a head with some dark twists", and that [...] "One last showdown then sees Ronnie get rid of Carl forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|New Potions {{professor}} Horace Slughorn invites Hermione to {{join his}} [...] "Slug Club", and she helps Ron retain his spot on the Gryffindor Quidditch team when she confunds Cormac McLaggen, causing him to miss his last save attempt during Keeper tryouts. Hermione's feelings for Ron continue to grow and she decides {{to make a move}} by inviting him to Slughorn's Christmas Party, but he romances Lavender instead in retaliation for his belief that Hermione had kissed Krum years earlier. She attempts to get even by dating McLaggen at the Christmas party, but her plan goes bust and she abandons him midway through the party. Ron and Hermione continually feud with each other (Ron is upset with her because she set birds to attack him after seeing him and Lavender kissing; Hermione is mostly <b>mad</b> <b>because</b> of her growing jealousy) until he suffers a near-fatal poisoning from tainted mead, which frightens her enough to reconcile with him. Following Dumbledore's death, Ron and Hermione both vow to stay by Harry's side regardless of what happens. A minor subplot in the book is that Hermione and Harry form a rivalry in Potions, as Hermione is used to coming first in her subjects and is angered that Harry outperforms her undeservedly by following tips and different instructions written in the margins of Harry's potions book by the previous owner. Hermione is also {{the only one of the}} trio to successfully pass her Apparition test (Ron failed, albeit barely, and Harry was too young).|$|E

50|$|Iphinoe, one of {{the daughters}} of Proetus and Stheneboea. She and her sisters Lysippe and Iphianassa were driven <b>mad</b> (either <b>because</b> they didn't accept the rites of Dionysus, or else because they disparaged a wooden statue of Hera) and ran off into the {{wilderness}} like maenads. Melampus had to pursue {{them in order to}} provide a cure; Iphinoe died in the pursuit, but her sisters did eventually recover their wits through purification rites.|$|R

6000|$|... "All {{habits are}} bad habits," [...] said Michael, with deadly calm. [...] "Madness {{does not come}} by {{breaking}} out, but by giving in; by settling down in some dirty, little, self-repeating circle of ideas; by being tamed. YOU went <b>mad</b> about money, <b>because</b> you're an heiress." ...|$|R

While annoyed at having {{to work as a}} team (not to mention the dispositions of her team members), Renko proves on many occasions to be an integral member of the group. She also loves Pandas.|$|R
