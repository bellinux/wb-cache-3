5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Pairing up study {{partners}} {{has been}} compared to making a shidduch (marriage match), as the skills, interests, temperament and schedule of each person <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> consideration. Good friends do not necessarily make good chavrusas. If the chavrusas spend too much time chatting or joking with each other at the expense of their study time, they are advised to find different study partners.|$|E
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E

5|$|It <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> {{account that}} Soviet T-26 was one {{the most modern}} tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, {{including the right to}} protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E
5|$|Repeating nines also {{turn up in}} {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof {{needs to be able}} to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E

5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada's Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E

In Godson-T, there is a close tight coupling relationship between {{cache coherence}} protocol and memory consistency model. In our research of Godson-T, we found that its cache coherence is relaxed unlike other cache coherence protocols. We choose Murphi as modeling language and verification tool.
