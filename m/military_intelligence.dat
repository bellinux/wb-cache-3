5|$|In 1926, the German Navy adopted, as its top {{cryptographic}} device, {{a modified}} civilian Enigma machine; in 1928 the German Army followed suit. The {{complexity of the}} system was much increased in 1930 {{by the introduction of}} a plugboard (Steckerbrett), albeit with only six connecting leads in use. In December 1932, Marian Rejewski made what historian David Kahn describes {{as one of the greatest}} advances in cryptologic history, by applying pure mathematicsthe theory of permutations and groupsto breaking the German armed forces' Enigma machine ciphers. Rejewski had worked out the precise interconnections of the Enigma rotors and reflector, after the Bureau had received, from French <b>Military</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Captain Gustave Bertrand, two German documents and two pages of Enigma daily keys (for September and October of that year). These had been obtained by a French <b>military</b> <b>intelligence</b> agent, a German codenamed Rex, from an agent who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, whom the French codenamed Asché.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations {{and reducing the}} number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the <b>military</b> <b>intelligence</b> service. This was to be achieved by strengthening <b>military</b> <b>intelligence</b> through closer coordination with the Sûreté, and by raising internal standards. An inquiry into the mutiny at showed that cooperation between Resident Massimi and Commandant Le Tacon did not exist despite multiple requests, and that it was partly responsible for the uprising. The relationship between the civilian and military authorities were traditionally poor, but Yen Bay stood out in the total lack of military-civilian cooperation. Further VNQDĐ conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as Kiến An, were detected and scotched at late notice. It was decided that the teamwork with the Sûreté had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Yen Bay style rebellions. The rebellion allowed the civilian authorities an opportunity to involve themselves in military matters.|$|E

5|$|In his 2011 book Satellittkrigen, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation {{journalist}} Bård Wormdal {{argues that}} SvalSat {{is used for}} <b>military</b> <b>intelligence</b> and thus is violating the Svalbard Treaty. Specifically, Wormdal provides evidence that downloaded images of the earth are used for intelligence and military activities. For instance, a Landsat image taken during the Libyan Civil War was sold by the Italian company e-GEOS to the Italian Armed Forces. Similarly, a Technology Experiment Satellite image was sold to the United States Armed Forces during the War in Afghanistan and Arirang-2 images of North Korean installations have been sold to the United States. All three satellites use SvalSat {{as one of their}} ground stations. According to Governor Odd Olsen Ingerø, even if a military should indirectly use information downloaded from SvalSat, this would not be a breach of the treaty. A dissertation by Professor Geir Ulfstein concludes that even if a ground station was directly used for downloading <b>military</b> <b>intelligence</b> from military satellites, it would still be permitted by the treaty.|$|E

5|$|The {{collapse}} of South Vietnamese {{forces in the}} Central Highlands came about {{as a result of}} three major factors. Firstly, during much of the war, President Nguyen Van Thieu’s confidence in the ARVN’s intelligence could not be shaken. However, following the capitulation of Ban Me Thuot, Thieu lost all faith in his own <b>military</b> <b>intelligence</b> agencies, when it became evidently clear that the strength of North Vietnamese forces was far greater than what South Vietnamese intelligence agencies had gathered. Consequently, Thieu completely ignored his own <b>military</b> <b>intelligence</b> and the CIA, and made all military decisions by himself without consulting the Joint General Staff. Thus, when Major-General Pham Van Phu requested that Thieu send reinforcements to bolster the strength of South Vietnamese forces in the Central Highlands, Thieu gave him two options: either carry out the President’s orders, or be replaced by somebody who was willing to do so. General Phu chose to implement Thieu’s orders and evacuated his units from II Corps.|$|E

5|$|After being {{promoted}} to colonel, {{he served as}} Director of <b>Military</b> <b>Intelligence</b> between 1960 and 1964, and while the Australian Army was developing its own doctrine on counter-revolutionary warfare, Graham's ideas on counter-insurgency were influenced by a visit to South Vietnam in November 1961. Graham's understanding of {{the challenges of the}} prevailing Cold War environment allowed him to reform Australia's nascent <b>military</b> <b>intelligence</b> apparatus, encouraging developments in joint intelligence arrangements with Australia's allies and fostering liaison with his British and US counterparts, as well as establishing relationships with countries in South-East Asia. In recognition of his service to the Australian Staff Corps he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1963. He then took up an appointment as commandant of the Jungle Training Centre (JTC) at Canungra, Queensland in 1964. The Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) was being prepared for deployment during this time, and Army officers were learning new tactics, techniques and procedures. Promoted to brigadier in 1965 he then commanded the 6th Task Force in southern Queensland, supervising the training of 2 RAR and 6 RAR, both battalions which would later serve under his command in Vietnam. In 1966, Graham studied at the Imperial Defence College in London.|$|E
