25|$|Dry {{suits are}} often worn for boating, {{especially}} sailing, and on personal water craft {{in the winter}} months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion in cold water if the user falls overboard. These dry suits, which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving dry suits. They are usually made of a breathable <b>membrane</b> <b>material</b> to let sweat permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day. Membrane type surface dry suits only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Most users will wear a thin thermal undersuit, or street clothes, for warmth; but wearing ordinary fabrics can be dangerous if the suit leaks in cold water because they will lose most of their insulating properties.|$|E

40|$|Reverse osmosis (RO) is {{currently}} the most important desalination technology and it is experiencing significant growth. The objective {{of this paper is}} to review the historical and current development of RO <b>membrane</b> <b>materials</b> which are the key determinants of separation performance and water productivity, and hence to define performance targets for those who are developing new RO <b>membrane</b> <b>materials.</b> The chemistry, synthesis mechanism(s) and desalination performance of various RO membranes are discussed from the point of view of <b>membrane</b> <b>materials</b> science. The review starts with the first generation of asymmetric polymeric membranes and finishes with current proposals for nano-structured <b>membrane</b> <b>materials.</b> The paper provides an overview of RO performance in relation to <b>membrane</b> <b>materials</b> and methods of synthesis. To date polymeric membranes have dominated the RO desalination industry. From the late 1950 s to the 1980 s the research effort focussed on the search for optimum polymeric <b>membrane</b> <b>materials.</b> In subsequent decades the performance of RO membranes has been optimised via control of membrane formation reactions, and the use of poly-condensation catalysts and additives. The performance of state-of-the-art RO membranes has been highlighted. Nevertheless, the advances in membrane permselectivity in the past decade has been relatively slow, and membrane fouling remains a severe problem. The emergence of nano-technology in <b>membrane</b> <b>materials</b> science could offer an attractive alternative to polymeric <b>materials.</b> Hence nano-structured <b>membranes</b> are discussed in this review including zeolite membranes, thin film nano-composite membranes, carbon nano-tube membranes, and biomimetic membranes. It is proposed that these novel materials represent the most likely opportunities for enhanced RO desalination performance in the future, but that a number of challenges remain with regard to their practical implementation...|$|R

By the FEM analysis, it was found out that when tensioned under uni-axial loads, the tensile modulus in the warp and fill direction of woven <b>membrane</b> <b>materials</b> could be predicted nicely, especially after the revision of the properties for the fiber materials. The effect of the tensile moduli of the fiber and the PVC coating materials on the modulus of the woven membrane fabrics has been discussed.

When it comes to the prediction of the modulus of the woven <b>membrane</b> <b>materials</b> under bi-axial loads, large difference could be noticed between the predicted results and the experimental results, especially in warp direction.
