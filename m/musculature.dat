5|$|Adult {{males have}} large cheek flaps {{to show their}} {{dominance}} to other males. The cheek flaps are made mostly of fatty tissue and are supported by the <b>musculature</b> of the face. Mature males' throat pouches allow them to make loud calls.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw <b>musculature,</b> enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw <b>musculature,</b> to increase the power of their bite.|$|E
5|$|In {{the acute}} phase {{physical}} therapists {{focus on the}} patient’s respiratory status, prevention of indirect complications (such as pressure ulcers), maintaining range of motion, and keeping available <b>musculature</b> active.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{arise from}} the meso- and meta-thoracic {{segments}} and are similar in size in the basal groups. In more derived groups, the meso-thoracic wings are larger with more powerful <b>musculature</b> at their bases and more rigid vein structures on the costal edge.|$|E
5|$|This {{structure}} {{ensures that}} the <b>musculature</b> is excited rapidly and simultaneously, and can be directly stimulated from any point on the body, and it also is better able to recover after injury.|$|E
5|$|VO2 max: This level uses {{interval}} training {{to build the}} athlete's VO2 max—volume of oxygen that the lungs pass into the <b>musculature</b> via the cardiovascular system.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} <b>musculature</b> of the kakapo is also {{modified by}} flightlessness. The pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles are greatly reduced. The propatagialis tendo longus has no distinct muscle belly. The sternocoracoideus is tendinous. There is an extensive cucularis capitis clavicularis muscle that {{is associated with}} the large crop.|$|E
5|$|While {{cockroaches}} do {{not have}} lungs as do vertebrates, and can continue to respire if their heads are removed, in some very large species, the body <b>musculature</b> may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air {{in and out of}} the spiracles; this may be considered a form of breathing.|$|E
5|$|Discussion {{continues}} {{about the}} relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts {{also point out that}} the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as <b>musculature,</b> blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.|$|E
5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw <b>musculature</b> is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of <b>musculature</b> and innervation in the region.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb <b>musculature</b> made by Coombs in 1978 {{suggest that}} the forelimbs bore the {{majority}} of the animal's weight, and were adapted for high force delivery on the front feet, possibly for food gathering. In addition, Coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers, though the hoof-like structure of the manus would have limited fossorial activity. Ankylosaurs were likely to have been slow-moving and sluggish animals, though they may have been capable of quick movements when necessary.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and <b>musculature.</b> While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} {{are preserved}} with {{a gap between}} the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more <b>musculature</b> would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do not correspond with subcutaneous structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve {{is derived from}} the first pair of occipital somites, collections of mesoderm that form next to the main axis of an embryo during development. The <b>musculature</b> it supplies develop as the hypoglossal cord from the myotomes of the first four pairs of occipital somites. The nerve is first visible as a series of roots in the fourth week of development, which have formed a single nerve and link to the tongue by the fifth week.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the breed}} is used mainly for meat, {{due to its}} {{extensive}} <b>musculature.</b> Horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries, including France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. However, they are increasingly used for farm, forest and leisure work. Their nimble action, stamina and good temper make them increasingly used for competitive driving across Europe, and they have also been used as mounts for therapeutic horseback riding. The breed {{is known for its}} ability to work in rough, hilly terrain.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} for the diet of aetosaurs. In 1947, H J Sawin proposed that the aetosaur Longosuchus was a scavenger based on the close proximity of some specimens to {{a large number of}} skeletons that were likely carcasses. A 2009 study of the jaw biomechanics of the South American genus Neoaetosauroides suggested that the animal may have fed on larvae and insects without hard exoskeletons. This is because Neoaetosauroides lacks serrations or wear facets on the teeth and has a jaw leverage that is not designed for strong forces such as crushing and chopping. The study recognized that northern aetosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Stagonolepis did have jaws that would have supported a strong <b>musculature,</b> and were likely better suited to eating plant material.|$|E
5|$|Bite force {{estimates}} for Deinonychus were first produced in 2005, based on reconstructed jaw <b>musculature.</b> This {{study concluded that}} Deinonychus likely had a maximum bite force only 15% that of the modern American alligator. A 2010 study by Paul Gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate the bite force based directly on newly discovered Deinonychus tooth puncture marks in the bones of a Tenontosaurus. These puncture marks came from a large individual, and provided the first evidence that large Deinonychus could bite through bone. Using the tooth marks, Gignac's team were able to determine that the bite force of Deinonychus {{was significantly higher than}} earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone. They found the bite force of Deinonychus to be between 4,100 and 8,200 newtons, greater than living carnivorous mammals including the hyena, and equivalent to a similarly sized alligator.|$|E
5|$|Greg Paul (1988) {{proposed}} that the horns were butting weapons and that the small orbita would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting. Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) suggested that Carnotaurus used its horns in a way similar to rams. They calculated that the neck <b>musculature</b> {{was strong enough to}} absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5.7m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia, while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas {{concluded that}} despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated <b>musculature</b> was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the <b>musculature</b> of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|Its closest {{relative}} is {{the black}} currawong (S. fuliginosa) of Tasmania, which has sometimes been considered a subspecies. Together with the larger grey currawong (S. versicolor), they form the genus Strepera. Although crow-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and instead belong to the family Artamidae, together with the closely related Australian magpie and the butcherbirds. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they {{were placed in the}} family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist John Albert Leach after he had studied their <b>musculature.</b> Ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which became the family Artamidae.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty {{because he had}} introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away from art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of the}} congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered <b>musculature</b> of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E
5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is one of}} six (or seven) {{members of}} the genus Cracticus known as butcherbirds. Within the genus, it is most {{closely related to the}} Tagula butcherbird (C. louisiadensis) and hooded butcherbird (C. cassicus). The three form a {{monophyletic}} group within the genus, having diverged from ancestors of the grey butcherbird around five million years ago. The butcherbirds, Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) and currawongs (Strepera spp.) were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by John Albert Leach after he had studied their <b>musculature.</b> American ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which became the family Artamidae in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the bodies and their <b>musculature</b> refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses {{of some of the}} figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth were}} long and slender, {{as opposed to the}} usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were {{equipped}} with fifteen dentary teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points. The lower jaw was found with hyoid bones, in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue <b>musculature</b> and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily.|$|E
5|$|The {{unblemished}} <b>musculature</b> of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} pied and grey currawong, the black currawong forms the genus Strepera. Although crow-like in {{appearance}} and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and are instead {{closely related to}} the Australian magpie and the butcherbirds. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist John Albert Leach after he had studied their <b>musculature.</b> Ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between the woodswallows and the butcherbirds and relatives in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which later became the family Artamidae.|$|E
5|$|As in {{all other}} tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and {{surrounding}} <b>musculature</b> provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds, {{as opposed to the}} vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and <b>musculature</b> needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Schlegel first {{proposed}} in 1857 that the species {{belonged to the}} starling family (Sturnidae), reclassifying {{it as part of}} the Sturnus genus S. capensis. This reclassification was observed by other authors; Carl Jakob Sundevall proposed the new genus name Lophopsarus ("crested starling") in 1872, yet Fregilupus varius—the oldest name—remains the bird's binomial, and all other scientific names are synonyms. In 1874, after a detailed analysis of the only known skeleton (held at the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology), James Murie agreed that it was a starling. Richard Bowdler Sharpe said in 1890 that the hoopoe starling was similar to the starling genus Basilornis, but did not note any similarities other than their crests. In 1941, Malcolm R. Miller found the bird's <b>musculature</b> {{similar to that of the}} common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) after he dissected a specimen preserved in spirits at the Cambridge Museum, but noted that the tissue was very degraded and the similarity did not necessarily confirm a relationship with starlings. In 1957, Andrew John Berger cast doubt on the bird's affinity with starlings due to subtle anatomical differences, after dissecting a spirit specimen at the American Museum of Natural History. Some authors proposed a relationship with vangas (Vangidae), but Hiroyuki Morioka rejected this in 1996, after a comparative study of skulls.|$|E
5|$|Later, Brown {{revised the}} {{phylogeny}} of Corythosaurus, {{and found that}} it was closely related, and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus. The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae, and the proportions of the limbs. During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately, and that birds, based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians. He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true. He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians, it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic <b>musculature</b> and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus. However, even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians, birds are now thought to have descended from the latter.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral <b>musculature,</b> and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck <b>musculature</b> to control balance.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{study from}} life, {{depicting}} {{a black and}} a white wrestler grappling. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, {{as it was a}} common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and <b>musculature</b> of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} <b>musculature</b> which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
5|$|The soft fins, skin, and <b>musculature</b> of {{the false}} {{catshark}} suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E
