40|$|A {{program called}} ``Innovative Billing?? has been {{developed}} to provide individualized energy information for a mass audience?the entire residential customer base of an electric or gas utility. Customers receive a graph on the bill that compares that customer?s consumption with other similar customers for the same month. The program aims to stimulate customers to make ef?ciency improvements. To group as many as several million customers into small ``comparison groups??, an automated method must be developed drawing solely from the data available to the utility. This paper develops and applies methods to compare the quality of resulting comparison groups. A data base of 114, 000 customers from a utility billing system {{was used to evaluate}} Innovative Billing comparison groups, comparing four alternative criteria: house characteristics (?oor area, housing type, and heating fuel); street; meter read route; billing cycle. Also, customers were interviewed to see what forms of comparison graphs made most sense and led to fewest errors of interpretation. We ?nd that good quality comparison groups result from using street name, <b>meter</b> <b>book,</b> or multiple house characteristics. Other criteria we tested, such as entire cycle, entire <b>meter</b> <b>book,</b> or single house characteristics such as ?oor area, resulted in poor quality comparison groups. This analysis provides a basis for choosing comparison groups based on extensive user testing and statistical analysis. The result is a practical set of guidelines {{that can be used to}} implement realistic, inexpensive innovative billing for the entire customer base of an electric or gas utility...|$|E

Idyll 29, a pederastic love poem, [...] "which is presumably an imitation of Alcaeus and opens with a quotation from him," [...] is in the same <b>meter</b> as <b>Book</b> II of Sappho. The other three poems are composed in the Greater Asclepiad <b>meter</b> (like Sappho, <b>Book</b> III). Also in the third century BC, a hymn by Aristonous (Collectanea Alexandrina 162) is composed in glyconic-pherecratean stanzas, and Philodamus' paean to Dionysus (CA 167) is partly analyzable by Aeolic principles.|$|R

50|$|Sappho and Alcaeus' poetic {{practice}} had in common, {{not just}} the general principles sketched above, but many specific verse forms. For example, the Sapphic stanza, which represents such {{a large part of}} Sappho's surviving poetry, is also well represented in Alcaeus' work (e.g. Alcaeus frr. 34, 42, 45, 308b, 362). Alcaeus frr. 38a and 141 use the same <b>meter</b> as <b>Book</b> II of Sappho, and Alcaeus frr. 340-349 the Greater Asclepiad as in Book III. One notable form is the Alcaic stanza (e.g. Alcaeus frr. 6, 129, 325-339), but this too is found in both poets (Sappho frr. 137-138).|$|R

5000|$|Harvey Manning (July 16, 1925 in Ballard, Seattle, Washington - November 12, 2006 in Bellevue, Washington) was a noted {{author of}} hiking guides and {{climbing}} textbooks, and a tireless hiking advocate. Manning lived on Cougar Mountain, {{within the city}} limits of Bellevue, Washington, calling his home the [...] "200 <b>meter</b> hut". His <b>book</b> Walking the Beach to Bellingham is an autobiography and manifesto fleshing out his journal of a hike along the shore of Puget Sound over a two-year span.|$|R
50|$|Harriet Drury Van Meter visited India in 1965 by {{invitation}} of the United States Department of State. While in India, she witnessed {{long lines of}} people waiting just to borrow a book to study from. She returned to Kentucky and placed an inquiry in the English-speaking Indian newspaper The Hindu, offering books. A {{large number of people}} responded, so Harriet Van <b>Meter</b> started sending <b>books</b> from her basement. In 1986, Harriet Van Meter was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts, and she was a finalist.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{additional}} meters found in Sappho and Alcaeus {{are similar to the}} ones discussed above, and similarly analyzable. For example, Sappho frr. 130-131 (and the final lines of fr. 94's stanzas) are composed in a shortened version (gld) of the <b>meter</b> used in <b>Book</b> II of her poetry. However, the surviving poetry also abounds in fragments in other meters, both stanzaic and stichic, some of them more complicated or uncertain in their metrical construction. Some fragments use meters from non-Aeolic traditions (e.g. dactylic hexameter, or the Ionic meter of Sappho fr. 134).|$|R
50|$|While Sappho used several {{metrical}} {{forms for}} her poetry, she is most {{famous for the}} Sapphic stanza. Her poems in this <b>meter</b> (collected in <b>Book</b> I of the ancient edition) ran to 330 stanzas, {{a significant part of}} her complete works (and of her surviving poetry: fragments 1-42). It is not clear if she created it or if it was already part of the Aeolic tradition; according to Marius Victorinus (Ars grammatica 6.161 Keil), it was invented by Alcaeus but then used more frequently by Sappho, and so is more strongly associated with her.|$|R
50|$|Herodotus in Book 1, Chapter 68, {{describes}} how the Spartans uncovered in Tegea the body of Orestes which was seven cubits long—around 10 feet (3 <b>meters).</b> In his <b>book</b> The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus Plutarch {{describes how}} the Athenians uncovered the body of Theseus, which was of more than ordinary size. The kneecaps of Ajax were exactly {{the size of a}} discus for the boy's pentathlon, wrote Pausanias. A boy's discus was about twelve centimeters in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around five centimeters, suggesting Ajax may have been around 14 feet (~4.3 meters) tall.|$|R
5000|$|The {{appendix}} of An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes {{presented the}} rudiments of music, instructions for tuning the voice, musical notation, intervals, scales, clefs, and <b>meter</b> signatures. The <b>book</b> became the prototype for numerous other books written during the 18th century. The third edition, published in 1726, is the earliest still in existence. It contained 37 English psalm tunes with two harmony voices. In Music and Musicians in Early America, pp. 53-55, Irving Lowens suggests that [...] "100 Psalm Tune New" [...] was probably written by Tufts. If so, {{it could be the}} first published composition by an American-born composer.|$|R
5000|$|Finchs poetry {{first found}} its first {{national}} readership in 1997 {{with the publication}} of her second book Eve (Story Line Press), a finalist for awards including the National Poetry Series and the Yale Series of Younger Poets, which drew attention from reviewers for its unexpected use of traditional forms and meters for feminist mythmaking and incantatory [...] "shapeshifting." [...] Her third book, Calendars (Tupelo Press, 2003), was shortlisted for the Foreword Poetry Book of the Year. [...] The Readers Guide released by Tupelo Press in 2010 notes 15 different <b>meters</b> in the <b>book</b> [...] Henry Taylor noted Finchs differences from the usual school of New Formalist poets in a review. Experimental poet Ron Silliman compared Finch to Robert Duncan and Bernadette Mayer, saying of Finch, [...] "her loyalty is to the language. She gets it.".|$|R
5000|$|Much of Finch's poetics {{centers on}} the role of {{repetition}} and pattern. In the title essay of her book of essays The Body of Poetry, Finch connects the use of poetic meter and form with Goddess spirituality. Other essays in the collection describe her own creative process, discuss translation and women's poetic traditions, and advocate for [...] "Metrical Diversity," [...] the idea that formal poetry is more versatile, effective, and eloquent when it encompasses other metrical patterns in addition to iambic <b>meter.</b> [...] Her <b>books</b> on writing poetry, such as An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets Celebrate the Diversity of Their Art, coedited with Kathrine Varnes, and A Poet's Craft: A Comprehensive Guide to Making and Sharing Your Poetry, which includes a guide to writing in meter and has been called [...] "nothing less than an MFA program in 600 pages", are assigned widely in university writing programs.|$|R
5000|$|Steele's {{two books}} on versification have {{attracted}} considerable attention. [...] Missing Measures: Modern Poetry and the Revolt Against Meter examines {{the ideas and}} conditions that led many poets, {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, to challenge poetry's traditional principles of rhythmical organization and to develop new forms of verse without the regular units of measure that had characterized earlier verse. Among other topics, the book explores the legacy of Aristotle's dual view of poetry as, on the one hand, a rhetorical art of metrical speech and, on the other hand, a mimetic art that does not necessarily involve <b>meter.</b> The <b>book</b> also examines the shift in Romantic aesthetics from the bellief that artists objectively represent the world outside them to the belief that they subjectively express their inner feelings. Another subject of discussion is the increasing prominence in imaginative literature, in the eighteenth century and afterwards, of prose forms like the novel. Yet another topic is the sense among modern poets and artists that the physical sciences have moved into the central position in culture and that the arts should, to keep up with science, adopt its methods and become [...] "experimental." [...] And the book documents the way a number of leading modern poets came to feel that meter itself was inextricably bound up with the dated idioms of Victorian verse and that to break with or reform Victorian style it was also necessary to break with or reform meter. More specifically, the book observes how free verse—originally regarded by the great early modern poets as a temporary expedient to bring new life into poetry and as a challenge to poets to think freshly about their art—ramified into increasingly divergent modes and became, over the course of the twentieth century, a predominant means of poetic expression.|$|R
