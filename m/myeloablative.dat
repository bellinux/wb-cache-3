40|$|PURPOSE: Retrospective {{studies have}} shown similar {{survival}} among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) after nonmyeloablative compared with <b>myeloablative</b> conditioning. Refined risk stratification is required to design prospective trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We stratified outcomes among patients with AML (n = 391) or MDS (n = 186) who received either nonmyeloablative (n = 125) or <b>myeloablative</b> (n = 452) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) based on comorbidities, as assessed by a HCT-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), as well as disease status. Patients receiving nonmyeloablative conditioning were older, more frequently pretreated, more often received unrelated grafts, and more often had HCT-CI scores of 3 compared with patients who received <b>myeloablative</b> conditioning. RESULTS: Patients with HCT-CI scores of 0 to 2 and either low or high disease risks had probabilities of overall survival at 2 years of 70 % and 57 % after nonmyeloablative conditioning compared with 78 % and 50 % after <b>myeloablative</b> conditioning, respectively. Patients with HCT-CI scores of 3 and either low or high disease risks had probabilities of overall survival of 41 % and 29 % with nonmyeloablative conditioning compared with 45 % and 24 % with <b>myeloablative</b> regimens, respectively.

Unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative graft source for patients without matched related donors (MRD); however, costs of UCB HCT have not been described. We compared the costs of HCT within the first 100 days among recipients of MRD (<b>myeloablative</b> = 67, nonmyeloablative = 54) or UCB (<b>myeloablative</b> = 63, nonmyeloablative = 110) HCT. Cost and hospitalization data {{were obtained from the}} institutional accounting department. The 100 -day probabilities of overall survival (OS) and cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) were comparable among 4 transplant types; however, neutrophil recovery was delayed and graft failure was more likely in UCB recipients. The median cost per day survived (excluding costs of graft acquisition) was $ 1016 for <b>myeloablative</b> MRD, $ 2082 for <b>myeloablative</b> UCB, $ 612 for nonmyeloablative MRD, and $ 1156 for nonmyeloablative UCB recipients, respectively (P 48 days; 2. 1 [1. 9 - 2. 3]).

Within the first 100 days, the absolute costs of <b>myeloablative</b> and nonmyeloablative UCB are higher than <b>myeloablative</b> and nonmyeloablative MRD transplantation.

Thirty-nine patients receiving nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) were compared with 97 patients receiving <b>myeloablative</b> transplantation. Patients receiving NST were at high risk for treatment-related complications given that they were older, 57 vs 43 years (P <. 001), and more likely had received previous or <b>myeloablative</b> transplantation (54 % vs 2 %; P <. 0001). The cumulative risk of relapse was higher for patients after NST (61 % vs 38 %; P =. 02). The 100 -day mortality was less after NST (15 % vs 32 %) Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 28 % for NST and 34 % for <b>myeloablative</b> transplantation (P =. 89). Progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years was 20 % for NST and 31 % for <b>myeloablative</b> transplantation (P =. 31).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{development}} of new treatment options, the prognosis of high-risk neuroblastoma patients is still poor; more than half of patients experience disease recurrence. High-dose chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell rescue (i. e. <b>myeloablative</b> therapy) might improve survival. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy with conventional therapy in children with high-risk neuroblastoma. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), MEDLINE/PubMed (1966 to January 2009) and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to January 2009). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy with conventional therapy in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. If possible, we pooled results. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs including 739 children. The meta-analysis of event-free survival showed a significant difference in favour of the <b>myeloablative</b> therapy group (HR 0. 78; 95 % CI 0. 67 to 0. 90), as did the meta-analysis of overall survival (HR 0. 74; 95 % CI 0. 57 to 0. 98). The meta-analysis of secondary malignant disease and treatment-related death did not show {{a significant difference between the}} treatment groups. In one study a significant difference in favour of the conventional therapy group was identified for renal effects, interstitial pneumonitis and veno-occlusive disease, whereas for serious infections and sepsis no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified. In the individual studies we evaluated different subgroups, but the results were not univocal in all studies. All studies had some methodological limitations. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the currently available evidence, <b>myeloablative</b> therapy seems to be a good treatment option for children with high-risk neuroblastoma. It results in higher survival rates than conventional therapy, although possible higher levels of adverse effects should be kept in mind. A definitive conclusion regarding the effect of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy in different subgroups is not possible. This systematic review only allows a conclusion on the concept of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy; no conclusions can be made regarding the best treatment strategy. Future trials on the use of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma should focus on identifying the most optimal induction and/or <b>myeloablative</b> regimen.

40|$|AbstractT-cell {{recovery}} following <b>myeloablative</b> preparatory regimens and {{cord blood}} transplantation in adult patients gen erally occurs between 1 and 3 years following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. T-cell reconstitution may involve thymic education of donor-derived precursors or peripheral expansion of mature T-cells transferred in the graft. We measured {{quantitative and qualitative}} immunologic reconstitution, T-cell receptor spectratyping, and T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) levels in adult recipients of umbilical cord blood transplants following a novel nonmyeloablative regimen. These results were compared to previously published results of similar patients receiving a <b>myeloablative</b> regimen and cord blood stem cells. With small numbers of patients treated so far, T-cells (CD 3 +) reached normal levels in adults 6 to 12 months following nonmyeloablative transplantation compared with 24 months in adults receiving a <b>myeloablative</b> regimen. At 12 months after transplantation, the numbers of phenotypically naive (CD 45 RA) T-cells were higher in those receiving the nonmyeloablative regimen. The T-cell repertoire in cord blood recipients treated with a nonmyeloablative regimen was markedly more diverse and robust compared with the repertoire in those receiving the <b>myeloablative</b> regimen at similar time points. TRECs (which are generated within the thymus and identify new thymic emigrants and those that have not divided) were detected 12 months after transplantation in the nonmyeloablative recipients, whereas TRECs were not detected in adults until 18 to 24 months in those receiving <b>myeloablative</b> regimens. Thus, in adults receiving a nonmyeloablative preparatory regimen, the quantitative and qualitative recovery of T-cells occurs through rapid peripheral expansion. The ability of patients receiving a nonmyeloablative regimen to recover {{within a few months}} suggests that the peripheral niches in which T-cells can proliferate are preserved in these patients compared to those receiving ablative regimens. Moreover, the presence of TREC-positive cells within 1 year suggests that thymic recovery is likewise accelerated in non <b>myeloablative</b> compared to <b>myeloablative</b> regimens.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of {{this article}} is to compare the {{differences}} in efficacy and toxicity between the various conditioning regimens for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies, all retrospective, that compare the impact of various different conditioning regimens amongst each other are presented. Reduced intensity conditioning apparently lowered transplant-related mortality in patients with minimal residual disease who were at high risk for treatment-related mortality.

In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles and the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) (from 2002 to 2011), American Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (ASPHO) (from 2002 to 2012), Advances in Neuroblastoma Research (ANR) (from 2002 to 2012) and American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (from 2008 to 2012). We searched for ongoing trials by scanning the ISRCTN register and the National Institute of Health Register ([URL] both screened July 2012). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy with conventional therapy in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. If appropriate, we pooled studies. The risk ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated for dichotomous outcomes. For the assessment of survival data, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % CI. We used Parmar's method if hazard ratios were not reported in the study. We used a random-effects model. We identified three RCTs including 739 children. They all used an age of one year as the cut-off point for pre-treatment risk stratification. The updated search identified a manuscript reporting additional follow-up data for one of these RCTs. There was a statistically significant difference in event-free survival in favour of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy over conventional chemotherapy or no further treatment (3 studies, 739 patients; HR 0. 78, 95 % CI 0. 67 to 0. 90). There was a statistically significant difference in overall survival in favour of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy over conventional chemotherapy or no further treatment (2 studies, 360 patients; HR 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 57 to 0. 98). However, when additional follow-up data were included in the analyses the difference in event-free survival remained statistically significant (3 studies. 739 patients; HR 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 70 to 0. 90), but the difference in overall survival was no longer statistically significant (2 studies, 360 patients; HR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 73 to 1. 01). The meta-analysis of secondary malignant disease and treatment-related death did not show any statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. Data from one study (379 patients) showed a significantly higher incidence of renal effects, interstitial pneumonitis and veno-occlusive disease in the <b>myeloablative</b> group compared to conventional chemotherapy, whereas for serious infections and sepsis {{no significant difference between the}} treatment groups was identified. No information on quality of life was reported. In the individual studies we evaluated different subgroups, but the results were not univocal in all studies. All studies had some methodological limitations. Based on the currently available evidence, <b>myeloablative</b> therapy seems to work in terms of event-free survival. For overall survival there is currently no evidence of effect when additional follow-up data are included. No definitive conclusions can be made regarding adverse effects and quality of life, although possible higher levels of adverse effects should be kept in mind. A definitive conclusion regarding the effect of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy in different subgroups is not possible. This systematic review only allows a conclusion on the concept of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy; no conclusions can be made regarding the best treatment strategy. Future trials on the use of <b>myeloablative</b> therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma should focus on identifying the most optimal induction and/or <b>myeloablative</b> regimen. The best study design to answer these questions is a RCT. These RCTs should be performed in homogeneous study populations (e. g. stage of disease and patient age) and have a long-term follow-up. Different risk groups, using the most recent definitions, should be taken into account. It should be kept in mind that recently the age cut-off for high risk disease was changed from one year to 18 months. As a result it is possible that patients with what is now classified as intermediate-risk disease have been included in the high-risk groups. Consequently the relevance of the results of these studies to the current practice can be questioned. Survival rates may be overestimated due to the inclusion of patients with intermediate-risk diseas...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs older {{patients}} {{are eligible for}} allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), older siblings are increasingly proposed as donors. We studied the impact of donor age on the tempo of hematopoietic engraftment and donor chimerism, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) among 1174 consecutive patients undergoing <b>myeloablative</b> and 367 patients undergoing nonmyeloablative HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors with granulocyte colony–stimulating factor–mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cell allografts. Sustained engraftment rates were 97 % and 98 % in patients undergoing <b>myeloablative</b> and nonmyeloablative conditioning, respectively, for grafts from donors < 60  years old (younger; n =  1416) and 98 % and 100 %, respectively, for those from donors ≥ 60  years old (older; n =  125). No significant differences were seen in the tempo of neutrophil and platelet recoveries and donor chimerism except for an average 1. 3 -day delay in neutrophil recovery among <b>myeloablative</b> patients with older donors (P = . 04). CD 34 + cell dose had an independent effect on the tempo of engraftment. Aged stem cells did not convey {{an increased risk of}} donor-derived clonal disorders after HCT. <b>Myeloablative</b> and nonmyeloablative recipients with older sibling donors had significantly less grade II to IV acute GVHD than recipients with grafts from younger unrelated donors. Rates of grade III and IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and NRM for recipients with older donors were not significantly different from recipients with younger donors. In conclusion, grafts from donors ≥ 60  years old do not adversely affect outcomes of allogeneic HCT compared with grafts from younger donors...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} granulomatous disease (CGD) with <b>myeloablative</b> bone marrow {{transplantation}} is considered risky. This study investigated complications and survival according to different risk factors present at transplantation. The outcomes of 27 transplantations for CGD, from 1985 to 2000, reported to the European Bone Marrow Transplant Registry for primary immunodeficiencies were assessed. Most transplant recipients were children (n = 25), received a <b>myeloablative</b> busulphan-based regimen (n = 23), and had unmodified marrow allografts (n = 23) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -identical sibling donors (n = 25). After <b>myeloablative</b> conditioning, all patients fully engrafted with donor cells; after myelosuppressive regimens, 2 of 4 patients fully engrafted. Severe (grade 3 or 4) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) disease developed in 4 patients: 3 of 9 with pre-existing overt infection, 1 of 2 with acute inflammatory disease. Exacerbation of infection during aplasia was observed in 3 patients; inflammatory flare at the infection site during neutrophil engraftment in 2 : all 5 patients belonged to the subgroup of 9 with pre-existing infection. Overall survival was 23 of 27, with 22 of 23 cured of CGD (median follow-up, 2 years). Survival was especially good in patients without infection {{at the moment of}} transplantation (18 of 18). Pre-existing infections and inflammatory lesions have cleared in all survivors (except in one with autologous reconstitution). <b>Myeloablative</b> conditioning followed by transplantation of unmodified hemopoietic stem cells, if performed at the first signs of a severe course of the disease, is a valid therapeutic option for children with CGD having an HLA-identical donor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractABO {{blood group}} {{incompatibility}} between {{donor and recipient}} {{has been associated with}} poor transplant outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, its effect on the outcome of cord blood transplantation (CBT) has yet to be clarified. We retrospectively analyzed 191 adult patients who received single-unit CBT after <b>myeloablative</b> conditioning for malignant disease in our institute. Major mismatch showed a significantly lower incidence of platelet engraftment compared with ABO match as a reference (hazard ratio,. 57; P = . 01). Nevertheless, there was no increase in graft-versus-host disease, transplant-related mortality, and overall mortality after ABO-incompatible CBT. These data suggested that donor–recipient ABO incompatibility does not {{have a significant impact on}} outcome after <b>myeloablative</b> CBT for hematological malignancies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{have been}} many changes in hemato-poietic stem cell {{transplantation}} (HSCT) that affect the patient’s nutrition support. In the early 1970 s, allogeneic transplants were the most common types of HSCTs; today, autologous transplants are the most common. Bone mar-row, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood all now serve as sources of stem cells. Conditioning therapies include <b>myeloablative,</b> reduced-intensity <b>myeloablative,</b> and nonmyeloablative regimens. New medications are being developed and used to minimize the toxicities of the conditioning therapy and to minimize infectious complica-tions. Supportive therapies for renal and liver complica-tions have changed. In the past, HSCT patients received parenteral nutrition (PN) throughout their hospitalization and sometimes as home therapy. Because of medica...|$|E
40|$|Allogeneic HSCT {{was first}} {{investigated}} in selected patients with advanced HD and proved that long-term survival improved for some patients who failed many other lines of therapy. There are 4 studies reporting <b>myeloablative</b> conditioning {{in preparation for}} allogeneic HSCT. Although overall survival was above 44 %, the high transplant-related mortality convinced most hematologists that allogeneic HSCT was not a real option for patients with HD. The development of reduced intensity conditioning regimens (RIC) in the late nineties, appeared {{as an opportunity to}} again test allogeneic HSCT in HD. RIC transplants are associated with significantly lower transplant mortality when compared to <b>myeloablative</b> transplants. However progression free survival is highly dependent on chemoresistance and performance status...|$|E
40|$|Ming Shi, Ming Li, Susumu IkeharaDepartment of Stem Cell Disorders, Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi City, Osaka, JapanAbstract: Bone marrow {{transplantation}} (BMT) {{has evolved}} into an effective strategy {{for the treatment of}} hematological and oncological disorders. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used as conditioning regimens prior to BMT to suppress host immunity and reduce tumor burden. High doses of total body irradiation are conventionally administered along with alkylating agents, ie, the <b>myeloablative</b> regimen, to help ensure rapid engraftment of donor cells and to prevent relapse. However, the toxicity of the <b>myeloablative</b> conditioning regimen and unacceptable nonrelapse mortality rules out this approach for older patients by whom less intense preparative regimens are likely to be better tolerated. The reduced-intensity and nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens have been demonstrated by many investigators to be novel approaches resulting in a lower nonrelapse mortality rate and lower incidence of severe acute graft versus host disease. Here, we review the conditioning regimens employed as a pretreatment for BMT, and focus on the novel conditioning regimens and cutting edge developments.

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) donor-specific antibodies (DSA) on cord blood (CB) engraftment is controversial. We evaluated the influence of pre-existing HLA-antibodies (HLA-Abs) on engraftment in 82 double-unit CB recipients (median age, 48 years) who underwent transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Of 28 patients (34 %) with HLA-Abs, 12 had DSA (median mean fluorescence intensity 5255; range, 1057 to 9453). DSA patients had acute leukemia (n = 11) or myelodysplasia (n = 1) and all received either high-dose or reduced-intensity (but <b>myeloablative)</b> conditioning. After <b>myeloablative</b> CB transplantation (CBT) (n = 67), sustained donor engraftment was observed in 95 % without HLA-Abs (median, 23 days), 100 % with nonspecific HLA-Abs (median, 23 days), and 92 % with DSA (median, 31 days, P =. 48). Of 6 patients with HLA-Abs to 1 unit, 3 engrafted with that unit and 3 with the other. Of 6 patients with HLA-Abs against both units, 1 had graft failure despite being 100 % donor, and 5 engrafted with 1 unit. Successful donor engraftment is possible in patients with DSA after <b>myeloablative</b> double-unit CBT. Our data suggest potential deleterious effects of DSA can be abrogated in patients with hematologic malignancies...|$|E
