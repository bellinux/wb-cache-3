50|$|Originally, Live at Max's Kansas City was {{a single}} album {{distillation}} of both sets re-sequenced and edited by Lou Reed and Atlantic staff producer Geoff Haslam to reflect the band's loud and quiet sides, respectively. On August 3, 2004, Warner Music re-issue label Rhino Records released a two-CD Deluxe Edition that contains both sets in their entirety in their original running order. The songs were recorded on a mono recorder using a simple ferro <b>musicassette</b> in a small venue, resulting in tape hiss and an audience often drowning out the quieter bits of music.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Quine, an avid Velvet Underground fan, used {{to travel}} to as many concerts as possible. He became friends with the band and they allowed him to record sets from the audience, {{occasionally}} asking for playbacks. Quine recorded many concerts, but as his original <b>musicassette</b> tapes began to wear out, he compiled four reels of what he considered the best material. These [...] "best-of" [...] reels were ultimately released in 2001 as the present The Quine Tapes set. The original musicassettes from which the reels were compiled no longer exist.|$|E
50|$|The ad hoc system {{relied on}} a system of trust, meaning that tapes were swapped {{in a kind of}} honor system; those who did not {{subscribe}} to this ethos and received tapes without returning the favor accordingly would become known as 'rip-offs' or 'rip-off traders' and were regarded with scorn. Flyers advertising gigs, recordings and other merchandises for sale were often swapped in conjunction with tape trading. Music that had been licensed to record companies (therefore subject to copyright) and released in the format of Vinyl records, CD and MC (<b>musicassette)</b> was also pirated onto blank compact cassette medium and traded, although this was in infringement of both unofficial 'rules' of the network and actual copyright law itself.|$|E
5000|$|Queens of Noise was {{released}} in January 1977 on three different formats: vinyl record, <b>Musicassette,</b> and Stereo 8 track tape. The cover features all five of The Runaways dressed in similar black shirts and pants, all [...] "clinging to long, metallic shafts" [...] in a design that Marianne Moro describes as a [...] "stripper pole album cover theme". The Runaways are partially obscured by smoke in the photograph that was used on the front cover of the album, which according to Fox was taken [...] "at the last moment before we all started choking". The back cover features a similar photograph that is posed differently and does not include any smoke, which Fox notes was originally intended to grace {{the front of the}} album, while the eventual front image was initially planned to be put on the back. After Fox suggested that the smoke-filled image would draw more attention {{on the front of the}} album, as well as noting the practical concern that it would not lend itself well to having the track listing and other notes printed over it, Mercury Records agreed and switched the covers.|$|E
