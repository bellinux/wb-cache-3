In this study, we report the cloning and {{characterization of the}} cDNA and the gene encoding the hyperglycemic hormone (MeCHH-B) of the <b>shrimp</b> <b>Metapenaeus</b> ensis. The amino acid sequence of MeCHH-B shows 85 % identity to that of MeCHH-A (formerly MeCHH-like neuropeptide). Two separate but identical MeCHH-B genes were identified in the genome of shrimp by library screening and they are located on different CHH gene clusters. The organization of the MeCHH-B gene is identical to {{other members of the}} CHH/MIH/GIH neurohormone family. MeCHH-B is expressed at a constant level in the eyestalks of juveniles and mature females. Unlike the MeCHH-A gene, a low level of MeCHH-B transcripts can also be detected in the central nervous system. Interestingly, the expression pattern of MeCHH-B in the eyestalk of vitellogenic females is reversed to that of the MeCHH-A gene. At the middle stage of gonad maturation, a minimum level of MeCHH-B transcript was recorded and a maximum level of MeCHH-A transcript was detected. Recombinant proteins for MeCHH-A and MeCHH-B were produced by a bacterial expression system. The hemolymph glucose level of bilaterally eyestalk-ablated shrimp increased two-fold 1 h after the rCHH injection and then returned to normal after 2 h.

A significant increase in ammonia-N excretion was observed when high-saline acclimated shrimps were abruptly exposed to different grades of low-saline media. Exposure to different grades of high-saline media {{on the other hand}} induced a significant decrease in ammonia excretion rate of low-saline acclimated shrimps. The O:N ratio (ratio of oxygen consumed to nitrogen excreted in atomic equivalents) showed a decreasing trend when the high-saline acclimated shrimps were abruptly exposed to low-saline media, indicating a shift towards protein dominated metabolism. A reverse trend could be observed in the O:N ratio when the shrimps were exposed to high-saline media indicating a shift towards lipid dominated metabolism in high salinities. Thus, {{there appears to be a}} shift in energy substrate utilization in these shrimps from protein dominated metabolism in low salinities (5 ‰, 10 ‰, 15 ‰ and 20 ‰) to lipid/carbohydrate dominated metabolism in high salinities (25 ‰, 30 ‰ and 35 ‰) ...|$|R

40|$|Methylfarnesoate (MF), an {{analogue}} of {{the insect}} juvenile hormone III, has been implicated {{to play a}} vital role in the regulation of the growth and reproductive development in crustaceans. Farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FAMeT) is the key enzyme involved in catalyzing the final step in the MF biosynthetic pathway. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of the cDNA encoding the putative FAMeT of the <b>shrimp</b> <b>Metapenaeus</b> ensis. FAMeT comprises 280 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 32 kDa. The predicted putative FAMeT protein reveals a high degree of structural conservation of FAMeT with the lobsters. It shares 79 and 70 % sequence identities with the putative FAMeTs of Homarus americanus and Panulirus interruptus, respectively. As revealed by the Southern blot analysis and genomic PCR, only one gene exists in the shrimp genome and the gene is uninterrupted in the coding region. The shrimp FAMeT mRNA is widely distributed in many tissues with the highest expression level observed in the central nervous system. A constant level of FAMeT expression is recorded in the ventral nerve cord of the juveniles and the mature females during the reproductive cycle. Unlike the ventral nerve cord, the eyestalk of the juvenile male, but not the female, expresses FAMeT. Further study shows that the eyestalk of the mature female expresses FAMeT during all stages of ovarian maturation. We spectulate that FAMeT may be important for the regulation of eyestalk neuropeptides.

The size of the cDNA is 4. 3 kb with the longest open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 545 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the shrimp cDNA consists of regions that are characteristic of those of the nuclear hormone receptors. It shows {{a high degree of}} amino acid sequence identity in the DNA binding domain, ligand binding domain and the FTZ box as compared to those of invertebrates and vertebrates. Unlike the insects Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori, an AF 2 transactivation domain was present in the shrimp FTZ-F 1. Northern blot analysis using total RNA indicated that the FTZ-F 1 mRNA could also be detected in the mature ovary. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR analysis showed that the shrimp FTZ-F 1 transcripts could be detected in the ovary, newly hatched nauplius, testis, eyestalk and epidermis of the adult shrimp. Although the cDNA clone was isolated from the eyestalk library, the shrimp FTZ-F 1 appeared to express most abundantly in the mature oocytes. The presence of abundant FTZ-F 1 specific maternal message in the late vitellogenic ovary and early nauplius indicates that it may be important for the early embryonic and larval development of the shrimp. Interestingly, shrimp FTZ-F 1 can also be found in testis of the male shrimp.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} experiments {{was conducted at}} Inhaca Island Marine Biological Station, Mozambique, {{in order to assess}} the separate effects of turbidity, prey density, substrate type, pneumatophore density, and the combined effects of turbidity with the latter three, on rate of predation by the thorn fish Terapon jarbua (Forskål, 1775) on white shrimp Penaeus indicus and brown <b>shrimp</b> <b>Metapenaeus</b> monoceros. Significant interactions between turbidity and the other three factors on shrimp predation for both prey species were detected. Regardless of prey density, increasing turbidity decreased predation on P. indicus, but not on M. monoceros, for which increasing densities reduced the protective effect of turbidity. Increasing prey density increased predation on P. indicus in clear water, and increased predation on M. monoceros in low and high, but not in intermediate turbidity or clear water. The presence of a substrate suitable for burying decreased predation on M. monoceros in clear water, but not in the turbidity levels used. In clear water, solely sandy-shell substrate afforded protection to P. indicus, while in turbid water, no substrate offered significant protection and muddy substrate even increased prey vulnerability to fish probably as a result of increased preys' locomotor activity. Raising pneumatophores density seems to lower the protective value of turbidity for both species. In clear water, only low and high structure density provided a deterrent effect on predation on P. indicus; in turbid water, intermediate and higher structure density increased predation. Increasing structural complexity reduced predation on M. monoceros linearly in clear water; but in low turbid water it increased. In high turbid waters, the increase was only significant in intermediate pneumatophore density. High structural complexities impair the pursuing capacity of fish and thus decreased predation rates. The results indicate that the effective provision of shelter of different habitats depends not only on the various environmental parameters analysed, but also on the way they interact and on the behaviour of prey and predator as well...|$|R
40|$|The Sofala Bank in {{the western}} Mozambique Channel is an {{essential}} habitat for shallow-water penaeid shrimps. It supports an important multi-sector and -species fishery, with Fenneropenaeus indicus and <b>Metapenaeus</b> monoceros (banana <b>shrimp)</b> being the two main target species. Over the past decade this valuable resource has been declining, which {{has been attributed to}} environmental changes, but no conclusive evidence has been found. This PhD thesis aims to understand the interactive roles of biophysical processes on recruitment of banana shrimps, par ticularly their larvae on the Sofala Bank. It is hypothesized that shrimp larvae can be advected offshore by passing mesoscale eddies to regions where they are unable to survive and are thus lost. In the absence of both physical and biological observations, a modelling approach is used. A high-resolution, nested, coastal, Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) of the Sofala Bank is developed. In general, the model agrees well with available observations and literature. The ROMS outputs and self-organizing map analysis indicate that the shelf circulation, structure and river plumes are strongly influenced by the highly energetic o_shore eddy activity. A biophysical, individual-based model (IBM) coupled to the ROMS was developed for early life stages of banana shrimps on the Sofala Bank. The IBM uses spawning patterns identified from analyses of both commercial and research survey data. Simulations indicate that shrimp larvae are lost offshore by entrainment in mesoscale eddies at inter- and intra-annual scales and eddies therefore are unlikely to produce a continuous declining in the catch. In contrast, these eddies induce onshore transport of larvae, promoting coastal settlement, compared with periods without eddies. Locations for simulated larval coastal settlement are identified: northern, central and southern. The roles of tides and larval diel vertical migration in influencing simulated larval settlement success was not conclusive; further research considering a selective tidal stream is needed. Simulated larvae were sensitive to low lethal temperature and river plumes. A conceptual model for the Sofala Bank circulation and another for the banana shrimps, early life history dynamics are proposed {{based on the results of}} this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} habitat {{structure}} and substratum on predation of the greasyback <b>shrimp</b> <b>Metapenaeus</b> ensis (De Haan), white shrimp Penaeus merguiensis De Man and tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon Fabricius by sea bass Lates calcarifer Bloch and mangrove snapper Lutjanus argentimaculatus (Forsskal) was evaluated. The shrimp juveniles measured 6 â€“ 15 mm in carapace length; fish measured 6. 5 â€“ 12. 5 cm in standard length; structure types were pneumatophores of the mangrove Sonneratia griffithii Kurz and dried coconut leaf bracts; structure densities were 0, 32 and 98 pneumatophores per tank; and sediment particle sizes were pebbles, sand-granules and siltâ€“sand. Predation on shrimp {{was significantly higher}} in controls or bare sand (48. 7 %) than among pneumatophores (29. 9 %), but not among leaf bracts (43. 5 %). Shrimp mortality was also significantly higher on bare sand (72. 9 %) compared to medium-density (54. 2 %), but not high-density (68. 8 %), pneumatophores. Fish predation on the burying shrimp M. ensis was affected by predator type but not by sediment size. The generally higher predation rates of snapper {{may be due to}} their habit of leaving unconsumed pieces of shrimp, whereas sea bass which devour whole prey require fewer shrimp to reach satiation. Moreover, the presence of structures did not affect sea bass behaviour of chasing prey among pneumatophores and under leaf bracts, but reduced predation by the relatively passive snapper. Predation rates among pneumatophores vs. control, and among medium-density pneumatophores vs. bare sand, were lower for P. monodon but not P. merguiensis. This {{may be related to the}} greater and more frequent use of (laboratory) shelters by juvenile tiger shrimp compared to white shrimp. The results demonstrate that the effective provision of shelter depends not only on structure type and density but on the behaviour of predator and prey as well. The use of mangrove structures (pneumatophores) by juvenile shrimp as refuge from predation is also documented for the first time...|$|R

Another study off the coast of Tarsus, Turkey, found the most important dietary component to be the penaeid <b>shrimp</b> <b>Metapenaeus</b> stebbingi, followed by the pistol shrimp Alpheus glaber and the swimming crab Charybdis longicollis; cephalopods were relatively important for males, while fishes were important for females. Common stingrays have been observed closely following each other in the presence of food, possibly to take advantage of other individuals' foraging success.Like other stingrays, the common stingray is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are initially sustained by yolk, which is later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk", enriched with proteins, fat, and mucus) delivered by the mother through numerous extensions of the uterine epithelium called trophonemata. Females bear two litters of 4-9 pups per year in shallow inshore waters, following a gestation period of four months. Various authors have generally reported birthing in summer, between May and September or over a narrower timeframe such as July to August. Mature rays are known to aggregate off the Balearic Islands from mid-June to July, possibly for reproductive purposes. Newborns measure about 8 cm across and 20 cm long. Males reach sexual maturity at 22 - 32 cm across, and females at 24 - 38 cm across. The oldest known individual from the wild was ten years of age, but the species has lived up to 21 years in captivity. Known parasites of the common stingray include the flukes Heterocotyle pastinacae and Entobdella diadema, and the tapeworm Scalithrium minimum.|$|R
50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Metapenaeus</b> affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} survey the {{prevalence}} of some infectious diseases e. g. Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) in white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) populations and {{to assess the impact}} of such infectious agents to indigenous aquatic animals in Thailand. Samples of both larval and juvenile or adult shrimp from each region of the country were collected and screened for TSV and IHHNV using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Viruses isolated from affected shrimp were used for determine the susceptibility to infection of some aquatic species native to Thailand. A total of 163 samples of larval shrimp from hatcheries were screened. The results showed infection with TSV and IHHNV in 3. 68 and 44. 17 %, respectively. As high as 7. 32 % TSV infection was detected in shrimp samples collected from the South Eastern coast, followed by the Eastern and Central regions with percentages of 5. 56 and 4. 53, respectively. Shrimp with the highest rate of IHHNV infection, 55. 56 % were collected from the Eastern region. A total of 192 samples of shrimp reared in grow-out ponds were also collected. The results showed shrimp were infected with TSV and IHHNV with percentages of 6. 67 and 67. 19, respectively. The highest prevalence of IHHNV (up to 90 %) was found in samples collected from the lower Southern region. The highest prevalence of TSV infection (11. 29 %) was reported in shrimp from the Central region. A study of the susceptibility to TSV and IHHNV infection of some indigenous aquatic species of Thailand was also carried out. The results showed many aquatic species native to Thailand e. g. black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), speckled <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Metapenaeus</b> monoceros), dwarf prawn (Macrobrachium equideus), krill (Acetes sp.), mantis lobster (Chloridopsis immaculatus), freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium lanchesteri and M. rosenbergii), mangrove crab (Sesarma sp.) and mud crab (Scylla serrata) were susceptible to viruses and died due to infection. The mortality of affected species associated with a causative agent was confirmed in most species, except the mud crab and freshwater prawn (Marcrobrachium rosenbergii). However, viral particles can be still detected in surviving animals 10 days after infection. The results of this study will be a helpful tool employed in establishing measures on disease control and reduction of risk with the importation of white shrimp broodstock...|$|R

40|$|The desert locust, S. gregaria {{exhibits}} a rather fascinatingtype of phenotypic plasticity. In response to changing population densities, these animals can develop in two distinct phases: solitarious (scattered and shy) or gregarious (swarming) locusts. Crop loss caused by swarming locusts was already described in ancient texts {{such as the}} Bible and the Quran. Even today, they can still invade one fifth of the worlds land surface, {{including some of the}} worlds poorest countries and affect the livelihood of one tenth of the human population. Control is still reliant on the spraying of non-selective insecticides over very large areas. Because their use also has negative effects on non-target organisms and the environment, finding and screening new targets for selective locust control remain crucial. The classic insect hormones, juvenile hormone and 20 -hydroxyecdysone are key players in many physiological processes in insects. In locusts they have been implicated in several aspects of developmental and reproductive physiology as well as in phase transition. Recent breakthroughs in the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways of the classic insect hormones have offered new and exciting possibilities to examine their role in locust life. The general aim of this thesis was to improve the insights into the upstream elements of classic insect hormone biosynthesis in the desert locust, which will hopefully one day lead to safer, more selective and effective locust control strategies. In D. melanogaster, M. sexta and B. mori the Halloween genes (Spo, Phm, Dib, Sad and Shd) were functionally characterised. These genes were found to encode cytochrome P 450 enzymes involved in the final steps of the 20 E biosynthetic pathway. Orthologs of Spo (involved in the rate-limiting black box), Phm (encoding a 25 -hydroxylase) and Shd (encoding a 20 -hydroxylase) were partially cloned in S. gregaria. Additionally an orthologof Cyp 6 h 1, previously suggested to encode a 20 -hydroxylase in L. migratoria was identified. Q-RT-PCR profiling, ecdysteroid measurements and an RNAi study were performed to obtain indications to verify the function of these genes in the desert locust. The spatial expression profiles of SgSpo, SgPhm and SgShd seem to be very similar to the ones described for the previously characterised dipteran and lepidopteran Halloween genes. And although little is known on the temporal expression of these genes in maturing adult female insects, the transcript levels of SgSpo, SgPhm and SgShd seem to correlate well with the developing ovaries and oocytes, as is expected since ecdysteroids {{play a major role in}} this process. Moreover, the mRNA levels of SgSpo, SgPhm and SgShd were shown to correlate well withthe circulating ecdysteroid titers in the haemolymph measured with an EIA. A relatively high SgCyp 6 h 1 transcript level, on the otherhand, was measured in the female fat body and did not correlate with the circulating ecdysteroid titer in adult females. During the RNAi experiment, the relative mRNA levels of SgSpo, SgPhm, SgShd and SgCyp 6 h 1 were shown to be significantly downregulated at different time points measured in the PG and Malpighian tubules of the fifth larval instar. The simultaneous downregulation of SgSpo and SgPhm appeared to significantly influence the circulating ecdysteroid titer, although no visible disruptions of the moulting process were observed. Likewise, the downregulation of SgShd caused a lower 20 E level in the treated animals and a build-up of its precursor E, but no visible moulting difficulties or delays were observed. Major breakthroughs were also realised in the elucidation of the JH biosynthetic pathway. Two genes, JHAMT and CYP 15 A 1  previously reported to be involved in the finalsteps of JH biosynthesis in several insect species  were characterisedin the desert locust. Additionally, a S. gregaria ortholog of FAMeT (originally suggested to encode a FA methyltransferase in the <b>shrimp,</b> <b>Metapenaeus</b> ensis) was identified. Q-RT-PCR profiling demonstrated these orthologs to be mainly expressed in the CA. Temporal expression profiling of these genes during fifth larval and adult development hinted at a similar role for SgJHAMT and SgCYP 15 A 1 (as was previously described). Moreover, the results of the RNAi experiment clearly demonstrated that SgJHAMT and SgCYP 15 A 1 encode a functional FA methyltransferase and a MF epoxidase respectively. However, our study did not show any involvement of SgFAMeT in JH biosynthesis. Thanks to the functional characterisation of these Halloween gene orthologs and orthologs for the genes involved in the final steps of JH biosynthesis, interesting molecular tools are now available to further investigate the role of the classic insect hormones in the development, reproduction and phase transition of the desert locust. Moreover, high-throughput assay development andcompound library screening for effective blockers of these Halloween and JH synthesizing genes can possibly one day lead to safe andeffective locust control strategies. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Another {{important}} gene, {{heat shock}} factor (MeHSF) was also cloned using homology based PCR {{because it was}} suggested {{to participate in the}} transcriptional regulation of many essential components of ovarian maturation including vitellogenin gene and several proteins for hormones metabolism. The complete cDNA sequence of MeHSF was 2211 bp in length, which encoded a 622 amino acid protein. The translated MeHSF protein shared high similarity with those of other species, especially in the N terminal region. RT-PCR showed that MeHSF was universally expressed in most of the female tissues investigated including ovary, central nervous system, heart, gill, gut and muscle. However, its expression was not detectable in eyestalk and hepatopancreas. MeHSF was highly expressed in immature ovaries, and decreased dramatically with the progress of ovarian maturation. Since the synthesis of vitellogenin in ovary showed an opposite trend, the result suggested that MeHSF probably functioned as a transcriptional repressor to vitellogenin. Four HSFs isoforms generated from alternative splicing were obtained in immature ovaries, suggesting a possible universal role of HSF in coordinating transcription of different target genes during shrimp ovarian maturation. As an important component of enzymatic scavenger systems, glutathione peroxidases (GPx) play important roles in maintaining the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cellular scavenging ability. In this research, a full length GPx gene (MeGPx) which had been identified using RAP-PCR previously was cloned and characterized. MeGPx might play a pivotal role in preventing oocytes from oxidative damage and balancing ROS production. The present data on shrimp GPx provides insights on the regulation of ROS in the ovarian maturation process. Four candidate genes possibly participating in the regulation of ovarian maturation were obtained by random sequencing the libraries, including metallothionein, two zinc finger proteins and member 4 of wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT 4). The zinc finger protein containing a plant homeodomain, was only expressed in the eyestalk of female with immature ovaries, but not that of female with early mature and mature ovaries. The full length cDNA sequence of shrimp WNT 4 gene (MeWNT 4) was obtained using RACE technique. RT-PCR showed that the expression of MeWNT 4 in eyestalk decreased with the maturation of shrimp ovaries. Interestingly, MeWNT 4 was strongly expressed in the central nervous system and gut of both female and male shrimp. It was suggested that WNT 4 could antagonize the testis determining factor (SRY), and play an essential role in suppressing the formation of testis, and at the same time, controlling of female development. Thus, the identification WNT 4 from crustacean would contribute to our understanding on the sex determination mechanism. In this thesis, two genes, heat shock protein 90 and heat shock factor, possibly playing important roles in shrimp ovarian maturation were identified and characterized. Shrimp farming plays an important economic role in Southeast Asian countries. Yet further development of this industry is seriously restricted by the environmental deterioration and the prevalence of fetal diseases. Moreover, the failure of sexual maturation of cultured female shrimp forms a bottleneck to the further development of shrimp aquaculture. With the aim to produce shrimp without totally depending on the wild stocks, many studies have been focused on the endocrine regulation of shrimp ovarian maturation. In order to enhance our understanding on the molecular events occurred during ovarian maturation, in this research, several candidate genes are identified, and their potential roles in ovarian maturation are studied in the <b>shrimp</b> <b>Metapenaeus</b> ensis. Since heat shock protein 90 gene is one of the essential components of steroid hormone signal cascades in vertebrates, it was cloned and isolated by homology cloning strategy. The complete cDNA sequence of shrimp Hsp 90 (MeHsp 90) was 2524 by in length, which encoded a 720 amino acid polypeptide. The MeHsp 90 coding region was interrupted by four introns. MeHsp 90 was differentially expressed in eyestalk, ovary and hepatopancreas at different ovarian maturation stages, and consistently expressed in other tissues including heart, gill, gut, muscle and central nervous system. In vitro ovary explant assay revealed that MeHsp 90 expression in immature ovary could be induced by the addition of exogenous estradio 1 - 17 beta. MeHsp 90 was highly expressed in pre-vitellogenic oocytes, and its expression decreased with the progress of maturation, and finally stopped in late-vitellogenic oocytes. The co-regulation of MeHsp 90 and vitellogenin by estrogen hormone suggested a possible regulatory role of Hsp 90 in vitellogenin synthesis of the shrimp. Wu, Long Tao. "May 2008.
