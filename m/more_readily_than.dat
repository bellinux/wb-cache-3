5|$|Plant species often {{hybridize}} <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> animal species, and {{the resulting}} hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species {{are the result of}} hybridization, combined with polyploidy, which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.|$|E
5|$|In the second, mild {{protection}} scheme, A and dA {{are protected}} with isobutyryl or phenoxyacetyl groups (PAC). C and dC bear acetyl protection, and G and dG are protected with 4-isopropylphenoxyacetyl (iPr-PAC) or dimethylformamidino (dmf) groups. Mild protecting groups are removed <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> the standard protecting groups. However, the phosphoramidites bearing {{these groups are}} less stable when stored in solution.|$|E
5|$|Excluding {{insects and}} other arthropods, 192 exotic animal species have {{established}} themselves in Florida as of 2009. More than 50 {{species of fish}} have been introduced. Early recorded species were the pike killifish (Belonesox belizanus) and oscar (Astronotus ocellatus). The extensive network of canals throughout South Florida allows many species to disperse <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> they would under natural conditions as many regions in the Everglades go dry each year or experience extended drought periods. The overall impact of exotic fishes on the native populations and habitats is largely unknown.|$|E

5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> wrought iron, but {{is cheaper}} and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with {{small amounts of}} manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
50|$|In this pathway, (C5Me5)2Sm(OEt2) is {{used since}} it is <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> {{available}} <b>than</b> (C5Me5)3Sm and does not react THF.|$|R

50|$|If {{the mixture}} is acidic, DNA will {{precipitate}} into the organic phase while RNA remains in the aqueous phase due to DNA being <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> neutralised <b>than</b> RNA.|$|R
5|$|Representing {{the first}} fully {{professional}} football {{competition in the}} world the league saw its early years dominated by teams from the North and Midlands, where professionalism was embraced <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> in the South. Its status as the country's pre-eminent league was strengthened in 1892, when the rival Football Alliance was absorbed into the Football League. Former Alliance clubs comprised the bulk of a new Second Division, from which promotion to the top level could be gained. It was not until 1931 that a Southern club were crowned champions, when Herbert Chapman's Arsenal secured the title. Arsenal scored 127 goals in the process, a record for a title-winning side (though runners-up Aston Villa scored one goal more, a record for the top division).|$|E
25|$|The second {{substitution}} reaction (on the right) is slower {{because the}} first nitro group is deactivating. Conversely, if an activating group (electron-donating) was introduced (e.g., alkyl), a second substitution reaction would occur <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> {{the first and the}} disubstituted product might accumulate to a significant extent.|$|E
25|$|Grasslands burn <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> {{forest and}} shrub ecosystems, {{with the fire}} moving through the stems and leaves of {{herbaceous}} plants and only lightly heating the underlying soil, even in cases of high intensity. In most grassland ecosystems, fire is the primary mode of decomposition, making it crucial in the recycling of nutrients.|$|E
30|$|The {{condition}} ζ _n^i∈Γ _n^i is <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> applicable <b>than</b> {{requiring that}} Tx is proximinal and weakly closed for each x, and then, computing ζ _n=P_Tx_nx_n at each iterative step.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes, {{especially}} for aggregate data, expenditure data is <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> available <b>than</b> quantity data. For these cases, we can formulate the indices {{in terms of}} relative prices and base year expenditures, rather than quantities.|$|R
50|$|The data {{above are}} derived from {{laboratory}} studies of A. planci, which are much <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> obtained <b>than</b> equivalent data from the field. The laboratory observations, however, accord with the limited field observations of life-cycle.|$|R
25|$|In electrophilic {{aromatic}} substitution reactions, naphthalene reacts <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> benzene. For example, chlorination and bromination of naphthalene proceeds {{without a}} catalyst to give 1-chloronaphthalene and 1-bromonaphthalene, respectively. Likewise, whereas both benzene and naphthalene can be alkylated using Friedel–Crafts reactions, naphthalene {{can also be}} easily alkylated by reaction with alkenes or alcohols, using sulfuric or phosphoric acid catalysts.|$|E
25|$|Rhenium {{prefers to}} enter sulfides <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> osmium. Hence, during melting of the mantle, rhenium is {{stripped}} out, and prevents the osmium–osmium ratio from changing appreciably. This locks in an initial osmium {{ratio of the}} sample {{at the time of}} the melting event. Osmium–osmium initial ratios are used to determine the source characteristic and age of mantle melting events.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{are seen}} in rootability and {{flowering}} and {{can be seen in}} the same mature tree. Juvenile cuttings taken from the base of a tree will form roots much <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> cuttings originating from the mid to upper crown. Flowering close to the base of a tree is absent or less profuse than flowering in the higher branches especially when a young tree first reaches flowering age.|$|E
50|$|Since they're roughly 1/32 in scale, and {{are cheaper}} and <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> {{available}} <b>than</b> the figures purpose-manufactured for the hobby, Homies and Gonzales' other figures are sometimes {{used in the}} scenery of slot car layouts.|$|R
50|$|In some respects, {{dendritic}} cells cultured {{in vitro}} {{do not show}} the same behaviour or capability as dendritic cells isolated ex vivo. Nonetheless, they are often used for research as they are still much <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> available <b>than</b> genuine DCs.|$|R
40|$|The {{amounts of}} firmly bound γ-globulin (i. e. {{resistant}} to elution by Tyrode's solution) showed marked differences when {{the absorption of}} various heterologous γ-globulins on chopped guinea-pig lung was compared [Sheep>pig>bovine>horse>human>rabbit]. This suggests that non-sensitizing γ-globulins were <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> adsorbed <b>than</b> the sensitizing γ-globulins...|$|R
25|$|At this time, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that either surgery or beam radiation has an advantage over the other in this regard, the lower death rates reported with surgery appear to occur because surgery is more likely to be offered to younger men with less serious forms of cancer. Insufficient information is available to determine whether seed radiation extends life <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> the other treatments, but data so far do not suggest that it does.|$|E
25|$|Sulbutiamine (brand name: Arcalion) is a {{synthetic}} derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1). As a dimer of two modified thiamine molecules, it is a lipophilic compound that crosses the blood–brain barrier <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> thiamine {{and increases the}} levels of thiamine and thiamine phosphate esters in the brain. Sulbutiamine was discovered in Japan {{in an effort to}} develop more useful thiamine derivatives since it was hoped that increasing the lipophilicity of thiamine would result in better pharmacokinetic properties.|$|E
25|$|Guanine can be hydrolyzed {{with strong}} acid to glycine, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. First, guanine gets deaminated to become xanthine. Guanine oxidizes <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> adenine, the other purine-derivative base in DNA. Its {{high melting point}} of 350°C {{reflects}} the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the oxo and amino groups in the molecules in the crystal. Because of this intermolecular bonding, guanine is relatively insoluble in water, but it is soluble in dilute acids and bases.|$|E
50|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of methane to methanol {{has long been}} sought as a route to methanol. This route is effected by enzymes such as methane monooxygenases but commercial routes remain elusive because of the tendency for over-oxidation, i.e., methanol is <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> oxidized <b>than</b> methane.|$|R
50|$|Type 440C - has the {{greatest}} amount of carbon of the Type 440 variants. Strongest and considered more desirable in knifemaking than the Type 440A variant, except for diving or other salt-water applications. This variant is also <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> available <b>than</b> other variants of Type 440.|$|R
50|$|His {{questioning}} of the political, social, and economic scenes in contemporary Mali is evident in how AIDS, wars, ecological issues, human rights, and globalization affects all aspects of life and individuals within society. Much of his large-scale work is textile-based, a medium that is <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> available <b>than</b> paints.|$|R
25|$|In most {{organosilicon}} compounds, Si is tetravalent with tetrahedral molecular geometry. Carbon–silicon bonds {{compared to}} carbon–carbon bonds are longer (186 pm vs. 154 pm) and weaker with bond dissociation energy 451 kJ/mol vs. 607 kJ/mol. The C–Si bond is somewhat polarised towards carbon due to carbon's greater electronegativity (C 2.55 vs Si 1.90). The Si–C bond {{can be broken}} <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> typical C–C bonds. One manifestation of bond polarization in organosilanes {{is found in the}} Sakurai reaction. Certain alkyl silanes can be oxidized to an alcohol in the Fleming–Tamao oxidation.|$|E
25|$|The UUA {{is not a}} {{denomination}} in {{the traditional}} sense; the UUA is an association of congregations with no one organization able to speak authoritatively for the whole. It is the congregations that have authority over the larger body, through the annual General Assembly of the Unitarian Universalist Association. Since the general public understands denomination much <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> association of congregations, the distinction is generally omitted in conversation. Because of this relationship between the congregations and the association, Unitarian Universalist congregations have a congregationalist polity of governance. However, day-to-day decisions are made by the president, the moderator, and the Board of Trustees.|$|E
25|$|Dry sockets more {{commonly}} {{occur in the}} mandible than the maxilla, due to the relatively poor blood supply of the mandible and also because food debris tends to gather in lower sockets <b>more</b> <b>readily</b> <b>than</b> upper ones. It {{more commonly}} occurs in posterior sockets (molar teeth) than anterior sockets (premolars and incisors), possibly because {{the size of the}} created surgical defect is relatively larger, and because the blood supply is relatively poorer at these sites. Dry socket is especially associated with extraction of lower wisdom teeth. Inadequate irrigation (washing) of the socket has been associated with increased likelihood of dry socket.|$|E
40|$|Since November 2002 the University Library in Munich {{has been}} {{offering}} a publication server {{for all kinds}} of scientific publications.
