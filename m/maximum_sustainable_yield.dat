40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} exploitation {{status of}} the stocks of demersal fishes in Omani artisanal fisheries.

25|$|Salmon are carnivorous. They are fed a meal {{produced}} from catching other wild {{fish and other}} marine organisms. Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish. Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product. To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them. As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, {{at a time when}} 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yield.</b> The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.|$|E

2500|$|In ecology, {{resilience}} is {{the capacity}} of an ecosystem {{to respond to a}} perturbation or disturbance by resisting damage and recovering quickly. Such perturbations and disturbances can include stochastic events such as fires, flooding, windstorms, insect population explosions, and human activities such as deforestation, fracking of the ground for oil extraction, [...] pesticide sprayed in soil, and the introduction of exotic plant or animal species. Disturbances of sufficient magnitude or duration can profoundly affect an ecosystem and may force an ecosystem to reach a threshold beyond which a different regime of processes and structures predominates. Human activities that adversely affect ecosystem resilience such as reduction of biodiversity, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, land use, and anthropogenic climate change are increasingly causing regime shifts in ecosystems, often to less desirable and degraded conditions. Interdisciplinary discourse on resilience now includes consideration of the interactions of humans and ecosystems via socio-ecological systems, and the need for shift from the <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yield</b> paradigm to environmental resource management which aims to build ecological resilience through [...] "resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance".|$|E

The key idea is that a periodically time-dependent IDE can be transformed into the state-dependent IDE. As applications of our theory, the optimization problems in population dynamics are studied. That is, the <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yields</b> of single population models with periodically impulsive constant harvesting are discussed. Furthermore, we apply these results to the studies of the order- 1 periodic solutions and their stability of a single population model with stage structure in which the mature is impulsively proportionally harvested while the immature is impulsively added with the constant...|$|R

50|$|Biological {{reference}} points {{are the primary}} output of stock assessments and fishing regulations are set to meet these biological benchmarks. There are several types of benchmarks are used depending on the preference of the regulating agency. The benchmarks are used to control {{different aspects of the}} fishery or population. Benchmarks that regulate fishing mortality include Fcurr, Fmsy, Emsy, and MFMT. Fcurr is the current level of fishing mortality, Fmsy is the fishing mortality that produces the <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yield,</b> and Emsy is the expected level of fishing that will produce the <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yield.</b> SSBcurr, SSBmsy, and MSST are used in the regulation of biomass levels. SSBcurr stands for the current spawning stock biomass, SSBmsy is the amount of spawning stock biomass needed to produce the <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yield,</b> and MSST is the minimum standing stock threshold. The amount that is available to be harvested is controlled by the benchmarks MSY and OY. MSY is the <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yield</b> and OY is the optimum yield of a stock.

50|$|In {{population}} ecology and economics, <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yield</b> or MSY is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) {{that can be}} taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period. Fundamental to the notion of sustainable harvest, the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely. Under the assumption of logistic growth, resource limitation does not constrain individuals’ reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small. At intermediate population densities, also represented by half the carrying capacity, individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate. At this point, called the <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yield,</b> there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals. Above this point, density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity. At this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero. The <b>maximum</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>yield</b> is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield.|$|E
40|$|Fish landing data {{collected}} by the Kenyan Fisheries Department from the nearshort coastal marine waters from 1985 to 1994 were statistically analyzed to determine trends in the traditional fisher's catch.

Lutjanidae, Scaridae, Carangidae, Scombridae and Mullidae. 1994 registercd the lowest catch over ten years.

40|$|Fisheries {{management}} approach of several countries, {{including those in}} the Indian Ocean region, has been generally on a species-to-species basis.
