50|$|The {{proliferation}} of multiple communications technologies has itself created {{the need to}} combine them effectively, resulting in a new technology, unified communications. This technique blends instant <b>messaging,</b> e-mail, voice <b>mail,</b> short <b>message</b> <b>service,</b> web-conferencing, fax, audio, video, cellphone, VIOP and other telecommunications services into a single system. Cooke Aquaculture Inc. of Blacks Harbour New Brunswick uses just such a system, developed by Cisco Systems Canada Co. to manage its fish farm operations.|$|R

50|$|A {{receptionist}} is {{an employee}} taking an office or administrative support position. The work is usually {{performed in a}} waiting area such as a lobby or front office desk of an organization or business. The title receptionist is attributed {{to the person who}} is employed by an organization to receive or greet any visitors, patients, or clients and answer telephone calls. The term front desk is used in many hotels for an administrative department where a receptionist's duties also may include room reservations and assignment, guest registration, cashier work, credit checks, key control as well as <b>mail</b> and <b>message</b> <b>service.</b> Such receptionists are often called front desk clerks. Receptionists cover many areas of work to assist the businesses they work for, including setting appointments, filing, record keeping, and other office tasks.|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{powerful}} hand-held devices {{and the desire}} for communication on the move, are the driving forces behind an emerging technology called mobile computing. Today, mobile computing users are being provided with applications such as electronic <b>mail,</b> short <b>message</b> <b>service</b> (SMS) and calendar/diary programs. Observing the growing demands of roaming users, it can be predicted that the next generation (3 G and beyond) wireless networks will be burdened with bandwidth-intensive trac generated by personal multimedia applications such as web browsing, traveler information systems, video and games. However, the available resources (e. g. bandwidth) for supporting such applications is extremely limited. Additionally, mobility of users poses a signicant challenge {{due to the fact that}} the the resource requirements in the network could be quite unpredictable. Therefore, proper management of bandwidth and hence ecient schemes for quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning between the end-systems are necessary to accommodate the envisaged high-bandwidth multimedia services. Until now, research and the current day technology has only identied the bottlenecks to provide QoS in wireless networks. Although various frameworks for QoS provisioning at various layers of the network protocol stack have been proposed, there exists a plenty of challenges and issues that need to be tackled before the next generation wireless multimedia networks are widely used in practice...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} threats to the E-mail <b>service</b> are <b>message</b> loops, <b>mail</b> <b>messages</b> which {{endlessly}} circulate between a number of E-mail relays and severely deteriorate or even interrupt the <b>messaging</b> <b>service.</b> Although the standards ruling E-mail communications include mechanisms to prevent message loops, these mechanisms are often unimplemented and, if they are, can fail to work reliably under certain circumstances. This paper describes a novel approach to the automatic and reliable elimination of looping messages. Statistical properties of the message traffic are analyzed to detect messages that might be looping. Such messages are earmarked, {{and if they are}} observed to actually be looping, they are eliminated. This method has been implemented and successfully applied in the multi-protocol E-mail environment of the University of Geneva.
