25|$|In 1978, British Lesney, {{makers of}} Matchbox diecast vehicles, bought AMT {{and moved the}} company to Baltimore, closing the Maple Road {{facility}} in Troy, Michigan (just outside Detroit). (Cawthon 2002). By this time, prices of plastics had increased and Detroit was squeezed by government regulations of safety, emissions and fuel economy. Detroit sponsored fewer and fewer promotionals so model companies depended more on kits but the <b>model</b> <b>building</b> hobby declined as well. Also, AMT had an incredible display of models and documentary history at its headquarters that was scattered at that time (Anderson 2003).|$|E

40|$|Heliodons {{have been}} {{developed}} to simulate sunlight direction in relation to a <b>building</b> <b>model.</b> In the pursuit of a heliodon capable of producing quasi-parallel light impinging on physical <b>building</b> <b>models</b> for simulating sunlight impingement for various hours of the day and various days of the year, and for varying latitudes, yet occupying a space generally affordable in an architect’s design studio, a new table top heliodon has been developed. This paper reports on this heliodon which simulates the directional and parallelity aspects of sunlight. It employs a movable artificial directional light source assembly giving light onto a <b>building</b> <b>model</b> which is placed on a horizontal model stand. The light source assembly is adjustable for giving simulated sunlight (only simulating for the directional and parallelity aspects of sunlight) onto the <b>building</b> <b>model,</b> for the desirable day, time, and latitude of the location of the <b>modelled</b> <b>building.</b> This directional adjustment of light is effected by moving the simulated light generator about the simulated earth axis, thus also allowing strong demonstration of physical solar movement around the <b>building</b> <b>model.</b> In order to receive the simulated sunlight which comes out in a limited face area of the lens, the <b>building</b> <b>model</b> and/or its stand have to be moved to ensure that the simulated quasi-parallel light will fall onto the desirable parts of the <b>building</b> <b>model.</b> This model movement is a simple movement just for keeping the correct north-south orientation of the <b>building</b> <b>model,</b> and for catching the simulated sunlight, without tilting the <b>building</b> <b>model.</b> link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|At {{the level}} of quantum field theory, Kaluza–Klein theory unifies gravity with gauge interactions, based on the {{realization}} that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces electromagnetism. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe quantum gravity. Therefore, these models still require a UV completion, {{of the kind that}} string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a Calabi–Yau manifold. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory <b>model</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crick and Watson {{felt that}} they had benefited from collaborating with Wilkins. They offered him a co-authorship on the article that first {{described}} the double helix structure of DNA. Wilkins turned down the offer, a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgment of experimental work done at King's College in the eventual published paper. Rather than make any of the DNA researchers at King's College co-authors on the Watson and Crick double helix article, the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from King's College along with the helix paper. Brenda Maddox suggests that because of the importance of her experimental results in Watson and Crick's <b>model</b> <b>building</b> and theoretical analysis, Franklin should have had her name on the original Watson and Crick paper in Nature.
