5|$|Calakmul {{was already}} a large city in the Preclassic period. The early history of Calakmul is obscure, {{although}} a dynastic list has been pieced together that extends back into an ancestral past. This dynasty has been reconstructed in part from Late Classic ceramics from the region of great Preclassic cities of El Mirador and Nakbe. This <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Calakmul ultimately inherited its political authority from one of these cities, with its dynasty originating in the Late Preclassic in the Mirador Basin and relocating itself to Calakmul in the Classic period {{after the collapse of}} these cities.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century CE, possibly extending back to 1690 BCE. Radiocarbon dating on postholes and pits {{in the area}} show activity from 1690 to 1390, 1319 to 1214, and 977 to 899 BCE. Wheat and barley grains {{have been found in}} these excavations. Tests show that most of the barley was dehulled, but that absence of such debris <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the cereal was brought in from other areas.|$|E

5|$|What {{this phrase}} meant to {{the maker of}} these riddles is {{impossible}} to say.

5|$|After an interregnum {{prompted}} by Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from Gaul to become {{ruler of the}} East Angles. It is likely that he gained the kingdom by military means, because his prowess as a commander was later remembered. During his reign, part of the kingdom was governed by Ecgric his 'kinsman', a relationship described by the Latin term cognatus. This <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Ecgric was a son of Rædwald. However, the historian Steven Plunkett is amongst those that consider Ecgric {{to be the same}} person as Æthelric, named in the East Anglian tally (in the Anglian collection) as a son of Eni, Rædwald's brother. Whoever the pagan Ecgric was, Sigeberht had equal or senior power while he ruled, because the influence of his religious patronage was felt throughout his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After his cathedral {{church was}} burned down in 1114, Luffa managed to secure King Henry I's {{financial}} help in rebuilding the church. Besides the rebuilding, Luffa built a Lady chapel, which still remains. Other work still extant {{in the cathedral}} are the arcades, the exteriors of the clerestory and those galleries that are unvaulted. The art historian George Zarnecki {{has argued that the}} rood screen in the cathedral also dates from Luffa's episcopate. Two panels from this work still survive, and depict the meeting of Jesus with Mary and Martha at Bethany as well as the miracle where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. The scenes show some resemblance to works in Hildesheim and Cologne, and this resemblance <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Luffa was from Germany, or hired sculptors from there.|$|E

5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning on Venus, and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and thunder. The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming {{the occurrence of}} lightning on Venus. One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped {{by a factor of}} 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|When Bede {{was about}} 17 years old, Adomnán, the abbot of Iona Abbey, visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. Bede would {{probably}} have met the abbot during this visit, {{and it may be}} that Adomnan sparked Bede's interest in the Easter dating controversy. In about 692, in Bede's nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a deacon by his diocesan bishop, John, who was bishop of Hexham. The canonical age for the ordination of a deacon was 25; Bede's early ordination <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> his abilities were considered exceptional, but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded. There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices. In Bede's thirtieth year (about 702), he became a priest, with the ordination again performed by Bishop John.|$|E

5|$|In 627, Honorius was consecrated as {{archbishop}} by Paulinus of York at Lincoln. Honorius {{wrote to}} Pope Honorius I asking the pope {{to raise the}} see of York to an archbishopric, so that when one archbishop in England died, the other {{would be able to}} consecrate the deceased bishop's successor. The pope agreed, and sent a pallium for Paulinus, but by this time, Paulinus had already been forced to flee from Northumbria. When Paulinus, after the death of King Edwin of Northumbria in October 633, fled Northumbria, he was received by Honorius and appointed to the bishopric of Rochester. The papal letter is dated to June 634, and implies that news of Edwin's death had not reached the pope. This evidence <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the traditional date of Edwin's death may need to be moved to October 634. The papal letter may also mean that the traditional date of consecration for Honorius may need re-dating, as the long gap between 627, when he {{is said to have been}} consecrated, and 634, when he finally received a pallium, is much longer than usually found. It may be that Honorius was consecrated closer to 634. The papal letter to Honorius is given in the Ecclesiastical History of the medieval writer Bede.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether the English pursuit was ordered by Harold {{or if it was}} spontaneous. Wace relates that Harold ordered his men to stay in their {{formations}} but no other account gives this detail. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the death of Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine occurring just before the fight around the hillock. This <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the two brothers led the pursuit. The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio relates a different story for the death of Gyrth, stating that the duke slew Harold's brother in combat, perhaps thinking that Gyrth was Harold. William of Poitiers states that the bodies of Gyrth and Leofwine were found near Harold's, implying that they died late in the battle. It is possible that if the two brothers died early in the fighting their bodies were taken to Harold, thus accounting for their being found near his body after the battle. The military historian Peter Marren speculates that if Gyrth and Leofwine died early in the battle, that may have influenced Harold to stand and fight to the end.|$|E
5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} {{role in the}} body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes. Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain {{the integrity of the}} cell membrane. Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.|$|E
