50|$|The main bottom {{longline}} {{is set in}} {{a simple}} way with a main line rigging from which many secondary or branch lines are hanging, of about 12 to 15 m long. On each of these lines, a cone-shaped device or protection net is placed in each secondary line, made by two metallic rings on the edge covered by a mesh net: the upper ring of 20 cm of diameter consisting in encased wire ending in retention rigging; and a lower ring of 100 cm diameter, with a separation distance between both rings of 180 cm. The mesh net composing the device is 7.5 cm, and on the upper ring, it ends in a knot allowing movement through the branch lines.

For {{the transformation of}} the sol-gel precursor to a crystalline oxide coating detailed microstructural characterization is given. The main subject of the study was the bridging of fibers by interphase material, a general phenomenon of sol-gel coatings. A three-point bending test is proposed as a semi-quantitative method to determine the characteristic stiffening of bridged fiber bundles. This method is successfully used to evaluate the influence of sol concentration on fiber bridging and to prove the benefit of additional surfactants to aqueous sols. Differences in film formation on the individual fiber surfaces leading to homogeneous or inhomogeneous film thickness and variation in degree of fiber surface coverage are explained with a three-fiber model. Based on model and experiment it is shown that even surface coverage and homogeneous film thickness can better be accomplished by multiple coatings from low concentrated sols than by single coatings from high concentrated sols.

It {{was found that the}} G-actin could be polymerized into ordered filamentous structures with different diameter from the slimmest filament of single F-actin to giant filament in tree-like branched aggregates. The observed polymerized actin filaments, to which our most intense attention was attracted, was discretely distributed and showed obvious polymorphism distinctly different from those in the presence of phalloidin or actin binding proteins (fimbrin, gelsolin, etc.) in previous experiments. Latter structures were mainly composed of single F-actin and/or <b>multifilaments</b> clearly consisting of several single F-actin. The experimental results clearly demonstrated that non-interference with the F-actin intrinsic dynamics in self-organizing could lead to the polymorphism of actin filamentous structures, and further analysis implied that the disturbance of normal F-actin dynamics by many factors could prevent the emergence of structural polymorphism, more often than not, give rise to formation of specific structures instead and different interference would bring about various particular structures under certain conditions.
