This simple truism raises several questions: rst, about the potential partners R and S; second, about the nature of X; and third, about the constraints on and the point of the whole process. On the rst question, our initial intuition might be that both S and R must be individuals. They need to be suf ciently separate for one to be in possession of information that the other lacks. The concept of a biological individual is a complex and elusive one, however (de Sousa 2005), and it is soon apparent that S and R don’t have to be individuals in any strong sense.

40|$|What is materiality? And is it of a {{different}} order from semiosis? In this commentary I reflect on the place of materiality—that quality of material phenomena—and materialization—the processes by which such qualities are actualized in social life—in Matthew Hull’s brilliant book, Government of paper (GoP). The analytic materiality is central to Hull’s ethnography, both theoretically (it informs his engagements with James Scott, Bruno Latour, and contemporary linguistic anthropology, among others) and methodologically (it guides his ethnography and analysis). And yet, while Hull demonstrates the term’s pragmatic purchase, he never quite tackles what is “meant ” by it head on. 1 Bracketing whether this {{is in fact the}} point, in what follows I comment on what I think materiality and materialization do in Hull’s analysis, motioning to some issues this raises for linguistic anthropology.

I will argue that each type of theory faces a serious problem. Let <b>me</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> the strong theory which is built upon the notion of psychological connectedness.
