After birth, it is the predominant means by which nitrogenous waste is excreted in the urine of these animals. In humans and other higher apes, the metabolic pathway for conversion of uric acid to allantoin is not present, so the former is excreted.

40|$|The {{microbial}} world displays {{an immense}} taxonomic diversity. This diversity is manifested {{also in a}} multitude of metabolic pathways that can utilize different substrates and produce different products. Here, we propose that these observations directly link to thermodynamic constraints that inherently arise from the metabolic basis of microbial growth. We show that thermodynamic constraints can enable coexistence of microbes that utilise the same substrate but produce different end products. We find that this thermodynamics-driven emergence of diversity is most relevant for <b>metabolic</b> <b>conversions</b> with low free energy as seen for example under anaerobic conditions, where population dynamics is governed by thermodynamic effects rather than kinetic factors such as substrate uptake rates. These findings provide a general understanding of the microbial diversity based on the first-principles of thermodynamics.

40|$|Effective {{regulation}} of highly compartmentalized production of {{reactive oxygen species}} and peroxidation reactions in mitochondria requires targeting of small molecule antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes into the organelles. This review describes recently developed approaches to mitochondrial targeting of small biologically active molecules based on: (i) preferential accumulation in mitochondria because of their hydrophobicity and positive charge (hydrophobic cations), (ii) binding with high affinity to an intra-mitochondrial constituent, and (iii) <b>metabolic</b> <b>conversions</b> by specific mitochondrial enzymes to reveal an active entity. In addition, targeted delivery of antioxidant enzymes via expression of leader sequences directing the proteins into mitochondria is considered. Examples of successful antioxidant and anti-apoptotic protection based {{on the ability of}} targeted cargoes to inhibit cytochrome c-catalyzed peroxidation of a mitochondria-specific phospholipid cardiolipin, in vitro and in vivo are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the employment of triphenylphosphonium- and hemi-gramicidin S-moieties as two effective vehicles for mitochondrial delivery of antioxidants. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The peroxisomal {{compartment}} in hepatocytes hosts several essential <b>metabolic</b> <b>conversions.</b> These are defective in peroxisomal disorders {{that are}} either caused by failure to import the enzymes in the organelle or by mutations in the enzymes or in transporters needed to transfer the substrates across the peroxisomal membrane.

In mouse models of these diseases liver pathologies also occur, although these are not always concordant with the human phenotype which might be due to differences in diet, expression of enzymes and backup mechanisms. Besides the morphological changes, we overview the impact of peroxisome malfunction on other cellular compartments including mitochondria and the ER. We further focus on the metabolic pathways that are affected such as bile acid formation, dicarboxylic acid and branched chain fatty acid degradation.

50|$|Toxicological {{studies have}} shown that safrole is a weak hepatocarcinogen at higher doses in rats and mice.

Metabolism of the methylenedioxy group to a carbene allows the molecule to form ligand complexes with cytochrome P450 and P448. The formation of this complex leads to lower amounts of available free cytochrome P450. Safrole can also directly bind to cytochrome P450, leading to competitive inhibition.  These two mechanisms result in lowered mixed function oxidase activity.|$|E

In addition to E 2 itself, recent findings highlight the significance of 4 -hydroxylated estrogen metabolites as chemical mediators and their link to breast cancer development and progression, whereas, in opposition, 2 -methoxylated estrogens appear to be protective. Recent data also indicate that breast tissue possesses enzymatic machinery to inactivate and eliminate E 2 and its oxidized and methoxylated metabolites through conjugation catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), which involves the covalent addition of glucuronic acid. In opposition to other metabolic pathways of estrogen, the UGT-mediated process leads to the formation of glucuronides that are devoid of biologic activity and are readily excreted from the tissue into the circulation. This review addresses the most recent findings on the identification of UGT enzymes that are responsible for the glucuronidation of E 2 and its metabolites, and evidence regarding their potential role in breast cancer...|$|R

30|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressants}} (TCA) are pharmaceutically important {{compounds and}} {{are widely used}} {{for the treatment of}} psychiatric patients suffering from clinical depression Goodman and Gilman (2001). The main function of these drugs is to block the reuptake of the neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (Morton 1991; British Pharmacopoeia 1988). Imipramine hydrochloride (IMP) and Clomipramine hydrochloride (CLM) are important compounds of this group of drugs. Inspite of the importance of these drugs, a review of literature reveals the absence of comprehensive studies on the solution behaviour of these drugs especially on their oxidation-kinetics and mechanisms. In biochemical reactions, kinetic knowledge is used to optimize the reaction conditions in order to unfold the mechanistic picture of the particular redox system which remains an area of interest and importance. Hence, such a study could throw some light on the mechanism of <b>metabolic</b> <b>conversions</b> of these drugs in the biological systems.

50|$|Chloral hydrate {{also was}} also a {{significant}} object of study in various early pharmacological experiments. In 1875, Claude Bernard tried to tell if chloral hydrate exerted its action through a <b>metabolic</b> <b>conversion</b> to chloroform. This {{was not only the}} first attempt to determine whether different drugs were converted to the same metabolite in the body but also the first to measure the concentration of a particular pharmaceutical in the blood. The results were inconclusive. In 1899 and 1901 Hans Horst Meyer and Ernest Overton respectively made the major discovery that the general anaesthetic action of a drug was strongly correlated to its lipid solubility. But, chloral hydrate was quite polar but nonetheless a potent hypnotic. Overton was unable to explain this mystery. Thus, chloral hydrate remained one of the major and persistent exceptions to this breakthrough discovery in pharmacology. This anomaly was eventually resolved in 1948, when Claude Bernard's experiment was repeated. While chloral hydrate was converted to a different metabolite than chloroform, it was found that was converted into the more lipophilic molecule 2,2,2-Trichloroethanol. This metabolite fit much better with the Meyer-Overton correlation than chloral had. Prior to this, it had not been demonstrated that general anesthetics could undergo chemical changes to exert their action in the body.|$|E
50|$|In May 2016, a study {{published}} in the journal Nature determined that HNK, specifically (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, is responsible for the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in mice; administration of (2R,6R)-HNK demonstrated ketamine-type antidepressant-like effects, and preventing the <b>metabolic</b> <b>conversion</b> of ketamine into HNK blocked the antidepressant-like effects of the parent compound. As (2R,6R)-HNK, unlike ketamine, is not an NMDA receptor antagonist, and produces no dissociative or euphoric effects, it has consequently been concluded that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may in fact not be mediated via the NMDA receptor. This is tentative, as confirmation that the findings translate to humans is still needed, but it is notable that published human data show a positive association between the antidepressant responses of ketamine and plasma (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK levels. In accordance with the notion that the NMDA receptor is not responsible for the antidepressant effects of ketamine, dizocilpine (MK-801), which binds to and blocks the same site on the NMDA receptor that ketamine does, lacks antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, the findings would explain why other NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine, lanicemine, and traxoprodil have thus far failed to demonstrate ketamine-like antidepressant effects in human clinical trials. Instead of acting via blockade of the NMDA receptor, (2R,6R)-HNK increases activation of the AMPA receptor via a currently unknown/uncertain mechanism. The compound is now under active investigation by researchers at NIMH for potential clinical use, and is expected to mitigate the various concerns (such as abuse and dissociation) of using ketamine itself in the treatment of depression.|$|E

Cl*int,HB and Cl*int,AM were both increased by phenobarbital and polychlorinated biphenyl pretreatment.
