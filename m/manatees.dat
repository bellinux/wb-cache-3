5|$|The meat, oil, bones, {{and skin}} of <b>manatees</b> are {{valuable}} items. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African <b>manatees</b> are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Though illegal, lack {{of law enforcement}} in these areas induce poaching. Some residents of West African countries, such as Mali and Chad, depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions. Hunting is the largest source of mortality in Amazonian <b>manatees,</b> {{and there are no}} management plans except for in Colombia. Amazonian <b>manatees,</b> especially calves, are sometimes illegally sold as pets, but there are several institutions that care for and rescue these orphans, with the possibility of their releasing into the wild. The body parts of Dugongs are used as medicinal remedies across the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|All {{sirenians}} {{are protected}} by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to this, the four species are further protected by various specialty organizations. The Dugong is listed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Migratory Species, and the Coral Triangle Initiative. In Florida, <b>manatees</b> {{are protected by}} the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978, which implements actions such as the limitation or prohibition of watercraft speeds where <b>manatees</b> exist.|$|E
50|$|The Amazonian <b>manatee</b> is the second-smallest {{species of}} <b>manatee</b> after the dwarf <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus pygmaeus) from Brazil. However, the {{validity}} of the dwarf <b>manatee</b> as a species is the subject of debate, with some believing it to be an immature Amazonian <b>manatee.</b>|$|R
50|$|Located on the <b>Manatee</b> River in {{downtown}} Bradenton is the South Florida Museum, Bishop Planetarium and Parker <b>Manatee</b> Aquarium. This one-stop museum-planetarium-aquarium offers {{a glimpse of}} Florida history, a star and multimedia show, and ongoing lecture and film series. The Parker <b>Manatee</b> Aquarium is the permanent home to <b>Manatee</b> County's most famous resident and official mascot, Snooty, the <b>manatee.</b> Born at the Miami Aquarium and Tackle Company on July 21, 1948, Snooty {{was one of the}} first recorded captive <b>manatee</b> births. He is the oldest <b>manatee</b> in captivity, and likely the oldest <b>manatee</b> in the world.|$|R
50|$|The West Indian <b>manatee</b> is {{a species}} {{distinct}} from the Amazonian <b>manatee</b> (T. inunguis) and the African <b>manatee</b> (T. senegalensis). Based on genetic and morphological studies, the West Indian <b>manatee</b> {{is divided into two}} subspecies, the Florida <b>manatee</b> (T. m. latirostris) and the Antillean or Caribbean <b>manatee</b> (T. m. manatus). However, recent genetic (mtDNA) research suggests that the West Indian <b>manatee</b> actually consists of three groups, which are more or less geographically distributed as: (1) Florida and the Greater Antilles; (2) Mexico, Central America and northern South America; and (3) northeastern South America.|$|R
5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. <b>Manatees</b> can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian <b>manatees</b> and African <b>manatees</b> can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian <b>manatees</b> have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|E
5|$|Much like elephants, <b>manatees</b> are polyphyodonts, and {{continuously}} replace {{their teeth}} {{from the back}} of the jaw. Adults lack incisors, canines, and premolars, and instead have 8 to 10 cheek teeth in their mouth. <b>Manatees</b> have an infinite supply of teeth moving in from the back and shedding in the front, which are continuously formed by a dental capsule behind the tooth-row. These teeth are constantly worn down by the abrasive vascular plants they forage, particularly aquatic grasses. Unlike in <b>manatees,</b> the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two tusks which emerge in males during puberty, and sometime later in life for females after reaching the base of the premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong.|$|E

50|$|Lake <b>Manatee</b> is a {{reservoir}} located in <b>Manatee</b> County in southwestern Florida in the United States. Highway 64 crosses {{the eastern end}} of the lake, while the Lake <b>Manatee</b> State Park is found at the southwestern end. The <b>Manatee</b> River flows into the lake at the eastern end, then continues to the west, where it flows into Tampa Bay. Lake <b>Manatee</b> is a major source of water for Bradenton and other cities in <b>Manatee</b> County, providing 32 million gallons per day. Lake <b>Manatee</b> State Park is located on the south shore of the lake.|$|R
50|$|Snooty (July 21, 1948 - July 23, 2017) {{was a male}} Florida <b>manatee</b> that resided at the South Florida Museum's Parker <b>Manatee</b> Aquarium in Bradenton, Florida. He was one of {{the first}} {{recorded}} captive <b>manatee</b> births, and at age , he was the oldest <b>manatee</b> in captivity, and possibly the oldest <b>manatee</b> in the world. Due to his hand rearing from birth, Snooty was never released to the wild and was the only <b>manatee</b> at the museum's aquarium that had regular human interaction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Manatee</b> High School {{currently}} {{offers an}} academic curriculum {{known as the}} AP+ Program. In essence, this is simply an official title given to students who take {{a certain number of}} Advanced Placement courses. <b>Manatee</b> also offers a Dual-Enrollment program which arranges for its students to take courses at the local State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota (formerly <b>Manatee</b> Community College). In 2006 and 2007, <b>Manatee</b> received a grade of D (on an A-F scale) in the Florida Department of Education rating of school quality. In 2008, <b>Manatee</b> was able to demonstrate statistical improvement, and was given a grade of A instead. In 2009, <b>Manatee</b> was demoted to B. In 2010, <b>Manatee</b> regained their A rating, becoming the highest rated high school in <b>Manatee</b> and Sarasota Counties.|$|R
5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and <b>manatees</b> may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African <b>manatees</b> have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the <b>manatees.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fresh water}} {{entering}} Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that foster animal {{life in the}} bay. Sea turtles and <b>manatees</b> (Trichechus manatus latirostris) eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic plankton. Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and <b>manatees</b> spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, {{due to the lack}} of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch (Pleuroploca gigantea), left-handed whelk (Busycon contrarium), and the Florida crown conch (Melongena corona) as drinking vessels, picks, hammers, knives and awls.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and <b>manatees.</b> The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, <b>manatees,</b> and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Manatee</b> River {{watershed}} {{lies in the}} Tampa Bay {{sector of}} <b>Manatee</b> County. The watershed covers approximately 360 sq mi. [...] The <b>Manatee</b> River headwaters flow 45 mi in a westerly direction towards the Gulf of Mexico and southern Tampa Bay. [...] Two major river systems make up the <b>Manatee</b> River Watershed — Braden River and <b>Manatee</b> River. These two rivers have been impounded to create two reservoirs for potable supply — Ward Lake (also known as Bill Evers Reservoir) and Lake <b>Manatee</b> Reservoir. [...] Ward Lake is located upstream on the narrow, winding Braden River.

On June 29, 1976, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. After it ceased being used as a courthouse, it became the <b>Manatee</b> Methodist Church and then the <b>Manatee</b> Methodist Church Parsonage.|$|R
5|$|Marine mammals are aquatic mammals {{that rely}} on the ocean and other marine {{ecosystems}} for their existence. They include animals such as seals, whales, <b>manatees,</b> sea otters and polar bears. They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution, as in {{they do not have}} an immediate common ancestor. They are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian <b>manatees,</b> very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E
5|$|Low-powered motorboats {{are allowed}} in the park; the {{majority}} of salt water areas are no-wake zones to protect <b>manatees</b> and other marine animals from harm. Jet skis, airboats, and other motorized personal watercraft are prohibited. Many trails allow kayaks and canoes. A state license is required for fishing. Fresh water licenses are not sold in the park, but a salt water license may be available. Swimming is not recommended within the park boundaries; water moccasins, snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), alligators and crocodiles thrive in fresh water. Sharks, barracuda, and sharp dangerous coral are plentiful in salt water. Visibility is low in both kinds.|$|E

5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} <b>manatees</b> and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (<b>manatees)</b> with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|The fauna of Puerto Rico {{is similar}} to other island {{archipelago}} faunas, with high endemism, and low, skewed taxonomic diversity.

He was raised entirely in captivity, and died at the age of 69. <b>Manatees</b> can also be viewed in a number of European zoos, such as the Tierpark in Berlin, the Nuremberg Zoo, in ZooParc de Beauval in France, and in the Aquarium of Genoa in Italy. The River Safari at Singapore features seven of them.|$|E
5|$|The sandbar of Carabane {{has very}} few mammals other than pets, {{although}} the French first noted {{the presence of}} monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese <b>manatees</b> (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African <b>manatees</b> can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|E
