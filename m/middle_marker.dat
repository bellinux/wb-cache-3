40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an exploration}} of Chinese middle constructions, which starts with distinguishing the middle construction from the middle voice, considering that these two terms have long been used interchangeably with different connotations. Consequently, middle data presented in the literature vary tremendously, both intra-linguistically and inter-linguistically. In order to delineate a clear boundary for the middle construction, this study defines it as a generic semantic category with the obligatory non-realization of a verb’s highest argument. By contrast, the middle voice is a morphological category with various syntactic and semantic features. Starting from the working definition arrived at, the study identifies several middle constructions, viz., the qilai middle, the hao middle, the rongyi/nan middle, the de middle (and the te middles in Chengdu Chinese), the bu middle and transitive middles. Most of these middle constructions come with <b>middle</b> <b>markers,</b> though these are both morphologically and syntactically diversified. In the case of transitive middles, middle formation depends on an idiosyncratic argument realization {{of a small group}} of verbs and does not include markers. In this sense, the presence of <b>middle</b> <b>markers</b> is not a design feature of Chinese middles. Moreover, the occurrence of the identified <b>middle</b> <b>markers</b> does not necessarily lead to a middle analysis, because they can also mark other constructions, e. g., the qilai unaccusative construction, the rongyi/nan tough construction, and the de-resultative unaccusative construction. Syntax-wise, Chinese middles can have both complex predicates (e. g., [V-qilai AP] and [rongyi/nan V]) and simple predicates (e. g., hao-V, V-de-A, V-bu-A, V-te-A, V-te), both of which are proved to be unergative in nature. Consequently, these middle constructions are collectively termed “unergative middles”, which stand in contrast with “transitive middles” in terms of transitivity. However, “unergative middles” and “transitive middles” share one property: they do not involve any movement mechanisms. Therefore, both of them are subsumed under the rubric of “lexical middles”, which in addition exhibit the cross-linguistic lexical middle properties proposed by both Marelj (2004) and Lekakou (2005). This study is the first to adopt a parametric approach to Chinese middle constructions. It adds Chinese to languages like English, Dutch and German on the list of lexical middle languages, to be distinguished from syntactic middle languages like French, Italian, Portuguese, and Serbian/Croatian. published_or_final_versionEnglishDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} and intrusion of 20 pilot workload assessment techniques were compared using a psychomotor loading task in a three degree-of-freedom moving-base aircraft simulator. The primary task was an {{instrument landing system}} approach and landing, with measures taken between the outer and <b>middle</b> <b>markers.</b> Three levels of psychomotor load were obtained by combined manipulation of random wind-gust disturbance level and pitch stability. Two rating scale measures and one control movement measure demonstrated sensitivity to all levels of load. Additionally, one time estimation measure and one pulse rate measure demonstrated sensitivity to some levels of load. No intrusion was found. The results of this experiment indicate that the sensitivities of workload estimation techniques vary widely, and {{that only a few}} techniques appear sensitive to psychomotor load...|$|R

When the aircraft is above the <b>middle</b> <b>marker,</b> the receiver's amber <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> light starts blinking, and a repeating pattern of audible morse code-like dot-dashes at a frequency of 1,300 Hz in the headset. This alerts the pilot that the CAT I missed approach point (typically 200 ft above the ground level on the glideslope) has been passed and should have already initiated the missed approach if one of several visual cues has not been spotted.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that recombination near the third chromosome centromere is associated with negative chromosome interference, a phenomenon for which Green (1975) and Sinclair (1975) suggested gene conversion as a possible mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that negative chromosome interference is still observed when deficiencies or translocation breakpoints are scored as the <b>middle</b> <b>markers</b> in recombination experiments and the rate of recombination is increased by interchromosomal effect. We argue that these chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints are not subject to conversion. Since neither successive premeiotic and meiotic exchanges, nor negative chromatid interference, can by themselves account for the negative chromosome interference, we conclude that a greater than expected frequency of multiple exchanges actually occurs. We further suggest that negative chromosome interference may be characteristic of all chromosomal regions normally showing very little exchange in relation to physical length...|$|R

50|$|Approach {{lighting}} systems {{are designed to}} allow the pilot to quickly and positively identify visibility distances in Instrument meteorological conditions. For example, if the aircraft is at the <b>middle</b> <b>marker,</b> and the <b>middle</b> <b>marker</b> is located 3600 feet from the threshold, the Decision Bar is 2600 feet ahead. If the procedure calls for {{at least half a}} statute mile flight visibility (roughly 2600 feet), spotting the Decision Bar at the marker would indicate enough flight visibility to continue the procedure. In addition, the shorter bars before and after the Decision Bar are spaced either 100 feet or 200 feet apart, depending on the ALS type. The number of short bars the pilot can see can be used to determine flight visibility. Approaches with lower minimums use the more precise 100-foot spacing systems for more accurate identification of visibility.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{two decades}} have {{witnessed}} {{a surge of}} interest in the research on middles in various languages ranging from English and Greek, to Kanuri and Modern Chinese. However, the existence of middle constructions in Archaic Chinese has completely escaped the attention of linguists. This thesis constitutes the first step in achieving an understanding in the form and function of middles in Archaic Chinese. Drawn on Kemmer (1993), a comprehensive typological study which presents 13 types of uses of <b>middle</b> <b>markers</b> in 34 languages, the thesis identifies five middle constructions in Archaic Chinese: reflexive middles, reciprocal middles, emotion middles, spontaneous middles, and passive middles. Semantically and syntactically, the five types of middles in Archaic Chinese all exhibit the characteristics of “low distinguishability of participants” and “low elaboration of events”, two common denominators among different uses of middle marking in world languages as proposed by Kemmer (1993). The two properties distinguish situations encoded by middle constructions from prototypical two-participant events and prototypical one-participant events. With data primarily from Zuozhuan, the thesis shows that the middle constructions in Archaic Chinese, parallel to other middle marking languages, have a “centralizing” effect. On a semantic map, the middles lie between typical transitive and typical intransitive constructions, and also between typical passive and typical active constructions. The thesis concludes that, in addition to the fully recognized distinction between the active and the passive, a third dimension – the middle, should be introduced into the grammatical system of Archaic Chinese with due attention...|$|R
