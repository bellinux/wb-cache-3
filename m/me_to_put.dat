5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to <b>me.</b> <b>To</b> <b>put</b> it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
25|$|It was as hard-hitting a {{memorandum}} as I could make it. Butler {{accused me of}} overstating the lack of resolve in both Washington and London.

Her lovers included reporter-turned-playwright Charles MacArthur and the publisher Seward Collins. Her relationship with MacArthur resulted in a pregnancy, about which Parker is alleged to have remarked, [...] "how like <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all my eggs into one bastard." [...] She had an abortion, and fell into a depression that culminated in her first attempt at suicide.|$|E

500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|Details {{of a film}} {{examining}} Hitchcock's {{obsession with}} Hedren were reported in December 2011. The Girl, written by Gwyneth Hughes, would star Toby Jones as Hitchcock and Sienna Miller as Hedren. In a post-production BBC press release about the film in November 2012, Hughes described her enthusiasm when she was approached about the project while on holiday: [...] " [...] {{got a phone call}} from producer Amanda Jenks. She only managed to get out the words 'Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren' before I was already shouting 'yes yes yes!' to this seductive, sinister, deeply touching story of love and obsession among Hollywood royalty." [...] Hughes interviewed Hedren and members of Hitchcock's crew before preparing a script. She described her discussions with Hedren: [...] "Her wisdom and insights have helped <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her real life ordeal on to the screen. I know Tippi is absolutely thrilled, as I am, with the casting of Sienna Miller to play her." [...] The film's title was inspired by the name Hitchcock used for Hedren after she stopped working for him.|$|E

You got an idea — boom! Idea, boom!" [...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent her tracks. Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing.

500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
500|$|Burnley is {{the primary}} {{songwriter}} in the band. Music industry attorney and author Martin Frascogna writes that [...] "it's unmistakably clear that Burnley started the group, is the creative force behind the group and essentially dictates the group's decisions." [...] Bands such as Nirvana, Live, Bush, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Beatles have been cited as influences. Burnley remarked in 2009 that while the other band members did contribute, it was [...] "always left up to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all the pieces together and make it so that it's even anything at all." [...] However, Burnley expressed how he considered Rauch to be his [...] "writing partner" [...] during Dear Agony, and that {{he looked forward to}} writing with him in the future. After joining the band in 2014 as part of the new lineup, Rauch provided writing contributions on Dark Before Dawn, writing the intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks. Burnley revealed in 2015 that the whole band would write songs for Breaking Benjamin in the future, and that [...] "It just so happens that when they came on board for this album, I was already 95 percent done", adding, [...] "I'm really looking forward to writing the next one all together." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, [...] "the demand changed" [...] which left them with only one month to finish the entire album. While establishing himself as a composer and as an artist, Mars worked with several artists which led to him spending long periods of time in the recording studio [...] "figuring out the production and the writing process".

In a 2015 interview with Jody Rosen of The New York Times, Thicke expressed both embarrassment over his public dedications and regret over giving the album a commercial release, stating, [...] "my record company didn’t want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it out, but they stuck by me.
