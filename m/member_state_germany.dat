40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{contribution to the}} literature on the formation of policy preferences on Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) reform within its Member States. In the aftermath of the euro crisis, many proposals to ‘complete’ EMU have been tabled. However, discord among Member States has led to a piecemeal restructuring of EMU. For this paper, a survey has been conducted among euro area academic experts, gauging preferences on EMU reform. We find that general consensus masks significant discord among academics from different Member States. Our data indicates the existence of conflicting national epistemic communities, bound by shared causal beliefs on macro-economic policy. Academics within the key creditor <b>Member</b> <b>State,</b> <b>Germany,</b> assume an outlier position. Within the sample of German academics, economists are particularly strongly opposed to all moves in the direction of fiscal or social union. As economists are those academic experts most likely to influence the economic policy beliefs dominant among the German policy elite, these results are highly politically salient. We confront these findings with {{the literature on the}} exceptionalism of German economics. We contend that our results substantiate the claim that inadequate EMU reform and, more generally, the EU approach to the Eurozone crisis, can be partially explained by the firm grip these economic doctrines hold over the economics profession and policy-making circles in Germany...|$|E

In recent years the preva-lence of a specific type of MRSA has been described in livestock. The European Union con-ducted a basic study in all Member States in order to estimate the spread (prevalence) of MRSA in pig breeding stocks. This study was coupled with a survey of the prevalence of Salmonella in these pig farms. The surveys were conducted between 1 January and 31 December 2008 on the basis of an EU study design. They recorded at least 80 % of breeding pigs in each Member State and were preferably carried out in farms with at least 50 breeding pigs. Representative pig farms for the different geographical situations were se-lected in each <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> <b>Germany</b> has presented the results of its basic study on the prevalence of MRSA in pig breeding herds. Sampling in the pig farms and data recording were done by the Länder au-thorities. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) coordinated the study, monitored the diagnostics, did the isolate typing and drew up the report. 84 of the 201 stocks were tested positive for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the dust samples examined. 93 % of the isolated MRSA belonged to the sequence type ST 398 frequently found in livestock. This confirms the results of the studies conducted in cooperation with the Länder on the spread of MRSA in the German pig population...|$|E

Next to eggs and poultry, pork is among the most common sources of such infections. In order to assess the prevalence of Salmonella in holdings of breeding pigs, the European Commission proposed a baseline survey in all Member States. The survey was carried out from 1 January to 31 December 2008 according to a study design prescribed by the EU. It covered at least 80 % of breeding pigs in each Member State. The individual studies were preferably carried out at holdings with at least 50 breeding pigs. Representative holdings were selected in each <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> <b>Germany</b> has now presented the results of its baseline survey on the prevalence of Salmo-nella in breeding pig stocks. The regional authorities (Länder) were responsible for taking samples at the holdings, testing for Salmonella and collecting the data. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) coordinated the survey, supervised the laboratory work, typed the isolates and prepared the reports. In 45 of the 201 holdings examined, at least one out of 10 composite faecal samples taken contained Salmonella. In most positive holdings only one (15 holdings) or two (11 holdings) of the 10 samples examined came up positive. 58 % of Salmonella that were found were of the most common serovars found in pigs namely Salmonella Derby (38 %) and Salmonella Typhimurium (20 %). These serovars were also the most common serovars found in a survey on slaughter pigs in 2006 / 2007...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Spain herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State Spain (EMS Spain), received and application from Syngenta Agro to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance thiamethoxam in artichokes, table olives and olives for oil production and for clothianidin in table olives and olives for oil production, based on the intended use of thiamethoxam. Spain received also another application from Syngenta Crop Protection AG to modify the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam and clothianidin in cauliflower, based on the intended use of thiamethoxam. In order to accommodate for the intended SEU use of thiamethoxam, the EMS Spain proposed to raise the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam in table olives and olives for oil production from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 5 mg/kg and to raise the existing MRLs for clothianidin in table olives, olives for oil production and cauliflower, resulting from the use of thiamethoxam from 0. 02 mg/kg to 0. 09 and 0. 05 mg/kg, respectively. For artichokes, the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam and clothianidin, and for cauliflower the existing MRL for thiamethoxam, {{do not need to be}} modified. Germany, herewith {{referred to as the}} evaluating <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>Germany</b> (EMS Germany), compiled an application to raise the existing MRLs for clothianidin in herbs (except chervil) to 1. 5 mg/kg, based on the intended NEU use of clothianidin. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for thiamethoxam and clothianidin in the crops under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of thiamethoxam on table olives, olives for oil production, cauliflower and artichokes as well as the intended use of clothianidin on herbs, will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. EFSA notes that Member States when granting new authorizations on the use of thiamethoxam and clothianidin implement appropriate risk mitigation measures to protect honey bees...|$|E

Before lowering the existing MRLs on pome fruits from 0. 3 mg/kg to 0. 2 mg/kg, grapes from 0. 5 mg/kg to 0. 07 mg/kg and wheat from 0. 1 mg/kg to and 0. 04 mg/kg, Germany suggested awaiting the finalisation of the ongoing review of the existing MRLs of tetraconazole, whereas they proposed to raise the existing MRLs in the liver of swine and ruminants from 1 mg/kg to 1. 5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, respectively. Germany drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 2 mg/kg on apples, 0. 07 mg/kg on grapes and 0. 02 mg/kg (LOQ) on wheat. Before the MRLs are lowered it should be confirmed that no more critical GAPs are currently authorised at EU level for these crops. Taking into account the intended and the existing uses of tetraconazole, EFSA proposes to raise to 1. 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg the existing MRLs for swine and ruminant liver, respectively. The data also support the lowering of the existing MRLs in swine, bovine, sheep and goats meat, fat and kidney and in ruminant milk. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of tetraconazole in the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses of tetraconazole on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values for tetraconazole and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E

40|$|A key {{question}} troubling {{the managers of}} the European Union (EU) is how can Europe be kept manageable? De-regulation, decentralisation and enlargement are increasing the heterogeneity of the EU and putting the present governance model under pressure. In its 2001 White Paper, the Commission showed that it interprets governance to mean less central control and more network-led steering. Drawing upon an empirical study of environmental policy integration (EPI) in the EU, this article shows that this vision may not adequately fit the multi-actor, multi-level characteristics of some EU problems. By studying the administrative capacities that the European Commission and three <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>Germany,</b> the Netherlands and the UK) have created to discharge this responsibility, this article shows significant administrative weaknesses at actor and at network level.

40|$|ABSTRACT The European Union (EU) {{is searching}} for new {{approaches}} to manage problems that span different policy sectors. In the regional policy field, incompatibilities between the EU’s territorial development objectives and its transport, agricultural, competition and environmental policies, are well known. The need to integrate territorial policy concerns into these sectoral policies (territorial policy integration or “TPI”) has recently emerged as a key policy priority. This article examines the EU’s capacity to implement TPI. It does so in relation to two <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>Germany</b> and the Netherlands) and the European Commission. It finds that the administrative implications of implementing TPI are far more demanding than any of these actors are currently able to handle. Moreover, some EU-level networks are potentially relevant to TPI, but these are mostly focused on regional policy matters (i. e. they are relatively inward looking). If these administrative issues are not taken more seriously, “integration ” will struggle to make headway in an EU which is notoriously sectorized...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{concentrates}} on two phenomena: EU {{foreign policy and}} the EU-Israel relationship. As a result, the methodological approach is two-fold. The first {{focal point of the}} thesis is the evolution of EU foreign policy itself, especially concentrating on the situation before and after the Treaty of Lisbon came into effect on 1 December 2009. The second focal point of the thesis are two qualitative analyses of Operation Cast Lead (2008 / 2009) and Operation Protective Edge (2014) which compare the reactions of EU institutions with the reactions of two 'pro-Israel' EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>Germany</b> and the Czech Republic) and two 'anti-Israel' EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (France and Sweden) to each conflict.
