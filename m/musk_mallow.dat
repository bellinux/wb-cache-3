And here, as with bird notes which delight us on account of their resemblance to fresh, young, highly musical human voices, flowers please us best when they exhibit the loveliest human tints--the apple blossom and the bindweed, <b>musk</b> <b>mallow</b> and almond and wild rose, for example. After these we are most taken with the deeper but soft and not too luminous reds--the red which we admire in the red horse-chestnut blossom, and many other flowers, down to the minute pimpernel. Next come the intense rosy reds seen in the herb-robert and other wild geraniums, valerian, red campion and ragged robin; and this shade of red, intensified but still soft, {{is seen in the}} willow-herb and foxglove, and, still more intensified, in the bell- and small-leafed heath. Some if not all of these pleasing reds have purple in them, and there are very many distinctly purple flowers that appeal to us {{in the same way that}} red flowers do, receiving their expression from the same cause. There is some purple colour in most skins, and even some blue.|$|E

50|$|The site is rough {{grassland}} on {{the bank}} of the River Chelmer, with areas of woodland and thorn thicket. Over 230 plant species have been recorded, including St John's wort, hairy violet and <b>musk</b> <b>mallow.</b> Birds include several species of warbler, and 23 of butterflies.|$|E
50|$|Abelmoschus ficulneus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the genus Abelmoschus, family Malvaceae. Commonly known as white wild <b>musk</b> <b>mallow</b> or native rosella, it is fibrous perennial with a woody stem. Its flowers are about an inch in diameter, either pink or white, with a rose center; its leaves are palmate.|$|E
50|$|Botanically, three {{different}} zones can be distinguished: the shore area, the raised bog and {{the slopes of}} the maar basin. In the shore area, as well as the reeds there are communities of yellow iris, white water-lily, yellow loosestrife, purple loosestrife and club-rush. The slopes of the maar basin are dominated by a mix of dry grassland and woodland edge vegetation. In addition to Breckland thyme and oregano, there is restharrow, hare's-foot clover, hop trefoil, narrow-leaved everlasting pea, <b>musk</b> <b>mallow,</b> clustered bellflower, downy hemp-nettle, fox and cubs, brown knapweed, greater knapweed, small scabious, woodruff and large communities of rosebay willow-herb. Neophytes that may be seen include garden lupins and large-flowered mountain trumpets.|$|E
40|$|Dry seeds (cultivar I – tall, branched, {{moisture}} content 3. 5 %; cultivar II – dwarf, unbranched, {{moisture content}} 1. 5 %) of Abelmoschus moschatus (L.) Medik (Family: Malvaceae; Common name: Ambrette; English name: <b>Musk</b> <b>mallow)</b> were treated (0. 25, 0. 50, and 1. 00 % for 3 h and 6 h durations) with chemical mutagens ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) and hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) to raise desirable ‘plant type’ mutants. Mutagenic sensitivity (from M 1 biological damages like lethality, injury and sterility; LD 50 was ascertained), M 2 mutation frequency and types (cv. I: pigmented stem, lax branching, long petiole, large flower and early flowering, 1089 plants scored; cv. II: funnel, thick stem and late flowering, 1945 plants screened), mutagenic effectiveness (EMS {{more effective than}} NH 2 OH) and efficiency (variable response but threshold dose seems to be efficient) and meiotic chromosome behaviour of the plant types were assessed. Macromutants evolved were viable and may be important genetic resources in the plant species...|$|E
