50|$|At {{about this}} time there was plans for the 28-GeV CERN proton synchroton, Colin Ramm was very {{interested}} in the idea of an internationale collaboration to build a much faster accelerator. So he joined the PS Division in 1954 {{as the leader of the}} <b>magnet</b> <b>group,</b> which became responsible for the whole of the synchroton's magnet system. When the work on the magnet finished the <b>magnet</b> <b>group</b> became the Nuclear Physics Apparatus Division in 1961. At this time they turned towards making the PS usable as an experimental device, and in the course of time a number of projects took shape: the heavy-liquid bubble chamber, enhanced neutrino beam, electrostatic separators. The bubble chamber has a volume of 500 litres, is still now to this day the largest heavy liquid chamber operating in a magnetic field at its time. Completed in 1960 it was used in CERN's first neutrino experiments. The electrostatic separators built by Colin’s division gave CERN some of the world’s highest-energy beams of separated particles, as well as leading to research into the basic principles of high-voltage breakdown.|$|E

50|$|The {{new company}} won {{accreditation}} to British Standard 5750, which {{enabled them to}} produce vehicles for the Ministry of Defence (MoD). In late 1987, Fred W Davies, a Canadian who owned the Davies <b>Magnet</b> <b>Group</b> and York Trailers, was also trying {{to break into the}} MoD market, and saw the acquisition of Harbilt as a way to obtain their good reputation and their BS5750 accreditation quickly. Harbilt shares were trading at about £6, and he offered £11. The offer was accepted, and production moved to Corby, but Davies failed to win any MoD contracts, and lost interest in building electric vehicles. The business was put up for sale in 1989, and although John Bradshaw of Peterborough was keen to buy it, it was M&M Electric Vehicles of Atherstone who were successful.|$|E
50|$|Harbilt {{electric}} vehicles were initially {{produced by the}} Market Harborough Construction Company, which was formed in 1935 as a manufacturer of aircraft components. After {{the end of the}} Second World War, they diversified, and {{electric vehicles}} were a part of their new product range. The first vehicle produced was the 551 pedestrian controlled vehicle, which they supplied with a charger made by Partridge Wilson of Leicester, who were making their own range of Wilson battery vehicles. As well as milk delivery, the chassis was popular in Switzerland, with some 2000 vehicles supplied to the Swiss Post Office and to Swiss hotels. From 1956, they introduced ride-on vehicles, beginning with the model 735, and expanded the range considerably over the next few years. The Dairyliner range was showcased at the Royal International Dairy Show held at Olympia in October 1970. At some point in the early 1970s, prior to 1974, Harbilt and Morrison-Electricars reached an agreement for a product exchange and rationalisation. All milk floats would be built by Morrisons at their Tredegar works, while Morrison trucks would be handed over to Harbilt. The electric vehicle facility was taken over by a management buyout in 1975, and registered as Harbilt Electric Trucks. It continued to make trucks for a variety of industries, until it was bought for almost twice its share value by Fred W Davies, a Canadian who owned the Davies <b>Magnet</b> <b>Group</b> and York Trailers, in 1987. Production moved to Corby, but the venture was short-lived, and it was sold again to M&M Electric Vehicles of Atherstone in 1989.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of static magnetic fields on cutaneous wound healing in an animal model. The literature was reviewed to explore the historical and scientific basis of magnet therapy and to define its current role in the evidence-based practice of plastic surgery. Methods: Standardized wounds were created on the backs of 33 Sprague-Dawley rats, which were divided into 3 groups with either a 23 gauss <b>magnet</b> (<b>group</b> 1), a sham <b>magnet</b> (<b>group</b> 2), or nothing (group 3) positioned over the wound. The rate of wound closure by secondary intention was compared between the groups. Literature review was conducted through searches of PubMed and Ovid databases for articles pertinent to magnets and wound healing. Results: Wounds in the <b>magnet</b> <b>group</b> healed in an average of 15. 3 days, significantly faster than those in either the sham group (20. 9 days, P =. 006) or control group (20. 3 days, P <. 0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the sham and control groups (P =. 45). Conclusions: An externally applied, low-power, static magnetic field increases the rate of secondary healing. Review of the literature reveals conflicting evidence regarding the use of magnetic energy to aid the healing of bone, tendon, and skin.

Huh 7 hepatoma cells were labeled with anionic magnetic nanoparticles (AMNP) and tagged with a fluores-cent membrane marker (PKH 67). Iron-uptake was measured by magne-tophoresis. Twenty C 57 Bl 6 mice re-ceived an intrasplenic injection of 2 × 106 labeled cells. An external magnet (0. 29 T; 25 T/m) was placed over the liver of 13 randomly selected animals (<b>magnet</b> <b>group),</b> while the remaining 7 animals served as controls. MRI (1. 5 T) and confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) were performed 10 days post-transplantation.

In this study {{the effect of}} electromagnetic field (EMF) on NO level, an effective factor in increasing blood flow, and on ankle brachial index (ABI) as a n index of lower extremity blood flow in type 2 diabetic patients, have been investigated.   Methods: This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial carried out in Imam Khomeini hospital of Ardabil and Mehr physiotherapy center in 2013. Thirty diabetic patients after initial pilot study participated in this experiment based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, they were randomly assigned into two equal groups, electromagnetic therapy and control. The baseline levels of ABI and NO of both groups were measured. Patients in electromagnetic group were exposed to 10 Hz EMF radiation (with intensity of 8 mT) together with scanning lower limbs (three sessions per week, and 40 minutes per session for 8 weeks). The control group did not receive any treatment. After eight weeks, the amount of ABI and NO level were recorded. For statistical analysis paired t-test and independent t-test were used in SPSS 19 software.   Results: Statistical analysis showed significant differences between pre (1. 009 ± 0. 02) and post (1. 052 ± 0. 02) measurement of ABI of diabetic patient after applying magnetic field (P = 0. 013).

40|$|The MAX IV facility, {{currently}} {{under construction in}} Lund, Sweden, features two electron storage rings operated at 3 GeV and 1. 5 GeV and optimized for the hard X-ray and soft X-ray/VUV spectral ranges, respectively. A 3 GeV linear accelerator serves as a full-energy injector into both rings {{as well as a}} driver for a short-pulse facility, in which undulators produce X-ray pulses as short as 100 fs. The 3 GeV ring employs a multibend achromat (MBA) lattice to achieve, in a relatively short circumference of 528 m, a bare lattice emittance of 0. 33 nm rad, which reduces to 0. 2 nm rad as insertion devices are added. The engineering implementation of the MBA lattice raises several technological problems. The large number of strong magnets per achromat calls for a compact design featuring small-gap combined-function <b>magnets</b> <b>grouped</b> into cells and sharing a common iron yoke. The small apertures lead to a low-conductance vacuum chamber design that relies on the chamber itself as a distributed copper absorber for the heat deposited by synchrotron radiation, while non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating provides for reduced photodesorption yields and distributed pumping. Finally, a low main frequency (100 MHz) is chosen for the RF system yielding long bunches, which are further elongated by passively operated third-harmonic Landau cavities, thus alleviating collective effects, both coherent (e. g. resistive wall instabilities) and incoherent (intrabeam scattering). In this paper, we focus on the MAX IV 3 GeV ring and present the lattice design as well as the engineering solutions to the challenges inherent to such a design. As the first realisation of a light source based on the MBA concept, the MAX IV 3 GeV ring offers an opportunity for validation of concepts that are likely to be essential ingredients of future diffraction-limited light sources...|$|R
