Later, the samples of their process writing work in Advanced Reading and Writing Course I are scanned to find expressions revealing their ideas about gender stereotypes and gender roles. These expressions and their frequency are listed. It is thought that this study will reveal gender stereotypes and roles shared by the average language students at universities.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that there are big parallelisms between the imbalances and trends that existed in the societies of 1985 and 2007 (when the novels were written) and the issues that strongly inspired both authors and which are dealt with in both dystopian novels. Les novel•les distòpiques escrites per Sarah Hall The Carhullan Army i The Handmaid's Tale de Margaret Atwood, especulen amb un món futur pessimista en què homes, dones, la societat en el seu conjunt i el medi natural pateixen grans retrocessos i desastres respecte al món actual en el que vivim. L'objectiu d'aquest treball és demostrar que hi ha grans paral•lelismes entre els desequilibris i tendències que hi havia a les societats de 1985 i 2007 (quan es van escriure les novel•les) i els temes que van inspirar fortament a ambdues autoraes i que s'aborden en les dues novel•les distòpiques...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} toxic masculinity {{is used in}} the social {{sciences}} to highlight the idea that some traditional norms of masculine behavior - ideas of how men should behave - are in fact harmful to <b>men,</b> <b>women</b> and <b>society</b> overall. Terry Kupers, a professor at The Wright Institute school of psychology, defines toxic masculinity as [...] "the constellation of socially regressive male traits that serve to foster domination, the devaluation of women, homophobia and wanton violence". The concept of toxic masculinity is not intended to demonize men or male attributes, but rather to emphasize the harmful effects of conformity to certain traditional masculine ideal behaviors such as dominance, self-reliance, and competition.|$|R

On this account women's subordination is a function of class oppression, maintained (like racism) because it serves the interests of capital and the ruling class; it divides <b>men</b> against <b>women,</b> privileges working class men relatively within the capitalist system in order to secure their support; and legitimates the capitalist class's refusal to pay for the domestic labor assigned, unpaid, to women.|$|R

It shows clearly that the traditionally negative correlation between wealth and social development {{on the one hand}} and fertility on the other no longer holds once a society has reached a certain level of development. Today more children are born in the countries with the most advanced social systems in regard to gender equality. Based on this result, we propose to discuss the problem of low-fertility countries from a different point of view. Neither child benefits nor other sources of financial aid appear to motivate people in modern industrial societies to have more children.
