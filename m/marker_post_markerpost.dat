50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{road signs}} show {{distances}} in miles and location <b>marker</b> <b>posts</b> {{that are used}} for reference purposes by road engineers and emergency services show distance references in unspecified units which are kilometre-based.The advent of the mobile phone {{has been instrumental in}} the British Department for Transport authorising the use of driver location signs to convey the distance reference information of location <b>marker</b> <b>posts</b> to road users should they need to contact the emergency services.|$|R

40|$|Hollow {{metal and}} plastic (PVC) pipes and posts are found {{throughout}} the world and serve a variety of purposes. Wildlife (birds, reptiles, small mammals) mortalities, including species of conservation concern, have been documented in mine claim <b>marker</b> <b>posts</b> (Brattstrom 1995, Lahontan and Red Rock Audubon Societies 2009) which resulted in passing a law in Nevada that called {{for the removal of}} all PVC mine claim markers across the state (American Bird Conservancy 2011).

50|$|Research {{on trial}} {{sections}} of motorways showed that emergency service organisations responded 10 percent more rapidly when a motorway had driver location signs {{than when it}} did not. Driver locations signs are more visible than the small distance <b>marker</b> <b>posts,</b> enabling motorists to know their location more accurately and emergency services to reach incidents more quickly. The analysis of an exercise run by the Highways Agency (Exercise Hermes) in which a serious traffic accident was simulated reported that call handlers in control rooms should request <b>marker</b> <b>post</b> or location sign locations when taking calls {{from members of the}} public.|$|R
50|$|The number used on {{distance}} <b>marker</b> <b>posts</b> is also encoded {{into the}} numbers associated with motorway emergency roadside telephones. In this way motorway control centre staff can pinpoint the telephone {{from which a}} call is being made.|$|R

50|$|The {{area was}} {{historically}} prone to serious flooding from the River Frome, notably in 1882 and 1889. There are still four Victorian flood <b>marker</b> <b>posts.</b> It {{was also a}} source of water supply {{for the city of}} Bristol through the Quay Pipe and The Boiling Wells.|$|R

50|$|Mountain bike {{trails are}} {{developed}} in the forest by Hamsterley Trailblazers which were constituted on 5 January 2004.

25|$|During design, planning, {{maintenance}} and construction, metric is used. As a result, (and anticipating that the roadsigns themselves {{will one day}} be changed to display in metric units) recently erected signs are increasingly being placed at metric intervals but display an imperial unit as required by the current road-signage rules. For example, a 110yd marker might actually be placed at the 100m distance. Since 2008, location <b>marker</b> <b>posts</b> have appeared on motorways and major A roads in England, situated generally at intervals of 500 metres (though the dimension is not given). These repeat the information given on the co-sited surveyors' <b>marker</b> <b>post</b> which, since the 1960s, have reported distances on such roads in kilometres from a datum—usually the start of the road, or the planned start-point of the road.|$|R
50|$|Numbered {{location}} markers of one type or another {{are used to}} identify specific locations along a road. Historically, milestones were used, but since the early 20th century they fell into disuse. However, for administrative and maintenance purposes, distance <b>marker</b> <b>posts</b> and driver location signs have been erected on motorways and certain dual carriageways.The numbers on distance <b>marker</b> <b>posts</b> are embedded into emergency roadside telephone numbers and are used by the emergency services to pinpoint incidents.The advent of the mobile phone meant that location information embedded into motorway emergency telephone systems was not being accessed by drivers and since 2007 driver location signs have been erected on many motorways. These contain important information about the location and carriageway direction, and the reference number should be quoted in full when contacting the emergency services.|$|R

2500|$|The name Manukau, {{from the}} Manukau Harbour {{west of the}} city, is of Māori origin, and means [...] "wading birds", {{although}} {{it has been suggested that}} the name of the harbour was also sometimes rendered as Mānuka, meaning a <b>marker</b> <b>post</b> with which an early chief is said to have claimed the area.|$|R
5000|$|Coal-tax <b>posts</b> are <b>marker</b> <b>posts</b> {{found in}} {{southern}} England. They were erected in the 1860s and form an irregular loop between 12 and 18 miles from London {{to mark the}} points where taxes on coal were due to the Corporation of London. There were originally around 280 posts of which around 210 remain.|$|R
