The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound).

In this study, we tested whether exposure to conspecifics alters the number of brain mast cells in male rats, and then investigated the nature of stimuli influencing the changes observed in the number and localization of brain mast cells. Five days of cohabitation with an ovariectomized, estrogen–progesterone (OVX � EP) treated female resulted in {{the largest number of}} thalamic mast cells, while pairing with such a female physically separated by a wire mesh or with a novel male produced a smaller, but significant increase over other pairings (OVX females for 5 days, OVX and OVX � EP females for 1 day, familiar or isolated males for 5 days).

The thalamus was stained immunocytochemically for parvalbumin and 28 kDa calbindin in normals and in brains in which retrogradely transported tracers were injected into middle layers of auditory cortical areas or {{applied to the}} cortical surface. Parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive cells show a complementary distribution in ventral, anterodorsal, posterodorsal, and magnocellular <b>medial</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The ventral nucleus has a high density of parvalbumin cells and few calbindin cells, and the anterodorsal nucleus has a high density of parvalbumin cells and moderate numbers of calbindin cells, Both nuclei have a dense parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuropil formed by terminations of fibers ascending in the brachium of the inferior colliculus. The posterodorsal nucleus has approximately equal proportions of parvalbumin and calbindin cells; neuropil staining is weak but contains terminations of calbindin-immunoreactive fibers ascending in the midbrain tegmentum. The magnocellular nucleus contains domains of parvalbumin and calbindin cells. Parvalbumin cells in the ventral nucleus project to a central core of auditory cortex with densest parvalbumin immunoreactivity.

Previous to this study, however, the lack of three-dimensional (3 -D) probability maps precluded comparing the anatomical precision of MRI studies with microscopically defined fiber tracts in human postmortem brains. The present study provides 3 -D registered maps of the topography, course and intersubject variability of major fiber tracts, which were identified at microscopic resolution. The analyzed tracts include the corticospinal tract, optic and acoustic radiations, fornix, cingulum, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal, superior and inferior occipito-frontal and uncinate fascicles; sources and targets of fiber tracts include the lateral and <b>medial</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei</b> and mamillary bodies.

The individual fiber tracts and nuclei were superimposed in the reference space, and probability maps were generated as a quantitative measure of intersubject variability for each voxel of the stereotaxic space. This study presents the first stereotaxic atlas of the course, location and extent of fiber tracts and related nuclei based on microscopically defined localization and topographic data taken at multiple levels {{on each of the}} three orthogonal planes.

40|$|Rats with a {{bilateral}} neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion (NVHL) {{are used as}} models of neurobiological aspects of schizophrenia. In view of their decreased number of GABAergic interneurons, we hypothesized that they would show increased reactivity to acoustic stimuli. We systematically characterized the acoustic reactivity of NVHL rats and sham operated controls. They were behaviourally observed during a loud white noise. A first cohort of 7 months` old rats was studied. Then the observations were reproduced in a second cohort {{of the same age}} after characterizing the reactivity of the same rats to dopaminergic drugs. A third cohort of rats was studied at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months. In subsets of lesioned and control rats, inferior colliculus auditory evoked potentials were recorded. A significant proportion of rats (50 - 62 %) showed aberrant audiogenic responses with explosive wild running resembling the initial phase of audiogenic seizures. This was not correlated with their well-known enhanced reactivity to dopaminergic drugs. The proportion of rats showing this strong reaction increased with rats` age. After the cessation of the noise, NVHL rats showed a long freezing period that did neither depend {{on the size of the}} lesion nor on the rats` age. The initial negative deflection of the auditory evoked potential was enhanced in the inferior colliculus of only NVHL rats that displayed wild running. Complementary anatomical investigations using X-ray scans in the living animal, and alizarin red staining of brain slices, revealed a thin layer of calcium deposit close to the <b>medial</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei</b> in post-NVHL rats, raising the possibility that this may contribute to the hyper-reactivity to sounds seen in these animals. The findings of this study provide complementary information with potential relevance for the hyper-reactivity noted in patients with schizophrenia, and therefore a tool to investigate the underlying biology of this endophenotype.

40|$|The <b>medial</b> <b>geniculate</b> body (MGB) of the {{thalamus}} is a {{key component}} of the auditory system. It is involved in relaying and transforming auditory information to the cortex and in top-down modulation of processing in the midbrain, brainstem, and ear. Functional imaging investigations of this region in humans, however, have been limited by the difficulty of distinguishing MGB from other thalamic nuclei. Here, we introduce two methods for reliably delineating MGB anatomically in individuals based on conventional and diffusion MRI data. The first uses high-resolution proton density weighted scanning optimized for subcortical grey-white contrast. The second uses diffusion-weighted imaging and probabilistic tractography to automatically segment the <b>medial</b> and lateral <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei</b> from surrounding structures based on their distinctive patterns of connectivity {{to the rest of the}} brain.

Importantly, both methods rely on commonly available imaging sequences and standard hardware, a significant advantage over previously described approaches.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an account of}} past and current research on spiny inverted neurons – alternatively also known as ‘inverted pyramidal neurons’– in rats, rabbits and cats. In our laboratory, we have studied these cells with a battery of techniques suited for light and electron microscopy, including Nissl staining, Golgi impregnation, dye intracellular filling and axon retrograde track-tracing. Our results show that spiny inverted neurons make up less than 8. 5 and 5. 5 % of all cortical neurons in the primary and secondary rabbit visual cortex, respectively. Infragranular spiny inverted neurons constitute 15 and 8. 5 % of infragranular neurons in the same animal and areas. Spiny inverted neurons congregate at layers V–VI in all studied species. Studies have also revealed that spiny inverted neurons are excitatory neurons which furnish axons for various cortico-cortical, cortico-claustral and cortico-striatal projections, but not for non-telencephalic centres such as the lateral and <b>medial</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei,</b> the colliculi or the pons. As a group, each subset of inverted cells contributing to a given projection is located below the pyramidal neurons whose axons furnish the same centre. Spiny inverted neurons are particularly conspicuous {{as a source of}} the backward cortico-cortical projection to primary visual cortex and from this to the claustrum. Indeed, they constitute up to 82 % of the infragranular cells that furnish these projections. Spiny inverted neurons may be classified into three subtypes according to the point of origin of the axon on the cell: the somatic basal pole which faces the cortical outer surface, the somatic flank and the reverse apical dendrite. As seen with electron microscopy, the axon initial segments of these subtypes are distinct from one another, not only in length and thickness, but also in the number of received synaptic boutons. All of these anatomical features together may support a synaptic-input integration which is peculiar to spiny inverted neurons. In this way, two differently qualified streams of axonal output may coexist in a projection which arises from a particular infragranular point within a given cortical area; one stream would be furnished by the typical pyramidal neurons, whereas spiny inverted neurons would constitute the other source of distinct information flow...|$|R
40|$|The slow (< 1 Hz) rhythm is an {{electroencephalogram}} {{hallmark of}} resting sleep. In thalamocortical neurons this rhythm correlates {{with a slow}} (< 1 Hz) oscillation comprising recurring UP and DOWN membrane potential states. Recently, we showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor activation brings about an intrinsic slow oscillation in thalamocortical neurons of the cat dorsal lateral <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus</b> in vitro which is identical to that observed in vivo. The {{aim of this study}} was to further assess the properties of this oscillation and compare them with those observed in thalamocortical neurons of three other thalamic nuclei in the cat (ventrobasal complex, <b>medial</b> <b>geniculate</b> body; ventral lateral nucleus) and two thalamic nuclei in rats and mice (lateral <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus</b> and ventrobasal complex). Slow oscillations were evident in all of these additional structures and shared several basic properties including, i) the stereotypical, rhythmic alternation between distinct UP and DOWN states with the UP state always commencing with a low-threshold Ca 2 + potential, and ii) an inverse relationship between frequency and injected current so that slow oscillations always increase in frequency with hyperpolarization, often culminating in delta (?) activity at 1 – 4 Hz. However, beyond these common properties there were important differences in expression between different nuclei. Most notably, 44 % of slow oscillations in the cat lateral <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus</b> possessed UP states that comprised sustained tonic firing and/or high-threshold bursting. In contrast, slow oscillations in cat ventrobasal complex, <b>medial</b> <b>geniculate</b> body and ventral lateral nucleus thalamocortical neurons exhibited such UP states in only 16 %, 11 % and 10 % of cases, respectively, whereas slow oscillations in the lateral <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus</b> and ventrobasal complex of rats and mice did so in < 12 % of cases. Thus, the slow oscillation is a common feature of thalamocortical neurons that displays clear species- and nuclei-related differences.

40|$|The {{striatum}} projection neurons are striatonigral and striatopallidal medium sized-spiny neurons (MSNs) that preferentially express D 1 (D 1 R) and D 2 (D 2 R) dopamine receptors, respectively. It {{is generally}} assumed that these neurons are physically intermingled, without cytoarchitectural organization although {{this has not}} been tested. To address this question we used BAC transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescence (EGFP) under the control of Drd 1 a or Drd 2 promoter and spatial point pattern statistics. We demonstrate that D 1 R- and D 2 R-expressing MSNs are randomly distributed in most of the dorsal striatum, whereas a specific region in the caudal striatum, adjacent to the GPe, appears to lack neurons expressing markers for indirect pathway neurons. This area comprises almost exclusively D 1 R-expressing MSNs. These neurons receive excitatory inputs from the primary auditory cortex and the <b>medial</b> <b>geniculate</b> thalamic <b>nucleus</b> and a rich dopamine innervation. This area contains cholinergic and GABAergic interneurons but apparently no D 2 R/A 2 aR modulation because no fluorescence was detected in the neuropil in Drd 2 -EGFP, Drd 2 -Cre and Adora-Cre BAC reporter mice. This striatal area that expresses calbindin-D 28 K, VGluT 1 and 2, is poor in &# 181; opiate receptors and preproenkephalin. Altogether, the differences observed in D 1 R-MSNs, D 2 R-MSNs and interneurons densities, as well as the anatomical segregation of D 1 R- and D 2 R/A 2 aR-expressing MSNs suggest that there are regional differences in the organization of the striatum...|$|R

Further, we show that pharmacological blockade of NMDAR-driven synaptic plasticity, NOS activation, or PKG signaling in the LA significantly impairs high-frequency stimulation-(HFS-) induced ERK activation and IEG expression in both regions, while blockade of extracellular NO signaling in the LA impairs HFS-induced ERK activation and IEG expression exclusively in the MGm/PIN. These findings suggest that NMDAR-driven synaptic plasticity and NO-cGMP-PKG signaling within the LA coordinately regulate ERK-driven gene expression in both the LA and the MGm/PIN following LTP induction at thalamo-LA synapses, and that synaptic plasticity in the LA promotes ERK-driven transcription in MGm/PIN neurons via NO-driven “retrograde signaling”...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} thalamic nuclei have been recognized: first order, which relay {{information}} from subcortical sources, and higher order, which may relay information from one cortical area to another.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the role of}} the thalamic <b>medial</b> <b>geniculate</b> (MG) <b>nucleus</b> in discriminative avoidance learning, wherein rabbits acquire a locomotory response to a tone [conditioned stimulus (CS) �] to avoid a foot shock, and they learn to ignore a different tone (CS�) not predictive of foot shock. Limbic (anterior and medial dorsal) thalamic, cingulate cortical, or amygdalar lesions severely impair acquisition, and neurons in these areas develop training-induced activity (TIA) : more firing to the CS � than to the CS�. MG neurons exhibit TIA during learning and project to the amygdala. The MG neurons may supply afferents essential for amygdalar and cingulothalamic TIA and for avoidance learning. To test this hypothesis, bilateral electrolytic or excitotoxic ibotenic acid MG nuclear lesions were induced, and multiunit recording electrodes were chronically implanted into the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, the anterior-ventral and medial-dorsal thalamic nuclei, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala before training. Learning was severely impaired and TIA was abolished in all areas in rabbits with lesions. Thus learning and TIA require the integrity of the MG nucleus. Only damage in the medial MG division was significantly correlated with the learning deficit. The lesions abolished the sensory response of amygdalar neurons, and they attenuated (but did not eliminate) the sensory response of cingulothalamic neurons, suggesting the existence of extra geniculate sources of auditory transmission to the cingulothalamic areas.
