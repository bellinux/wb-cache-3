5|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, {{the second season}} of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings. By December 2009, the average episode viewership was 5.3 <b>million</b> <b>households.</b> The average was lower than the other NBC comedy shows that aired Thursday night along with Parks and Recreation: Community drew an average 6.5 <b>million</b> <b>households,</b> 30 Rock an average 7.3 million, and The Office an average 10.1 million. By February 2010, ratings had begun to improve all of NBC's Thursday comedy shows, especially Parks and Recreation, but the network remained in fourth place among the major networks in Nielsen ratings. By {{the end of the}} season, the average viewership for the 24 episodes of season two was 4.68 million, lower than season one's average of 5.45 <b>million</b> <b>households.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parks and Recreations premiere {{was seen}} in 6.77 <b>million</b> <b>households.</b> Media outlets {{described}} this as a solid result, comparable to the average Nielsen ratings for 30 Rock, another Thursday-night show on NBC. However, viewership declined almost every week {{over the rest of}} the season, culminating in a season low of 4.25 <b>million</b> <b>households</b> for the final episode. The average first season viewership was 5.45 <b>million</b> <b>households</b> per episode. The Office experienced similarly poor ratings during its first season and later became a success. However, the low viewership presented a greater challenge for Parks and Recreation because NBC now trailed CBS, ABC and Fox in the ratings, and the move of comedian Jay Leno from The Tonight Show to a variety show in NBC's 10 p.m. weeknight slot left less room on the network's primetime schedule.|$|E
