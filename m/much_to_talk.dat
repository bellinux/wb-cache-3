For the album, Minaj desired {{to return to her}} hip-hop roots, calling the album's sound [...] "a {{continuation}} of [...] with a lot more". Minaj told MTV News that the sound of The Pinkprint would be [...] "next level" [...] and will have [...] "so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about", saying: [...] "I'm really excited and the people that have been working with me now, have been people that I haven't worked with before so it's like they're bringing a new sound to the album that I've never experimented with." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Sokol, Bryan Sokol, and John Waldman {{all of the}} {{professional}} wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer reviewed the Impact! episodes involving the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament. For the first round, Chris said the bout between The Motor City Machine Guns and the team of Tyson Dux and Daivari [...] "was a really good match." [...] Meanwhile, Waldman reviewed the match between Team Japan and Team Mexico, in which he stated [...] "the action is fast paced and unlike anything we see on North American TV." [...] Bryan Sokol reviewed the first two standard matches of round two, with him commenting {{on the encounter between}} Bucanero and Koslov as being an [...] "overall quick match with not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about", but did not give an opinion on the Milano Collection A.T. versus Curry Man bout. Bryan and Chris Sokol reviewed the last two standard matches of round two together, with them saying that the contest pitting Masato Yoshino against Doug Williams was a [...] "nice back and forth match." [...] Neither gave their opinion on Kaz versus Último Guerrero in their review.|$|E
500|$|Critics responded {{positively}} to the film. In {{an article in}} The Times David Chater awarded the programme the TV choice of the day, describing it as [...] "tremendous", and [...] "the wonderful surprise of Christmas". The film was described in The Telegraph as a [...] "rare treat", as it is [...] "something that teenagers and parents can watch together". This view was shared by producer Anne Brogan, {{who said that the}} film was something [...] "that parents and children will enjoy watching while giving them <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about". Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, said Stevenson was [...] "good as a woman who was far more comfortable in the past than the present", and that [...] "her performance was more than matched by that of Dakota Blue Richards as April, mostly banked-down and wary but prone to sudden wild flashes of anger". He criticised some of the [...] "implausibilities", saying that the plot was, at times, [...] "a lot kinder than the world might have been", but said that [...] "it still made you well up with its final reconciliation" [...] with emotion that had been [...] "honestly earned". Euan Ferguson, in an article in The Guardian, said that the film [...] "hooked and haunted", and added that Stevenson played Marion like [...] "a kind of updated" [...] Jean Brodie.|$|E
60|$|Graham's {{answer was}} inarticulate assent. He {{tried to see}} the old man but the {{darkness}} hid his face. He wanted very <b>much</b> <b>to</b> respond, <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> {{but he did not}} know how to begin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Tom! that's your chief fault. You {{are always}} {{inclined}} <b>to</b> think too <b>much,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> too little. Now I, on the contrary, am always--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Friend Lion," [...] {{retorted}} the dog, [...] "if I hadn't lost my growl, {{you would}} hear it now. I have as <b>much</b> right <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{as you have}} to sleep." ...|$|R
2500|$|Oliver Sykes' lyrics has {{a strong}} feeling of {{catharsis}} for him, he mainly draws from personal experience and has likened the band's live performances to being therapeutic. In 2006, {{when asked about the}} lyrics of Count Your Blessings, as they had been criticised for their content solely fixated on heartbreak to other themes that were called [...] "shallow and meaningless", he responded [...] "My life's never been that bad so I’ve not got that <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about".|$|E
2500|$|The {{arrival of}} the largest party of missionaries ever sent to China—as well as their intent to be dressed in native clothing—gave the foreign {{settlement}} in Shanghai <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about and some criticism began for the young China Inland Mission. [...] The party donned Chinese clothing, notwithstanding—even the women missionaries—which was deemed semi-scandalous at the time. When other missionaries sought to preserve their British ways, Taylor {{was convinced that the}} Gospel would only take root on Chinese soil if missionaries were willing to affirm the culture of the people they were seeking to reach. He argued, from the example of the Apostle Paul, [...] "Let us in everything not sinful become like the Chinese, that by all means we may save some." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I {{think we}} had all better {{separate}} and go quietly to bed early. We may have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about tomorrow; and tonight I want to think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your gallantry {{is really}} unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)--nobody speaks except ourselves, {{and it is}} rather too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> {{nonsense}} for the entertainment of seven silent people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some day," [...] she said, [...] "not in the {{restaurant}} here but when we are alone and have time, I should so <b>much</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with you on really serious matters." ...|$|R
60|$|Lemarchant laughed, and lit his cigar; {{but after}} that, somehow, {{the other men}} didn't <b>much</b> care <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him in an {{ordinary}} way more than was necessary for the carrying out of the ship's business.|$|R
6000|$|We'll to our {{chairs for}} we have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of, [...] And we have Ullad and Muirthemne, and here [...] Is Conall Muirthemne {{in the nick}} of time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks, awfully, Bob," [...] said Mike. And {{after that}} {{there seemed to}} be nothing <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. So Mike edged out of the room, and tore across to Wain's.|$|E
6000|$|... "We talked," [...] said Mabel, with a frank glance. [...] "There was <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about and}} all was rather wonderful. Perhaps this looks extravagant, but I don't think it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You might, at any rate, confine {{yourself}} to sense, Lord Kilcullen, when I am taking so <b>much</b> pains <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> sensibly <b>to</b> you, {{on a subject}} which, I presume, cannot but interest you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! and it's <b>much</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> than <b>to</b> bear either,' said Madame, {{rubbing her}} nose with much {{irritability}} of manner. 'There, {{get to your}} work, child, and put the things in order, do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Marble, {{you have}} too <b>much</b> sense <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> in this manner. It is, fortunately, {{not too late to}} change your mind; and I will let it be {{understood}} that you did so at my persuasion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, {{as far as}} I am concerned, sir," [...] Ronald said. [...] "It was the Fingoes' doing altogether, and they could have managed as well, indeed better, without me." ...|$|E
60|$|Chisholm had not {{stipulated that}} nobody should be told and Flora's friends had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. Mabel Hilliard was disturbed, and when Marston {{came to her}} mother's house one evening {{took him to the}} garden.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you tell}} me about it, Uncle?" [...] Oswald asked. [...] "My father cares not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of it; and though I know that he fought there, he has never told me the story of the battle." ...|$|E
60|$|We did {{not have}} <b>much</b> time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over family affairs but {{it was good to}} see them even for a few moments and to know that mother was slowly regaining the use of her limbs.|$|R
60|$|Felix {{had never}} before felt so hopeful about Fulbert; but still he was too <b>much</b> overset <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Cherry, and hurried her off to bed, soon {{following}} her example, for he had not the heart to see Lance that night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{into the}} {{conservatory}} {{for a few}} minutes," [...] he begged. [...] "You know that I take no wine and I prefer not to return into the dining room. I would like so <b>much</b> instead <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you before you see Sir Charles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I will dance this one," [...] said Mrs. Peagrim surprisingly. [...] "I'm {{sure you}} two must have ever so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. Why don't you take Sir Derek {{and give him}} a cup of coffee?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{lingered in}} the old garden until twilight, sweet as dusk in Eden must have been, crept over it. There was so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over and recall--things said and done and heard and thought and felt and misunderstood.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not like}} the {{prospect}} of affairs," [...] said Mr. Sidney Wilton to Endymion as they were posting up to London from Montfort Castle; a long journey, but softened in those days by many luxuries, and they had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Catholic Herald newspaper published in December 2008, he {{was reported to have}} said that it does not make <b>much</b> sense <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about salvation <b>to</b> young people [...] "unless you speak in their own language." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{it seems}} so absurd <b>to</b> think of, <b>much</b> more <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of, his going wrong or running away! The first thing I've got to do, Samuel, {{is to go to}} the police-office, report the case, and hear what they have to advise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because the Almighty {{sent the}} rain {{at the very}} moment," [...] said Harry, {{striking}} the top rail {{of one of the}} pens with his fist. [...] "I'm not <b>much</b> given <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Providence, but this looks like it, does it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Sylvia," [...] said I, [...] "we {{have had}} so much to do and so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, and so much to think about and plan, that I have had no chance to finish the story of Tomaso and Lucilla." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely. It {{would have}} been a misfortune if you had visited my chateau and I had been unable to have a word with you. I have had to do with many German soldiers, but never with an officer before. I have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you about." ...|$|E
60|$|After supper, {{when the}} Crees and voyageurs had rolled into their blankets, snoring, {{the two men}} lingered by the dying fire. There was <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about,--wars and {{politics}} and explorations, the doings of men and the happening of things, mutual friends, marriages, deaths,--five years of history for which Fairfax clamored.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, Miss Eden, let us stay at home, {{and have}} a morning to {{ourselves}} in the garden. We have not yet had <b>much</b> time <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> as I am generally rather tired in the evenings. And besides, what I wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about {{is one of my}} secrets, and it could not be mentioned before another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} that you did from the first," [...] said Lenore. [...] "And {{it would make it}} <b>much</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you than to any outsider, who would never understand, even if it were {{possible}} for me to explain, {{how hard it is to}} see which way my duty lies--especially filial." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Lucy was {{resolved}} {{that she would}} not tell anything. [...] "I am so wretched!" [...] That would have been all; but she would not tell her wretchedness. [...] "We are so quiet in Kingsbury Crescent," [...] she said; [...] "you have so <b>much</b> more <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of." ...|$|R
