Kennedy, his brother, Kennedy replied, [...] "Well, that. But it makes <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> what they might do to me too." [...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world." [...] Greenfield later said, [...] "I could not {{for the life of me}} understand that callousness until, of course, I realized he had been thinking of the death of his brother." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics commended the {{development}} of the relationship between Maggie Green and Glenn. Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun stated that the storyline epitomized a [...] "steamy romance", while The Wall Street Journal Aaron Rutkoff called it [...] "the funniest moment of the series." [...] Goldman opined that their sexual encounter felt genuine; [...] "He's a nice guy, she seems like a cool gal, and it felt genuine when she noted she felt plenty lonely too and ready for some companionship." [...] Nick Venable of Cinema Blend asserted that the interactions between Maggie and Glenn was the highlight of the episode. [...] "I'm glad the writers are introducing this comic book plot point, as this show seriously needs a couple without closets full of skeletons. When Glenn accidentally grabs a box of condoms for Maggie to see, I chuckled heartily. The ensuing conversation also made me smile, which makes <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> why humor is paid the least amount of attention on the show." [...] Jackson was surprised with the scene, and called it [...] "unexpected". Jen Chenay of The Washington Post compared Glenn to Little Mikey from the Life advertisements, and summated: [...] "He has assumed this role without much choice in the matter, but he has done so with a certain quiet, occasionally petrified, baseball-cap-wearing dignity that makes him admirable." ...|$|E
2500|$|After re-reading {{it again}} in 2010, over ten years after its publication, DeLillo commented that re-reading it [...] "made <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> whether I {{would be capable of}} that kind of writing now – the range and scope of it. There are certain parts of the book where the exuberance, the extravagance, I don’t know, the overindulgence....There are city scenes in New York that seem to transcend reality in a certain way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Summarizing {{the media}} {{response}} to the speech, Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz wrote, [...] "Not surprisingly, most liberals loved the speech and many conservatives — though not all — lambasted it. ... the reaction {{on the left and}} right sometimes made <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> whether these pundits were watching the same speech. The only point of agreement I found is skepticism that it will help Obama with white, working-class voters, sometimes short-handed as Reagan Democrats." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2009, National Public Radio (NPR), {{relying on}} {{information}} {{obtained from the}} CIA World Factbook, put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on State Department and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction. Chuck Holmes, foreign editor for NPR Digital, said, [...] "I'm surprised and displeased, and it makes <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> what other information is out-of-date or incorrect in the CIA World Factbook." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “In the Stenhouse {{works in}} Barrhead, {{the workers were}} solid {{supporters}} of Chartism, the big movement founded [...] to get votes for working people. Here they were all solid Chartists, solid radicals, so radical even the tulips are radical, because the works manager, his pride and joy were his tulips. They were all beautiful, they all had names, all had pedigrees and his best, his beautiful, tallest, most symmetrical tulips were all named after his favourite radical politicians. So if you're having a works manager who's a convinced radical, maybe the Stenhouses who own the place are a bit radical. Which makes <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> if Helen drank in her radical politics from her mother's milk.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1997, then-president of Alma College, Alan Stone, asked 480 {{colleges to}} boycott the U.S. News & World Report Rankings due to the peer {{assessment}} survey which counts for 22.5% of a college's ranking. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, in 1996, Alma College surveyed 158 colleges about the rankings. The result of the survey indicated that [...] "84 per cent of the respondents admitted that they were unfamiliar {{with some of the}} institutions they had been asked to rank. Almost 44 per cent indicated that they 'tended to leave responses for unfamiliar schools blank.' [...] " [...] Stone stated, [...] "this makes <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> just how many votes are being considered for each school's academic-reputation ranking." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{wrote that}} many of his critics mischaracterize the {{argument}} he puts forth in his essay {{in a manner similar to}} what Rosenfeld wrote was an erroneous portrayal in The New York Times. He explains: [...] "Since I never once referred to 'liberalism', called no one a 'Jewish anti-Semite' or 'self-hating Jew', said nothing about Democrats or the Iraq war, and made no attempt to 'silence' anyone, this Kafkaesque bill of indictment makes <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> what is at play here – illiteracy, dishonesty, or worse? As Bret Stephens recently put it, 'How does joining a debate become an effort to suppress it?' Rosenfeld denied it, stating that, [...] "Nobody's being silenced.... I think its a red herring to talk about silencing, this debate in fact is evidence of a robust and open discussion".|$|E
2500|$|... "Then {{the white}} man who had {{introduced}} Sitting Bull arose again {{and said he would}} interpret what the chief had said. [...] He then started telling the audience all about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, generally spoken as the ‘Custer massacre.’ [...] He [...] mentioned how the Sioux were all prepared for battle, and how they had swooped down on Custer and wiped his soldiers all out. [...] He told so many lies that I had to smile. [...] Then {{the white man}} said that all those who wished to shake hands with Sitting Bull would please line up if they cared to meet the man who had killed Custer. [...] It made <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> what sort of people the whites were, anyway. [...] Perhaps they were glad to have Custer killed, and were really pleased to shake the hand with the man who had killed him!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the film in its original, longer form was almost entirely negative. Many critics responded unfavorably to the film's long running time and sprawling nature. Roger Ebert described the Cannes screening as [...] "The most disastrous since, yes, The Brown Bunny." [...] Salon.com critic Andrew O'Hehir called the Cannes cut [...] "about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen." [...] Jason Solomons, in The Observer (UK), said that [...] "Southland Tales was so bad it made <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> if [...] had ever met a human being" [...] and that ten minutes of the [...] "sprawling, plotless, post-apocalyptic farrago" [...] gave him the [...] "sinking feeling {{that this may be}} one of the worst films ever presented in [...] competition." [...] A handful of the American and European critics, however, were more positive. The Village Voice critic J. Hoberman, for example, called Southland Tales [...] "a visionary film about the end of times" [...] comparable in recent American film only to David Lynch's [...] Mulholland Drive.|$|E
60|$|He {{promised me}} {{in a way}} that made <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> if he would ever sleep again or turn his back on anyone--made <b>me</b> <b>wonder</b> too, at the menace in his voice. Steele seemed likely to be torn two ways, and already there was a hint of future desperation.|$|E

60|$|This was all Greek to me, {{and after}} {{receiving}} the order, I stood staring about <b>me,</b> <b>wondering</b> {{what it was that}} was to be done. But the mate had turned on his heel, and made no explanations. At length I followed after him, and asked what I must do.|$|R

60|$|Between her agitation, and {{her natural}} awkwardness in {{getting out of}} the cart, Peggotty was making a most {{extraordinary}} festoon of herself, but I felt too blank and strange to tell her so.

60|$|Now, I looked round <b>me,</b> <b>wondering</b> whether I {{should tell}} the truth or hold my tongue, and as I looked my eyes met those of Saduko, who, cold and unconcerned, was seated among the captains, but at a little {{distance}} from any of them--a man apart; and I remembered that he and I alone knew {{the truth of the}} end of Umbelazi.|$|R

60|$|Then {{again she}} shrugged her {{shoulders}} and left <b>me</b> <b>wondering</b> what she meant by her dark sayings.

60|$|Then, {{without waiting}} to be thanked, he turned and {{disappeared}} among a crowd of Zulus, who were following us from curiosity, leaving <b>me</b> <b>wondering</b> whether or no Dingaan was right when he called this young man a liar.

60|$|I bade the man {{bring her}} to <b>me,</b> <b>wondering</b> who on earth she could be, for it is not usual for the Zulus to send women as messengers, and from whom she came. However, I knew exactly what she would be like, some hideous old hag smelling horribly of grease and other abominations, with a worn snake skin and some human bones tied about her.|$|R
