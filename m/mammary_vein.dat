40|$|Abstract Background More than 50 % of aortocoronary {{saphenous vein}} grafts are {{occluded}} 10 years after surgery. Intimal hyperplasia is the initial critical {{step in the}} progression toward occlusion. Internal mammary veins, which are physiologically prone to less hydrostatic pressure, may undergo an accelerated progression to intimal hyperplasia and thus be suitable for investigation of the mechanisms of aortocoronary vein graft disease. Methods Six minipigs underwent aortocoronary bypass grafting using standard cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. <b>Mammary</b> <b>vein</b> were grafted in a reversed manner from ascending aorta to left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The proximal LAD was ligated, rendering the anterior left ventricle vein graft-dependent. Minipigs were killed after 4 weeks, and vein grafts were harvested. Histological and immunohistological investigation were performed with respect to morphometric analysis, endothelial damage/dysfunction (v-Willebrand-factor (vWF)), smooth muscle cells (α-smooth actin) and proliferation rate (proliferation marker Ki 67). Results Mean intimal area of vein grafts was increased compared to ungrafted mammary veins. Intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts was characterized by massive accumulation of smooth muscle cells with a high proliferation rate and endothelial perturbation. Significant (p = 0. 001) intimal hyperplasia of the grafted <b>mammary</b> <b>vein</b> compared to the ungrafted <b>mammary</b> <b>vein</b> was found. These changes were absent in ungrafted mammary veins. Conclusion The present study demonstrates a pig model of aortocoronary vein graft intimal hyperplasia which is characterized by an accelerated progression within internal mammary veins. The model is suitable to investigate the pathophysiology of aortocoronary vein graft intimal hyperplasia as well as therapeutic approaches. </p...|$|E

40|$|Endothelin- 1 is a 21 -amino acid endothelial {{vasoconstrictor}} peptide {{that may}} be the physiological antagonist of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Endothelin- 1 (10 (- 11) - 3 x 10 (- 7) M) evoked potent contractions of isolated internal mammary arteries, internal <b>mammary</b> <b>veins,</b> and saphenous veins, which were enhanced in internal <b>mammary</b> <b>veins</b> as compared with internal mammary arteries (concentration shift, 6. 3 -fold; p less than 0. 05) but not in the saphenous veins. Endothelial removal augmented the response to the peptide (at 3 x 10 (- 7) M) in internal mammary arteries (p less than 0. 05) but not in veins. In the artery, EDRF released by acetylcholine or bradykinin reversed endothelin- 1 -induced contractions; in saphenous veins, both agonists were much less effective compared with the artery and veins contracted with norepinephrine (p less than 0. 005 - 0. 01). This inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxations in veins occurred at half-maximal contractions but was most prominent at maximal contractions to the peptide. Nitric oxide similarly inhibited contractions to endothelin- 1 and norepinephrine in internal mammary arteries, whereas in veins that were contracted with endothelin- 1 but not with norepinephrine, the relaxations were blunted (p less than 0. 005). The nitric oxide donor SIN- 1 and sodium nitroprusside induced complete relaxations of internal mammary arteries but were less effective in veins contracted with endothelin- 1 (p less than 0. 005). Thus, in normal human arteries, EDRF inhibits endothelin- 1 -induced contractions, whereas the peptide specifically attenuates the effects of EDRF and nitrovasodilators in veins. This may be important in pathological conditions associated with increased levels of endothelin- 1 and in veins used as coronary bypass grafts...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{concentrations}} of blood variables obtained simultaneously from the jugular and mammary veins of dairy cows. Eighty Holstein cows were divided into four equal groups: dry, low- (LY), medium- (MY) and high-yielding (HY). Blood insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and urea concentrations were measured. The jugular and <b>mammary</b> <b>vein</b> (J/M) ratio between concentrations of each variable was calculated. Differences between the groups of cows in concentrations of variables in the jugular vein were not in accordance with those obtained for the <b>mammary</b> <b>vein.</b> J/M values for insulin and glucose concentrations were above 1. 0 in all groups of cows. The ratios for NEFA and BHBA concentrations were under or equal to 1. 0 in dry and LY cows but above 1. 0 in the MY and HY groups, indicating that in MY and HY cows those metabolites are apparently utilised by the mammary gland. J/M values for urea were above 1. 0 in dry and LY cows but less than 1. 0 in groups MY and HY, indicating that in the latter case urea is apparently released by the mammary gland. In conclusion, J/M for NEFA, BHBA and urea may be useful for estimation of the critical point when the mammary gland receives insufficient energy precursors for its current activity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} carried out on the mammary glands taken from 3 bovine (the BălŃată Românească breed), all adults. The {{distribution}} of the venous vascular system of the mammary glands was emphasised by injecting into the venous system a solution obtained by mixing the commercial product “Palux” with blue dye, then keeping the glands in 5 % formaldehyde for 24 hours, and finally dissecting them. Due to its highly specific function – the production of milk, the mammary gland is endowed with a vascular system extremely complex from a morphological point of view. Given its complexity, our research and observations regarding the venous circulatory system of the mammary gland may be performed by {{taking into account the}} state of the mammary gland, namely whether it is functionally active or not. The mammary venous system originates in the network of the mammelonary venules in the anastomotic complex. The deep <b>mammary</b> <b>veins</b> have many tributary streams forming real trunks of vasculary veins which have an ascending trajectory, crossing the mammary parenchyma to reach the base of the corresponding mammary quarter.

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the diaphragmatic {{circulation}} {{was found to be}} composed of an internal arterial circle formed by the head to head anastomosis of the phrenic arteries and internal mammary arteries. Branches originating from the internal arterial circle anastomosed head to head with branches of the intercostal arteries (8 $ sp{ rm th}$ to 13 $ sp{ rm th}$ intercostal space) to form costophrenic arcades all along the muscular fibers of the crural and costal diaphragm. These anastomosis were found to be physiologically functional. Diaphragmatic circulation produced only by the intercostal arteries was able to sustain costal and crural contractility at the fatigue threshold (TTdi of 0. 20). However, internal mammary artery perfusion was only able to maintain costal contractility. Left and right hemidiaphragmatic arterial communications (shunting) were inexistant during electrophrenic unilateral and bilateral stimulation. Diaphragmatic venous outflow was produced mostly by the intercostal veins (60 % of total diaphragmatic venous outflow) which drained into the azygos trunk. The phrenic veins contributed 25 % and the internal <b>mammary</b> <b>veins</b> contributed 15 % of total diaphragmatic venous outflow.

30|$|Central venous {{thrombosis}} and compression: Superior vena cava (SVC), brachiocephalic or internal jugular veins {{can be directly}} compressed by the mediastinal adenopathy with development of SVC syndrome. Lymphoma is responsible for about 10  % of malignant SVC obstruction cases [24]. SVC and brachiocephalic {{venous thrombosis}} can also complicate chemotherapy catheter placement in patients with HL. Contrast-enhanced chest CT is the modality of choice for evaluation of SVC obstruction and to differentiate between venous thrombosis and extrinsic compression. Chest wall venous collaterals and characteristic focal hyperenhancement of liver (“hot-spot sign”) is seen with SVC or brachiocephalic vein obstruction due to opening of caval-mammary-phrenic–hepatic capsule-portal pathways (Fig.  1). In this pathway, blood flows from the internal <b>mammary</b> <b>vein</b> to the inferior phrenic vein. The inferior phrenic vein then communicates with hepatic capsular veins, which in turn drain into the intrahepatic portal tributaries. Focal non-mass-like contrast enhancement is seen along the superior aspect of the liver with dilated inferior phrenic veins and hepatic capsular veins [25, 26].|$|E

40|$|Sow milk is {{the major}} source of {{nutrients}} for suckling piglets and taking into account the large litter sizes of our current sow genotypes, it is imperative to maximize nutrient use by the mammary gland. The amount of nutrients available to mammary tissue is dependent upon the concentrations of nutrients in blood and the rate of its flow to the lactating glands. Nutrient availability to the udder may be estimated by measuring mammary arteriovenous differences, and mammary blood flow can be measured either directly or via indirect calculations. For all these measures, mammary venous and arterial blood samplings are required and catheters must be inserted in <b>mammary</b> <b>veins.</b> Blood flow to the udder is influenced by numerous factors, such as litter size, time since feeding, postural behaviour, vasoactive substances, and ambient temperature; yet, the single most important effector of mammary blood flow is milk removal. Glucose represents 40 to 60 % of the total carbon mass taken up by sow mammary tissue and its uptake by the mammary gland appears to be mediated by glucose transporter proteins. Other energetic precursors which are used by the mammary gland are triglycerides, phospholipids, acetate, propionate and lactate. The uptake of amino acids by sow mammary glands has been extensively studied and is affected by diet, stage of lactation, and milk demand. Recent data also showed that amino acid uptake is controlled by transporter proteins that channel amino acids intracellularly, and that these proteins are in turn affected by diet and physiological status. Data on mammary uptake of hormones are contradictory; yet, the endocrine involvement in the regulation of milk synthetic processes is evidenced by the presence of specific hormonal receptors in mammary tissue...|$|R

There are no comparative data to elucidate the indications and outcomes for each. We hypothesize that the CVT is as reliable as vein grafts when indicated. Methods: All consecutive cases where a CVT or venous vein grafts were used for free-flap breast reconstruction between 2000 and 2012 were reviewed. Patient demographics, operative notes, indications, and flap survival were compared between the 2 groups. Results: Ten patients underwent a CVT and 38 patients received a vein graft for insufficient venous outflow. There were no differences in average age, body mass index, or comorbid conditions between the groups. Similarly, {{there was no difference}} in previous radiotherapy, timing of reconstruction, or side of reconstruction. A CVT was used for salvage following venous thrombosis in 7 patients (70. 0 %) and for primary venous outflow in the remaining patients due to inability to use the internal <b>mammary</b> <b>vein.</b> Vein grafts were performed primarily in 31 patients, 22 for augmenting venous drainage (supercharge), 9 for the dominant venous outflow, and 7 for salvage of a thrombosis.

Ratios of mammary uptake of {{free amino acids}} (AA) in blood to output of AA in milk protein and ratios of the enrichments of Phe, Tyr, Met, and Lys at isotopic plateau in secreted milk casein to the free AA in arterial and <b>mammary</b> <b>vein</b> blood were monitored during the last 5 h of a 30 -h continuous i. v. infusion of [1 - 13 C]Phe, [2 H 4]Tyr, [5 - 13 CH 3]Met, and [2 - 15 N]Lys on two occasions: before (control) and on d 6 of an i. v. infusion of Phe (6 g/d). During the control, uptakes of free Phe and Met were less than their output in milk. This result was com-parable with the labeling kinetic results, suggesting that vascular peptides contributed 5 to 11 % of Phe and 8 to 18 % of Met. Free Tyr and Lys uptakes during the control were sufficient for milk output; however, the labeling kinetics indicated that 13 to 25 % of the Tyr and 4 to 13 % of the Lys were derived from peptides. Infusion of Phe increased the uptake of free AA but reduced the contribution of peptides toward Phe (0 to 3 %) and Tyr (8 to 14 %) supply for casein synthesis. Whole body hydroxylation of Phe to Tyr increased from 10 to 18 % with the infusion of Phe; within the mammary gland, this conversion was lower (3 to 5 %).

When the patient has massive bleeding unexplained by the estimated bleeding point, thoracotomy must be done. A question arises as to the option of incision. Once cardiac rupture is strongly suspected, incision is basically rapid, especially in cardiac arrest. Left anterolateral thoracotomy is speedy but it gives very poor access to any cardiac structure except {{the apex of the}} left ventricle [9]. In addition, the extension of this incision across the sternum into a clamshell (bilateral anterior thoracotomies) leads to four more bleeding vessels (internal <b>mammary</b> arteries and <b>veins)</b> to contend with [9]. However, in our case, we ought to have chosen the left anterolateral thoracotomy in supine position for an exploration of the left thorax, because the advantage of the left anterolateral thoracotomy is that the incision might be extended to the right if we needed to explore the right thorax.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Vasoactive {{agents and}} inotropes {{influence}} conduit-coronary blood flow following {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG). It was hypothesized that dopexamine hydrochloride, a dopamine A- 1 (DA- 1) and beta(2) agonist would increase conduit-coronary blood flow. A prospective randomized double blind clinical trial was carried out to test this hypothesis. DA- 1 receptors have previously been localized to human left ventricle. METHODS: Twenty-six American Society of Anaesthesiology class 2 - 3 elective {{coronary artery bypass graft}} patients who did not require inotropic support on separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were studied. According to a randomized allocation patients received either dopexamine (1 microg/kg per min) or placebo (saline) by intravenous infusion for 15 min. Immediately prior to and at 5, 10 and 15 min of infusion, blood flow through the internal <b>mammary</b> and <b>vein</b> grafts (Transit time flow probes, Transonic Ltd.), heart rate, cardiac index, mean arterial pressure and pulmonary haemodynamics were noted. The data were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: Low-dose dopexamine (1 microg/kg per min) caused a significant increase in mammary graft blood flow compared to placebo at 15 min of infusion (P= 0. 028, dopexamine group left internal mammary artery (LIMA) flow of 43. 3 +/- 14. 2 ml/min, placebo group LIMA flow at 26. 1 +/- 16. 3 ml/min). Dopexamine recipients demonstrated a non-significant trend to increased saphenous vein graft flow (P= 0. 059). Increased heart rate was the only haemodynamic change induced by dopexamine (P= 0. 004, dopexamine group at 85. 2 +/- 9. 6 beats/min and placebo group at 71. 1 +/- 7. 6 beats/min after 15 min of infusion). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that administration of dopexamine (1 microg/kg per min) was associated with a significant increase in internal mammary artery graft blood flow with mild increase in heart rate being the only haemodynamic change. Low-dose dopexamine may improve graft flow in the early post CABG period with minimal haemodynamic changes...|$|R

Milk fat yield was lowered (P=. 03) by SF vs. DR sorghum; SF vs SR of corn tended to increase (P=. 07) concentration but not yield of milk protein. Blood flows in portal (1988 ± 109 L/h) and hepatic vein (2368 ± 215 L/h) were not altered by diets. Steam-flaked vs. DR sorghum tended (P=. 18) to increase UN cycling (162 vs. 95 g/d), and reduced (P≤. 09) absorption of AAN (223 vs. 269 g/d) and NH 3 N (257 vs. 318 g/d) by PDV. Flaking vs. rolling of sorghum increased (P≤. 07) estimated uptake (83 vs. 67 g/d) and extraction ratio (14. 5 vs. 11. 1 %) of AAN by mammary tissues. Net uptake and release of AAN and NH 3 N across splanchnic tissues of cows were not altered by corn processing; however, SF vs. SR corn increased (P=. 08) UN cycling to PDV by 143 % (212 vs. 87 g/d). Steam-flaked vs SR corn increased (P≤. 02) estimated uptake (88 vs. 61 g/d) and extraction ratio (14. 7 vs. 11. 0 %) of AAN by mammary tissues. It is concluded that feeding of steam-flaked sorghum or corn compared to dry-rolled sorghum or steam-rolled corn improves N utilization of dairy cows by increasing urea transfer to the gut and uptake of amino acid by the mammary gland...|$|E
40|$|For many microsurgeons, {{antegrade}} internal mammary vessels (AIMVs) {{represent the}} recipients of choice in autogenous breast reconstruction. For the past few years, the retrograde internal mammary vessels (RIMVs) have been demonstrated to be a further reliable option when needed, according to many papers focusing more on the vein than on the artery. Besides the clinical evidence, the hemodynamic features of the retrograde system have been very seldom analyzed. In this article, we report our clinical experience with deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps anastomosed to RIMVs, along with a perioperative radiological follow-up to study RIMVs' hemodynamics and to further support {{the reliability of the}} retrograde system with particular focus on the retrograde internal mammary artery. Prospective, preoperative, and postoperative (3 days, 21 days, and 3 months, respectively) color Doppler sonographies of the internal mammary artery (IMA) and DIEPs have been performed to collect the velocity of flow (v) and resistive index (RI) data. Twenty-two patients agreed to undergo this protocol, of which 10 unipedicle flaps were anastomosed to AIMVs ("control" group), 10 bipedicle DIEPs to both AIMVs and RIMVs ("study" group), and 2 DIEPs anastomosed to retrograde internal mammary artery and antegrade internal <b>mammary</b> <b>vein</b> (not statistically analyzed for their paucity). Student t test was performed to compare the "control" and "study" groups. All the flaps survived, and no re-exploration was needed. Internal mammary artery and perforators v showed similar but speculate trend, whereas IMA and perforators RI looked stable during that time. Significant differences have been found in the "study" group for IMA v at 3 -day period, for perforator v at 21 - and 90 -day periods, and for perforator RI at 90 -day period, without any clinical implication for flap viability. Retrograde internal mammary vessels can be considered reliable vessels for both arterial flap input and venous flap outflows, either as additional or the sole recipients. However, further and larger studies would be useful to better understand the hemodynamics of the retrograde system...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} propionate (C 3) and casein (CN) on whole-body and mammary metabolism of energetic nutrients. Three multiparous Holstein cows fitted with both duodenal and ruminal cannulas were used in 2 replicated Youden squares with 14 -d periods. Effects of CN (743 g/d in the duodenum) and C 3 (1, 042 g/d in the rumen) infusions, either separately or in combination as supplements to a grass silage diet, were tested in a factorial arrangement. The control diet provided 97 % of energy and protein requirements. Within each period, blood samples were taken (d 11) from the carotid artery and the right <b>mammary</b> <b>vein</b> to determine net uptake of energetic nutrients. Plasma blood flow was calculated using the Fick principle (based on Phe and Tyr). On d 13, [6, 6 -(2) H(2) ]glucose was infused in the jugular vein to determine whole-body glucose rate of appearance (Ra) based on enrichments in arterial plasma. Both C 3 and CN treatments increased whole-body Ra (17 % and 13 %, respectively) but only CN increased milk (18 %) and lactose (14 %) yields, suggesting no direct link between whole-body Ra and milk yield. When CN was infused alone, the apparent ratio of conversion of CN carbon into glucose carbon was 0. 31 but, when allowance was made for the CN required to support the extra milk protein output, the ratio increased to 0. 40, closer to the theoretical ratio (0. 48). This may relate to the observed increases in arterial glucagon concentrations for CN alone. Conversely, the apparent conversion of infused C 3 carbon alone to glucose was low (0. 31). With C 3, mammary plasma flow increased as did uptakes of lactate, Ala, and Glu whereas the uptake for beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) decreased. Mammary net carbon balance suggested an increase with C 3 treatment in glucose, lactate, Ala, and Glu oxidation within the mammary gland. Mammary glucose uptake did not increase with CN treatment, despite an increase in glucose arteriovenous difference and extraction rate, because plasma flow decreased (- 17 %). Whereas CN, alone or in combination with C 3, increased both lactose and protein yields, only mammary AA (and BHBA in CN alone) uptake increased because plasma flow decreased (- 17 %). These {{data suggest that the}} observed variations of milk lactose yield (and other milk components) are linked to metabolic interchanges between several energetic nutrients at both the whole-body and mammary levels and are not explained by increases in whole-body glucose availability...|$|E
40|$|Background—Urotensin II (UII) is the ligand for the GPR 14 {{receptor}} and {{the most}} potent vasoconstrictor in the cynomolgus monkey. UII also contracts rat thoracic aorta. We studied the effect of human UII (hUII) in human blood vessels Methods and Results—Small subcutaneous resistance arteries, internal <b>mammary</b> arteries, saphenous <b>veins,</b> and small subcutaneous veins were studied using standard techniques. Subcutaneous resistance arteries constricted in response to norepinephrine (maximum tension, 2. 8460. 38 mN/mm; the concentration required to produce 50 % of the maximum response [EC 50], 0. 5260. 07 mmol/L) and endothelin- 1 (maximum tension, 4. 1960. 93 mN/mm; EC 50, 1. 660. 1 nmol/L). hUII did not contract these arteries, internal mammary arteries, or either type of vein, {{but it was a}} potent vasoconstrictor in rat thoracic aorta (maximum tension, 2. 3660. 2 mN/mm; EC 50, 1. 1360. 36 nmol/L). Conclusions—hUII has no vasoconstrictor action in human arteries and veins of different sizes and vascular beds. Marked species differences in the actions of UII question its importance in human cardiovascular regulation. (Circulation. 2001; 103 : 1378 - 1381.)

40|$|The posteromedial thigh (PMT) flap {{has been}} {{described}} for breast reconstruction in vertical fashion (vPMT). However, it might not incorporate enough soft tissue for reconstruction of a medium size breast. Here, we present a case utilizing the free inverted-L posteromedial thigh (L-PMT) flap for autologous reconstruction of the breast. A 65 -year-old woman with a body max index (BMI) of 24. 5 kg/m 2 underwent nipple sparring mastectomy and received immediate unilateral breast reconstruction. The flap was raised based on the first medial perforator of the profunda femoris artery (PFA). The internal <b>mammary</b> artery and <b>vein</b> were dissected as recipient vessels. The flap size was 25 cm × 25 cm. The mastectomy specimen and weight of the flap was 260 g and 310 g, respectively. The flap survived completely after surgery. The donor site was primarily closed with minimal morbidities. Follow-up observations were conducted from 1 to 6 months. The patient was satisfied with the reconstruction. The free L-PMT flap may be suitable for breast reconstruction in women with moderate breast size. The inverted-L pattern of the PMT flap allows the surgeon to include a bigger quantity of flap soft tissue enabling a more anatomical shape of the breast and represents an alternative design {{that may be used}} for autologous breast reconstruction in selected patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{vertical}} posteromedial thigh (vPMT) perforator flap {{is a new}} reliable flap with versatility. The {{purpose of}} this article was to report our experience with the use of free vPMT flap for reconstruction of the breast. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 2015 to December 2015, seven patients received immediate unilateral breast reconstruction with seven free vPMT flaps. The flaps were raised based on the first medial perforator of the profunda femoris artery (PFA). The internal <b>mammary</b> artery and <b>vein</b> were dissected as recipient vessels. RESULTS: The flap sizes varied from 25 × 9 cm to 30 × 10 cm. The average weight of the flap and mastectomy specimen was 431 g (range: 390 to 470 g) and 410 g (range: 360 to 450 g) respectively. The average pedicle length was 10. 4 cm (range, 8. 5 to 12. 5 cm) and the average arterial diameter was 2. 1 mm (range, 1. 8 to 2. 6 mm). All of the flaps survived completely after surgery. The donor sites were all primarily closed with minimal morbidities. Follow-up observations were conducted from 3 to 9 months. All of patients were satisfactory with the reconstruction. CONCLUSION: The vertical vPMT is suitable for breast reconstruction in women with small to moderate breast size; the vertical pattern of the PMT avoids some of the problems related to other flaps with transverse patterns and represents an alternative design that can be successfully used for breast reconstruction...|$|R
