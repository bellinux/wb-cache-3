50|$|For {{telephone}} {{local exchange}} carriers (LEC), triple play is delivered {{using a combination}} of optical fiber and digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies (called fiber in the loop) to its residential base. This configuration uses fiber communications to reach distant locations and uses DSL over an existing POTS twisted pair cable as last mile access to the subscriber's home. Cable television operators use a similar architecture called hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) to provide subscriber homes with broadband, but use the available coaxial cable rather than a twisted pair for the last mile transmission standard. Subscriber homes can be in a residential environment, <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>units,</b> or even in business offices.|$|R
50|$|CloudCommand Enterprise is a Wi-Fi {{system that}} {{consists}} of Wi-Fi access points that can be deployed, secured and managed via a cloud-based management interface. This approach, which does not require wireless controller hardware, is ideal for deployments with a high-density of mobile users, such as hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, schools, conference centers, assisted living facilities, and <b>Multi-Dwelling</b> <b>Units</b> (MDUs) such as apartment buildings. This method of instantiating a wireless network does not require onsite wireless LAN controller hardware; as the access points are managed via the cloud network. Ostensibly this reduces equipment costs and eases management. This technology also enables businesses or Value-Added Resellers to create multiple private wireless networks using the same public access infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|High-rise {{residential}} {{building is a}} type of housing that has <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>units</b> built on the same land. This type of housing has become popular each year in urban area due to the increasing cost of land. There are several common facilities provided in high-rise {{residential building}}. For example playground, swimming pool, gymnasium, 24 hours security system such as CCTV, access card and so on. Thus, maintenance works of the common facilities must be well organised. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the classification of facilities provided at high rise residential building. The survey was done on 170 high-rise residential schemes by using stratified random sampling technique. The scope of this research is within Klang Valley area. This area is rapidly developed with high-rise residential building. The objective of this survey is to list down all the facilities provided in each sample of the schemes. The result, there are nine classification of facilities provided for high-rise residential building...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{airtightness}} {{of building}} envelopes {{is one of}} the factors which most affects the hygrothermal conditions and the air quality of the indoor environment, as well as the energy consumption of the building. In <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>units</b> this contributes significantly to the overall load for heating or air conditioning, making it possible to calculate the repercussion of infiltrations on the energy demand of a dwelling as between 20 to 50 % of the total amount, depending on the climate zone and construction characteristics of the envelope. Hence the importance of knowing the parameters that characterise it. Pressurisation/depressurisation tests are the best method for characterisig these, butmust be carried out in accordance with specific measurement procedures. The main objective of this paper is the proposal of five specific protocols for carrying out these tests in MDU, and their specific use in buildings in Southern European regions. In order to develop and validate this proposal we have carried out a series of multi test in ten dwelling units in a block recently built in the south of Spain. The results of these tests are presented and analysed here. These confirm the need for some protocols to distinguish between wet and dry spaces within the dwelling, given the difference in airtightness between them, and to expand the study indicators proposed by international regulations for a more accurate rendering of the behaviour of the envelope and the elements within it...|$|R

40|$|No son pocos los arquitectos que, tras abrazar la modernidad, encontraron su {{particular}} conversión desde la experiencia táctil y espiritual del material o, incluso, desde la evocación de su memoria y nostalgia. A todos ellos les llegó un momento en el que los tensos planos enfoscados en blanco les parecían de una excesiva abstracción y, sobre todo, distantes de otras realidades materiales por las que sentían una atracción más honda y permanente, y que activaban, simultáneamente, su memoria y las razones espirituales del construir. De hecho, en esa blanca abstracción no se mantuvieron ni sus creadores. Uno de los conversos de más largo recorrido es Barragán y las transformaciones en su obra son deudoras de los múltiples encuentros con los materiales y sus paisajes. After a few {{early years}} {{working in the}} Guadalajara of his birth, Barragán seized a dream opportunity and relocated to Spain’s capital city in 1935. In Madrid he embarked on a productive and successful career, designing <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>units</b> for private developers for 5 years. During that time, further {{to what he had}} learnt in his travels across Europe, Barragán saw in modern architecture a catalogue of precise postulates with a reproducible vocabulary. All the buildings he authored in that period indisputably drew from modernist precepts. Nonetheless, like other modern architects, including Le Corbusier himself, Barragán experienced the desolation of white abstraction, of inert and repetitive matter: precise and effective perhaps, but unable to engage with the spiritual values nesting in the deep recesses of the architect’s memory. Around 1940 Barragán decided to break with architectural practice. In so doing he redefined it beyond the stylistic limits that had been his reference until then. The source for that redefinition was the encounter with gardens as the material and object of design, along with the strong attraction exerted on the architect by that specific type of matter. The return to stone, wood or traditional rendering arose not only out of a need to evoke his own experience, but of a desire to conjure up in these materials the memory and nostalgia of other cultures. The El Pedregal gardens and adjacent Prieto House, built in 1945 - 1950, constituted a veritable laboratory where Barragán, deploying a materially dense architecture, spawned beauty by uniting landscape and aesthetic expression. In a word, the architect aspired to use matter to express humanity’s emotional link with nature, its ultimate haven. With his oeuvre, Barragán blurred the boundaries between technical and humanistic concerns, sensing in every element, every object, the spiritual reasons for building. As in the Capuchin Convent at Tlalpan (1952 - 1955) and the Gilardi House at Mexico City (19769, with that blurring matter also participates in continuity. Such continuity, converted in his architecture into spatial succession, elicits the feel of a close-knit, changing and uninterrupted sequence. The resulting sleekness is the origin of the joyful, still delight in a work that needs mouldable materials to create that effect. All that together associates memory with the experience of materials. Inherited matter contributes to the generation of timeless and universal architecture, which portrays it not portrayed as the opposite of the spirit but rather, paradoxically, as the vehicle for its expansion...|$|R
