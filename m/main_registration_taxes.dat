50|$|Cars are {{subjected}} to a first-time <b>registration</b> <b>tax,</b> which varies from 35% to over 100%, based on the size and value of the car. The level of vehicle taxation was increased by a law passed on 2 June 1982 to discourage private car ownership, and also as an incentive to buy smaller, more efficient cars, as these have less tax levied on them. First-time <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> was doubled, annual licensing fees were increased by 300%, and $0.7 duty was imposed on each litre of on light oils.|$|R

50|$|Giving {{economic}} incentives {{is regarded as}} a favourable policy that encourages the use of EVs as it lowers the costs. Exemption of the first <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> on EVs was first introduced in 1997 to promote the use of greener vehicles.

A microeconomic framework is proposed to analyse such a reform. For the case of Denmark, the analysis shows that the reform is likely to yield a significant and robust welfare gain. However, it seems not unlikely that CO 2 emissions from passenger cars may increase {{as a result of}} the reform. ...|$|R

The main objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> as an incentive environmental tax and to know its real influence on consumption and CO 2 emissions. First we carry out a review of the environmental regulatory framework in Spain and in the European Union. Then, we perform an analysis of the legislation of the <b>registration</b> <b>tax.</b> We will also measure the impact of the <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> in the most relevant economic variables, and finally we will make a comparative analysis observing different budgets of different vehicles, observing the application of the tax in the commercial offers. Our main conclusion is that tax remains distorted by other concepts within budget, and that the standardization of the tax for all premises can be a solution...|$|R

30|$|Three {{amendments}} {{were made}} to the base model for this case study. Firstly, the original model only included tax reductions based on relative CO 2 emissions, but for this study reductions/exemptions specifically for EVs were implemented. Secondly, the market share determined by the user group could be influenced by “demand kicks” from subsidies and exemptions. This demand kick is a calibrated multiplier of market share over the period that the incentive is in place, the value of which is determined by a sensitivity of a base demand kick to the magnitude of the subsidy/exemption. This characteristic did not originally include the circulation or <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> exemption. Finally, scenarios were run where <b>registration</b> <b>taxes</b> were included in the purchase price of the vehicles, rather than the fixed operational costs as per the original model structure. As NL <b>registration</b> <b>taxes</b> are particularly high, and the exemption could have a bigger impact on the purchase decision, including <b>registration</b> <b>taxes</b> in the purchase price may be a more accurate account of reality. In addition to the above changes, an attempt was made to capture some of the idiosyncrasies of the incentives at regional or fleet level. As over 90 % of EV purchases in 2014 were fleet vehicles [27], € 5000 subsidies were implemented throughout the fleet. Furthermore, we tested the isolated impact of including only PHEV in the demand kick, as BEV results seemed to over-predict actual data.|$|R
50|$|The Irish {{government}} has instituted {{a package of}} measures, including a €5,000 grant (US$7,158) to assist with purchasing the vehicle, exemption from vehicle <b>registration</b> <b>tax,</b> and accelerated capital allowances to promote electric vehicle purchase.In 2013, the Irish government withdrew the EV vehicle <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> exemption {{and replaced it with}} a €5,000 discount on the tax. New conditions were also added to the SEAI EV Grant which reclassified private EV purchases via Hire Purchase or car loan as a commercial purchase, effectively reducing the EV grant to €3,500 for all non-cash buyers. As a result of these changes, EV sales fell in 2013 to only 58 units.|$|R

40|$|Under Belgian {{constitutional}} law, succession <b>tax</b> and <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> are regional taxes. For the Flemish government, {{the legislative}} competence {{in this field}} seems an important instrument for policy making. In an attempt to sustain familial entrepreneurship as a valuable element in our society's economic texture, the inheritance of a family-owned company is exempted from the Succession Tax (art. 60 bis Succession Tax Code for the Flemish Region). It is useful to analyse this measure. More precisely, {{it is interesting to}} figure out the material conditions for the aforementioned exemption and policy-goals that inspired to them. Questions to be dealt with are the characteristics of a family-owned company - how must the company be organised; minimum control/participation of the deceased's family - and the minimum standards the company must fulfil in terms of - ongoing - employment. For transfer by death, an exemption exists; while for the gift of a company inters vivo, a reduced tax rate is applied (art. 140 bis-octies <b>Registration</b> <b>Tax</b> Code for the Flemish Region). The conditions for this reduction need to be analysed, as well as the differences with the conditions for the exemption of art. 60 bis Succession Tax Code for the Flemish Region shall be commented. It has to be clear why the reduction of the percentage of the <b>Registration</b> <b>Tax</b> is not reserved to family-owned companies and why {{it does not seem to}} be subject to an employment condition, but only to keep the company ongoing during a period of five years. Lastly, the Flemish measures to promote entrepreneurship form the viewpoint of Succession <b>tax</b> and <b>Registration</b> <b>tax</b> need to be situated in an international and inter-regional context...|$|R
