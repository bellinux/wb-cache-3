5|$|A dry track during Q2 {{saw the two}} Mercedes drivers fastest, Rosberg four-tenths of {{a second}} faster than Hamilton. Fernando Alonso failed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3, the seventh time that season. He had missed {{the last part of}} {{qualifying}} seven times over the entire course of his Ferrari stint in the five previous seasons. Daniel Ricciardo was eliminated in 14th place, meaning that he - like Button - was unable to take the full extent of his ten-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|Consistent with {{previous}} form, the Hondas of Barrichello and Button failed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the top ten; they qualified 13th and 15th respectively. Takuma Sato, once again out-qualified the two Honda cars, just {{missing out on}} the top ten, in front of Vitantonio Liuzzi. He made it through to the second session of qualifying by 94 hundredths of a second, where he qualified in 14th. Scott Speed was the slowest car in the second session of qualifying putting him in 16th position.|$|E

Alonso was {{eliminated}} in 14th position, ahead of Max Verstappen in the Toro Rosso, who was half a second slower than Carlos Sainz Jr., his teammate. Sergio Pérez joined the two Sauber drivers as the last three cars not to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the top 10.|$|E

5|$|In Q2, lap times {{improved}} {{and the two}} Mercedes drivers led the way, with Rosberg {{a little over a}} tenth of a second ahead of teammate Hamilton. Fernando Alonso went faster than Valtteri Bottas and looked to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3, when Max Verstappen went faster and eliminated the McLaren driver. Also not in the top ten were both Lotus and the second McLaren of Jenson Button. Conditions soon worsened, preventing faster lap times. Many drivers spun out {{in the latter part of}} the session, complaining about aquaplaning.|$|E

5|$|The {{second session}} saw Hamilton post the fastest time, {{even though his}} car lost contact to pit lane and his seat {{overheating}} once more. He was three-tenths clear of his teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third. Daniil Kvyat suffered engine problems and failed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3, as did the second Force India of Sergio Pérez, both Toro Rosso drivers and the Lotus of Pastor Maldonado.|$|E
5|$|Before Animaniacs was {{put into}} {{production}} in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that were thrown out were Rita and Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that senior producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years. After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Animaniacs (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.|$|E

He failed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the Bundesliga Team of the Season, but was included in {{a list of the}} Best Defenders for the 2013–14 campaign. Rodríguez's nine assists also meant that he created more goals than any other full-back in Europe. His impressive displays during the season included 2.3 key passes per game, the same number as Andrea Pirlo, the two-time reigning Serie A Footballer of the Year, and 2.6 successful dribbles per game, more than Cristiano Ronaldo, the reigning Ballon d'Or winner.|$|E
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not {{to go out on a}} second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), only the Ferrari were confident enough to run only on the slower, harder tyres, {{while the rest of the}} field needed to equip the super-soft compound. Daniil Kvyat topped the session with a time of 1:45.340 on the supersoft tyre. Pastor Maldonado was eliminated, as were the two Manor Marussia drivers, who were even further off the pace than usual. Both of the team's drivers received a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change. Both Sauber drivers also did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q2, when Jenson Button was the last to set a fast lap, edging out Felipe Nasr by less than a tenth of a second.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Since the cars of Manor Marussia failed to start, only three drivers were eliminated during the first session of qualifying (Q1), all of which was run in dry conditions. The McLaren cars of Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen struggled as expected, following their lack of pre-season testing and failed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q2, just as Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson. Mercedes and Williams' Valtteri Bottas were the only ones not having to use the softer tyres to proceed into the next part of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. The first part of qualifying (Q1) was disrupted towards the end, when Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso came to a halt at the hairpin, preventing a number of drivers from improving on their lap times. Marcus Ericsson, whose first timed lap had been hampered by a spin, was one of the affected drivers and was eliminated in 17th place. Jenson Button also did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q2. While his second run was also affected by Verstappen, he lost time in his first due to a failure of communication concerning his engine mode. Also eliminated were the second Sauber of Felipe Nasr and both Manor Marussia cars.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was first}} {{developing}} the characters, Hillenburg wanted Pearl and Mr. Krabs to travel around town in a caravan boat with a whale-sized teardrop trailer connected to it; while this element did <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the series, it was only used sparsely in early episodes. The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives {{as part of his}} pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E

5|$|While McLaren {{once again}} succeeded in {{advancing}} both cars into Q2, Fernando Alonso's car {{stopped in the}} first corner due to an electrical fault {{at the start of}} the second session, and he took no further part in qualifying. Team mate Jenson Button was more successful, missing out on Q3 when his second fast lap was interrupted by Nico Rosberg going off at Sainte Dévote. The second Williams of Felipe Massa completed a problematic Saturday for the team, claiming only 14th on the grid, while Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean also did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3.|$|E
5|$|Central Coast Mariners' {{bid for a}} {{franchise}} in the Football Federation Australia's new A-League competition was aimed at filling the one spot for a regional team that was designated by the FFA. Media speculation prior to {{the announcement of the}} franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners' bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former Australian international player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan—who would act as inaugural club chairman—also strengthened its proposal. As the only regional bidder, Central Coast was expected to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the league by default. Following a reported signed deal with the FFA, the club signed former Northern Spirit coach Lawrie McKinna as manager and Ian Ferguson, a former Rangers and Northern Spirit player, as coach. To aid the FFA's goals of building the profile of the sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United. On 1 November 2004, after much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of FFA's domestic competition, the A-League. The decision made Central Coast Mariners the first Gosford-based professional sports team to play in a national competition.|$|E
5|$|For {{his next}} serial, Hergé planned to put {{together}} a story that caricatured the actions of Nazi Germany, developing the plot for King Ottokar's Sceptre. However, he temporarily set aside that project when he began to experience dreams of white and a car stuck in the snow, having ideas of sending Tintin to the north, considering Greenland or the Klondike as potential locations. The result was The Black Island, although Hergé only sent Tintin as far north as Scotland, and he instead used the idea of the car stuck in a snowdrift on a greetings card that he designed. He also had an idea of Tintin combating a group of anarchists bent on destroying Europe's iconic buildings, but again this idea did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the eventual story. Having decided to set most of his story in Britain, Hergé briefly visited London and the southern English coast {{to learn more about the}} country. There, he purchased a stainless steel Gillotts Inqueduct G-2 pen, a type that he would continue to use throughout his life. His positive depiction of Britain was in part due to an Anglophilia that he had received from his childhood, with the British government having been a longstanding ally of Belgium, supporting its 1831 creation and liberating it from German occupation during the First World War.|$|E
