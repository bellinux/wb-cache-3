The robust and labour-efficient method for the simultaneous determination of six ionophore coccidiostats (lasalocid, maduramicin, monensin, narasin, salinomycin, and semduramicin) in targeted feed has been developed. Properly grinded and homogenized feed sample was spiked with internal standard (<b>monesin</b> methyl ester) and extracted with methanol.

40|$|Dysidenin, a hexachlorinated tripeptide-like {{molecule}} {{extracted from}} the sponge Dysidea herbacea, has lethal effects on fishes and some marine organisms. In an in vitro screening study, this molecule {{appeared to be a}} strong inhibitor of iodide transport in dog thyroid slices. Ouabain blocks iodide transport by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase, which sustains the Na+ gradient needed to drive iodide transport. Dysidenin and ouabain block iodide transport with the same kinetics but not by the same mechanisms; dysidenin, unlike ouabain, did not inhibit 86 Rb+ uptake or increase its efflux. Inhibitors of chloride channels or carriers did not reduce the T/M value of 131 I-, with the exception of phloretin, a relatively nonspecific anion transport blocker. <b>Monesin</b> (or Na+ ionophores) but not dysidenin clearly increased 22 Na+ efflux in tracerpreloaded thyroid slices treated with ouabain. This suggests that dysidenin does not act as a chloride channel inhibitor or a Na+ ionophore. Increasing the iodide concentration in the medium decreased the inhibition by dysidenin, suggesting a pseudocompetitive type of effect. To study the structure-activity relationship of dysidenin, several hydrolytic products and synthetic derivatives have been prepared. The data obtained showed that the inhibition is sensitive to stereochemical effects and that the trichloromethyl terminus of the molecule is recognized by the binding site. The presence of only one trichloromethyl terminus is sufficient to exert the inhibitory effect. In VitroJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{cytotoxic}} activity {{profile of}} an immunotoxin, SWA 11 -ricin A chain, recognising a cell-surface antigen associated with human small cell lung cancer (SCLC), was examined in detail using {{a panel of}} SCLC, non-SCLC and non lung tumour cell lines in tissue culture. SWA 11 -ricin A chain was potently and selectively active against three SCLC cell lines of both classic and variant morphologies, inhibiting the incorporation of 3 H-leucine with an IC 50 of 5 x 10 - " M. At a concentration of 1 x 10 - 8 M, the SWAI immunotoxin could selectively eliminate in excess of 99. 9 % of clonogenic tumour cells. Intoxication proceeded rapidly following a 4 h lag phase; the initial rate of protein synthesis inhibition occurred with a t % of 2 h and a t,o of 7 h. The cytotoxic activity of SWA I-ricin A chain was potentiated by 100 -fold {{in the presence of}} the carboxylic ionophore monensin at I x 10 - 7 M. Kinetic studies revealed that monensin enhanced the rate of protein synthesis inhibition by two-fold and eliminated the lag phase suggesting a rapid effect on either the rate or route of internalisation. Studies with SWA could detect no influence of <b>monesin</b> on the rate of antibody internalisation and a transient delay in the delivery of internalised antibody to lysosomes was observed by immunoelectron microscopy.

40|$|Objetivou-se verificar a influência da inclusão de diferentes níveis do ionóforo monensina sódica na dieta sobre os parâmetros ruminal, sangüíneo e urinário e a digestibilidade aparente em novilhas leiteiras. Foram coletadas amostras de líquido ruminal (imediatamente antes e duas horas após a alimentação), sangue, urina e fezes de 28 novilhas da raça Holandesa mantidas em regime de confinamento por 84 dias. As dietas possuíam 32, 84 % de concentrado (grão de milho, farelo de soja, uréia e mistura mineral), 33, 58 % de silagem de milho e 33, 58 % de cana-de-açúcar na matéria seca. Os níveis de ionóforo avaliados foram 0, 14, 28 e 42 mg de monensina/kg de matéria seca da dieta. O experimento foi instalado {{conforme}} delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com quatro tratamentos e sete repetições, realizando-se estudos de regressão e contrastes ortogonais. Antes da alimentação, a monensina não influenciou o pH ruminal e a concentração de amônia e dos ácidos acético, propiônico e butírico, mas promoveu redução da relação acetato:propionato. Duas horas após a alimentação, verificou-se redução do pH e da relação acetato:propionato; e aumento da concentração de ácido propiônico. O estudo de contrastes revelou que ocorreu diminuição da concentração de amônia antes da alimentação. Não foram verificadas mudanças significativas nas concentrações de glicose e uréia sangüínea. A monensina também não influenciou os consumos de matéria seca (MS), matéria orgânica, proteína bruta, extrato etéreo (EE), carboidratos totais (CHOT) e fibra em detergente neutro. As digestibilidades da MS, EE e CHOT e a perda de nitrogênio urinário apresentaram respostas quadráticas. The {{objective of}} this trial was to {{study the effects of}} different dietary levels of the ionophore monensin on apparent digestibility of nutrients and on ruminal, blood, and urinary metabolites in dairy heifers. Samples of ruminal fluid (pre-feeding and 2 hours post-feeding), blood, urine, and feces all were collected from 28 confined Holstein heifers. Diets contained (dry matter basis) : 32. 84 % of concentrate (corn grain, soybean meal, urea, and mineral salt mixture), 33. 58 % of corn silage, and 33. 58 % of sugarcane. The following amounts of monensin were included in the diets: 0, 14, 28 or 42 mg/kg of diet dry matter. The experiment was analyzed as a complete randomized design with four treatments and seven replications. Both regression analysis and orthogonal contrasts were part of the statistical model. No significant differences before feeding were observed for ruminal pH and for the ruminal concentrations of ammonia, acetate, propionate, and butyrate by adding monensin to the diets. However, a significant reduction in the acetate:propionate ratio was detected. Conversely, ruminal pH decreased and ruminal propionate increased when samples were taken at two hours after feeding. As before, the acetate:propionate ratio was reduced when <b>monesin</b> was increased from 0 to 42 mg/kg of diet dry matter. In addition, orthogonal contrasts showed a decrease in the concentration of ruminal ammonia before feeding. Including <b>monesin</b> in diet of dairy heifers did not alter the concentrations of glucose and blood urea. Similarly, intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter, crude protein, ether extract (EE), total carbohydrates (TC), and neutral detergent fiber were all unchanged by dietary supplementation with monensin. Significant quadratic effects were observed for apparent digestibilities of DM, EE, and TC and also for the excretion of urinary nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|A {{digestion}} {{trial was}} conducted to evaluate a source of readily degradable protein and the polyether ionophore <b>monesin</b> on the accumulation of peptides and starch digestion in steers fed a high concentrate diet. Four dietary treatments: (1) urea supplement (urea), (2) soybean meal supplement (SBM), (3) urea plus monensin (urea +), and (4) soybean meal plus monensin (SBM +) were compared in a Latin Square 4 x 4 experimental design using four crossbred steers (BW = 280 ± 34 kg). Feeding SBM (P. 05). Monensin decreased apparent organic matter digestion in the rumen (P 10). Ruminal starch digestion, however, tended to be decreased by monensin (P =. 18). Total tract digestibilities of OM, NDF, ADF and starch were not affected by source of supplemental N or monensin (P 3 ̆e. 10). Supplemental SBM increased the flow of undegraded feed-N (P. 10). Microbial efficiency calculated as g bac N/kg OM digested in the rumen was not affected by treatments although a numerical increase (P =. 15) was observed with monensin. Microbial efficiency calculated as 9 bac N/kg starch digested in the rumen was improved when steers were fed SBM (P. 10). Monensin increased the molar proportions of ruminal propionate when steers were fed urea supplemented diets but not when fed SBM supplemented diets (protein by monensin interaction, P 3 ̆c. 001). Neither source of dietary N nor monensin influenced ruminal NH 3 -N concentrations;Results are interpreted to indicate that accumulation of peptides in rumen fluid did not increase starch digestion.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of phytogenic additives (PA) and organic acids (OA), alone or in combination, on the performance, intestinal histomorphometry and lipid oxidation, and immune responses of broiler chickens. In this experiment, 820 one-day-old chicks were distributed according to a completely randomized design in a 2 × 2 + 1 factorial arrangement, with four replicates of 41 broilers each. The dietary treatments consisted of a control diet with no PA or OA (CD); CD with OA and no PA (CD+OA-PA); CD with PA and no OA (CD+PA-CD); CDwith both PA and OA (CD+PA+CD); and CD + avilamycin + <b>monesin</b> sodium. Broiler performance was not affected by the alternative feed additives, except from 1 to 21 days, when broilers fed the CD or CD+PA+OA diets showed higher body weight gain than those fed the CD with only OA. The broilers fed the diet containing avilamycin and monensin presented better performance. The supplementation of PA and OA increased bursalcortical area on 21 and 42 days post-hatch. On 21 days post-hatch, broilers fed the AGP diet presented higher ileal villus height than those fed the control diet. The pH values of the jejunum content were reduced on the OA-fed chickens. Higher villus height and crypt depth were found in the alternative additive-fed chickens on 7 days post-hatch. On 42 days post-hatch, the percentage of the bursal cortex increased in PA-fed broilers; however, there was no increase in antibody production. The PA-fed chickens presented lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values in the small intestine. The dietary supplementation of phytogenic additives, individually or in combination associated with organic acids, does not affect broiler live performance or intestinal histomorphometry; however, it enhances immune responses and intestinal quality...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{purified}} vesicles {{of cardiac}} sarcolemma were prepared from a homogenate of canine ventricular muscle by density gradient centrifugation. The preparation showed an extremely high content of (Na+,K+) -ATPase. The steady state levels of Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme {{formation in the}} presence of Triton X- 100 and the specific ouabain binding in the absence of Triton X- 100 were, respectively, 773 and 907 pmol-mg" 1 under the optimum conditions. On the other hand, the amount of Ca 1 +-dependent phosphoenzyme formed in the absence of Triton X- 100 was less than 2 pmol-mg~ 1. This demonstrates that the preparation was virtually free of contaminant sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments. The preparation showed ATP-dependent Ca 2 + uptake. Almost all the Cat+ accumulated on the addition of ATP was rapidly released by the subsequent addition of NaCl. This finding gives evi-dence that the ATP-driven Ca 2 + pump exists in the cardiac sarcolemma. The Ca 1 + uptake was unaffected by 2,UM digitoxin, 1 /IM <b>monesin,</b> and 200 fiM dinitrophenol. These results exclude the possibility that transmembrane gradients of Na+ and H+ were involved in this Ca 1 + uptake. The Ca 2 + pump was activated by calmodulin. The concentration of calmodulin giving a half-maximum activation was 0. 05 //g-ml" 1, which is equivalent to 3 nM.

40|$|Isolated {{mononuclear}} {{cells from}} 20 healthy volunteers were incubated for 4 hours with varying concentrations of the antibiotics {{either in the}} absence of presence of PMA, ionomycin and <b>monesin.</b> Both moxifloxacin (0 - 50 μg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (0 - 100 μg/ml) dose-dependently decrease the Th 1 signature cytokine IFNγ and IL- 4 (a signature cytokine for Th 2 cells) (p= 0. 001) and only IL 4 was affected by clarithromycin (p= 0. 04, 0 - 125 μg/ml). However, the overall ratio of Th 1 to Th 2 cells was not found to be significantly modulated in cells treated with any of concentrations of the three antibiotics. The findings of the immunomodulatory effects of ciprofloxacin clarithromycin and moxifloxacin strongly implicate transcription factors as major targets of the antibiotics. An investigation of the effect of ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin on the expression of genes and proteins of leucocytes was undertaken utilising. Affymetrix genechip and protein array analysis. Venous blood was drawn from a healthy volunteer and aliquots were incubated for 4 hours in {{the presence or absence of}} 2 μ/ml LPS with concentrations of ciprofloxacin (0 - 50 μg/ml) or moxifloxacin (0 - 20 μg/ml). Leuocytes and plasma were isolated from the whole blood and were taken forward to gene and protein array analysis respectively. These revealed that both ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin are capable of significantly modulating the expressions of a wide range of immune related factors at all the variable concentrations in both endotoxin stimulated and unstimulated whole blood. In particular the array studies revealed that the quinoline drugs were capable of modulating chemoattractant factors which could potentially enhance the inflammatory response and prime cells to migrate to the site of infection, suggesting that early use of the antibiotics may be beneficial. Continued enhanced inflammatory responses could, on the other hand be damaging to patient recovery and survival. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Dois experimentos foram conduzidos com o intuito de avaliar os efeitos da suplementação com diferentes aditivos, sobre o consumo e ganho de peso, em bovinos mantidos em pastagem durante o período das águas. No experimento I, 48 novilhas Nelore, com 266 kg de peso vivo médio inicial, foram distribuídas no delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, em quatro tratamentos, sendo cada animal considerado uma unidade experimental. Os tratamentos foram arranjados em esquema fatorial 2 x 2, com dois tipos de suplemento (suplemento mineral e mineral protéico energético) e dois níveis de monensina (0 e 1200 ppm em suplemento mineral, 0 e 60 ppm em mineral protéico energético). No experimento II, foram utilizados 60 bezerros Nelore, com peso vivo médio inicial de 300 kg. Os animais foram distribuídos em um delineamento inteiramente casualizado em quatro tratamentos com 15 animais cada. Os animais foram submetidos aos tratamentos: com suplemento mineral (controle), suplemento mineral com virginiamicina (1333 ppm), suplemento mineral com salinomicina (1111 ppm) e suplemento mineral com monensina (1000 ppm). Em ambos os experimentos, os animais foram alocados em quatro piquetes de Brachiaria decubens, com 6, 7 hectares cada, e eram rotacionados semanalmente. As análises estatísticas foram feitas utilizando o programa estatístico SAS. No experimento I, o consumo do suplemento mineral protéico energético, com e sem monensina, foi maior em relação aos demais tratamentos (P< 0, 05) e a monensina não provocou uma queda siginificativa no consumo dos suplementos. Os animais que receberam o suplemento mineral protéico energético ganharam mais peso do que os animais que receberam o suplemento mineral (P< 0, 05), não havendo influencia da monensina sobre o ganho de peso. No experimento II, a monensina promoveu uma redução no consumo em relação ao grupo controle (P< 0, 06). O suplemento com virginiamicina não afetou o consumo aos 56 dias, mas os suplementos com salinomicina e monensina reduziram o consumo em relação ao controle (P< 0, 05). Não houve diferença siginificativa no consumo entre os tratamentos aos 28 dias e aos 84 dias, porém houve uma redução no consumo de todos os suplementos. O ganho de peso diário entre os animais que consumiram os aditivos não apresentaram diferenças significativas, mas os tratamentos com virginiamicina e salinomicina proporcionaram ganhos maiores do que o tratamento controle. A virginiamicina e a salinomicina ocasionaram um aumento no ganho de peso, e a salinomicina e a monensina reduziram o consumo. Two {{experiments were}} conducted to evaluate {{the effects of the}} supplementation with different feed additives on feed intake and average daily gain for grazing Nellore bovines during the rainy season. On the experiment I, 48 Nellore heifers (266 kg BW) were distributed in four treatments, and each animal was considered one experimental unit. The treatments were organized in a factorial 2 x 2, two types of supplements (mineral supplement and mineral protein-energy supplement) and two levels of monensin (0 and 1200 ppm in the mineral supplement, 0 and 60 ppm in the mineral protein- energy supplement). In the study II, 60 Nellore calves of 300 kg (BW) were distributed in 4 treatments of 15 animals each. Treatments consisted of the inclusion of: mineral supplement (control treatment), mineral supplement with virginiamycin (1333 ppm), mineral supplement with salinomycin (1111 ppm) e mineral supplement with monensin (1000 ppm). In both studies, animals were allocated in four rotational stocking areas (6, 7 hectares each area) of Brachiariadecubens. Statistical analyses were conducted using the software SAS. In the experiment I, the consumption of the mineral proteic supplement, with and without monensin, was higher compared to the others treatments (P< 0. 05) and the monensin did not cause any significant decrease on the supplement intake. Animals who received protein mineral supplement had higher average daily gain than animals who received mineral supplement (P< 0. 05) and there was no effect of monensin on the weight gain. In the experiment II, the inclusion of monensin reduced the consumption compared to the control treatment (P< 0. 06). The supplement with virginiamycin did not affect the consumption on the day 56, however the supplements with salinomycin and <b>monesin</b> reduced the consumption compared to the control treatment (P< 0. 05).
