5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which <b>make</b> <b>new</b> copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, {{and this is one}} of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, K-III {{continued}} acquiring publishing assets, including a $650 million acquisition from News Corporation in 1991. K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR continued to <b>make</b> <b>new</b> {{investments in the}} company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity. In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company's stock collapsed.|$|E

5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to <b>make</b> <b>new</b> proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E

He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe.

He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then he had to <b>make</b> <b>new</b> contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E

The game takes place {{over the course of}} a week, and consists of the player reading the story, occasionally making choices that affect the direction of the plot; on the sixth day, one of the female characters dies, and the game moves back in time to the beginning, letting the player use knowledge from the first set of six days to <b>make</b> <b>new</b> choices, to try to prevent the character's death.|$|E

They were en route to enroll the two boys at Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut. Lorna Colbert relocated the family downtown to the more urban environment of East Bay Street in Charleston. Colbert found the transition difficult and did not easily <b>make</b> <b>new</b> friends in his new neighborhood. Colbert later described himself during this time as detached, lacking a sense of importance regarding the things with which other children concerned themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{was met with}} mostly positive critical reviews, with many appreciating the gathering of some of Yankovic's best works. However, the box set was not a high seller, and {{near the end of}} the 1990s, it ranked as Yankovic's least-purchased album. In 2006, due to a mishap by Volcano Records, the artwork for the set was lost, and the collection went out of print. Yankovic refused to scan existing copies of the album to <b>make</b> <b>new</b> ones, fearing that it would lead to an inferior product.|$|E

5|$|Viruses are green, (red in Rush mode in the iOS mobile version) spiky {{circles that}} split cells larger than them into many pieces (16 or fewer, {{depending}} on the mass) and smaller cells can hide underneath a virus for protection against larger cells. Cells in 16 pieces can eat viruses without splitting, though it is usually dangerous moving in many pieces, as the cells are smaller and easier to eat.. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can <b>make</b> <b>new</b> viruses by feeding a virus, i.e. ejecting {{a small fraction of}} a player's cell's mass into the virus a few times, causing the virus to split and hence create another virus.|$|E
5|$|With Poland's regained {{independence}} {{came the}} {{major change in}} the fortunes of Kraków—now {{the second most important}} city of a sovereign nation. The state began to <b>make</b> <b>new</b> plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style. Important buildings constructed in the style of Polish modernism include the Feniks 'LOT' building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the Main Square and the Municipal Savings Bank on Szczepański Square. The Józef Piłsudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.|$|E
