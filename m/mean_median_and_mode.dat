40|$|Hypothesis: Data {{from the}} 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36) {{do not follow}} a normal {{distribution}} {{and should not be}} analyzed using parametric techniques. A novel type of analysis, top-box analysis, may add to the interpretation of these data. Design Review of SF- 36 data from preoperative and postoperative patients. Setting Tertiary care hospital and clinic. Patients One thousand randomly selected preoperative and postoperative patients with a variety of surgical diseases completed the SF- 36 (8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, role emotional, bodily pain, vitality, mental health, social functioning, and general health). The best possible score was 100; the worst possible score, 0. One item assessed "health transition. " The best score was 1; the worst score, 5. The health transition item and each domain were analyzed for mean with standard deviation, <b>median,</b> <b>mode</b> skewness, kurtosis, <b>and</b> normality. A "top-box" assessment was done by determining the frequency of patients scoring 100 in each domain or 1 in the health transition item. In addition, preoperative and postoperative scores were compared. Results: The results for all 1000 questionnaires demonstrated that none of the domains had data that followed a normal distribution. The <b>means,</b> <b>medians,</b> <b>and</b> <b>modes</b> were different. Five domains had the <b>mode</b> <b>and</b> <b>median</b> at the top box. Conclusions :The SF- 36 data did not follow a normal distribution in any of the domains. Data were always skewed to the left, with <b>means,</b> <b>medians,</b> <b>and</b> <b>modes</b> different. These data need to be statistically analyzed using nonparametric techniques. Of the 8 domains, 5 had a significant frequency of top-box scores, which also were the domains in which the mode was at 100, implying that change in top-box score may be an informative method of presenting change in SF- 36 data...|$|R

40|$|Craniofacial {{identification}} methods heavily rely on {{the knowledge}} of average soft tissue depths. This study measured soft tissue thicknesses of an Australian cadaver sample (N 533) using published needle puncture techniques at 13 anatomical locations. Data were compared and contrasted with other studies that used essentially identical samples and methods. Full descriptive statistics were calculated for measurements made in this study <b>and</b> <b>means,</b> <b>medians,</b> <b>and</b> <b>modes</b> were reported. Differences between mean values {{for males and females}} were found to be minimal (2. 2 mm or less) and considerable overlap was found between the groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the soft tissue depths of the sexes (P 40. 05). These findings indicate that differences between male and female soft tissue depths are of little practical significance for craniofacial identification and, therefore, data (means, standard deviations, and sample sizes) reported for Australians were pooled across the sexes and the studies. Although these new pooled means have increased statistical power, data distributions at some landmarks were skewed and thus emphasis is placed on <b>median</b> <b>and</b> <b>modes</b> reported for this study rather than upon the collapsed data means...|$|R

50|$|Some {{measures}} that {{are commonly used}} to describe a data set are measures of central tendency and measures of variability or dispersion.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{estimating}} data from experiments determining lottery certainty equivalents. The paper presents the parametric and nonparametric {{results of the}} least squares (<b>mean),</b> quantile (including <b>median)</b> <b>and</b> <b>mode</b> estimations. The examined data {{are found to be}} positively skewed for low probabilities and negatively skewed for high probabilities. This observation leads to the striking conclusion that lottery valuations are only nonlinearly related to probability when means are considered. Such nonlinearity is not confirmed by the mode estimator in which case the most likely lottery valuations are close to their expected values. This means that the most likely behavior of a group is fully rational. This conclusion is a significant departure from one of the fundamental results concerning lottery experiments presented so far. ...|$|R

50|$|Central {{tendency}} {{is one of}} the most common numerical descriptive measures. It's used to estimate the central location of the univariate data by the calculation of <b>mean,</b> <b>median</b> <b>and</b> <b>mode.</b> Each of these calculation has its own advantages and limitations.The mean has the advantage that its calculation includes each value of the data set, but it is particularly susceptible to the influence of outliers. The median is a better measure when the data set contains outliers. The mode is simple to locate. The important thing is that it's not restricted to using only one of these measure of central tendency. If the data being analyzed is categorical, then the only measure of central tendency that can be used is the mode. However, if the data is numerical in nature (ordinal or interval/ratio) then the mode, median, or mean can all be used to describe the data. Using more than one of these measures provides a more accurate descriptive summary of central tendency for the univariate.|$|E
50|$|Amateurs, or collaborators, are not {{formally}} organized, {{they do not}} carry titles relating to their collaboration, and collaborators can have any level of skill. In Clay Shirky's example, users on Flickr fall into the definition of collaborators and they, without any institutional guidance, {{figured out how to}} solve the problem of organizing photographs. To further illustrate his point he references what is commonly known as the 80/20 rule; also known as power law distribution. By harvesting the efforts of multiple amateurs, one can end up with a more valuable result than if one had relied on the traditional institutional model. This distribution dictates that 20% of a group will produce 80% of the content. With power law, the most active contributor is far more active than the second most active, who is far more active than the rest. Here, most producers only contribute relatively minor additions. In this distribution, the <b>mean,</b> <b>median,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mode</b> are typically very different in a power law curve. Due to this contrast in production among contributors, traditional hierarchy is replaced with a heterarchical format wherein distinct roles are blurred.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Our basic {{question}} is as follows: given a, maybe multivariate, probability distribution, how to formalize {{the idea that}} some points are more central than others? We present {{an account of the}} notion of centrality which is based on fuzzy events and is valid for single distributions and for families of distributions (including imprecise probability models). This unifying framework is natural and subsumes many known concepts like the following (not an exhaustive list) : (a) univariate location estimators like the <b>mean,</b> the <b>median</b> <b>and</b> the <b>mode,</b> (b) the interquartile interval and the Lorenz curve of a random variable, (c) several generalized <b>medians,</b> trimmed regions <b>and</b> statistical depth functions from multivariate analysis, (d) most known location estimators for random sets, (e) the probability mass function of a discrete random variable and the coverage function of a random closed set, (f) the Choquet integral with respect to an infinitely alternating or infinitely monotone capacity...|$|R

Rather than relying on educated guesses, we can actually use available statistical data to determine the actual ages at which golfers peak their golf game.
