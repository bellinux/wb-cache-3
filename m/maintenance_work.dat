40|$|With {{a growing}} number of aged {{buildings}} which need to undergo <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> in Hong Kong, disputes concerning building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> has become increasingly common in recent years. There have been contentions that bid-rigging activities involved during the tendering process of these projects. Bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> is a social problem as all buildings will become aged and required to carry out building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> It is illegal and harmful to the society as the affected group of people would be extensively covering all types of occupants in terms of cost and living environment. In the event that bid-rigging arises during tendering process of the building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> flat owners not only have to pay additional amount of money out of the exorbitant building maintenance cost, but they have to bear the risk of works which cannot be properly done. In addition, it implies various parties have participated in the tendering process enabling the building consultants or building contractors to win the maintenance contract fraudulently. Such incidents also reflected that there may be grey areas in legislation which enhances the emergence of bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> Although there are various kinds of supporting schemes from the government and related organizations to assist building owners to carry out <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> the effectiveness of the schemes remain unknown regarding the increasing disputes arise from building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> and bid-rigging. The study would have a deeper understanding for the causes and effects of bid-rigging in relation to building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> in terms of building condition, assistance and policies provided by the government and relevant organizations to assist building owners in Hong Kong. These include technical and financial assistance on building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> education for prevention and detection of infraction in collusive behavior, and legislation and prosecution on alleged crimes. In the final part, recommendations would be made to avoid bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> The goals of the study is to identify the cause of the problem of bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> in Hong Kong and make possible suggestions to prevent the bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{conservation}} of historical buildings {{is a method}} on preserving structures which are historically and culturally important to the nation. Conservation involves works undertaken to preserve {{the condition of the}} building to its original state and this also includes the subsequent <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> is identified as a means on prolonging the lifespan of the historical structures. Without proper and systematic <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> without doubt, the historical buildings will deteriorate and becoming dysfunctional as well as unfit to be used. This paper intends to highlight the establishment of maintenance management, the responses on the importance of <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> to be undertaken for historical buildings, factors governing the effectiveness of <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> on historical buildings and maintenance approaches, inclusive of maintenance programmed undertaken on the structural, non-structural elements as well as the services systems. The findings for this research are summarized from the responses obtained directly from the respondents employed for the management of the historical buildings. Case studies involving 20 numbers of historical buildings, of which some are already categorized under national heritage, were carried out. The methodology for this research is based on personal interviews and distribution of self-developed questionnaire which consists of 10 key topics, all developed relating to {{conservation of}} historical buildings and the current scenario on the implementation of <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> on these buildings...|$|R

The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E
