40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of the Dutch Milk Genomics Initiative, and the general aim was to obtain more insight into the genetic {{background}} of bovine <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition.</b> Morning <b>milk</b> samples from roughly 2000 cows were analyzed for the six major milk proteins (αS 1 -casein, αS 2 -casein, β-casein, κ-casein, α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin) using capillary zone electrophoresis. The estimated genetic parameters for <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition</b> showed that there was considerable genetic variation for <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition</b> and that the genetic correlations among the six major milk proteins were low. There was a strong negative genetic correlation between β-lactoglobulin and total casein in milk. The presence of genetic variation justified the performance of in-depth genetic analyses such as linkage and association mapping. A linkage study was performed to screen the whole bovine genome to identify chromosomal regions affecting <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition.</b> This study resulted in ten chromosomal regions, of which regions on BTA 6, 11 and 14 showed the largest effect on <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition.</b> The confidence intervals of these regions were large, in general. Therefore, an association study was performed to narrow down these chromosomal regions and to detect new chromosomal regions affecting <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition.</b> The association study resulted in four main regions on BTA 5, 6, 11 and 14, and also new regions were detected. These new regions may, in addition to the four main regions, {{play a role in the}} genetic regulation of milk protein synthesis. The <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition</b> is important for technological properties of milk. An increase in casein index is preferable for the cheese production. Therefore, four scenario’s, to increase casein index in milk, were discussed.

40|$|Milk fat {{contains}} {{a large number}} of fatty acids (FA) and other liposoluble components that exhibit various effects on human health. The present article reviews some of the factors affecting FA, vitamin A and cholesterol concentrations in milk from dairy cow and goat. <b>Milk</b> fat <b>composition</b> is linked to many factors, both intrinsic (animal species, breed, lactation stage) and extrinsic (environmental). The effect of animal species on <b>milk</b> fat <b>composition</b> is important, as reflected by higher concentrations of short- and medium-chain FA, vitamin A and cholesterol in goat than in cow milk. In a given ruminant species, the effects linked to breed are significant but limited and they can only be achieved over long periods of time. The lactation stage has an important effect on <b>milk</b> FA <b>composition,</b> mainly linked to body fat mobilisation in early lactation, but it only lasts a few weeks each year. Furthermore, changes in feeding have a marked influence on <b>milk</b> fat <b>composition.</b> Changing the forages in the diet of ruminants, pasture in particular, or supplementing lipids to the diet, represent an efficient mean to modify <b>milk</b> fat <b>composition</b> by decreasing saturated FA and cholesterol, and increasing cis- 9,trans- 11 -CLA and vitamin A.

The final version is available from American Society for Nutrition via [URL] Intravenous or ruminal infusion of cobalt ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Co-EDTA) or Co-acetate alters <b>milk</b> fat <b>composition</b> in cattle but the mechanisms involved are not known. ? Objective: The present study evaluated the effect of ruminal Co-EDTA infusion on milk fatty acid (FA) composition, mammary lipid metabolism, and mammary lipogenic gene expression. ? Methods: Four cows in mid-lactation and fitted with rumen cannulae were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square with 28 d periods. Co-EDTA was administered in the rumen to supply 0, 1. 5, 3. 0 or 4. 5 g of Co/d over an 18 -d interval with a 10 d washout between experimental periods. Milk production was recorded daily and <b>milk</b> FA <b>composition</b> determined on alternate days. Mammary tissue was biopsied on d 16 and arterio-venous differences of circulating lipid fractions and FA uptake across the mammary gland measured on d 18. Results: Co-EDTA {{had no effect on}} intake, rumen volatile FA or milk production, but caused dose-dependent changes in <b>milk</b> FA <b>composition.</b> Alterations in <b>milk</b> fat <b>composition</b> were evident within 3 d of infusion and characterized by linear or quadratic decreases (P < 0. 05) in FAs containing a cis- 9 double bond, an increase in 4 : 0 and 16 : 0, and linear decreases in milk 8 : 0, 10 : 0, 12 : 0, and 14 : 0 concentrations. Co-EDTA progressively decreased (P < 0. 05) the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) catalyzed desaturation of FAs in the mammary gland by up to 72 %, but had no effect on mammary SCD 1 mRNA or protein abundance.

PhD thesis, Wageningen University, the Netherlands Fat {{is one of}} the main components in bovine milk and comprises a large number of individual fatty acids (FA). The composition of FA in milk varies considerably due to differences in the genetics and nutrition of cows and an increasing interest in the possibilities for modifying FA composition can be noticed nowadays. In this thesis two fields of interest were combined, namely: production of milk with specific <b>milk</b> fat <b>composition</b> and conservation of native cattle breeds. Therewith, the overall objective of this thesis was to investigate the variability of detailed <b>milk</b> FA <b>composition</b> between and within different dairy cattle breeds, including the mainstream Holstein Friesian (HF) and Jersey, and the native dual purpose breeds Meuse-Rhine-Yssel (MRY), Groningen White Headed (GWH) and Dutch Friesian (DF) in the Netherlands. For this study the accuracy of mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry was evaluated for predicting FA composition in different breeds. Differences of <b>milk</b> FA <b>composition</b> within and between breeds were investigated using MIR and Gas Chromatography (GC) information. Finally, similarities in genomic variation associated with detailed <b>milk</b> fat <b>composition</b> between the mainstream HF breed and native dual purpose breeds were studied. Results show that MIR is an accurate method for predicting FA composition among different breeds and countries. Evaluating the FA composition in different breeds, differences were found in <b>milk</b> FA <b>composition</b> among herds using different cattle breeds in the Netherlands, based on detailed milk FA measurements using GC. Evaluating the FA <b>composition</b> in <b>milk</b> between and within breeds using a large dataset that included MIR spectra of milk from cows from a range of farms using one or more breeds, in general, only minor breed differences in FA composition were found and HF showed more genetic variation in FA composition compared to MRY. Furthermore, differences were detected between the native breeds MRY, DF and GWH in genomic variations of regions that are associated with FA composition in HF, while most variation in these main regions was clearly observed in HF. Overall, it was concluded that no large differences existed in <b>milk</b> FA <b>composition</b> among the native Dutch dual purpose breeds and the mainstream HF breed. It is suggested, however, that selecting specific FA composition differences in farms using different breeds in the Netherlands can attribute to modifying the FA <b>composition</b> in bovine <b>milk</b> production.  ...|$|R

An association study of 50, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed for even-chain saturated fatty acids (C 4 : 0 -C 18 : 0), even-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (C 10 : 1 -C 18 : 1), and the polyunsaturated C 18 : 2 cis 9,trans 11 (CLA) to identify genomic regions associated with individual fatty acids in bovine milk. Results The two-step single SNP association analysis found a total of 54 regions on 29 chromosomes that {{were significantly associated with}} one or more fatty acids. Bos taurus autosomes (BTA) 14, 19, and 26 showed highly significant associations with seven to ten traits, explaining a relatively large percentage of the total additive genetic variation. Many additional regions were significantly associated with the fatty acids. Some of the regions harbor genes that are known to be involved in fat synthesis or were previously identified as underlying quantitative trait loci for fat yield or content, such as ABCG 2 and PPARGC 1 A on BTA 6; ACSS 2 on BTA 13; DGAT 1 on BTA 14; ACLY, SREBF 1, STAT 5 A, GH, and FASN on BTA 19; SCD 1 on BTA 26; and AGPAT 6 on BTA 27. Conclusions Medium chain and unsaturated fatty acids are strongly influenced by polymorphisms in DGAT 1 and SCD 1. Other regions also showed significant associations with the fatty acids studied. These additional regions explain a relatively small percentage of the total additive genetic variance, but they are relevant to the total genetic merit of an individual and in unraveling the genetic background of <b>milk</b> fat <b>composition.</b> Regions identified in this study can be fine mapped to find causal mutations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects exerted by the content of casein and whey protein fractions on variation of pH, rennet-coagulation time (RCT), curd-firming time (K 20), and curd firmness of Mediterranean buffalo individual milk. Measures of <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition</b> and assessment of genotypes at CSN 1 S 1 and CSN 3 were obtained by reversed-phase HPLC analysis of 621 individual milk samples. Increased content of αS 1 -casein (CN) was associated with delayed coagulation onset and increased K 20, whereas average pH, RCT, and K 20 decreased when β-CN content increased. Milk with low κ-CN content exhibited low pH and RCT relative to milk with high content of κ-CN. Increased content of glycosylated κ-CN was associated with unfavorable effects on RCT. Effects of <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition</b> on curd firmness were less important than those on pH, RCT, and K 20. Likely, this occurred as a consequence of the very short RCT of buffalo milk, which guaranteed a complete strengthening of the curd even in the restricted 31 min time of analysis of coagulation properties and for samples initially showing soft curds. Effects of CSN 1 S 1 -CSN 3 genotypes on coagulation properties were not to be entirely ascribed to existing variation in <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition</b> associated with polymorphisms at CSN 1 S 1 and CSN 3 genes. Although the role of detailed <b>milk</b> protein <b>composition</b> in variation of cheese yield needs to be further investigated, findings of this study suggest that modification of the relative content of specific CN fractions can relevantly influence the behavior of buffalo milk during processing...|$|R
