40|$|This {{issue of}} the Stockpile Stewardship Quarterly {{addresses}} some of our latest research areas, ranging from computing to manufacturing. The first article on the 20 -petaflop Sequoia supercomputer describes why it is {{number one in the}} world according to the Graph 500 data analytics benchmark. This is a remarkable tool which supports a required capability for stockpile stewardship. High energy density physics experiments are an important element of stockpile stewardship. An example is given in the second article which describes a new class of ablators, diamond and beryllium, which can result in more efficient implosions for National Ignition Facility ignition shots. This issue also includes yet a different approach to achieving thermonuclear burn in the laboratory. It is a pulsed power approach utilizing magnetically driven cylindrical implosions. The approach, called magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF) is being studied on the Z <b>machine.</b> <b>Burn</b> conditions are achieved through insulating magnetic fields. The last article presents how certain Laboratory Directed Research and Development projects have paid dividends for additive manufacturing (AM). Examples of AM projects are given and the staff who enabled this progress are highlighted. With the arrival of the warmer season, I wish everyone a safe (and relaxing) summer with family and friends...|$|E

The sequence featuring the witch has been almost entirely removed, as is most of the climactic battle sequence, which had already been greatly shortened in the Allied cut.

5000|$|This {{story is}} set in China many centuries ago, where a servant to the emperor Yuan notices a man that has created a contraption for flying. Emperor Yuan {{is not at all}} happy when he asks the {{inventor}} his purpose in creating such a device and the inventor replies that his motivation was merely the desire for innovation. Thus Yuan orders that the inventor shall be executed because, while his flying machine may be a beautiful creation, the emperor sees the devastating potential for those who [...] "have an evil face and an evil heart" [...] and will seek to use it for purposes other than the enjoyment of flight, namely flying over the Great Wall of China (which he himself created) and destroying it. For this reason, the inventor is executed, the flying <b>machine</b> <b>burned,</b> and all who saw it are silenced. But in the last line the Emperor mourns the loss of the machine, the marvel of which he appreciates but the danger of which is too great to allow its survival. This story can be used to weight pros and cons, as a theme.|$|R

50|$|Party {{standing}} in the U.S. Congress was strengthened once Hawaii achieved statehood in 1959. For the first time, political representation was fully justified as newly elected representatives were allowed to cast votes. The achievement of statehood had also significantly enhanced the party's status within national party organizations. Democrats have held onto a solid majority since 1962, with near-complete control over the state's congressional delegation and its legislative and executive branch. At the national level, Democrats held all of Hawaii's seats in the Senate and the House. Both positions of governor and lieutenant governor were also filled by Democrats, with the former being held by John Burns, the organizer of the <b>Burns</b> <b>Machine</b> in 1954. <b>Burns</b> {{was instrumental in the}} revitalization of the party following World War II. He was reelected two more times and died shortly after his third term in office in 1975.|$|R

40|$|The dry leaves (trash) {{adhering}} to ripe sugarcane {{are a significant}} source of renewable energy. At present, most of this energy is wasted in South Africa, since approximately 90 % of the cane crushed is burnt in the fields prior to harvesting. Apart from wasting valuable energy, this practice causes substantial environmental pollution. The cane trash burner is a patented <b>machine</b> that <b>burns</b> the cane leaves off the stalks in a sugar mill prior to shredding. Tops are left in the field while the cane, with adhering trash, is harvested and transported to the factory. The energy captured in the burner can be utilised for electricity through generating steam in a normal sugar mill boiler. The paper describes the construction of the pilot scale version of the burner, and gives details of initial burning trials, including the potential energy recoverable from the process. It deals with the main advantages and disadvantages of using the burner and lists some of the important economic factors affecting its incorporation into a standard raw sugar factory...|$|R

The procedure was applied over the Brazilian Cerrado savanna, validated with reference maps obtained from Landsat images and {{compared with the}} Collection 6 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Burned Area product (MCD 64 A 1) Results show that the algorithm developed improved the detection of small-sized scars and displayed results more similar to the reference data than MCD 64 A 1. Unlike active fire-based region growing algorithms, the proposed approach allows for the detection and mapping of burn scars without active fires, thus eliminating a potential source of omission error. The burned area mapping approach presented here should facilitate the development of operational-automated burned area algorithms, and is very straightforward for implementation with other sensors...|$|R

5000|$|Factionalism {{within the}} party was {{a problem in the}} late 1960s, as a newer {{progressive}} wing (led by Tom Gill) began to challenge the older wing headed by incumbent governor Burns. This division in the party reached a high point in 1970, when Gill challenged Burns for the next gubernatorial term. As a supporter of environmental protection, consumer protection and other progressive causes, Gill lost the primary election to Burns. While factional struggles continued into the 1970s, the Burns regime remained in power. [...] The strength of the <b>Burns</b> <b>Machine</b> has diminished since the mid-1980s, primarily due to the advanced ages of its original supporters.

Martoccio Macaroni Company {{acquired}} a defunct candy factory in 1911 {{for the sole purpose}} of replacing one of his own factory's <b>machines</b> that had <b>burned</b> out. Martoccio was talked into buying the entire Pratt and Langhoft Candy plant and found himself in the confectionery business. He purchased another candy company, the Pendergast Candy Company of Minneapolis in 1927, changing the name to Hollywood Brands in 1933. The Pendergast Company had discovered the method of making a fluffy nougat for candy bars that was copied by Frank Mars for his Milky Way bars. Martoccio invented a synthetic coating for his candy bars to keep them from melting in warm temperatures. Martoccio used only the very best ingredients—real cocoa butter, eggs, etc., and was still able to sell his milk chocolate bars for 3 cents compared to the 5 cent Hershey bar (1955). That was not continued after the company was sold in 1967.|$|R
