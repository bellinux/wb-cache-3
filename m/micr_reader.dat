50|$|MICR {{characters}} are printed on documents {{in either of}} the MICR fonts. The ink used in the printing is a magnetic ink or toner, usually containing iron oxide. The MICR text is passed before a <b>MICR</b> <b>reader.</b> The ink in {{the plane of the}} paper is first magnetized. Then the {{characters are}} passed over a MICR read head, a device similar to the playback head of a tape recorder. As each character passes over the head it produces a unique waveform that can be easily identified by the system.|$|E
50|$|Check {{scanners}} {{are used}} by banks or business through remote deposit capture programs to take a digital image of the check and send {{the information to the}} bank for deposit. This is where the image of a check on your bank statement originates. If a check scanner is not properly cleaned financial institutions risk increased transaction failures, equipment malfunctions, personnel costs to reconcile poor images, equipment repair or exchange and non-compliance due to poor image quality. A cleaning card designed to clean a specific model of check scanner is run through the device the same way the operator would run a check through the device. The cleaning card makes contact with the optical lenses, <b>micr</b> <b>reader,</b> transport belts and rollers, print heads and clears the check path.|$|E
50|$|With the Medium System, a {{computer}} could be simultaneously running a batch payroll system, inputting bank checks on a <b>MICR</b> <b>reader</b> sorter, compiling COBOL applications, supporting on-line transactions, and doing test runs on new applications (colloqially called 'the mix', as the console command 'MX' would shows that jobs were executing). It {{was not unusual}} to be running eight or ten programs on a medium-size B2500. Medium System installations often had tape clusters (four drives integrated into a mid-height cabinet) for magnetic tape input and output. Free-standing tape drives were also available, but they were much more expensive. Tape was a major storage medium on these computers, in early days it was often used for father-son batch updating; with additional disk becoming cheaper as time moved on it became relegated as a library/backup device that contained all the data files and sometimes the program files (using the MFSOLT utility) for a particular application or customer/client.|$|E
50|$|The final ERM {{computer}} contained {{more than}} a million feet (304,800 metres) of wiring, 8,000 vacuum tubes, 34,000 diodes, 5 input consoles with <b>MICR</b> <b>readers,</b> 2 magnetic memory drums, the check sorter, a high-speed printer, a power control panel, a maintenance board, 24 racks holding 1,500 electrical packages and 500 relay packages, and 12 magnetic tape drives for 2,400-foot (731-metre) tape reels.|$|R
50|$|Instead, {{they decided}} to combine the two technologies, and used MICR-printed account numbers which could be read by a {{magnetic}} reader {{similar to those in}} a cassette tape recorder. The resulting reader was a mechanical tour-de-force, combining five <b>MICR</b> <b>readers</b> with a large rotating drum that forced checks dumped in the top to come out the bottom single-file. The system was eventually able to read ten checks a second, with errors on the order of 1 per 100,000 checks.|$|R
50|$|The Deluxe Corporation {{also used}} {{a bank of}} Series/1 IBM 4956 {{computers}} for each check printing facility which handled the plant's business and personal check sales orders and printing operations. Various serial peripherals were attached: Printronix bar-coding printers, <b>MICR</b> <b>Readers,</b> IBM ASCII Terminals. Parallel devices were also used for phototypesetting machines, plate makers and Teletype BRPE punch creating Punched tape; all connecting to the IBM integrated DI/DO Digital In/Out card. The Series/1 was a good work horse for its day and was operational around the clock in an industrial environment.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (<b>MICR)</b> <b>reader</b> is {{a device}} that reads a {{personal}} check for payment at a store. A customer’s financial institution, account number, and check number are examples of data gathered from the check by the <b>MICR</b> <b>reader.</b> These machines are not perfect [...] - an error rate of about 5 % is typical due {{to a variety of}} factors. This work analyzes <b>MICR</b> <b>reader</b> error rates from Meijer, Inc. Based on this analysis, a new method of flagging faulty readers is introduced that improves upon Meijer’s current policy. A procedure {{that can be used to}} fix or replace a flagged machine is also suggested. In addition, cost effective solutions to MICR reade...|$|E
50|$|MICR code is a character-recognition {{technology}} used mainly by {{the banking industry}} to ease the processing and clearance of cheques and other documents. The MICR encoding, called the MICR line, {{is at the bottom}} of cheques and other vouchers and typically includes the document-type indicator, bank code, bank account number, cheque number, cheque amount, and a control indicator. The technology allows <b>MICR</b> <b>readers</b> to scan and read the information directly into a data-collection device. Unlike barcodes and similar technologies, MICR characters can be read easily by humans. The MICR E-13B font has been adopted as the international standard in ISO 1004:1995, but the CMC-7 font is widely used in Europe, Brazil and Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Cleaning {{cards are}} {{disposable}} products designed {{to clean the}} interior contact points of a device that facilitates an electronic information transaction (point of sale terminal, automated teller machine, remote deposit check scanners, <b>micr</b> <b>readers,</b> magnetic stripe reader, bill acceptor, bill validator, access control locks, etc.). In order for the cleaning card to work properly in the device, the card resembles or mimics the material of the transaction media - such as a credit card, check, or currency. As the cleaning card is inserted and passed through the device, it will clean components that would normally {{come in contact with}} the transaction media such as readers, lenses, read/write chip and pins, belts, rollers, and paths. Cleaning card products are widely accepted and endorsed by device manufacturers and industry professionals. Many have developed their own cleaning cards to better clean their particular devices.|$|R
50|$|Beverly Hills Data Center - Part of the CDC Cybernet {{network and}} also a rarity for CDC - did {{complete}} bank computing for about 12 small local banks. A midpoint of the CyberNet system, it interfaced to the Los Angeles Data Center (CDC 6600). The banking accounts were acquired from Corporation for Economic, Industrial and Operations Research (C.E.I.R) - an IBM system (1401?) which was replaced with the 3300. This system had 8 or 10 CDC 854 disk drives and connected to a Burroughs model B-3000 magnetic ink character <b>reader</b> (<b>MICR).</b>|$|R
