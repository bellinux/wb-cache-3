5|$|Quarter Ponies {{are often}} used in western riding {{activities}} as mounts for children because of their small size, and calm, even temperament. Larger ponies are <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for adult riders and sometimes used for rodeo events such as steer wrestling.|$|E
5|$|After the {{previous}} depot was destroyed, the Central Vermont Railroad (which then leased the New London Northern) began making {{plans for a}} larger replacement station. The Central Vermont and the New Haven Railroad (which had bought the Shore Line in 1870) bought {{the east end of}} the Parade from New London for the unusually low price of $15,000, with the understanding that the railroads would build a structure <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for the bustling city.|$|E
5|$|Even though Opera Mini {{is based}} on the same {{rendering}} engine as Opera for personal computers, it does not pass the Acid2 test. This is because Opera Mini intentionally reformats web pages to try to make them <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for devices with small screens.|$|E

5|$|In {{towns and}} central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were {{increasingly}} covered by weatherboards, a fashion {{made possible by}} sawmill technology. These buildings were better insulated and better protected against the harsh climate. But {{the main reason for}} the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> than bare log walls as a background to details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture.|$|E
5|$|Monotype has {{released}} two separate digitisations named Bembo {{and more recently}} Bembo Book, {{as well as the}} more slender caps-only display font Bembo Titling and the alternate italic design Fairbank. Bembo Book is considered to be superior by being thicker and <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for body text, as well as for offering the alternate shorter R for better-spaced body text.|$|E
5|$|Moore's first {{deployment}} as {{an artist}} was with the RAAF in Papua New Guinea in early 1944. His earlier watercolour paintings, made in Milne Bay and Goodenough Island, were destroyed by wet weather and humidity; he subsequently changed to working with oils, which were <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for the tropical environment.|$|E

5|$|Robin Hood Gate {{takes its}} name from the nearby Robin Hood Inn (demolished in 2001) and is close to what is called the Robin Hood {{roundabout}} on the A3. Widened in 1907, it has been closed to motorised vehicles since a 2003 traffic reduction trial. Alterations commenced in March 2013 to make the gates <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for pedestrian use and return some of the hard surface to parkland.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Frieda, {{a friend}} of Esther who has never {{received}} any marriage proposals, tells Shira that Esther would have preferred that Yochay marry her {{in the event of}} her death. As a result, Shira tells Yochay that Frieda is <b>more</b> <b>suitable,</b> which he takes as an affront.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breed}} first became commercial, it {{has spread to}} Canada and become a major {{contributor}} in the commercial lamb industry. The breed adapts well to confinement and is readily used in accelerated crossbreeding programs. Polled Dorsets thrive under grass-based and feedlot conditions and are <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> on small farms that are intensely managed.|$|E

A pronouncement that the marriage had been invalid was obtained from Pope Paul V, and on 7 February 1617 he married Caterina de’ Medici.|$|R
30|$|Planting <b>more</b> trees <b>suitable</b> for nesting and reproducing, {{improving}} ponds, {{swamps and}} grassland {{within and outside}} the buffer zone to create a food source and the better living environment for wild animals. There is also promoting tree planting in rural areas, industrial zones and urban areas to create the good habitat conditions for the biodiversity conservation.|$|R
5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} to make it <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> as a family film. By {{the time it was}} completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E
5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, York Minster or Westminster Abbey, would be <b>more</b> <b>suitable.</b> A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law grounds for the courts {{to be involved in}} that decision. Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015, during a televised memorial service held {{in the presence of the}} Archbishop of Canterbury and senior members of other Christian denominations.|$|E
5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is {{a method}} by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{bankruptcy}} of the Canadian Northern Railway, the First World War, the Great Depression, and a <b>more</b> than <b>suitable</b> existing hotel, delayed {{the building of the}} third Hotel Vancouver until 1937. When it was erected, it was expedited as a public work project to bring in much needed construction in the dark days of the Depression.|$|R
50|$|Helipot Corporation, the spinoff {{company that}} Beckman had created when NTL's board were dubious about electronics, was reincorporated into Beckman Instruments {{and became the}} Helipot Division in 1958. Helipot {{researchers}} were experimenting with cermets, composite materials made by mixing ceramics and metals. Potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were <b>more</b> heat-resistant, <b>suitable</b> for use at extreme temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|As the GSP is a medium/large, active breed, {{the dogs}} can require {{considerable}} food. Older or less active GSPs can also become obese if fed <b>more</b> than <b>suitable</b> for the individual's activity levels. A healthy weight should permit {{the last two}} ribs to be felt under the coat and the dog should have a distinct waist or [...] "tuck-up".|$|R
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, and it appears to have become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.2 was {{released}} on August 8, 2005 and added the option of One Bit Audio, used on Super Audio CDs, at up to 8 channels. To make HDMI <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for use on PC devices, version 1.2 also removed the requirement that only explicitly supported formats be used. It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would {{not be required to}} support YCBCR output.|$|E

5|$|HMS Renown was a second-class predreadnought {{battleship}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1890s. Intended to command cruiser squadrons operating on foreign stations, the ship served as the flagship of the North America and West Indies Station and the Mediterranean Fleet early in her career. Becoming obsolete as cruiser speeds increased, Renown became a royal yacht and had all of her secondary armament removed to make her <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for such duties. She became a stoker's training ship in 1909 and was listed for disposal in 1913. The ship was sold for scrap in early 1914.|$|E
5|$|In 1539, {{the fledgling}} colonial town of Villa de Señor San Pedro de Puerto Caballos was moved three leagues {{to the south}} and was given the new name of San Pedro de Puerto Caballos. At this time it {{consisted}} of just twelve palm-thatched houses imitating the native style of construction; in 1541 it had 35 Spanish residents. Montejo also moved Santa María de Comayagua to a <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> location and assigned 35 conquistadors as its citizens. Rich silver deposits were soon found there.|$|E
5|$|In 1711, by {{the order}} of then-Governor of Kiev, the route between the Zamkova and Andriyivskyy {{mountains}} were expanded, thus allowing traffic to become <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for horses and wagon carriages. The Andriyivskyy Descent was renamed in 1920 in honor of young revolutionary Georgiy Liver. In 1944, {{it was decided to}} return the street to its prior name; in 1957, the street was renamed back to Andreevsky Spusk—the Russian variant of Andriyivskyy Descent. In the 1980s, the Andriyivskyy Descent received a thorough reconstruction after years of disrepair.|$|E

40|$|Public global {{networks}} as {{for example}} the internet with {{the world wide web}} represent more and <b>more</b> a <b>suitable</b> platform for distributed information systems. Yet, the lack of methods for conceptual modelling (as known for the database design) often leads to quick and dirty implementations with uncontrollable data, data redundancies and data inconsistencies. In this paper, we present a method for the conceptual modelling of information systems within the world wide web. Starting from an extended Entity Relationship model, a page link scheme can be derived according to a classification of web pages and their links. 1 Introduction With its growing acceptance and use public global networks represent more and <b>more</b> a <b>suitable</b> platform for distributed information systems.
