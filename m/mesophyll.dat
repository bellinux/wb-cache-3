5|$|Salkin {{had noted}} that its {{tropical}} position might mean that B.dentata {{was a key}} species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the <b>mesophyll.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{research}} has focused on thrips species that feed on economically significant crops. Some species are predatory, but most of them feed on pollen and the chloroplasts harvested from the outer layer of plant epidermal and <b>mesophyll</b> cells. They prefer tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom thrips feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time and mortality is reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.|$|E
25|$|Both {{types of}} {{chloroplast}} contain {{large amounts of}} chloroplast peripheral reticulum, which they use to get more surface area to transport stuff {{in and out of}} them. <b>Mesophyll</b> chloroplasts have a little more peripheral reticulum than bundle sheath chloroplasts.|$|E
25|$|Anthocyanins {{are found}} in the cell vacuole, mostly in flowers and fruits, but also in leaves, stems, and roots. In these parts, they are found {{predominantly}} in outer cell layers such as the epidermis and peripheral <b>mesophyll</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|In {{some plants}} such as cacti, chloroplasts {{are found in the}} stems, though in most plants, chloroplasts are {{concentrated}} in the leaves. One square millimeter of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts. Within a leaf, chloroplasts are mainly found in the <b>mesophyll</b> layers of a leaf, and the guard cells of stomata. Palisade <b>mesophyll</b> cells can contain 30–70 chloroplasts per cell, while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8–15 per cell, as well as much less chlorophyll. Chloroplasts can also be found in the bundle sheath cells of a leaf, especially in C plants, which carry out the Calvin cycle in their bundle sheath cells. They are often absent from the epidermis of a leaf.|$|E
25|$|Generalist herbivores {{are more}} likely than specialists to be {{negatively}} affected by the defense chemicals that endophytes produce because they have, on average, less resistance to these specific, qualitative defenses. Among the chewing insects, infection by mycorrhizae can actually benefit specialist feeders even if it negatively affects generalists. The overall pattern of effects on insect herbivores seems to support this, with generalist <b>mesophyll</b> feeders experiencing negative effects of host infection, although phloem feeders appear to be affected little by fungal defenses.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily, {{carbon dioxide}} is fixed to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) by the enzyme RuBisCO in <b>mesophyll</b> cells exposed {{directly}} to the air spaces inside the leaf. This exacerbates the transpiration problem for two reasons: first, RuBisCo has a relatively low affinity for carbon dioxide, and second, it fixes oxygen to RuBP, wasting energy and carbon in a process called photorespiration. For both of these reasons, RuBisCo needs high carbon dioxide concentrations, which means wide stomatal apertures and, as a consequence, high water loss.|$|E
25|$|Those {{plastids}} {{that contain}} chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis. Plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes, {{which can be}} used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules. For example, the components of the plant cuticle and its epicuticular wax are synthesized by the epidermal cells from palmitic acid, which is synthesized in the chloroplasts of the <b>mesophyll</b> tissue. All plastids are derived from proplastids, which are present in the meristematic regions of the plant. Proplastids and young chloroplasts commonly divide by binary fission, but more mature chloroplasts also have this capacity.|$|E
25|$|Only one {{generation}} occurs per year. The butterfly lays its eggs on the leaves, buds, and seed pods of L. albifrons, L. formosus, and L. variicolor. The eggs are usually {{laid on the}} upper side of new lupine leaves. Eggs generally hatch within 6 to 10 days and the first- and second-instar larvae feed on the <b>mesophyll</b> of the lupine plants. The caterpillars, extremely small, feed {{for a short time}} and then crawl to the plant base, where they enter a dormant state, known as diapause, until the late winter or the following spring. Diapause usually begins about three weeks after eclosion and begins {{about the same time as}} the host plant shifts its energy to flower and seed production. When the caterpillar comes out of its diapause and begins feeding, it occasionally sheds its skin to accommodate its growth.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{diversity of}} gall forming insects are {{found among the}} flies, principally in the family Cecidomyiidae (gall midges). Many flies (most importantly in the family Agromyzidae) lay their eggs in the <b>mesophyll</b> tissue of leaves with larvae feeding between the surfaces forming blisters and mines. Some families are mycophagous or fungus feeding. These include the cave dwelling [...] Mycetophilidae (fungus gnats) whose larvae are the only diptera with bioluminescence. The Sciaridae are also fungus feeders. Some plants are pollinated by fungus feeding flies that visit fungus infected male flowers.|$|E
2500|$|Starch {{granules}} vary {{in composition}} and location across different chloroplast lineages. In red algae, starch granules {{are found in}} the cytoplasm rather than in the chloroplast. In [...] plants, <b>mesophyll</b> chloroplasts, which do not synthesize sugars, lack starch granules.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, chloroplasts in [...] <b>mesophyll</b> {{cells and}} bundle sheath cells are {{specialized}} for {{each stage of}} photosynthesis. In <b>mesophyll</b> cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack RuBisCO, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store [...] in a four-carbon compound, {{which is why the}} process is called [...] photosynthesis. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off [...] and returns to the <b>mesophyll.</b> Bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out the light reactions, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting RuBisCO activity. Because of this, they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks—though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow, a light-driven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen. They lack photosystem II, and only have photosystem I—the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow. Because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the Calvin cycle and make sugar, they often contain large starch grains.|$|E
2500|$|... plants evolved a way {{to solve}} this—by {{spatially}} separating the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. The light reactions, which store light energy in ATP and NADPH, are done in the <b>mesophyll</b> cells of a [...] leaf. The Calvin cycle, which uses the stored energy to make sugar using RuBisCO, {{is done in the}} bundle sheath cells, a layer of cells surrounding a vein in a leaf.|$|E
2500|$|PEPCK (...) is one {{of three}} {{decarboxylation}} enzymes used in the inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms of C4 and CAM plants. The others are NADP-malic enzyme and NAD-malic enzyme. In C4 carbon fixation, carbon dioxide is first fixed by combination with phosphoenolpyruvate to form oxaloacetate in the <b>mesophyll.</b> In PEPCK-type C4 plants the oxaloacetate is then converted to aspartate, which travels to the bundle sheath. [...] In the bundle sheath cells, aspartate is converted back to oxaloacetate. PEPCK decarboxylates the bundle sheath oxaloacetate, releasing carbon dioxide, which is then fixed by the enzyme Rubisco.|$|E
2500|$|In {{leaves of}} C3 plants, {{captured}} photons of solar energy undergo photosynthesis which assimilates carbon into carbohydrates (triosephosphates) in the chloroplasts of the <b>mesophyll</b> cells. The primary CO2 fixation step is catalysed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) which reacts with O2 leading to photorespiration that protects photosynthesis from photoinhibition but wastes 50% of potentially fixed carbon. concentration and prospects for its introduction into C3 plants |journal=J.

2500|$|Guard {{cells are}} {{specialized}} {{cells in the}} epidermis of leaves, stems and other organs {{that are used to}} control gas exchange. They are produced in pairs with a gap between them that forms a stomatal pore. The stomatal pores are largest when water is freely available and the guard cells turgid, and closed when water availability is critically low and the guard cells become flaccid. Photosynthesis depends on the diffusion of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air through the stomata into the <b>mesophyll</b> tissues. Oxygen (O2), produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis, exits the plant via the stomata. [...] When the stomata are open, water is lost by evaporation and must be replaced via the transpiration stream, with water taken up by the roots. Plants must balance the amount of CO2 absorbed from the air with the water loss through the stomatal pores, and this is achieved by both active and passive control of guard cell turgor and stomatal pore size.|$|E
60|$|Large {{leaves from}} an ivy plant growing {{on a wall}} were so tough {{that they could not}} be gnawed by worms, but after four days they were {{affected}} in a peculiar manner by the secretion poured out of their mouths. The upper surfaces of the leaves, over which the worms had crawled, as was shown by the dirt left on them, were marked in sinuous lines, by either a continuous or broken chain of whitish and often star-shaped dots, about 2 mm. in diameter. The appearance thus presented was curiously like that of a leaf, into which the larva of some minute insect had burrowed. But my son Francis, after making and examining sections, could nowhere find that the cell-walls had been broken down or that the epidermis had been penetrated. When the section passed through the whitish dots, the grains of chlorophyll were seen to be more or less discoloured, and some of the palisade and <b>mesophyll</b> cells contained nothing but broken down granular matter. These effects must be attributed to the transudation of the secretion through the epidermis into the cells.|$|E
