40|$|The bulk {{growth of}} solid {{solution}} alloys of <b>mercury</b> <b>telluride</b> and <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> is discussed.

The electronic energy band gap can be controlled between zero and 1. 6 electron volts by adjusting the composition x. The most useful materials are at x approximately 20 %, suitable for detection wavelengths of about 10 micrometers. The problems of growing large crystals are rooted in the wide phase diagram of the HgTe-CdTe pseudobinary system which leads to exaggerate segregation in freezing, constitutional supercooling, and other difficulties, and in the high vapor pressure of mercury at the growth temperatures, which leads to loss of stoichiometry and to the necessity of working in strong, pressure resistant sealed containers...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNear-infrared {{wavefront}} sensing {{allows for}} the enhancement of sky coverage with adaptive optics. The recently developed HgCdTe avalanche photodiode arrays are promising due to their very low detector noise, but still present an imperfect cosmetic that may directly impact real-time wavefront measurements for adaptive optics and thus degrade performance in astronomical applications. We propose here {{a model of a}} Shack-Hartmann wavefront measurement in the presence of residual fixed pattern noise and defective pixels. To adjust our models, a fine characterization of such an HgCdTe array, the RAPID sensor, is proposed.

40|$|Films of Cd-rich <b>cadmium</b> <b>mercury</b> <b>telluride</b> (Cd=Hgl =Te, CMT) 0. 1 to 2 ~m thick {{were formed}} on {{conducting}} lass (SnO 2) and cadmium substrates by electrochemical (potentiostatic) deposition from an aqueous bath. 1 - x ranged from 0 to 0. 25. The photoresponse of CMT electrodes of n- and p-type {{was investigated in}} electrolytes containing different redox couples. In 1 M polysulfide solution, the onset of photocurrents was found at- 1. 1 V vs. SCE, independent of the optical bandgap. In the plateau range of the photocurrent potential curves, quantum yields of charge collection up to 0. 45 were measured for Cd 0. gHg 0. 1 Te. The long-wavelength onset of photoresponse varied with the bandgap (1. 47 - 1. 08 eV) for 1 - x between 0. 01 and 0. 2. The drawback of the small minority-carrier diffusion length of CMT grown by electrocrystallization can be circumvented with stacked, semitransparent thin-film electrodes.
