50|$|At the One-Eleven Club, Rodney {{introduces}} Cassandra to Del Boy. They also meet Arnie, {{a retired}} jeweller, who interests the Trotters in 250 18 carat gold chains. Arnie {{explains that he}} acquired the chains for another man, <b>Mr</b> <b>Stavros,</b> but has not heard from him since, {{and now he is}} willing to sell them for half their wholesale price. Del forms a consortium of himself, Rodney, Albert, Boycie, Trigger, and Mike who purchase the chains for £12,500. However, seconds after the deal has gone through, Arnie calls his wife, who informs him that <b>Mr</b> <b>Stavros</b> has made contact and now wishes to purchase the chains. Arnie is distraught as he has shaken on the deal, and worries about having to explain to Stavros that he has sold the chains. Del calms the situation down with an idea. Arnie will sell the chains to Stavros on the consortium's behalf for the original price of £25,000, with Arnie receiving £2,000 for his troubles, leaving the consortium with a healthy profit.|$|R
