40|$|Abstract—The {{influence}} of the ground slope on radar backscat-ter has been proven to be greater for lower radar frequencies due to deeper canopy penetration. In this study, <b>multiple</b> <b>heading,</b> P-band SAR data of boreal forest in Sweden was used to find a model for topographic correction for improved biomass retrieval. Eleven models were tested and the best model was selected. The selected model was then used for biomass retrieval. Even {{by means of the}} most simplified approach, forest biomass could be established with a root-mean-square error of approximately 50 t/ha for HV and 66 t/ha for HH. I...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM {{produced}} the first global {{digital elevation model}} (DEM) data set of the world’s topography in the year 2000. The data set covers regions between ± 60 degrees latitude with a resolution of 30 meters. The 90 % height accuracy in these regions is on the range of 6 meters, limited by the baseline length, the metrology and the instrument noise. In mountainous areas larger data gaps exist in the C-band data set produced by NASA/JPL {{as well as in}} the X-band data set produced at DLR. The reason for these gaps are high slopes that lead to radar shadow, layover and to phase unwrapping problems. In order to overcome these problems and to further increase the DEM accuracy, future systems must take advantage of multiple incidence angles, <b>multiple</b> <b>heading</b> angles and multiple baselines or multiple radar frequencies. The paper demonstrates high mountain artifacts in SRTM data and demonstrates strategies and algorithms to overcome them. Optimized acquisition strategies for future missions are proposed that are adapted to the slope distribution of the area. The TanDEM-X mission currently studied at DLR and the expected product accuracy is shortly presented. ...|$|E

40|$|Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) are a committed-choice {{declarative}} language {{which has been}} designed for writing constraint solvers. A CHR program consists of multi-headed guarded rules which allow one to rewrite constraints into simpler ones until a solved form is reached. Many examples in the vast literature on the subject show that <b>multiple</b> <b>heads</b> are important in order to write programs which solve specific problems. On the other hand, the presence of <b>multiples</b> <b>heads</b> complicates considerably the semantics. Therefore, since restricting to single head rules {{does not affect the}} Turing completeness of the language, one can legitimately ask whether <b>multiple</b> <b>heads</b> do indeed augment the expressive power of the language. In this paper we answer positively to this question by showing that, under certain reasonable assumptions, {{it is not possible to}} encode the CHR language (with multi-headed rules) into a single head language while preserving the intended meaning of programs. ...|$|R
