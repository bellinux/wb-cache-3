40|$|<b>Disablement</b> <b>pensions</b> (Invalidity benefits) - Resumé As I am {{interested}} in the situation of disabled people {{and the ability of}} the community to take care properly of these needy people I decided to write a thesis on the subject of <b>disablement</b> <b>pensions</b> (or invalidity benefits). The aim of this thesis was to give a reader an overview of how different countries regulate the conditions under which invalidity benefits are provided. At the same time I would like to describe in detail and evaluate above named national legislations in the same structure, if possible. The first chapter deals with historical aspects. After the origins of social security are mentioned, I already focus on the historical development of invalidity benefits' legislation in european and czech context. The next chapter is an analysis of invalidity benefits at the international level. Especially the achievements of the International Labour Organization, the Council of Europe and the European Union in the field of <b>disablement</b> <b>pensions</b> are highlighted. It is completed by a brief description of bilateral agreements on social security. The third chapter, which is the largest one included in this thesis, examines the czech legislation regarding the invalidity benefits. First of all the issue of the pension insurance in general is outlined. The [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chronic {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) negatively {{affects the}} patient’s health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Only a few population-based studies have compared the HRQoL of patients with the background population. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the HRQoL in a European cohort of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease 10 years after diagnosis (European Collaborative study group of Inflammatory Bowel Disease) compared with the national background population in each country and to assess possible country-specific differences. Methods: Patients with IBD from 7 European countries were invited to a follow-up visit 10 years after their diagnosis of IBD. We assessed their clinical and demographic data, including the generic HRQoL questionnaire short form health survey- 36. Countrywise comparison with the background population was performed with z-scores using the Cohen’s effect size index. Results: Seven hundred sixty-nine patients were eligible for the study. We registered statistically significant and clinically relevant decreases in the short form health survey- 36 dimensional scores in patients with symptoms at the time of follow-up and for patients reporting sick leave during the previous year or having received <b>disablement</b> <b>pension.</b> In the Netherlands and Norway, there was a moderate difference between the patients with IBD and the background population for the general health dimension. Conclusions: Overall, the HRQoL was not reduced in the IBD cohort compared with the background populations. However, in addition to older age and female gender, current symptoms at follow-up, <b>disablement</b> <b>pension,</b> and sick leave during the previous year were significantly associated with a reduced HRQoL in patients with IBD.

40|$|This article {{examines}} recent claims for healthcare made by British veterans {{who participated in}} nuclear bomb testing in the 1950 s. Specifically, it focuses on their claims for war <b>disablement</b> <b>pensions,</b> exploring how they seek and challenge medical diagnoses. Detailing three veteran case studies, the article offers an ethnographic analysis of illness narratives. It explores how sufferers attempt to recast and reject the evidential burdens that they face in pension appeals, and identifies three narratives strategies that they deploy aimed at linking somatic realities to political etiologies. I propose the notion of biopolitical endpoints to capture how test veterans narratively connect political and medical domains as they seek to enable state culpability and redress.

40|$|This {{research}} is a qualitative {{analysis of the}} role of accounting in British <b>disablement</b> <b>pensions</b> awarded to men who sustained shell shock during their Army service in the First World War. It suggests that accounting classification of shell shock for pension determination purposes supported a view of shell shock which made men with shell shock scapegoats of a system that was often unsupportive. Accounting classification contributed to the lack of support by distancing pension decision-makers from the moral consequences of pension determinations. This was able to occur because the British government used accounting classification as part of a mechanism to avoid blame for its pension determination choices. This research contributes to an ongoing debate about the role of government by suggesting that the functions of government provide opportunities for accounting to simultaneously serve a neutral role as mere inscription while being a social and moral construct...|$|R
40|$|Background: Health {{and social}} {{conditions}} early in life {{has been associated with}} health and social function in adult age. However, the specific relation between parental disability in early life and adult function has not been subject to epidemiological investigation. We investigated the association between parental disability pension in childhood and adolescence, and subsequent outcomes related to health and social function in young adult age. Methods: Through linkage between several national registers containing personal information from birth into adult age we established a longitudinal, population based cohort. Study participants were all subjects born in Norway in 1967 – 1976 who were national residents at age 18 (N= 610 981). The study outcomes were educational attainment, intellectual level, mortality, disability pension, work participa-tion, and sickness absence in young adult age. Results: Parental disability pension was, after adjustment for potential confounders, moderately associa-ted with low educational attainment, low intellectual performance, increased mortality, lack of work participation, and increased number of sickness absence spells. The association was strongest for own disability pension when attaining adult age (hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) was 1. 98 (1. 81 – 2. 17) for women and 1. 94 (1. 79 – 2. 11) for men).

40|$|Collateral benefits’ {{received}} by accident victims also seeking damages at common law pose problems for both {{policy makers and}} lawyers. This article examines these problems {{in the specific context}} of the work related benefits which a plaintiff may receive. For example, should sickness payments or <b>disablement</b> <b>pensions</b> be taken into account to reduce the damages payable by a tortfeasor? Litigation has produced a complex set of rules influenced by policies which pull in different directions. There is uncertainty about how the employment benefits should be viewed: are they to be deducted because they are akin to those publicly provided by the welfare state, or are they to be left out of account, as are monies payable under an insurance policy, because they are truly private rights, independently negotiated and separately paid for? Do the benefits merely duplicate tort by being paid for the same purposes as the damages, or do they offer compensation for some additional losses? The questions posed by collateral benefits {{lie at the heart of}} any compensation system, and constitute one of the keys to its future direction. This is because the inter-relationship of compensation schemes is crucial in understanding the extent and fairness of the provision made for those incapacitated and disabled in society. The Law Commission has recently issued a Consultation Paper on collateral benefits. Although this article looks only at benefits related to work, it covers the key area where the major decisions must be made and the policies formulated...|$|R
50|$|In housing policy, a {{shift of}} {{emphasis}} in housing policy towards rehabilitation {{was evident in the}} further {{increase in the number of}} General Improvement Areas and the number of Housing Action Areas declared. An Act of March 1977 makes provision, for a limited period, for benefits to be paid from the age of 64 to workers who agree to retire in order to free jobs for young unemployed people, in response to the rise of youth unemployment. A number of other improvements were introduced in 1977, with Attendance Allowances extended to cover handicapped foster children and non-contributory <b>disablement</b> <b>pensions</b> extended to married women whose invalidity prevented them from carrying out their household tasks. In January 1977, regulations were issued which brought about a change in the administration of legislation governing fire precautions at places of work. Under these regulations the Health and Safety Executive retained full responsibility for fire safety in certain 'special' premises such as nuclear installations, coalmines and chemical plants, whereas responsibility for general fire precautions at places of work was transferred to local fire authorities. In July 1977, an experimental Job Introduction Scheme was introduced to provide financial assistance enabling certain disabled people to undertake a trial period of employment with an employer, where there was reasonable doubt as to the person’s ability to perform a particular job. In July 1978, a revised and simplified scheme designed to assist severely disabled people with their travel-to-work costs was introduced.|$|R
40|$|A {{regional}} prevalence {{group of}} 106 patients with Crohn's disease were interviewed about their familial, social, and professional conditions. The results {{were compared with}} results from similar interviews of an age and sex matched control group of 75 previously healthy patients {{admitted to the hospital}} for acute diseases of less than 28 days' duration. An equal percentage of the patients and the controls were married (67 % vs 71 %) and had become parents (68 % vs 79 %). The number of children was slightly lower among Crohn's disease patients. The occurrence of familial problems and sexual problems did not differ among patients and controls. The intake of sedatives was low in both groups and no difference was found in alcohol and tobacco intake between patients and controls. A combined score for social activities comprising cultural, sporting, educational and private social arrangements showed that about one-third of patients and controls had high social activity and about half of both groups had moderately high social activity. A similar physical activity score showed no difference between the two groups. The socioeconomic level of the Crohn's disease patients was slightly, but significantly higher than that of the controls. Sixty five per cent of Crohn's disease patients were employed, 64 % of controls; 6 % and 7 % respectively unemployed. Three per cent of Crohn's disease patients had <b>disablement</b> <b>pension.</b> Of Crohn's disease patients employed, a higher percentage (77 %) had remained in the same job {{for more than five years}} (64 % of controls). The number of sick leave days during previous year was less than 11 in 72 / 69 % of patients and controls. In spite of these objectively good results 54 % of patients with Crohn's disease felt exacerbations of their disease strained their professional and personal life. During the previous year 23 % reported decreased working capacity and 21 % reported decreased leisure activities, compared with their own expectations...|$|R
