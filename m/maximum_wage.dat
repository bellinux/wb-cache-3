5|$|The late 1950s saw a sharp {{downturn}} in Sunderland's fortunes, {{and the club}} was once again implicated in a major financial scandal in 1957. Found guilty of making payments to players {{in excess of the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>wage,</b> they were fined £5,000 (£ today), and their chairman and three directors were suspended. The following year, Sunderland were relegated from the highest division {{for the first time in}} their 68-year league history.|$|E
5|$|He turned {{professional}} at Burnley {{at the age}} of 17 {{on wages}} of £7 a week. His grandfather attempted to negotiate a £500 signing-on fee on his behalf but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt to circumvent the league's <b>maximum</b> <b>wage</b> was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 seconds, before going on to record a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head.|$|E
5|$|Injury limited him to only 28 {{appearances}} in 1948–49, as Blackpool struggled to a 16th-place finish. He {{spent the summer}} touring theatres in a variety act with his brother Ronnie, though he was troubled by an ankle injury he picked up in a charity game. Blackpool finished seventh in 1949–50, and though they were never title contenders vast crowds still turned out home and away to witness the entertaining football they displayed. At this time he received the <b>maximum</b> <b>wage</b> allowed for a professional player – £12 a week.|$|E

5|$|Whilst playing {{part-time}} for Distillery he {{also worked}} at the Harland and Wolff shipbuilding company. Though the <b>maximum</b> <b>wage</b> in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined {{to leave for the}} English Football League at the earliest opportunity, particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955. He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat Glentoran 1–0 in the second replay of the 1956 final of the Irish Cup at Windsor Park. He played mostly at half-back in the 1956–57 season as Distillery finished sixth in the Irish League and ended up as runners-up in the Ulster Cup, City Cup, and County Antrim Shield.|$|E
5|$|Rules stipulating a <b>maximum</b> <b>wage</b> {{for players}} were {{abolished}} in 1961. This {{resulted in a}} shift of power towards bigger clubs. Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as {{the highest level of}} football in England, and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put wealth into the hands of top flight clubs in a hitherto unprecedented manner. The first five champions in the Premier League era - Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United - had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were crowned champions {{for the first time in}} 2016, becoming the first (and to date only) team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division.|$|E
5|$|Stoke City {{arranged}} a testimonial match {{in honour of}} Matthews; it was much needed as he {{had spent most of}} his career constricted to the tight <b>maximum</b> <b>wage</b> that had been enforced upon the English game. The game was played at the Victoria Ground on 28 April 1965, by which time Matthews had decided to retire as a player, and the pre-match entertainment consisted of another match of two veteran teams featuring many legends of the game. Harry Johnston led out a team consisting of Bert Trautmann, Tim Ward, George Hardwick, Jimmy Hill, Neil Franklin, Don Revie, Stan Mortensen, Nat Lofthouse, Jimmy Hagan, Tom Finney and Frank Bowyer (reserve). Walley Barnes led out an opposing team consisting of Jimmy O'Neill, Jimmy Scoular, Danny Blanchflower, Jimmy Dickinson, Hughie Kelly, Bill McGarry, Jackie Mudie, Jackie Milburn, Jock Dodds, Ken Barnes, and Arthur Rowley (reserve).|$|E

5|$|The same year, Arsenal became {{embroiled in}} a scandal; footballers' pay {{at the time was}} limited by a <b>maximum</b> <b>wage,</b> but an FA enquiry found that Charlie Buchan had {{secretly}} received illegal payments from Arsenal as an incentive to sign for the club. Sir Henry Norris was indicted for his part and banned from football, but Chapman escaped punishment, and with the autocratic Norris replaced by the more benign Samuel Hill-Wood, Chapman's power and influence within the club increased, allowing him control over all aspects of the club's business. He persevered in building the team, strengthening his attacking lineup with the signings of David Jack in 1928, and Alex James and Cliff Bastin in 1929. As at his previous clubs, Chapman worked on improving the defence, notably through the signings of Herbie Roberts and Eddie Hapgood at centre half and left back respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 Constantine {{had signed}} an initial three-year {{contract}} with Nelson, {{to play in}} the Lancashire League. The contract was worth £500 per season, plus performance bonuses and travelling expenses. He remained there until 1937, an unusually long time for a professional to remain with one club. Constantine's appearances boosted attendances and gate receipts for all Nelson's matches, and was of great financial benefit to both the club and the League as a whole. In Constantine's nine seasons at the club, Nelson never finished lower than second, won the league competition seven times and the knockout cup twice. In 1931 Constantine renewed his contract for £650 per season; when in 1935 a rival league attempted to sign him, all the Lancashire League clubs contributed to his wage, which rose to £750 per year between 1935 and 1937. This was far more than the then <b>maximum</b> <b>wage</b> for a professional footballer of £386, or the £500 per season that a top county cricketer could potentially earn, and possibly made Constantine the best-paid sportsman in the country. Consequently, he and his family enjoyed a good standard of living {{for the first time in}} their lives.|$|E
5|$|In the club's {{early history}} the {{appearance}} record {{was held by}} goalkeeper Arthur Cartlidge, who played in 258 Southern League games between 1901 and 1909. His record stood until it was broken by another goalkeeper, Jesse Whatley, who played 14 times in the Southern League and a further 372 in The Football League, making a total of 386 overall. Following the Second World War the Bristol Rovers board introduced a no-buy/no-sell policy, which remained in force until {{the abolition of the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>wage</b> in football in 1961; as a result some players in that era had a high number of appearances for the club. Eight of the top nine most-used players played during this time, each making over 400 appearances. These eight were Bobby Jones (421 appearances), Alfie Biggs (424), Ray Warren (450), Harold Jarman (452), George Petherbridge (457), Geoff Bradford (462), Jack Pitt (466), and Harry Bamford (486). The club's all-time leading appearance maker, Stuart Taylor, played in 546 League games between 1965 and 1980. The club's highest scorer by a wide margin is Geoff Bradford, who scored 242 times in The Football League, exceeding the next-highest scorer Alfie Biggs by 64 goals.|$|E

50|$|The Statute of Artificers 1563 (5 Eliz. 1 c. 4) was an Act of Parliament of England, under Queen Elizabeth I, {{which sought}} to fix prices, impose <b>maximum</b> <b>wages,</b> {{restrict}} workers' freedom of movement and regulate training. Local magistrates had responsibility for regulating wages in agriculture. Guilds regulated wages of the urban trades. Effectively, it transferred to the newly forming English state the functions previously held by the feudal craft guilds.|$|R
5|$|After leaving Cardiff in 1956, he {{released}} his autobiography I Lead the Attack {{in which he}} revealed {{that he was involved}} in an illegal-payments scandal while at Sunderland, with the club attempting to circumvent the <b>maximum</b> <b>wage</b> at the time by offering payments and other incentives to players. Ford detailed several ways that Sunderland's board of directors had attempted to add extra bonuses such as offering houses for free or at hugely reduced costs to players and the free installation of new kitchen appliances whenever needed. The revelations saw the club suffer heavy financial penalties and Ford was temporarily suspended from the game. However, he maintained that he never regretted releasing the book. Following his suspension, Ford initially announced his retirement from football at the age of 33 but decided to come out of retirement in 1957. With the suspension in place, he was forced to look overseas for a club, signing for Dutch club PSV Eindhoven who were managed by Englishman George Hardwick at the time. Despite averaging a goal nearly every other game, Ford was largely in the shadow of one of the PSV's all-time greats in Coen Dillen during his spell with the club and failed to win a trophy during his three-year stint in Holland. He eventually won his case for reinstatement, returning to The Football League with a brief spell at Newport County in the Third Division. He ended a long career playing his football at Romford. In 1955, Ford also guest appeared for Southern Premier League side Gloucester City.|$|E

25|$|The Football League was reorganised for the 1958–59 {{season with}} Third Divisions North and South discontinued. The {{top half of}} each {{regional}} Third Division from the previous season formed a new Third Division, while the lower halves formed the new Fourth Division.

50|$|Included in {{the value}} of labour power is both a {{physical}} component (the minimum physical requirements for a healthy worker) and a moral-historical component (the satisfaction of needs beyond the physical minimum which have become an established part of the lifestyle of the average worker).

50|$|Eastham's time at Arsenal {{was often}} turbulent; {{as well as}} the court case against Newcastle United, he fell out with Arsenal after asking for a pay rise {{following}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>wage's</b> abolishment in 1961 (but eventually Arsenal relented and met his demands), and he asked for a transfer after being replaced by Joe Baker up front {{at the start of the}} 1962-63 season. However, Billy Wright sought a compromise and eventually restored Eastham to the side, behind Baker; Eastham's form returned, he came off the transfer list and in both 1963-64 and 1964-65 he scored ten goals, the most per season during his Arsenal career, which included two in a 4-4 draw in a memorable North London derby match against Tottenham Hotspur at Highbury in October 1963.|$|R

25|$|Sam Bartram, {{a former}} player, was {{appointed}} manager in July 1960. The club {{had a long}} list of injured or unsettled players on its books and many old favourites from the First Division years were sold. The abolition of the <b>maximum</b> <b>wage</b> in football hit the club's finances hard. Attendances dwindled, and the club finished 13th in 1960–61. The following season saw a remodelled team again finish 13th. Attendances had dropped to dangerous levels and the club was losing £400 a week. Bartram left {{at the end of the}} season; Jack Crompton was appointed manager on 29 June 1962 but resigned six days later citing his doctor's instructions. An increasingly desperate search for a manager ended with the appointment of Bill Harvey late in July. Harvey could do nothing to stop the club's decline – Luton finished with just 29 points as the team was relegated to the Third Division. Mitchell was subsequently replaced as chairman by Tom Hodgson. The club was already in serious relegation trouble in December 1963 when the signing of a young goalscorer, John O'Rourke, helped improve performances. O'Rourke scored both goals in the last home game of the season against rivals Watford, preventing the Hertfordshire club's promotion and guaranteeing Luton's survival.|$|E
