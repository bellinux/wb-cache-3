40|$|Macroeconomic {{control and}} microeconomic {{liberalization}} and reinvigoration are mutually complementary and conditional. In reforming the economic structure, both areas are important. <b>Macrocontrol</b> {{of the national}} economy has two objectives. One, in terms of value, total social production must meet total demand. Second, in terms of use value or product output, total production must also meet total demand. The first objective is quantitative balance. The second is balance between departments and products. Balance in value is the primary concern of <b>macrocontrol.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the effect of carbon emission regulations on the vehicles assignment optimization problem. We propose a mathematical model, in which the choice of vehicles (between the traditional and new environmental-friendly ones) and the proper assignments to customers are the decision variables. We introduce a new measure, called the over-emission intensity (OEI) factor, with which the government can control {{the amount of carbon}} emission of companies. Based on this proposal, we establish a new mechanism, known as the cap-and-trade program with OEI, and incorporate it into the optimization model. This novel model is then validated and used to study the impacts of OEI, carbon emission quota, emission price, and budget, on the operational performance and optimal decision of the company. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model by illustrating the effect of market regulation and government's <b>macrocontrol</b> on the reduction of carbon emission. We also show how the OEI affects the company's total cost, total amount of carbon emission, and the optimal vehicles assignment scheme. Finally, we argue that integrating the government <b>macrocontrol</b> scheme with the market mechanism is an effective measure. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} that the tax {{division}} system was implemented at the central-provincial levels, the Jiangxi provincial government implemented the tax division system at the sub-provincial levels beginning on January 1, 1994. This reform combined the principles of the State Council with the actual difficult situation in Jiangxi provincial finances, and measures were taken guided by the principle "if the province is to be enriched, counties must be enriched first. " The tax division reform in Jiangxi province aims (1) to gradually standardize the distributive relationship between the prefectural, municipal, and county governments; (2) to increase provincial <b>macrocontrol</b> power while maintaining the stock of local financial resources; and (3) to develop local revenue sources and mobilize local incentives to generate revenue. ...|$|E
30|$|From {{a policy}} perspective, our {{findings}} highlight that energy prices and macroeconomic risk factor variations have significant but different influences on carbon price. Moreover, only oil price {{has a positive}} effect on the carbon price. Thus, close but unstable dependences of coal price and macroeconomy have decreased the complexity of carbon price volatility regulation. China has established a national carbon emission trading market since 2017, and it has been predicted that the scale of this market will reach one trillion RMB after 2020. The establishment of this national carbon emissions trading market will help the carbon price to become more market-oriented, which will facilitate essential future research into the mechanisms of price fluctuation and the factors that influence the price of carbon emissions price in China (Zeng et al. 2017). To promote the carbon emission trading market at the national level, the government may establish market-oriented regulations and enhance low carbon development {{to make sure that the}} carbon emission trading market is efficient. Meanwhile, the government policymakers should strengthen <b>macrocontrol</b> of the macroeconomy and energy market.|$|E
40|$|With the {{continuous}} increase of marketization and normalization in the Chinese real estate market, the market mechanism now {{plays an important}} role in market regulation. The existing macro-control system for the real estate market, however, appears to lack the ability to regulate it. Thus, an effective and efficient information-oriented tool is needed to guide the development of Chinaâ€™s real estate market. The research reported herein constructs a new macro-control system for this market that is based on information systems, specifically, a real estate warning system, a confidence index system, and a simulation system. This paper first presents the framework of the new information systems-based macro-control system, and its functions are analyzed. The methods of constructing the system are then discussed. Based on these methods, the index systems of the respective information systems are established, and the main models are presented. Finally, a case study that is based on survey data from the Shenzhen real estate market is described to demonstrate the applicability of the new <b>macrocontrol</b> system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a national- and regional-scale urban growth model (NRUGM) of China based on panel data analysis. Through the panel analysis, population growth, road construction, salary increment per capita, and secondary industry product increment were {{proven to be}} the major driving factors for national-scale urban expansion. According to Seventh Five-Year Plan, China had been divided into three regions, Eastern China, Middle China, and Western China, by their geographic position and economic development. We studied the relationship between urban expansion and the driving factors for the three regions between 1990 and 2010 in China. The driving factors of urban expansion were different for the different regions and periods. Population growth and road construction were identified as the two major factors driving urban expansion for Eastern China. Secondary industry and economic development had become the major driving factors for urban expansion over {{the last twenty years}} in Middle China. Over the same period, for Western China, economic growth had become the major driving factor for urban expansion. Our results have significant policy implications for China. The <b>macrocontrol</b> of the central government should utilize different policies to adjust urban expansion in the different regions...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{research into}} effects of electron gun control on piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) structures. The experimental apparatus {{specific to the}} electron gun control of this structure is detailed, and the equipment developed for the remote examination of the bimorph surface profile is outlined. Experiments conducted to determine the optimum electron beam characteristics for control are summarized. Clearer boundaries on the bimorphs control output capabilities were determined, as was the closed loop response. Further controllability analysis of the bimorph is outlined, {{and the results are}} examined. In this research, the bimorph response was tested through a matrix of control inputs of varying current, frequency, and amplitude. Experiments also studied the response to electron gun actuation of piezoelectric bimorph thin film covered with multiple spatial regions of control. Parameter ranges that yielded predictable control under certain circumstances were determined. Research has shown that electron gun control {{can be used to make}} <b>macrocontrol</b> and nanocontrol adjustments for PVDF structures. The control response and hysteresis are more linear for a small range of energy levels. Current levels needed for optimum control are established, and the generalized controllability of a PVDF bimorph structure is shown...|$|E
