However, the profile likelihood is not a true likelihood, as it is not based directly on a probability distribution, and this leads to some less satisfactory properties.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was conventional in layout, all metal, metal-covered, with low-set wings and a twin tail. Originally a popular profile designed by Ryszard Bartel (also {{used in many}} other successful Polish airframes incl. PZL P.11) was planned for the aircraft; the need to store bombs inside wings forced modifications. Some publications claim the resulting profile displayed laminar-flow properties (one {{of the first in}} the world), but this is disputed - its shape which resembled laminar flow wings developed in later years, but this was largely fortuitous, and at any rate achieving the laminar flow regime would have required additional construction features (most importantly extremely smooth wings shaped with extreme precision) which the aircraft simply lacked. However, the profile did display lower drag than expected and the first A version had maximal speed 10% higher than the originally planned 360 km/h. The <b>modified</b> <b>profile</b> was viewed as highly successful and was later re-used for other projects (sometimes in further modified form; e.g. PZL.46 Sum, PZL.49 Miś, PZL.50).|$|E

40|$|Various {{modifications}} of the profile likelihood {{have been proposed}} in the literature. Despite <b>modified</b> <b>profile</b> likelihood methods have better properties than those based on the profile likelihood, the signed likelihood ratio statistic based on the <b>modified</b> <b>profile</b> likelihood has a standard normal distribution only to first order, {{and it can be}} inaccurate in particular in models with many nuisance parameters. In this paper we propose an adjustment of the profile likelihood from a new perspective. The idea is to resort to suitable default priors on the parameter of interest only to be used as non-negative weight functions in order to modify the <b>modified</b> <b>profile</b> likelihood. In particular, we focus on matching priors, i. e. priors on the parameter of interest only for which there is an agreement between frequentist and Bayesian inference, derived from <b>modified</b> <b>profile</b> likelihoods. The proposed <b>modified</b> <b>profile</b> likelihood has desiderable inferential properties: the corresponding signed likelihood ratio statistic is standard normal to second order and the correponding maximizer is a refinement of the maximum likelihood estimator, which improves its small sample properties.

40|$|It is well known, {{at least}} through many examples, that when there are many {{nuisance}} parameters <b>modified</b> <b>profile</b> likelihoods often perform {{much better than the}} profile likeli- hood. Ordinary asymptotics almost totally fail to deal with this issue. For this reason, we study asymptotic properties of the profile and <b>modified</b> <b>profile</b> likelihoods in models for stratified data in a two-index asymptotics setting. This means that both the sample size of the strata, m, and the dimension of the nuisance parameter, q, may increase to infinity. It is shown that in this asymptotic setting <b>modified</b> <b>profile</b> likelihoods give improvements, with respect to the profile likelihood, in terms of consistency of estimators and of asymp- totic distributional properties.

40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds have a {{tocopherol}} profile {{dominated by}} alpha-tocopherol. The {{objective of this}} research was to study the dynamics of tocopherol accumulation in sunflower lines with altered total tocopherol content or tocopherol profile. Developing seeds were sampled at regular intervals in two lines with reduced and increased total tocopherol content, respectively, and six lines with <b>modified</b> tocopherol <b>profiles.</b> The line with reduced tocopherol content showed a tocopherol accumulation rate reduced by half, whereas the line with increased tocopherol content showed a tocopherol accumulation rate twofold higher than the control. In the three cases, alpha-tocopherol followed a sigmoid accumulation pattern. <b>Modified</b> tocopherol <b>profiles</b> were expressed at early stages of tocopherol accumulation. In most lines with <b>modified</b> <b>profiles,</b> tocopherol accumulation pattern differed from the alpha-tocopherol lines, with maximum tocopherol content at 18 or 21 days after flowering (DAF) that was reduced to reach a plateau from 33 or 36 DAF onward. Such a reduction was caused by continued dry matter accumulation after tocopherol accumulation ceased or slowed down. In lines with increased levels of beta-tocopherol or both gamma- and delta-tocopherol, the synthesis of beta- and delta-tocopherol started and stopped earlier than the synthesis of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, respectively. © 2013 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.
