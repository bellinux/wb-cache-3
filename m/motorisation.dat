In these areas a motorised infrastructure is being developed alongside <b>motorisation</b> of the population. Great disparity of wealth means that {{only a fraction of}} the population can motorise, and therefore the highly dense multimodal transportation system for the poor is cross-cut by the highly motorised transportation system for the rich.|$|E
25|$|In the {{developing}} world, {{the migration from}} rural to urbanized habitats has progressed differently. Many areas of {{the developing}} world have urbanised without significant <b>motorisation</b> and the formation of suburbs. A small portion of the population can afford automobiles, but the automobiles greatly increase congestion in these multimodal transportation systems. They also produce considerable air pollution, pose a significant safety risk, and exacerbate feelings of inequities in the society. High population density could be supported by a multimodal system of walking, bicycle transportation, motorcycles, buses, and trains.|$|E
25|$|Before the First World War, {{mechanic}} Charles Marius Fouché {{cooperated with}} engineer Édouard Quellennec and the latter's son Jacques Quellennec to adapt existing caterpillar tractors {{to the conditions}} of Egyptian and French farming, among them the Holt Model 75. In this context in 1914 contacts were made with engineer Eugène Brillié of Schneider & Co. to adapt the Castéran Flexible Track Tractor. When that year war broke out, Jacques Quellennec was drafted as an infantry sergeant, witnessed most men of his unit being slaughtered during the First Battle of the Marne and was then severely wounded {{at the end of}} October. While recovering, he devised plans for an armoured tractor armed with a machine-gun and capable of destroying German machine-gun nests. Many in this period had comparable ideas but contrary to most, Quellennec had excellent contacts. Fouché had become a second lieutenant with the Grand Parc Automobile de Réserve of the Service Automobile, the Army branch responsible for <b>motorisation,</b> and Brillié was chief designer with one of France's main arms manufacturers. Early December, Quellennec met Fouché in Paris and both then went to Brillié to present drawings of a tracked armoured fighting vehicle. During a second visit Quellennec urged Brillié to bring over two Holt Model 75 tractors, at that time present in Tunisia, to France in order to perform the first trials. Brillié showed himself less than enthusiastic about the idea, objecting there would be not enough room on a tractor for both crew and armament. In February 1915, Quellennec was sent to an air force training base and tasked Fouché with trying to convince Brillié, without much apparent success.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSustainable Urban Mobility Planning is on Europe's top {{agenda for}} {{tackling}} urban transport challenges in cities. European Union policies {{call for a}} coordinated approach in increasing the effectiveness of urban mobility planning to achieve climate protection goals. National and local authorities require common guidance on developing and implementing such plans – with broad involvement of public authorities, transport professionals and research. Cities in Central and Eastern Europe have a long planning culture with strong focus on public transport. However, the unprecedented increase of private <b>motorisations</b> calls for innovative strategies to offer sustainable transport solutions to people. Two exemplary cities from the region demonstrate how sustainable transport can be maintained and even expanded. Gdynia (Poland) with its developing economy and relatively young population makes considerable efforts to reduce motor traffic demand in the area. The City's transport policy and strategy is focused on solving relevant transport problems {{of the city in}} a sustainable way. This covers the increase of bicycle use, an intelligent mix of different transport options and improving the quality of PT services by means of state of the art information and communication technologies and public participation mechanisms. Koprivnica (Croatia) stands exemplary for numerous medium-sized cities in the region with similar transport challenges. Decision makers work towards a participatory strategy for zero CO 2 emission planning and management of housing estates and urban transport. With the vision of developing a regional competence centre for sustainable urban mobility planning the city will attract researchers, students and professionals in this field. Long-term vision of both cities and their dedication to actively share their experiences with other cities has the potential for up-take of sustainable urban mobility planning in the region...|$|R
500|$|At {{the same}} time, the Faculty of Mechanisation and <b>Motorisation</b> of the Military Technical Academy named after F.E. Dzerzhinsky {{developed}} two tank models (TMM-1 and TMM-2) {{based on the}} Vickers 6-Ton tank design but with an American Hercules [...] six-cylinder water-cooled engine, improved front armour (to 15–20mm), and a driver's position on the left side. TMM stands for tank maloy moshchnosti or [...] "tank of low power". The TMM-1 was equipped with transmission details from the native [...] (...) and a ball mount for the DT tank machine gun {{in front of the}} hull, whereas the TMM-2 was equipped with an improved gear box, a steering device without clutches and a 37mm Hotchkiss gun in the right turret. Representatives from the main Soviet tank manufacturers together with officials from the RKKA Mobilization Department considered the Hercules engine to be too difficult to produce, and the engine tended to overheat inside the engine compartment. Tests of TMM-1 and TMM-2 prototypes performed in the beginning of 1932 demonstrated no advantage over the Vickers 6-Ton and the T-26 (the TMM-2's maneuverability was found to be even worse).|$|E
500|$|On 26 January 1931, I. Khalepsky (Head of the Department of Mechanisation and <b>Motorisation</b> of the RKKA) wrote {{a letter}} to S. Ginzburg with {{information}} obtained via the intelligence service that the Polish government had decided to purchase Vickers 6-Ton light infantry tanks as well as Christie M1931 cavalry tanks and to mass-produce them with the assistance of both the British and French. Because Poland was then considered, in Soviet military doctrine, to be the USSR's main enemy, the Soviet Revolutionary Military Council decided to pass the foreign tanks into Red Army service, starting their production immediately without waiting for the completion of development works, in order to counter possible aggression. At that time, the RKKA had only several dozen outdated Mk.V, Mk.A and Renault FT tanks, captured during the Russian Civil War, together with various armoured cars and obsolescent domestic MS-1 (T-18) light infantry tanks. On 13 February 1931, the Vickers 6-Ton light infantry tank, under the designator T-26, officially entered service in the Red Army as the [...] "main tank for close support of combined arms units and tank units of High Command Reserve".|$|E

2500|$|The rushed <b>motorisation</b> of the 1st Blackshirt Division 23rd Marzo, disorganised the {{relationship}} between drivers and infantry, since the division had not been trained as a motorised division. The advance reached Sidi Barrani with modest losses but failed to do much damage to the British. On 21 September, there were sixty-eight Fiat M.11/39 tanks left of the seventy-two sent to Libya. The 1st Medium Tank Battalion had nine serviceable and twenty-three unserviceable tanks and the 2nd Medium Tank Battalion had twenty-eight serviceable and eight unserviceable tanks. Italian medium tank strength was expected to increase when deliveries of the new Fiat M13/40 began. The new tank had a powerful Cannone da 47/32 M35 [...] gun. The II Medium Tank Battalion with thirty-seven M13/40 tanks arrived in Libya in early October, followed by the V Medium Tank Battalion with forty-six M13/40 tanks on 12 December. In mid-November the Italians had four hundred and seventeen medium and light tanks in Libya and Egypt.|$|E

50|$|After {{overcoming}} the post-war difficulties, the OEG {{had to deal}} with incipient mass <b>motorisation.</b> Its goal was to become faster and more convenient in order to hang on to patronage.

5000|$|Some {{time after}} the {{currency}} reform of 1948, increasing <b>motorisation</b> and an improved rail service on the [...] Bebra line led {{to the number of}} passengers quickly falling to about 1000 per day.

50|$|The {{emergence}} of mass <b>motorisation</b> led to increasing {{competition for the}} trams. In addition the increasing car traffic led to increased congestion on the tram routes. In contrast, the tramway network in the early 1950s was still {{the same as it}} was in 1930. The difficult economic situation of the 1930s and material deprivation and destruction during the Second World War did not permit modernisation of vehicles and equipment.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the tram system in 1904, and the <b>motorisation</b> of bus services by 1911, numerous important industries were established. The first of these was the Phoenix Telephone Company in 1911 (later moved to the Hyde). The Handley Page Aircraft Company soon followed, from 1912 until 1917, at 110 Cricklewood Lane and subsequently occupying a large part of Claremont Road. The Cricklewood Aerodrome was adjacent to their factory.|$|E

50|$|The {{line was}} also {{affected}} by the increasing <b>motorisation</b> and a systematic reduction in services by the Bundesbahn and other rationalisation leading to losses of passengers. At {{the beginning of the}} 1980s, after the closures of the Agger Valley Railway between Lohmar and Overath and Dieringhausen and Olpe, the remaining line was at risk of being closed. The railway workshop on the Agger Valley Railway was closed in 1982 and from then on rollingstock was serviced in Cologne.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{seasonally}} fluctuating {{rail transport}} of agricultural produce such as sugar beet or fertiliser also decreased {{because of the}} <b>motorisation</b> of the farmers and the agricultural trade increased significantly in the 1970s. With new, more powerful tractors, for example, sugar beet could be delivered directly to the sugar mill (for the Heinsberg farmers, for example, the sugar mills in Jülich or Ameln). Only a few customers, such as the municipal gas works, a timber yard and the Glanzstoff factory, remained in Oberbruch.|$|E
