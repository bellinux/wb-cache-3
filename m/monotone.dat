5|$|The {{computational}} {{difficulty of}} the clique problem has led it {{to be used to}} prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a clique of a given size is a <b>monotone</b> graph property, meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it will exist in any supergraph. Because this property is <b>monotone,</b> there must exist a <b>monotone</b> circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices. Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial. Additionally, the depth of a <b>monotone</b> circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded fan-in must be at least a polynomial in the clique size.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the things}} that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create a}} better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a <b>monotone</b> voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E

40|$|A {{partitioned}} process theory, {{as defined}} by Coecke, Fritz, and Spekkens, is a symmetric monoidal category together with an all-object-including symmetric monoidal subcategory. We think of the morphisms of this category as processes, and the morphisms of the subcategory as those processes that are freely executable. Via a construction we refer to as parallel-combinable processes with discarding, we obtain from this data a partially ordered monoid {{on the set of}} processes, with f > g if one can use the free processes to construct g from f. The structure of this partial order can then be probed using additive monotones: order-preserving monoid homomorphisms with values in the real numbers under addition. We first characterise these additive <b>monotones</b> in terms of the corresponding partitioned process theory. Given enough <b>monotones,</b> we might {{hope to be able to}} reconstruct the order on the monoid. If so, we say that we have a complete family of <b>monotones.</b> In general, however, when we require our <b>monotones</b> to be additive <b>monotones,</b> such families do not exist or are hard to compute. We show the existence of complete families of additive <b>monotones</b> for various partitioned process theories based on the category of finite sets, in order to shed light on the way such families can be constructed.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{definition}} of concurrence into a family of entanglement <b>monotones,</b> which we call concurrence <b>monotones.</b> We discuss their properties and advantages as computational manageable measures of entanglement, and show that for pure bipartite states all measures of entanglement can be written as functions of the concurrence <b>monotones.</b> We then show that the concurrence <b>monotones</b> provide bounds on quantum information tasks. As an example, we discuss their applications to remote entanglement distributions (RED) such as entanglement swapping and remote preparation of bipartite entangled states (RPBES). We prove a powerful theorem which states what kind of (possibly mixed) bipartite states or distributions of bipartite states can not be remotely prepared. The theorem establishes an upper bound {{on the amount of}} $G$-concurrence (one member in the concurrence family) that can be created between two single-qudit nodes of quantum networks by means of tripartite RED. For pure bipartite states the bound on the $G$-concurrence can always be saturated by RPBES. Comment: 8 page...|$|R
