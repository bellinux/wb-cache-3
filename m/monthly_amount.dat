25|$|In 1937, {{after years}} of living in poverty on the meager sum {{provided}} by Johnson and any money she could acquire through menial jobs, Jack brought Scott to court demanding $1,000 per month to support herself and her son, and a share of whatever interests Scott held in Scotty's Castle and the gold mine Jack still believed he had. The lawsuit failed because Scotty {{did not have any}} legal interests in mining or the castle, and certainly did not have the funds to pay her $1,000 per month. Jack then immediately turned her suit against Johnson himself, accusing him of manipulating her husband and hiding his finances so as to thwart her. Johnson, of course, had no legal obligation to pay Jack any money at all, nor to give her a share in any of his property, so Jack's lawsuit again failed. Johnson took pity on her, however, and raised the <b>monthly</b> <b>amount</b> he gave her to $75.|$|E

The other small incidental moneys, necessary for his use, were likewise all laid out under sanction of his Tutors, and accurately entered in Day-books by them, audited by Friedrich Wilhelm; of which some specimens remain, and one whole month, September, 1719 (the Boy's eighth year), has been published. Very singular to contemplate, in these days of gold-nuggets and irrational man-mountains fattened by mankind at such a price!

40|$|A {{decision}} support system was used to simulate irrigation scheduling for maize, cotton, and peanut for the 2001 to 2004 cropping seasons in southwest Georgia. The results were compared with observed data from the Agricultural Water Pumping (AWP) project. The comparison of the cumulative distribution functions between simulated and observed <b>monthly</b> <b>amounts</b> of irrigation showed significant differences for the three crops. However, almost 50 % of the simulated cotton and peanut <b>monthly</b> <b>amounts</b> of irrigation were adequately correlated with the observed data.
