60|$|The {{working of}} the Senate bears {{little or no}} analogy to that of our House of Lords. In the first place, the Senator's tenure there is not hereditary, nor is it for life. They are elected, and sit for six years. Their {{election}} is not made {{by the people of}} their States, but by the State legislature. The two Houses, for instance, of the State of Massachusetts meet together and elect by their joint vote to the vacant seat for their State. It is so arranged that an entirely new Senate is not elected every sixth year. Instead of this a third of the number is elected every second year. It is a common thing for Senators to be re-elected, and thus to remain in the house for twelve and eighteen years. In our Parliament the House of Commons has greater political strength and wider political action than the House of Lords; but in Congress the Senate counts for more than the House of Representatives in general opinion. Money bills must originate in the House of Representatives, but that is, I think, the only special privilege attaching to the public purse which the Lower House enjoys over the Upper. Amendments to such bills can be moved in the Senate; and all such bills must pass the Senate before they become law. I am inclined to think that individual members of the Senate work harder than individual Representatives. More is expected of them, and any prolonged absence from duty would be more remarked in the Senate than in the other House. In our Parliament this is reversed. The payment made to members of the Senate is 3000 dollars, or 600l., per annum, and to a Representative, 500l. per annum. To this is added certain <b>mileage</b> <b>allowance</b> for traveling backward and forward between their own State and the Capitol. A Senator, therefore, from California or Oregon has not altogether a bad place; but the halcyon days of mileage allowances are, I believe, soon to be brought to an end. It is quite within rule that the Senator of to-day should be the Representative of to-morrow. Mr. Crittenden, who was Senator from Kentucky, is now a member of the Lower House from an electoral district in that State.

40|$|A {{stratified}} {{random sample}} of grain ele-vators supplied grain bid and transportation cost data. These data are {{used to analyze the}} effects of various rail transportation costs on grain elevator handling margins for corn, soybean and wheat. Factors affecting transportation costs such as rail contracts, <b>mileage</b> <b>allowances,</b> and transportation mode are shown to have signif-icant impacts on elevator handling margins and consequently need to be considered in any anal-ysis attempting to explain grain handling margins. The performance of the grain marketing and processing system continually receives at-tention because of the large share of consumer food expenditures that accrue to firms pro-viding services between the "farm-gate " and the final consumer. The retail-farm price spread is a function of several factors including the quantity of food marketed, input costs and consumer demand for quantity, quality, and services. While the size of the retail-farm price spread tells nothing about the performance of the marketing system, it does result in an increased focus on measuring performance across the various marketing functions. Fisher explored the effects of a shift in the supply curve for marketing services on retail and farm prices and concluded that for most agricultural products, the major adjust-ments in marketing changes are made by farm prices. Brorsen et al. examined the impacts of price uncertainty on domestic U. S. wheat margins. Their theoretical and empirical anal-yses suggest that increased price variability significantly increases wheat marketing mar-gins.

40|$|Après un historique et une présentation de {{la nature}} de l’Alliance de la {{fonction}} publique du Canada, l'auteur en présente les structures et relève quelques problèmes internes de ce syndicat. SOME HlSTORYIn order {{to discuss the}} structure of the Public Service Alliance of Canada as it is now and indicate ways in which it is changing to conform to the pressures of collective bargaining in the Federal Public Service — a relatively new development — we must briefly review the history of Public Service Unions as they approached the development of collective bargaining in the Public Service. In the days following the Second World War when Canada was less concerned about inflation and the wage-price spiral, when the economy was booming but not « over-heated », there was an increasing demand by the general public for more and more services by government at all levels. To meet this demand, the federal government service was expanded considerably — from 116, 000 in 1945 to 160, 000 in 1961. Today, it is approximately 183, 000. Meantime, the staff association movement was developing. The Civil Service Federation, which began its career in 1909 with a membership of 5, 223 but had grown to 37, 000 by 1945, increased its membership to 80, 000 by 1958. It had, however, suffered setbacks in the breaking away of the Civil Service Association of Ottawa (later {{to become part of the}} Civil Service Association of Canada) in 1954 and the Canadian Postal Employees Association in 1962. Before the merger of the CSAC and the Federation in 1966, the CSF had a membership, nevertheless, that was nearly double that of all other staff associations combined. It was not only in numbers that the Federation grew. The 1947 Convention appointed a paid full-time National Secretary with a supporting clerical staff. After the passage of the Civil Service Act of 1961, this staff developed further so that, by 1962, there were upwards of thirty paid employees and a full-time President at the Head Office. The CSAC, at the time of its merger with the Amalgamated Civil Servants of Canada in 1958, had 22, 000 members. In the following eight years, this figure had increased to 33, 000. It, too, increased its Head Office staff and, when the Alliance was formed in 1967, this staff amounted to about 20. Politicians eventually began to take notice of this growth in strength of Civil Service Staff Organizations. In response to often voiced complaints, they began to speak of paying salaries comparable to those paid by « the best employers in the private sector ». This was soon watered down to « good employers in the private sector » and eventually to « rates comparable to those paid in the private sector ». The Civil Service Act of 1961 and the consultation process embodied in that Act were considered sufficient to produce the desired results. These measures were, however, quite inadequate. Meantime, the increased pressure occasioned by the development of staff organizations was not without its effects. In 1944, after numerous endorsements by parliamentary committees over a period of twenty-five years, and after a considerable amount of agitation, the government of the day had authorized the establishment of what came to be known as the National Joint Council. On this Council there was equal representation for employer and employee organizations, but the Council fell short of expectations. The Council which has continued into the collective bargaining era, has now assumed some of the functions of a labour-management committee and it is hoped that in the Council, agreement can be reached in matters affecting the whole service such as medical plans, insurance plans, <b>mileage</b> and commuting <b>allowances,</b> etc. Another effect was the creation in 1957 of the Pay Research Bureau, the reports and findings of which were made available to both management and staff organizations. This provided a common base on which consultations could take place. There was, however, constant sniping by representatives of the Treasury Board at the basis on which the statistics were compiled by the Pay Research Bureau, and the Board frequently interpreted the tabulations in PRB reports in a manner that was unacceptable to the staff organizations. Even more important, after consultation and agreement between the Civil Service Commission and the representatives of the employees, the Treasury Board arbitrarily set aside, on a number of occasions, the salary recommendations of the Civil Service Commission and made unilateral decisions that negatived the whole value of the consultation process. Prior to the 1962 federal election, the leaders of all political parties were asked by some of the staff organizations if they and their parties were prepared to endorse a system of collective bargaining for civil servants. Leaders of the Liberal and New Democratic parties answered affirmatively, the others supported the idea but with some reservations. The result was that when the Liberals formed their government they were reminded of their promise and, in 1963, the Preparatory Committee on Collective Bargaining was set up under the Chairmanship of Mr. A. D. P. Heeney, former Ambassador to Washington and former Chairman of the Civil Service Commission. In the deliberations of the Heeney Committee, the staff organizations were consulted. At first they co-ordinated their efforts through the Staff Side Conference but, as the ideas of the Heeney Committee became better known, the Professional Institute and the Federated Association of Letter Carriers (later to become known as the Letter Carriers Union) withdrew their support and decided to « go it alone » since they could see from the Heeney Committee discussions that bargaining would be based on occupational groupings. The Professional Institute believed it could command the allegiance of professional employees and thus capture the professional bargaining units and the Letter Carriers believed their destiny lay with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers to form a Council of bargaining agents in the Post Office. The two remaining members of the Staff Side Conference (the Civil Service Federation and the Civil Service Association) decided that they could only achieve bargaining rights for the majority of groups by merging their two organizations in the Public Service Alliance of Canada. The final step in this merger was taken at the Founding Convention of the Alliance in November, 1966. It was this organization's function to put collective bargaining into effect in 1967 for 115, 000 members. The Public Service Alliance was a creature of compromise. The founding fathers had been traditional rivals for many years. Without the catalyst of collective bargaining, with the need to join forces in order to obtain certification for the various bargaining units, I doubt whether unity would have been achieved for several more years. The Constitution of the newly formed Alliance, born of compromise, inevitably produced problems for our new role. The Federation was composed of affiliates which had full autonomy but had delegated certain rights to handle service-wide problems to the central establishment of the Federation. The Association was a unitary organization with full control vested in a central body. The founders of the Alliance attempted to create an organization that would reflect the best features of both parents. Just as parents can never be sure that their child will only inherit their best qualities, likewise the Alliance suffers from the same natural tendencies. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ALLIANCEThe passage of the Public Service Staff Relations Act of 1967, has meant that Public Service Organizations must deal with the Government in a fashion that differs from the practices of years gone by. There have been some fundamental changes in the feelings and attitudes of our members in the past few years. To some, their participation in a union is a traumatic experience. The word was always one of opprobrium. They even shrank from the term « collective bargaining » and preferred to use the word « negotiation ». On the other hand, we have members who now believe they can challenge management decisions at every level and at every opportunity and expect their organization to be militant on every issue regardless of merit. Luckily the vast majority fit into some grey area in between and will permit us to develop and mature in this new relationship without coming to blows with the employer at each difference of opinion. Section 26 of the Public Service Staff Relations Act of 1967 empowers the Public Service Commission to « specify and define the several occupational groups within each occupational category [...] . in such manner as to comprise therein all employees in the Public Service in respect to whom Her Majesty as represented by the Treasury Board is the employer ». There are six Categories (Executive, Scientific and Professional, Administrative and Foreign Service, Technical, Administrative Support and Operational) and seventy-two groups. As I have pointed out, this arrangement by groups for bargaining purposes operates across departmental lines and, as far as the Public Service Alliance is concerned, has brought about certain administrative and organizational arrangements that were considered necessary for the efficient operation of the bargaining process from the viewpoint of the staff side. First of all, it was obvious that research would have to be channelled along lines calling for detailed study and understanding of the classification standards and the selection standards to be used for the appointment, promotion, transfer and lay-off of public servants. Rates of pay for the seventy-two groups, including those who were formerly regarded as hourly rated and those who were paid « prevailing rates » in the locality of their employment, had to be studied on the basis of the new group classification. The Research Department was also required to give advice to the|$|R

He took a train from New York City, where he learned of the search, to Washington. The official certificate was delivered a day late but Webb's explanation was determined sufficient to excuse him for the tardiness and allow him to collect a $642.75 mileage reimbursement. [...] The reason for Webb's delay did not become publicly known for almost a year-and-a-half. On June 13, 1914, Webb married Claire Noelke of St. Louis, Missouri. The delay had come because Webb had stayed in St. Louis for several days to court his future wife instead of proceeding directly to Washington. Prior to their marriage, she had been a light opera singer.|$|E
40|$|Firms {{commonly}} offer three-part tariffs, or menus of three-part tariffs, in {{a variety}} of con-texts. A three-part tariff consists of a fixed fee, an included allowance of units for which the mar-ginal price is zero, and a positive marginal price for additional usage beyond the allowance. A prime example is the US cellular phone services market in which firms typically offer consumers plans consisting of a fixed monthly fee, an allowance of minutes, and an overage rate for minutes beyond the allowance. Pricing of Internet service is similar in many European countries, where usage is billed per megabyte (Anja Lambrecht and Bernd Skiera 2006). Other examples of three-part tariffs include car leasing contracts, which often include a <b>mileage</b> <b>allowance</b> and charge per mile thereafter. 1 In a variety of rental markets, contracts charge a flat rate for a specified period followed by steep late fees. Finally, introductory credit card offers may also be three-part tariffs. For instance a $ 1, 000 balance might be charged an initial balance transfer fee, zero marginal charge per month for the first six months, and a high marginal charge per month thereafter. The existing literature on nonlinear pricing does not provide a compelling explanation for such pricing patterns. For perfect competition, one expects prices to be driven down to cost, while standard nonlinear pricing models suggest the highest-demand consumer will pay the low-est marginal price. Instead, a tendency of consumers to underestimate the variance of their future demand when choosing a tariff provides a more plausible explanation of observed menus of three-part tariffs. Two important biases lead to this tendency: forecasting overconfidence, which has been well documented in the psychology literature, and projection bias, which is describe...|$|E
