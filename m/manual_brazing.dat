Depending on the application, the filler material can be pre-placed at the desired location or applied during the heating cycle. For <b>manual</b> <b>brazing,</b> wire and rod forms are generally used {{as they are}} the easiest to apply while heating.

50|$|Machine {{torch brazing}} is {{commonly}} used where a repetitive braze operation is being carried out. This method {{is a mix of}} both automated and manual operations with an operator often placing brazes material, flux and jigging parts while the machine mechanism carries out the actual braze. The advantage of this method is that it reduces the high labor and skill requirement of <b>manual</b> <b>brazing.</b> The use of flux is also required for this method as there is no protective atmosphere, and it is best suited to small to medium production volumes.|$|E
50|$|Manual {{torch brazing}} is a {{procedure}} where {{the heat is}} applied using a gas flame placed {{on or near the}} joint being brazed. The torch can either be hand held or held in a fixed position depending on whether the operation is completely manual or has some level of automation. <b>Manual</b> <b>brazing</b> is most commonly used on small production volumes or in applications where the part size or configuration makes other brazing methods impossible. The main drawback is the high labor cost associated with the method as well as the operator skill required to obtain quality brazed joints. The use of flux or self-fluxing material is required to prevent oxidation. Torch brazing of copper can be done without the use of flux if it is brazed with a torch using oxygen and hydrogen gas, rather than oxygen and other flammable gases.|$|E
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to oven brazing a brazing, process has been developed {{which is based on}} local electric heating, such as resistance or induction heating. Joining is executed in an inert gas atmosphere e. g. argon or nitrogen or in a weak reducing atmosphere, e. g. forming gas with a maximum of 10 % hydrogen, thus eliminating the necessity of applying aggressive flux material. Steel, Cr-Ni-steel, hard metal as well as brass alloys, can be brazed flux free. The joint surfaces are activated by means of heat, which causes the oxide layer to crack and spall. It will be demonstrated that different metals require different temperatures for the breaking of the oxide layer to occur and, thus, for wetting of the braze. Inert gas brazing with local heating is currently employed in the industry. <b>Manual</b> and automatic <b>brazing</b> equipment for this procedure is commercially available...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 24 The {{efficiency}} of compressor impellers, {{apart from the}} design, depends on some features linked with their manufacture. These features are the accuracy of geometry, the surface quality obtained, and the blockages which are inevitable with covered impellers and are attributable to the joining method applied, e. g., greater blade thicknesses {{in the case of}} riveting, or narrowed cross sections, due to weld seams, in the case of welding. As a result of the ever increasing importance of efficiency, efforts have been made to further improve the manufacturing process. The advantages and disadvantages of the various forming methods for high-quality impellers, such as milling with a relatively high accuracy, and involving high manufacturing outlay, are discussed. The various casting processes with a variety of possibilities to fulfill the requirements made with regard to the dimensional tolerances, process-dependent blade thicknesses and manual work for achieving certain specified accuracies are described. The {{efficiency of}} impellers with closed passageways, that is, with a cover or shroud disc, is superior to that of impellers with open passageways. This means that when no cast impellers are used, suitable methods must be available for joining the blades and the cover. For maximum accuracy and minimum blockage, the high-vacuum brazing method has become more and more accepted during the past few years. However, the manufacture of impellers applying the brazing method becomes problematic for large diameters. In addition to vacuum <b>brazing,</b> <b>manual</b> and machine welding processes continue to be applied, including slot welding for two-dimensionally curved blades. Diffusion welding and electron-beam welding have not found acceptance since high costs, unfavorable crevices, and sharp edges, along with possible deformations, have a negative influence on the behavior of such impellers during operation. It is true that the sophisticated riveting process of some manufacturers for two-dimensionally curved blades requires great wall thicknesses; but, {{it is also true that}} high-accuracy impellers can be produced by this method. In addition, the vibratory behavior of such impellers is favorable due to system-inherent dampening. Moreover, riveted impellers will tolerate high stresses when the Bauschinger effect is taken into account. The manufacture of highly stressed impellers for turbocompressors is based on the availability of suitable materials and adequate test methods...|$|R
40|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>brazing,</b> {{as it is}} {{used today}} in the {{manufacture}} of automobile bodywork, can be of variable quality and may be responsible for thermal damage to both base material and filler metal. Reworking is often necessary, but the need for this expensive and time-consuming process can be minimised by the automation of the brazing procedure. If Nd:YAG-lasers are used as heat sorce for brazing, the laser energy can be controlled with ease and specific temperature fields can be set up. Fibre-optic laser routing also makes it easy to integrate the technology into manufacturing systems. The goal of this project was the systematic development and optimisation of process controls and associated systems technology for automated flux-free brazing using double-beam laser technology. The system developed in the project was designed to handle modern bodywork materials (DC 04; DC 04 +ZE) and materials for lightweight construction (AlMg 0, 4 Sil, 2; AlMg 5 W 17) as well as aluminium alloys in combination with construction steels. The highest brazing quality was achieved with L-CuZn 40 and L-Ag 55 Sn filler metals. The use of 95 % N_ 2 and 5 % H_ 2 as a protection gas allowed flux-free brazing. If allowances are made for capillary action and gravity, it is possible to produce high quality joints using laser brazing and spacial seam-orientation. It is advantageous to use on-line process controls for the processing of critical contours. In flux-free laser brazing of aluminium alloys, an additional pulsed Nd:YAG-laser is used to modify the surface activity, making the surface more wettable to the filler metal. The different heat dispersal coefficients of aluminium and its oxide coat lead to disruption of this oxide layer and enable the filler metal to wet the surface. Combinations of construction steel and aluminium alloy can be brazed without flux by using the reducing gas and a zinc-based solder which is capable of wetting both materials. (orig.)
