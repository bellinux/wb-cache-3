5|$|The <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> law in Article 9(1) has {{a direct}} bearing on {{the scope of the}} Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E

5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships. Nor is the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> confined to sexually exploited males.|$|E
