5|$|Children {{may have}} {{behaviors}} that are easily <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> epileptic seizures but are not. These include breath-holding spells, bed wetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the {{head to the side}} in infants, which may be <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large {{that they can be}} <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> other species of bird.|$|E

5|$|Guepinia helvelloides has {{a rather}} unusual appearance, {{and is not}} likely to be <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> other fungi. However, the red {{chanterelle}} species Cantharellus cinnabarinus is superficially similar; unlike G.helvelloides, however, it does not have a rubbery and gelatinous texture, and its undersurface is wrinkled, not smooth.|$|E

5|$|It is {{sometimes}} <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> the deadly Inocybe erubescens. The rarer I.erubescens, like I.godeyi, bruises red, {{though it is}} lighter in colour to begin with. The most distinguishing feature is that I.erubescens lacks a bulbous base.|$|E
5|$|S.occidentalis {{may also}} be <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> Microstoma floccosum, which occurs in the same habitat. M.floccosum, however, has taller cups and is covered with stiff white hairs. Another cup-fungus, Scutellinia scutellata, is {{disc-shaped}} without a stem, and is fringed with black hairs around its rim.|$|E
5|$|The burbot, a {{predatory fish}} native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also {{commonly}} <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> bowfin. Burbots {{can be distinguished}} by their flat head and chin barbel, long anal fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.|$|E

5|$|The related black-headed sugar ant (Camponotus nigriceps) has {{a similar}} {{appearance}} and may be <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> a banded sugar ant. Black-headed sugar ants are lighter in colour than banded sugar ants and the orange-brown band is absent from their gaster.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E

5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E
5|$|Harmless watersnakes of {{the genus}} Nerodia are often <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> it. These are also semiaquatic, thick-bodied snakes with large heads that can be {{aggressive}} when provoked, but they behave differently. For example, watersnakes usually flee quickly into the water, while A. piscivorus often stands its ground with its threat display. In addition, watersnakes do not vibrate their tails when excited. A. piscivorus usually holds its head at an angle around 45° when swimming or crawling.|$|E
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E

5|$|In large doses, {{silver and}} {{compounds}} containing {{it can be}} absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues, leading to argyria, which results in a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Argyria is rare, and so far as is known, does not otherwise harm a person's health, though it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of argyria are sometimes <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> cyanosis.|$|E
5|$|Mycena nargan {{has a very}} {{distinct}} appearance, and {{is unlikely}} to be <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> other Mycenas. However, one noted unintentional misidentification occurred when the M.nargan on the cover photograph of Bruce A. Fuhrer's 2005 book A Field Guide to Australian Fungi was labelled as Mycena nivalis, a species with a white cap.|$|E
5|$|News of Stillman's defeat, the Indian Creek massacre, {{and other}} smaller attacks {{triggered}} panic among the white population.

Throughout the region, settlers hurriedly organized militia units and built small forts.|$|E

50|$|Which really {{caused a}} lot of trouble, since Mark, who had <b>mistaken</b> Iris <b>for</b> Laura, had sex with her. The whole {{situation}} was ironed out, even though Laura was very angry with her sister for some time. Eventually, Laura realized that Iris wasn't totally to blame, since Iris had been blinded and couldn't see anything, and Mark had <b>mistaken</b> Iris <b>for</b> Laura. Besides, Iris had kept on Mark to make his marriage to her sister work, which helped make Laura feel more secure. Iris and Spencer married after the whole mess was straightened out, and she had regained her sight.|$|R
