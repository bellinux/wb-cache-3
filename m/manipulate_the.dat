However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from Darrell's negligent care.|$|E

5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} the helm of the {{magazine}} was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can also argue that it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame.

However, new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable, and the {{location}} was discarded. There were accusations that the data was fabricated to <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> political decision. In 1992, parliament made a final vote that started construction of a new airport at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu.|$|E

5|$|Bonded by Blood {{commenced}} {{the recording}} of its first full-length, Feed the Beast, in January 2008 at J Street studios in Sacramento, California with producer Michael Rosen. At first, the recording sessions were going well, but when the band finish off Rosen began to <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> songs in ways that musicians were not enjoying it. The band then decided to re-record the album in the same studio where they recorded the Extinguish the Weak EP. Earache released Feed the Beast on May 9 in the United Kingdom and June 24 in the United States. Bonded by Blood supported the album with the Thrashing Like a Maniac tour. They toured the United States between June and July along with Fueled by Fire and Merciless Death, and in Europe between September and October with Gama Bomb headlining.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the plot}} of the game are two main {{characters}}, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral. The two characters are childhood friends, and while both are born of differing social classes; Ramza a noble and Delita a commoner, both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor, as taught by Ramza's father Balbanes. However, as the story progresses, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life; Delita seeks to <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> upper class to achieve his dreams, while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class.|$|E

5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E

Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, {{and then use}} hands {{to make contact with}} and <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E

5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5|$|Iridion began {{development}} as a shooter for the Game Boy Color; when Shin'en decided to drop development and shift their focus to the Game Boy Advance, Iridion was the first game by the developer {{to appear on the}} system. Though billed as a 3D game, Shin'en used realtime encoding and resizing to <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> size of 2D sprites instead of creating a true 3D environment. More room on the game cartridge was available for graphics due to the game's use of the GAX Sound Engine, which allowed real-time decoding of song data in a small file size.|$|E
5|$|Later in that year, the {{collaboration}} between monarch and premier, {{coupled with the}} fact that Tătărescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the National Peasants' Party (the main democratic opposition group), and the National Liberal Party-Brătianu — the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> votes in elections. (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants' Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the electoral pact.) Tătărescu's own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party.|$|E

They are also all susceptible to the potential rewards the company can offer despite the consequences of their actions, such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws.

5|$|On March 3, 1873, {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed a bill re-enfranchising ex-Confederates, {{to the delight of}} much of the state population and the concern of the Minstrels.

Baxter refused to let the Minstrels <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> election, declaring that free, honest elections would be held during his term. With the help of the newly re-enfranchised voters, conservative Democrats swept the election and gained a small majority in the legislature.
