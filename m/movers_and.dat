[...] In The Sporting News list of the [...] "100 Most Powerful People in Sports", Falk was listed no lower than #32 for 10 straight years from 1991 to 2000, peaking at #14 from 1998 to 1999.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that Loeb had taken advice from a [...] "number of real Wall Street <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> shakers" [...] to ensure [...] "horrifying accuracy" [...] for the film's script. Of the re-writes done to script, Stone said: [...] "We sort of started over {{with the story of}} a young man who is at the center of it, and how he needs Gordon Gekko's help to navigate those waters." [...] In a reference to the GEICO Gecko commercial, which was suggested by New York Governor David Paterson, Gekko says [...] "even a caveman could do it" [...] in the movie. At the request of Mulligan and LaBeouf, the filmmaker cut some dialogue from the character's break-up scenes, which he at first was initially hesitant to do.|$|E
500|$|As Amtrak's F40PH fleet was {{replaced}} by newer GE Genesis-series locomotives, Amtrak converted {{a number of the}} retired units into baggage/cab cars. Colloquially known as [...] "cabbages" [...] (a portmanteau of [...] "cab" [...] and [...] "baggage"), and officially known as Non-Powered Control Units (NPCUs), these units had their prime <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> traction motors removed and a large roll-up door installed in the side (allowing the former engine compartment to be used for baggage). Amtrak converted 22 locomotives into cabbage cars between 1996â€“2007. Each converted unit was renumbered by prefixing [...] "90" [...] to its original number. In 2011, Amtrak F40PH 406 was refurbished for Amtrak's 40th-anniversary exhibit train. It was converted to an NPCU to enable push-pull operation of the exhibit train; in addition a HEP generator was installed to supply auxiliary electricity. Unlike other NPCUs, the 406 retains its original number and resembles an operational F40PH externally.|$|E

500|$|The social {{environment}} {{created by the}} publicity of the Payne Fund Studies and religious protests reached such a fever pitch that {{a member of the}} Hays Office described it as a [...] "state of war".

When discussing the Supreme Court's 1915 decision, film historian Gregory Black argues that the efforts of reformers might have been lessened had [...] "filmmakers been willing to produce films for specialized audiences (adults only, family, no children) â€¦ but the <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> shakers of the industry wanted or needed the largest possible market." [...] The most provocative pictures were the most profitable, with the 25% of the motion picture industry's output that was the most sensational supporting the cleaner 75%.|$|E
500|$|Busby {{organised}} {{a meeting}} at St. Andrew's Hall, {{not far from the}} Queen's Hall. Invitations were sent to present and former members of the Queen's Hall Orchestra. About a hundred players attended. Busby explained the scheme: a new ensemble, the London Symphony Orchestra, to be run on co-operative lines, [...] "something akin to a Musical Republic", with a constitution that gave the organisation independence. At concerts promoted by the LSO the members played without fee, their remuneration coming {{at the end of each}} season in a division of the orchestra's profits. This worked well in good years, but any poorly-patronised series left members out of pocket, and reliant on the LSO's engagements to play for provincial choral societies and other managements. The proposal was approved unanimously, and a management committee was elected, comprising the four original <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> Alfred Hobday (viola) and E F (Fred) James (bassoon). Busby was appointed chief executive, a post variously titled [...] "Secretary", [...] "Managing Director", [...] "General Secretary" [...] and [...] "General Manager" [...] over the years.|$|E
