[...] In The Sporting News list of the [...] "100 Most Powerful People in Sports", Falk was listed no lower than #32 for 10 straight years from 1991 to 2000, peaking at #14 from 1998 to 1999.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that Loeb had taken advice from a [...] "number of real Wall Street <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> shakers" [...] to ensure [...] "horrifying accuracy" [...] for the film's script. Of the re-writes done to script, Stone said: [...] "We sort of started over {{with the story of}} a young man who is at the center of it, and how he needs Gordon Gekko's help to navigate those waters." [...] In a reference to the GEICO Gecko commercial, which was suggested by New York Governor David Paterson, Gekko says [...] "even a caveman could do it" [...] in the movie. At the request of Mulligan and LaBeouf, the filmmaker cut some dialogue from the character's break-up scenes, which he at first was initially hesitant to do.|$|E
500|$|As Amtrak's F40PH fleet was {{replaced}} by newer GE Genesis-series locomotives, Amtrak converted {{a number of the}} retired units into baggage/cab cars. Colloquially known as [...] "cabbages" [...] (a portmanteau of [...] "cab" [...] and [...] "baggage"), and officially known as Non-Powered Control Units (NPCUs), these units had their prime <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> traction motors removed and a large roll-up door installed in the side (allowing the former engine compartment to be used for baggage). Amtrak converted 22 locomotives into cabbage cars between 1996–2007. Each converted unit was renumbered by prefixing [...] "90" [...] to its original number. In 2011, Amtrak F40PH 406 was refurbished for Amtrak's 40th-anniversary exhibit train. It was converted to an NPCU to enable push-pull operation of the exhibit train; in addition a HEP generator was installed to supply auxiliary electricity. Unlike other NPCUs, the 406 retains its original number and resembles an operational F40PH externally.|$|E

500|$|The social {{environment}} {{created by the}} publicity of the Payne Fund Studies and religious protests reached such a fever pitch that {{a member of the}} Hays Office described it as a [...] "state of war". However, newspapers including The Plain Dealer (Cleveland), New Orleans Times Picayune, Chicago Daily News, Atlanta Journal, Saint Paul Dispatch, the Philadelphia Record and Public Ledger, the Boston American and New York's Daily News, Daily Mirror, and Evening Post all lambasted the studies. When discussing the Supreme Court's 1915 decision, film historian Gregory Black argues that the efforts of reformers might have been lessened had [...] "filmmakers been willing to produce films for specialized audiences (adults only, family, no children) … but the <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> shakers of the industry wanted or needed the largest possible market." [...] The most provocative pictures were the most profitable, with the 25% of the motion picture industry's output that was the most sensational supporting the cleaner 75%.|$|E
500|$|Busby {{organised}} {{a meeting}} at St. Andrew's Hall, {{not far from the}} Queen's Hall. Invitations were sent to present and former members of the Queen's Hall Orchestra. About a hundred players attended. Busby explained the scheme: a new ensemble, the London Symphony Orchestra, to be run on co-operative lines, [...] "something akin to a Musical Republic", with a constitution that gave the organisation independence. At concerts promoted by the LSO the members played without fee, their remuneration coming {{at the end of each}} season in a division of the orchestra's profits. This worked well in good years, but any poorly-patronised series left members out of pocket, and reliant on the LSO's engagements to play for provincial choral societies and other managements. The proposal was approved unanimously, and a management committee was elected, comprising the four original <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> Alfred Hobday (viola) and E F (Fred) James (bassoon). Busby was appointed chief executive, a post variously titled [...] "Secretary", [...] "Managing Director", [...] "General Secretary" [...] and [...] "General Manager" [...] over the years.|$|E
