500|$|Daytime {{heating and}} {{nighttime}} cooling of the hilly slopes lead to day to night {{variations in the}} airflow, similar {{to the relationship between}} sea breeze and land breeze. [...] At night, the sides of the hills cool through radiation of the heat. [...] The air along the hills becomes cooler and denser, blowing down into the valley, drawn by gravity. [...] This is known a katabatic wind or <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze.</b> [...] If the slopes are covered with ice and snow, the katabatic wind will blow during the day, carrying the cold dense air into the warmer, barren valleys. [...] The slopes of hills not covered by snow will be warmed during the day. The air that comes in contact with the warmed slopes becomes warmer and less dense and flows uphill. This is known as an anabatic wind or valley breeze.|$|E

60|$|I threw {{myself on}} the couch, and tried to read. But I soon {{exhausted}} my interest in my friend's library, and lay there staring {{through the open door}} on the green hillside beyond. The breeze again sprang up; and a delicious coolness, mixed with the rare incense of the woods, stole through the cabin. The slumbrous droning of bumblebees outside the canvas roof, the faint cawing of rooks on the opposite mountain, and the fatigue of my morning ride, began to droop my eyelids. I pulled the serape over me, as a precaution against the freshening <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze,</b> and in a few moments was asleep.|$|E

60|$|I am an {{historical}} painter by profession, and resided {{for some time}} in the family of a foreign prince, at his villa, about fifteen miles from Rome, among some of the most interesting scenery of Italy. It is situated on the heights of ancient Tusculum. In its neighborhood are the ruins of the villas of Cicero, Sulla, Lucullus, Rufinus, and other illustrious Romans, who sought refuge here occasionally, from their toils, in the bosom of a soft and luxurious repose. From the midst of delightful bowers, refreshed by the pure <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze,</b> the eye looks over a romantic landscape full of poetical and historical associations. The Albanian mountains, Tivoli, once the favorite residence of Horace and Maecenas; the vast deserted Campagna with the Tiber running through it, and St. Peter's dome swelling in the midst, the monument--as it were, over the grave of ancient Rome.|$|E
6000|$|Scott {{went on to}} expatiate on {{the popular}} songs of Scotland. [...] "They {{are a part of}} our {{national}} inheritance," [...] said he, [...] "and something that we may truly call our own. They have no foreign taint; they have the pure breath of the heather and the <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze.</b> All genuine legitimate races that have descended from the ancient Britons; such as the Scotch, the Welsh, and the Irish, have national airs. The English have none, because they are not natives of the soil, or, at least, are mongrels. Their music is all made up of foreign scraps, like a harlequin jacket, or a piece of mosaic. Even in Scotland, we have comparatively few national songs in the eastern part, where we have had most influx of strangers. A real old Scottish song is a cairngorm--a gem of our own mountains; or rather, it is a precious relic of old times, that bears the national character stamped upon it--like a cameo, that shows what the national visage was in former days, before the breed was crossed." ...|$|E
60|$|However, {{either the}} spirit of indignation {{at the sight of}} the unkneeling congregation, or else the {{familiar}} words of the beautiful musical service, made her more than usually devout, and stirred up something within her that could only be appeased by the resolution that the singing in Robert Fulmort's parish should be super-excellent. After the service, the carman persuaded them to drive in the Phoenix Park, where they enjoyed the beautiful broken ground, the picturesque thickets, the grass whose colour reminded them that they were in the Emerald Isle, the purple outlines of the Wicklow hills, whence they thought they detected a fresh <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze.</b> They only wondered to find this delightful place so little frequented. In England, a Sunday would have filled it with holiday strollers, whereas here they only encountered a very few, and those chiefly gentlefolks. The populace preferred sitting on the doorsteps, or lounging against the houses, as if they were making studies of themselves for caricatures; and were evidently so much struck with the young ladies' attire, that the shelter of the hotel was gladly welcomed.|$|E

60|$|As for Tancred, {{his life}} was novel, interesting, and exciting.

50|$|The {{winds are}} {{influenced}} by a system of local winds and the passage of frontal systems of low atmospheric pressure, which are conditioned by the topographical surrounding the valley where the city is. These winds occur mainly {{in the evening and}} early morning; <b>mountain</b> <b>breezes</b> flow in a north-east direction {{and in the course of}} the day valley breezes dominate with a South-West direction. The wind velocity along the day fluctuates between 1.5 m / s and 2.5 m / s.|$|R
60|$|All {{that did}} not tend to {{decrease}} her utter restlessness. It was already past midnight when she noticed that the wind had again abated. The <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze</b> had by this time possessed the stifling valleys and heated bars of the river in its strong, cold embraces; the equilibrium of Nature was restored, and a shadowy mist rose from the hollow. A stillness, more oppressive and intolerable than the previous commotion, began to pervade {{the house and the}} surrounding woods. She could hear the regular breathing of the sleepers; she even fancied she could detect the faint impulses of the more distant life in the settlement. The far-off barking of a dog, a lost shout, the indistinct murmur of some nearer watercourse--mere phantoms of sound--made the silence more irritating. With a sudden resolution she arose, dressed herself quietly and completely, threw a heavy cloak over her head and shoulders, and opened the door between the living-room and her own. Her father was sleeping soundly in his bunk in the corner. She passed noiselessly through the room, opened the lightly fastened door, and stepped out into the night.|$|E
60|$|The site {{selected}} was Reservoir Canyon, a beautiful, triangular valley {{with very}} steep sides, {{one of which}} was crowned by the immense reservoir of the Pioneer Ditch Company. The sheer flanks of the canyon descended in furrowed lines of vines and clinging bushes, like folds of falling skirts, until they broke again into flounces of spangled shrubbery over a broad level carpet of monkshood, mariposas, lupines, poppies, and daisies. Tempered and secluded from the sun's rays by its lofty shadows, the delicious obscurity of the canyon was {{in sharp contrast to the}} fiery mountain trail that in the full glare of the noonday sky made its tortuous way down the hillside, like a stream of lava, to plunge suddenly into the valley and extinguish itself in its coolness as in a lake. The heavy odors of wild honeysuckle, syringa, and ceanothus that hung over it were lightened and freshened by the sharp spicing of pine and bay. The <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze</b> which sometimes shook the serrated tops of the large redwoods above with a chill from the remote snow peaks even in the heart of summer, never reached the little valley.|$|E

50|$|Global {{warming and}} climate change are {{especially}} felt in the area, with summers becoming more tropical- featuring higher humidity with occasional afternoon thunderstorms and warmer nights. Winters are becoming warmer and drier. Due to these climatic changes, tropical plants such as mango, avocado, lychee, and plumeria are becoming a more common sight in the area, giving the town an exotic and lush feel. At night, the town often smells of these new tropical flowers and jasmine, as well as eucalyptus, as light <b>mountain</b> <b>breezes</b> blow the smells through the town.|$|R
60|$|By and by Arthur {{came home}} in the highest spirits, tossing Annie in the air, as he met her in the passage, and declaring himself so far from tired {{that he had not}} felt so well for a year, and that the <b>mountain</b> <b>breezes</b> had taken the weight off his chest for good and all.

50|$|The layout {{was also}} {{determined}} by air circulation.

60|$|But Maria, {{with the}} little Maltese dog in her arms, to guard him from a hailstorm of the pebbles, was inexorably bent on {{following}} her sisters; and Bertha had hurried nervously across from the strangers, so that Lieschen must pursue those light steps through the winding staircase streets, sometimes consisting of broad shallow steps, sometimes of actual flights of steep stairs hewn out in the rock, leading to a length of level terrace, where, through garden gates, orange trees looked out, dividing the vantage ground with houses and rocks--up farther, past the almost desolate old church of St. Paul--farther again--till, beyond all the houses, they came forth on the open mountainside, with a crest of rock far above, surmounted by {{the ruins of a}} castle, said to have been fortified by the Saracens, and taken from them by Charles Martel. It was to this castle that Phoebe's sketching duty was to be paid, and Maria and Bertha expressed their determination of climbing up to it, in hopes, as the latter said, of finding Charles Martel's original hammer. Lieschen, puffing and panting already, looked horrified, and laughingly they bade her sit down and knit, whilst they set out on their adventure. Phoebe smiled as she looked up, and uttered a prognostic that made Bertha the more defiant, exhilarated as she was by the delicious compound of sea and <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze,</b> and by the exquisite view, the roofs of the town sloping rapidly down, and the hills stretching round, clothed in pine woods, into which the gray olivettes came stealing up, while beyond lay the sea, intensely blue, and bearing on its bosom the three Isles d'Or flushed with radiant colour.|$|E
6000|$|For {{an hour or}} so I {{followed}} the valley in its many windings, but, failing to see any dwelling-place, I ascended a hill to get a view of the surrounding country. The prospect which disclosed itself when I had got a couple of hundred feet above the surrounding level, appeared unfamiliar. The hills among which I had been wandering were now behind me; before me spread a wide rolling country, beyond which rose a mountain range resembling in the distance blue banked-up clouds with summits and peaks of pearly whiteness. Looking on this scene I could hardly refrain from shouting with joy, so glad did the sunlit expanse of earth, and the pure exhilarating <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze,</b> make me feel. The season was late summer--that was plain to see; the ground was moist, as if from recent showers, and the earth everywhere had that intense living greenness with which it reclothes itself when the greater heats are over; but the foliage of the woods was already beginning to be touched here and there with the yellow and russet hues of decay. A more tranquil and soul-satisfying scene could not be imagined: the dear old mother earth was looking her very best; while the shifting golden sunlight, the mysterious haze in the distance, and the glint of a wide stream not very far off, seemed to spiritualize her [...] "happy autumn fields," [...] and bring them into a closer kinship with the blue over-arching sky. There was one large house or mansion in sight, but no town, nor even a hamlet, and not one solitary spire. In vain I scanned the horizon, waiting impatiently to see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine. This troubled me not a little, for I had no idea that I had drifted so far from civilization in my search for specimens, or whatever it was that brought me to this pretty, primitive wilderness. Not quite a wilderness, however, for there, within a short hour's walk of the hill, stood the one great stone mansion, close to the river I had mentioned. There were also horses and cows in sight, and a number of scattered sheep were grazing on the hillside beneath me.|$|E
6000|$|Lo! I {{must tell}} {{a tale of}} chivalry; For large white plumes are dancing in mine eye. Not like the formal crest of latter days: But bending in a {{thousand}} graceful ways; So graceful, that it seems no mortal hand, Or e'en the touch of Archimago's wand, Could charm them into such an attitude. We must think rather, that in playful mood, Some <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze</b> had turned its chief delight, To show this wonder of its gentle might. Lo! I must tell a tale of chivalry; For while I muse, the lance points slantingly Athwart the morning air: some lady sweet, Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet, From the worn top of some old battlement Hails it with tears, her stout defender sent: And from her own pure self no joy dissembling, Wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling. Sometimes, when the good Knight his rest would take, It is reflected, clearly, in a lake, With the young ashen boughs, 'gainst which it rests, And th' half seen mossiness of linnets' nests. Ah! shall I ever tell its cruelty, When the fire flashes from a warrior's eye, And his tremendous hand is grasping it, And his dark brow for very wrath is knit? Or when his spirit, with more calm intent, Leaps to the honors of a tournament, And makes the gazers round about the ring Stare at {{the grandeur of the}} balancing? No, no! this is far off:--then how shall I Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy, Which linger yet about lone gothic arches, In dark green ivy, and among wild larches? How sing the splendour of the revelries, When buts of wine are drunk off to the lees? And that bright lance, against the fretted wall, Beneath the shade of stately banneral, Is slung with shining cuirass, sword, and shield? Where ye may see a spur in bloody field. Light-footed damsels move with gentle paces Round the wide hall, and show their happy faces; Or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens: Like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens. Yet must I tell a tale of chivalry: Or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by? Wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight, Rein in the swelling of his ample might? ...|$|E
60|$|In truth, {{though her}} life had been mournful and oppressed, {{it had not been}} such as to age her early.

60|$|The colour was {{heightened}} by warm rooms, for Arthur {{was of a}} chilly race, and could not understand how oppressive the close atmosphere of London was to one used to <b>mountain</b> <b>breezes.</b> He would come in shivering, and be provoked to find her sitting by the smallest of fires; till she learnt that their estimate of heat was so different, that the only safety was in keeping the room like an oven. The folding doors into the back drawing-room had a trick of opening of their own accord; and the trouble given her by this draught-trap, as Arthur called it, can hardly be estimated, especially one windy week in March, {{when he had a}} cold.|$|R
5000|$|These {{winds are}} {{opposite}} from each other. While valley breezes {{occur when the}} warm air rises up the sides, warm air in a <b>mountain</b> <b>breeze</b> will rise up the middle.|$|E

50|$|The heavy old fat-tire bike frames, made of mild steel, {{were not}} {{standing}} up to the rigors of <b>mountain</b> biking. <b>Breeze</b> was asked by Charlie Kelly to build a mountain bike frame and in early 1977 Breeze agreed to do so.While working on the design for the <b>mountain</b> bike, <b>Breeze</b> took orders to make mountain bikes for several other Marin County off-road cycling enthusiasts. He completed the prototype (Breezer #1) in Fall 1977 and rode it to victory at Repack.Breeze finished nine more Breezer mountain bikes by June 1978.

50|$|<b>Mountain</b> and valley <b>breezes</b> form {{through a}} process similar to sea and land breezes. During the day, the sun heats up {{mountain}} air rapidly while valley remains relatively cooler. Convection causes it to rise, causing a valley breeze. At night, the process is reversed. During the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the <b>mountain</b> wind. These <b>breezes</b> occur mostly during calm and clear weather.|$|R
50|$|Vail has warm {{summers and}} cold winters {{because of its}} elevation. Depending on the {{classification}} used, it is either an alpine or subarctic climate transitional with humid continental due to the mild daytime temperatures in September bringing the daily mean to around 50 F. Minimum temperatures rarely rise above freezing point from late September to late May. The town receives an average of 200 inches of snowfall per season, with even more in the surrounding mountains. Roads may close occasionally during heavy snowfall. Summer temperatures can reach the 80s, but are more often {{in the mid to}} high 70s. Combined with <b>mountain</b> <b>breezes,</b> this makes summers refreshing and cool. For being a borderline subarctic climate daytime temperatures are very mild, indicating high diurnal temperature variation due to the altitude.|$|R
