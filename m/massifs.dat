5|$|The valley {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis that points {{toward the center}} of Mare Serenitatis. Large <b>massifs</b> are located {{on either side of the}} valley, called the North and South <b>massifs,</b> respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these <b>massifs</b> give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a scarp cuts across the valley floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South <b>massifs</b> funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E
5|$|The Highlands and Islands lie to {{the north}} and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Arran to Stonehaven. This part of Scotland largely {{comprises}} ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian, which were uplifted during the later Caledonian Orogeny. It is interspersed with igneous intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain <b>massifs</b> such as the Cairngorms and Skye Cuillins.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} on Apollo 17 {{show that the}} valley is composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia in the large <b>massifs</b> surrounding the valley and basalt underlying the valley floor, covered by an unconsolidated layer of regolith, or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events. Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E

5|$|Andreacarus voalavo {{was named}} in 2007 by Ashley Dowling, Andre Bochkov, and Barry OConnor {{on the basis}} of 15specimens found on an {{individual}} of the rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus that was collected in 1994 in the Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve in northern Madagascar. The specific name, voalavo, is taken from the generic name of the type host. Voalavo gymnocaudus, the only known host, is only found in the Anjanaharibe-Sud and Marojejy <b>massifs</b> of the Malagasy Northern Highlands. A.voalavo is closely related to Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, found on other Malagasy rodents. They are members of the genus Andreacarus, which currently includes 11 species found on rodents and other small mammals in Madagascar and mainland Africa.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} <b>massifs</b> {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|The Langenberg Quarry, where K. langenbergensis {{is known}} from, {{is part of}} the Lower Saxony Basin, which would {{have been part of the}} landmass {{associated}} with the Rhenisch, Bohemian, and London-Brabant <b>Massifs.</b> During the Kimmeridgian, it would have been a shallow marine environment; however, this does not imply that K. langenbergensis was marine, since the animals and plants of the Langenberg Quarry were probably transported allochthonously (albeit only by a short distance) from the surrounding islands. Brackish and freshwater sediments are also present in the quarry, which implies that there was occasional freshwater influx. Twigs and conifer cones indicate that the araucarian Brachyphyllum was present at the site.|$|E

50|$|Craddock <b>Massif</b> {{is located}} at the southeastern side of Vinson <b>Massif,</b> between Hammer Col and Karnare Col linking it to Vinson <b>Massif</b> and the {{southern}} Sentinel Range respectively. The highest point of Craddock <b>Massif</b> is Mount Rutford, a sharp peak that rises to 4477 m. The Craddock <b>Massif</b> also includes (from north to south) Bugueño Pinnacle, Rada Peak and Mount Craddock.|$|R
5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} {{has much to do}} with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, and because of the close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates <b>massifs</b> of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E
5|$|The Highlands and Islands lie to {{the north}} and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Arran to Stonehaven. This part of Scotland largely {{comprises}} ancient rocks, from Cambrian and Precambrian times, that were uplifted to form a mountain chain during the later Caledonian orogeny. These foundations are interspersed with many igneous intrusions of more recent age, the remnants of which have formed mountain <b>massifs</b> such as the Cairngorms and Skye Cuillins. A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of the Old Red Sandstone found principally along the Moray Firth coast and in the Orkney islands. These rocks are around 400 million years old, and were laid down in the Devonian period. The Highlands are generally mountainous and are bisected by the Great Glen Fault. The highest elevations in the British Isles are found here, including Ben Nevis, the highest peak at 1,344 metres (4,409ft). Scotland has over 790 islands, divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Hebrides, further sub-divided into the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{subsequently}} became {{heavily involved}} in fighting throughout the front it occupied, especially 3rd Parachute Battalion, which launched several attacks on a geographical feature known as 'Green Hill'; during multiple attacks, several companies from the battalion were able to gain {{the crest of the}} hill, only to be driven back by enemy counterattacks. On the night of 78 January the brigade was relieved from the frontline and transported to Algiers, with the exception of 2nd Parachute Battalion, which remained under the command of 78th Infantry Division {{because of a lack of}} troops to replace it. Plans were made to use the brigade in conjunction with US II Corps to cut Axis lines of communications around Sfax and Gabes, but these were never finalised. On 24 January it was transferred back to V Corps and came under the command of 6th Armoured Division, but did not remain there for long; two days later it came under the command of XIX French Corps, located in area around Bou Araba. There it was given command of several French units and stationed between 36th Infantry Brigade and 1st Guards Brigade. On 2 February 1 Parachute Battalion was ordered to mount an attack on the <b>massifs</b> of Djebel Mansour and Djebel Alliliga, supported by a company belonging to the French Foreign Legion. The battalion launched its attack during the night and by the next morning had captured both features against fierce opposition; however, heavy casualties meant that the battalion was forced to retreat from Djebel Alligila and concentrate on Djebel Mansour. There they were cut off from supplies and almost all reinforcements, and counterattacks by 6th Armoured Division failed to reach the battalion. A battalion from the Grenadier Guards was able to capture most of Djebel Alliliga on 4 February, but both battalions came under increasingly heavy attack, and by 11:00 the next day it was decided to withdraw both battalions.|$|E
