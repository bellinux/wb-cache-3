5|$|The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) <b>medical</b> <b>examiners</b> {{identified}} most of {{the bodies}} within 10 weeks of the accident. Due to extreme impact forces only one body was identifiable by sight. For approximately 100 bodies, the examiners used DNA; the DNA analysis {{has been referred to}} as the largest DNA identification project in Canadian history. About 90 bodies were identified by Canadian <b>medical</b> <b>examiners</b> using dental records. For around 30 bodies, examiners used fingerprints and ante mortem (before death) X-rays. The large number of ante mortem dental X-rays meant that around 90 bodies had been identified by the end of October. The RCMP contacted relatives of victims to ask for medical histories and dental records. Blood samples from relatives were used in the DNA identification of victims.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{received}} the final {{part of his}} father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany.

After he was deemed by the <b>medical</b> <b>examiners</b> as unfit for service, he returned to Munich. Hitler later claimed {{that he did not}} wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, <b>medical</b> <b>examiners</b> found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

5|$|The professionalization of {{the field}} began soon after, during the 1950s and 1960s. This move coincided with the {{replacement}} of coroners with <b>medical</b> <b>examiners</b> in many locations around the country. It was during this time that the field of forensic anthropology gained recognition as a separate field within the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the first forensic anthropology research facility and body farm was opened by William M. Bass. Public attention and interest in forensic anthropology began to increase around this time as forensic anthropologists started working on more high-profile cases. One of the major cases of the era involved anthropologist Charles Merbs who helped identify the victims murdered by Ed Gein.|$|E

The remains of two hijackers, potentially from Flight11, were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at this park.|$|E
5|$|As Paul, Christine and Michael {{continue}} to hit dead ends on solving Carmine's murder, Fen announces {{he wants to}} confess to a judge and be sentenced prison time; Christine and Lauren however are strongly against it.
