40|$|Purpose: {{the purpose}} of this paper is to {{establish}} <b>manufactured</b> <b>construction</b> as a good potential alternative to meet the growing housing needs of China. Design/methodology/approach: the paper uses literature review and case study as research methodologies. Literature review is used to identify the need for housing and establish the manufacturing prowess of China. The case study is used to look at how a similar problem has been tackled in the UK and then the case study findings are used to identify future direction for China. Findings – Findings suggest that there is an acute shortage of housing in China, and at the same time the manufacturing sector in China is very strong. Therefore, in order to meet the housing demand for the population, <b>manufactured</b> <b>construction</b> offers a very attractive and cost-efficient alternative. Practical implications – <b>Manufactured</b> <b>construction</b> is an attractive alternative for China and therefore the government needs to encourage this sector through subsidies and tax benefits. Given that currently China is regarded as a manufacturing powerhouse, it will be relatively easy to establish <b>manufactured</b> <b>construction</b> as an organised and supported sector by the government. Originality/value – The paper presents <b>manufactured</b> <b>construction</b> as an attractive alternative and strategic direction that China should adopt to meet the growing housing needs of the citizens. This also would appear to be an obvious alternative, given the manufacturing capabilities of China. Keywords Construction industry, Housing, Construction operations, Chin...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to gather a preliminary understanding of growing families' needs and evaluate how modular off-site <b>manufactured</b> <b>construction</b> could effectively answer those needs. Despite the large amount of research that has gone into off-site manufactured buildings, there is little research that has explored its suitability as a flexible housing typology for growing families. The pilot presented in this paper investigates the specific context of Brisbane, Australia; qualitative data have been gathered from growing families in this city and combined with established theory on flexible building to develop a preliminary understanding of how modular off-site <b>manufactured</b> <b>construction</b> could perform in meeting flexibility requirements in comparison to a traditional lightweight timber framed construction. Findings highlight how the ability to modify a dwelling is a fundamental feature for growing families; a number of other advantages in flexibility were found in modular off-site manufacture and recommendations made to improve this construction typology...|$|R

50|$|Since its {{inception}} in the early 1980s, the manufacturer of the surfaces selected for most championship meets has been by the Italian company, Mondo, again the trademarked brand name becoming misused as a genericized trademark. Mondo's track surface is called Mondotrack. The surface differs from the particles stuck in adhesion techniques, {{in that they are}} more of a rubber carpet, cut to size then tightly seamed together (in the linear direction along the lane lines). This form of construction gives a more consistent bounce (or energy return) and traction. Because of the tight fit specifications required for <b>manufacture,</b> <b>construction</b> surrounding these sites also has to be of a higher standard, making a Mondostrack {{one of the most expensive}} systems to use. Examples of Mondotracks were used for the 1996 Summer Olympics (since removed from the Centennial Olympic Stadium) in Atlanta, Georgia, United States; 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece; 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China; 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.|$|E

50|$|It {{was less}} amusing one Sunday morning in July 1883 when an R&P coal train broke in two on a grade of 57 ft per mile at Rasselas, twenty-five {{miles south of}} Bradford. A not {{altogether}} atypical occurrence {{in the days before}} reliable couplers, this resulted in seven loaded coal cars and a single passenger car with fifteen to twenty people aboard accelerating back down the grade out of control. The investigation that followed alleged that the conductor and brakeman were both asleep. Neither survived. The runaway string of cars smashed into a train proceeding in the same direction. The engineer of this train saw the cars coming and, with his fireman, leapt off the locomotive after reversing it, surviving with serious bruising. Since the passenger car was the last on the first train, it hit the locomotive at full speed and was split in half. The destroyed passenger car was immediately struck by the coal cars; seven people died, and eight were injured.Even well-run railroads have accidents, and the BR&P had its share. In the final analysis, all accidents result from someone's failure, whether in design, <b>manufacture,</b> <b>construction,</b> operation, or maintenance. The company set its standards higher than most did, but the risks of railroading still took a painful toll.|$|E
