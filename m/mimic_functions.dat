40|$|Poznań, 2006 Supervised {{learning}} in Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is considered in this dis-sertation. Spiking networks represent a special class of artificial neural networks, in which neuron models communicate by sending spikes (action potentials). SNN are investigated {{here in the}} context of their potential applications to movement control in neuroprostheses, i. e. in the systems that aim to substitute or restore locomotory functions in human subjects with the movement disorders. From the control point of view, human limb is a multidimensional, nonli-near, nonstationary object, characterized by the rich embedded dynamics. This is the reason for the low effectiveness of the traditional control approaches in neuroprosthesis. One of the new concepts to solve this problem is to <b>mimic</b> <b>functions</b> of the Central Nervous System by the SNN-based controllers.

40|$|Binary {{obfuscation}} {{plays an}} essential role in evading malware static analysis and detection. The widely used code obfuscation techniques, such as polymorphism and metamorphism, focus on evading syntax based detection. However, statistic test and semantic analysis techniques have been developed to thwart their evasion attempts. More recent binary obfuscation techniques are divided in their purposes of attacking either statistical or semantic approach, but not both. In this paper, we introduce mimimorphism, a novel binary obfuscation technique with the potential of evading both statistical and semantic detections. Mimimorphic malware uses instruction-syntax-aware high-order <b>mimic</b> <b>functions</b> to transform its binary into mimicry executables that exhibit high similarity to benign programs in terms of statistical properties and semantic characteristics. We implement a prototype of the mimimorphic engine on the Intel x 86 platform, and evaluate its capability of evading statistical anomaly detection and semantic analysis detection techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that the mimicry executables are indistinguishable from benign programs in terms of byte frequency distribution and entropy, as well as control flow fingerprint...|$|E
40|$|Rationale Acute alcohol {{intoxication}} selectively impairs executive {{functioning and}} prospective memory (PM). Much previous researches {{in this area}} have used laboratory-based tasks that may not <b>mimic</b> <b>functions</b> that individuals with dysexecutive syndrome have problems with in their everyday life. The present study aimed to assess {{the effects of a}} modest dose of alcohol on executive functioning and PM using a virtual reality task and investigate the role of executive planning in PM performance. Methods Forty healthy participants were administered 0. 4 [*]g/kg alcohol or matched placebo in a double-blind design. Executive function and PM were assessed using the Jansari–Agnew–Akesson–Murphy (JAAM) task, requiring participants {{to play the role of}} an office worker. Results Alcohol intoxication selectively impaired executive function and PM. The participants in the alcohol condition performed worse on the planning, prioritisation, creativity and adaptability executive subscales and also on the time-based and event-based PM tasks. However, alcohol did not impair the selection executive function task or the action-based PM task. Conclusions The results provide further support for the effects of alcohol on executive functioning and PM. In addition, the results suggest that such deficits may be present at relatively modest doses of alcohol and in the absence of a subjective feeling of intoxication Keywords: alcohol; executive functioning; prospective memory; virtual reality; memor...|$|E
40|$|Associate Editor K. A. Athanasiou {{oversaw the}} review of this article. Abstract—Poor {{vascular}} homeostasis drives many clinical disorders including diabetes, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and peripheral artery disease. Local tissue ischemia resultant of insufficient blood flow is a potent stimulus for recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). This mobilization and homing is a multi-step process involving EPC detachment from their steady state bone marrow niches, entry into circulation, rolling along vessel endothelium, transmigration, and adhesion to denuded extracellular matrix (ECM) where they may participate in neovessel formation. However, these events are often interrupted in pathological conditions partly due to an imbalance in factor presentation at the tissue level. EPC number and function is impaired in patients with vascular diseases and this dysfunction has been proposed as a prominent contributor to disease pathogenesis. Research approaches aimed at providing therapeutic angiogenesis commonly involve the delivery of proangiogenic cells and/ or soluble factors. Nevertheless, {{greater understanding of the}} mechanisms involved in EPC homing in both healthy and diseased states is critical for improving efficacy of such strategies. This review underscores the matrix-related signals necessary for enhancing EPC recruitment to ischemic tissue and provides an overview of the development of synthetic ECMs that aim to <b>mimic</b> <b>functions</b> of the local native microenvironment for use in therapeutic angiogenesis...|$|E
