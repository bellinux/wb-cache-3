25|$|Cardin {{was elected}} to succeed Paul Sarbanes in the 2006 U.S. Senate election, {{defeating}} Republican <b>Michael</b> <b>Steele,</b> the Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, {{by a margin of}} 54% to 44%.

When Lieutenant Governor <b>Michael</b> <b>Steele</b> opted to run for Senate instead of seeking a second term on Ehrlich’s gubernatorial ticket, Ehrlich named Maryland Secretary of Disabilities Kristen Cox, who was blind, {{as his running mate}} and was renominated by his party for a second term.|$|E
25|$|Coleman was {{considered}} a front-runner for the Republican National Committee's Chairmanship. Coleman {{said that he would}} not run against <b>Michael</b> <b>Steele</b> should Steele seek re-election to that position; when Steele announced his candidacy for re-election, in December 2010, Coleman stated that he would not run for the chairmanship. In April 2011, Coleman joined Hogan Lovells, an international legal practice, as senior government advisor in their Washington D.C. office.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2008 elections, the Republican Party, {{reeling from}} the loss of the presidency, Congress and key state governorships, was {{fractured}} and leaderless. <b>Michael</b> <b>Steele</b> became the first black chairman of the Republican National Committee, but was a poor fundraiser and was replaced after numerous gaffes and missteps. Republicans suffered an additional loss in the Senate in April 2009, when Arlen Specter switched to the Democratic Party, depriving the GOP of a critical 41st vote to block legislation in the Senate. The seating of Al Franken several months later effectively handed the Democrats a filibuster-proof majority, but it was short-lived as the GOP took back its 41st vote when Scott Brown won a special election in Massachusetts in early 2010.|$|E

500|$|As of 2015, Maryland {{has yet to}} {{have been}} served by a female Governor. [...] However, women were the runners-up in four gubernatorial {{elections}} (in 1974, 1994, 1998, and 2002). In addition, one woman {{has served as the}} Lieutenant Governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, under Gov. Parris Glendening from 1995 to 2003. Another woman, Kristen Cox, who was the Secretary of Disabilities, unsuccessfully ran for Lieutenant Governor as the running mate of the incumbent Governor Robert Ehrlich, when the Lieutenant Governor at that time, <b>Michael</b> <b>Steele,</b> left office to run for the U.S. Senate. Cox was a unique person to run for that office, not only because she is a woman, but also because she is legally blind.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} announcement, Specter {{also said that}} he had [...] "surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, {{observed}} other public opinion polls and have found that the prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak". A March 2009 Quinnipiac poll indicated that Specter trailed his likely primary challenger, Pat Toomey, by 14% (41% for Toomey, 27% for Specter). Additional polling found that 70% of Pennsylvania Republicans disapproved of his vote in favor of the Stimulus Bill and that 52 percent of Pennsylvania Republicans disapproved of the job he was doing. Following Specter's switching parties, Republican National Committee chairman <b>Michael</b> <b>Steele</b> criticized his leaving the Republican Party, claiming that Specter had [...] "flipped the bird" [...] at the GOP.|$|E
500|$|Strategists {{from both}} parties viewed {{the outcome of the}} race as a [...] "referendum on President Obama's {{handling}} of the economy". Chairman <b>Michael</b> <b>Steele</b> of the Republican National Committee said the special election was the first of three elections that were [...] "incredibly important" [...] for the Republicans to win. The Republican leadership made this race a top priority, and Chairman Steele, former Governor George Pataki, House Minority Leader John Boehner, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich helped Tedisco with fundraising. Steele visited the district twice. On the Democratic side, Senator Gillibrand appeared in commercials and robocalls for Murphy, and Senator Chuck Schumer helped Murphy's campaign with fundraising. Less than a week before the election, President Obama formally endorsed Murphy in a mass email to supporters and urged supporters to organize and vote for Murphy. A radio ad Vice President Joe Biden recorded for Murphy was released on March 25. That same day, Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tim Kaine emailed 500 of the party's top donors asking them to contribute to Murphy's campaign.|$|E

25|$|While {{chairman}} in 2006, staffers {{of the committee}} obtained a copy of Maryland's 2006 Republican senate candidate <b>Michael</b> <b>Steele's</b> credit report. A staff researcher used Steele's social security number to obtain his credit report from TransUnion. The report was paid for with the DSCC credit card issued to the researcher's supervisor. After an internal investigation, the Maryland Democratic Party determined the credit report was obtained illegally and reported the incident to the U.S. Attorney. The staffer resigned and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of computer fraud {{and was sentenced to}} 150 hours of community service. The supervisor resigned from the DSCC.|$|R
500|$|Prior to {{switching}} parties, Specter {{was promised}} by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid {{that he would}} keep his seniority on the Senate if he joined the Democratic Party. The arrangement displeased some Senate Democrats, and, on May 3, the Senate voted to strip him of his seniority despite Reid's promise. This temporarily made Specter the most junior Democrat in the Senate and severely limited his influence as a legislator. Nevertheless, Specter's decision was praised by many major Democrats, including Reid and President Barack Obama, who promised to campaign for him. Republicans, however, criticized the decision, accusing Specter of betraying his principles and party to preserve his political career. <b>Michael</b> <b>Steele,</b> chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Specter [...] "flipped the bird" [...] to the party and that Specter made the decision based solely because {{he knew he would}} lose the election. Senator John Cornyn, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a past supporter of Specter, said the decision [...] "represents the height of political self-preservation". Specter defended his position by arguing the Republican Party had strayed too far from the vision of President Ronald Reagan, adding, [...] "I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate." ...|$|E
