50|$|Nephi Ephraim Miller (born November 24, 1873 in Providence, Cache Valley, Utah) was {{a pioneer}} in the modern {{practice}} of <b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping.</b> Miller gained an interest in bees as a child, while living on his father's farm. Miller was to inherit his father's farm and become a farmer, but his interest in bees grew. Miller traded a few bags of oats, left over from the harvest in exchange for seven bee colonies. As the colonies grew and blossomed into a burgeoning business, Miller quit his job on a wheat-threshing crew and devoted all his time to beekeeping. As the number of his colonies grew, so did the by-products such as beeswax. At the time many industries were learning the value of by-products that previously had been considered waste and were discarded. Miller wanted to learn how to effectively clean the wax and traveled to California where he met M. H. Mendelson, an experienced beekeeper who showed him how to render the beeswax into smooth cakes.|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping</b> {{is based on}} moving honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies between different locations to intensify agricultural production through improved pollination services. However, due to stress caused by exposure of bee hives to different environments, <b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping</b> activities can lead colonies to greater susceptibility of these insects to pathogens and pests, thus leading to population decline and mortality. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the health profile of apiaries that adopt two types of management (stationary and migratory), located in the central-eastern region of São Paulo state, Brazil, during two sampling periods, one in spring (October 2010), and one in autumn (May 2011). We collected 474 samples of honeycomb from the brood area, combs containing capped brood, adult bees that covered the brood area, and foraging bees, to evaluate the presence and prevalence of Paenibacillus larvae, Varroa destructor, Nosema apis and N. ceranae. Seasonality was identified as a determining factor in the health condition of Africanized A. mellifera colonies, causing a stronger effect on health than the type of management employed (stationary vs <b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping).</b> The infection rates of N. ceranae were higher during the autumn in relation to the spring (387 ± 554 spores per bee in the spring and 1, 167 ± 1, 202 spores per bee in the autumn in stationary apiaries and 361 ± 687 spores per bee in the spring and 1, 082 ± 1, 277 spores per bee in the autumn in migratory apiaries). The same pattern was found for infestation rates of V. destructor (2. 83 ± 1. 97 in the spring and 9. 48 ± 6. 15 in the autumn in stationary apiaries and 3. 25 ± 2. 32 in the spring and 6. 34 ± 6. 58 in the autumn in migratory apiaries).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{increased}} annual {{losses in}} European honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America {{and some other}} countries is usually attributed {{to a range of}} factors including pathogens, poor nutrition and insecticides. In this essay I will argue that the global trade in honeybees and <b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping</b> practices within countries has enabled pathogens to spread quickly. Beekeepers’ management strategies have also contributed to the spread of pathogens as well as the development of resistance to miticides and antibiotics, and exacerbated by hobby beekeepers. The opportunities for arresting honeybee declines rest as strongly with individual beekeepers as they do with the dynamics of disease...|$|E

40|$|When {{beekeeping}} {{is managed}} on a migratory basis, the bee colony produces physical outputs (honey) and pollination services on {{a sequence of}} forage sites. Forage sites are competitors if their flowering periods overlap, and are complementary otherwise. Viable sequences consist only of complementary forage sites. A part of the bee colony’s production time is spent on each forage site in the period when the crop or wild vegetation covering it is in flower. The total period covered by the sequence of sites, including the base site, must be equal to or less than the duration (365 days) of the bee colony’s annual biological cycle. The migratory beekeeper draws up viable sequences of forage sites and calculates their profitability levels. Variations in the profitability of forage sites which alter {{the composition of the}} sequence, affecting provision of the non-marketed ecosystem pollination services, impact the biodiversity of the pollinated plants with trickle-down effects on sustainability.

We also found that several risk factors—including the incidence of a poor brood pattern, chalkbood (CB), deformed wing virus (DWV), sacbrood virus (SBV), and exceeding the threshold of 5 Varroa mites per 100 bees—were differentially expressed in different beekeeping operations. Further, we found that a diagnosis of several factors were significantly more or less likely to be associated with a simultaneous diagnosis of another risk factor.

40|$|Abstract: Apis mellifera shows {{geographic}} {{variation in}} morphology and in genetic characteristics. Allozyme polymoprhisms and mitochondrial DNA variation are particularly useful tools {{for the study}} of genetic and geographic variation in honey bees. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation reveals four lineages of bees: West European, East European, African and a newly recognized Middle Eastern lineage. In Turkey, mtDNA study shows that A. m. anatoliaca and A. m. caucasica belong to the East European group. Approximately 86 % of sample colonies of A. m. anatoliaca in Thrace share genetic traits with A. m. carnica. A. m. caucasica mtDNA was found in 77 % of colonies examined near the Georgian border, 29 % of sample colonies in Erzurum, and 25 % of sample colonies from Muş, Bitlis and Van. Samples from Hatay showed that 57 % had mtDNA belonging to the Middle Eastern group. These are believed to represent A. m. syriaca. Allozyme variation also exists among Turkish populations, but a high frequency of Mdh 1100 is characteristic of all populations examined. There is still much to learn about genetic variation among Turkish honey bees, but much variation may be lost due to <b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping,</b> large scale queen production from limited stocks and distributing them to all over the country...|$|E
40|$|Honey bees, Apis mellifera, face major {{challenges}} including {{diseases and}} reduced food availability due to agricultural intensification. Additionally, <b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping</b> may subject colonies to a moving stress, both during the move itself {{and after the}} move, from the bees having to forage in a novel environment where they {{have no knowledge of}} flower locations. This study investigated the latter. We moved three colonies housed in observation hives onto the campus from a site 26 [*]km away and compared their foraging performance to three similarly sized colonies at the same location that had not been moved. We obtained data on (1) foraging performance by calculating distance by decoding waggle dances, (2) hive foraging rate by counting forager departure rate, (3) forage quality by assessing sugar content of nectar from returning foragers, and (4) forager success by calculating the proportion of bees returning to the nest entrance with nectar in their crop. We repeated this 3 times (August 2010, October 2010, and June 2011) to encompass any seasonal effects. The data show no consistent difference in foraging performance of moved versus resident hives. Overall the results suggest that moving to a new location does not adversely affect the foraging success of honey bees...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The genetic {{variability}} of 37 honey bee populations of Greece was studied, using geometric morphometrics analysis, on {{a sample of}} 798 honey bees collected from 105 different apiaries. The geometric morphometrics analysis was based on coordinates of 19 landmarks located at vein intersections of the left wing. Statistical analysis of measurements, using MS Excel and Matlab packages, showed high hybridization between the Greek honey bee populations, probably due to beekeeping manipulations (<b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping</b> and commercial breeding), represented with the standarized wings ’ shapes and revealed from the centroid size of the wings ’ shapes appearance. This estimation is confirmed in the UPGMC dendrogram, where all populations are mixed {{with the exception of}} Ikaria and Antikythira populations. Minor inter-population variability was detected only in Karpathos, Kos, Ikaria, Antikythira and Astypalaia islands populations. Samples from Crete island appear to be of a mixed origin, a result that it is in coincidence with a previous study based on mtDNA analysis (Harizanis and Bouga, 2003). Our results are in disagreement with Ruttner’s (1988) morphometrics analysis and partly in disagreement with a preliminary study of ours (Hatjina et al., 2002), where we found that the populations from Rodos, Astypalaia and Ikaria were clearly differentiated from the rest ones and formed a distant group. Geometric morphometrics analysis can be very powerful in exploring intra-specific variation at the population level and it is largely employed in evolutionary studies concerning honey bees in Greece, combined with other approaches such as classical morphometrics and molecular markers...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Entomology, Washington State UniversityCross-pollination by bees is {{necessary}} for commercial alfalfa seed production. To maintain varietal purity in alfalfa, seed producers adhere to spatial isolation standards to minimize or prevent bee flight and subsequent pollen flow between fields. The increased use of genetically-engineered (GE) crops in agriculture has raised concerns over pollinator-mediated gene flow between transgenic and conventional agricultural varieties. The 2011 deregulation of genetically engineered glyphosate-resistant alfalfa by the USDA has generated public concern and scientific debate over current recommended bee management practices {{and their ability to}} maintain varietal purity of alfalfa grown for seed production. The primary objective of this research is to determine the roles that pollinators play in contributing to undesired gene flow between alfalfa fields. We evaluated the impact of <b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping</b> practices on transgenic pollen flow between spatially isolated alfalfa fields by permitting honey bees, Apis mellifera, to openly forage upon transgenic alfalfa blossoms, and transporting them 112 km to forage on caged conventional alfalfa following either 8 or 32 hours of isolation from the transgenic source. Cross-pollination between transgenic and conventional alfalfa was nearly eliminated (0. 00008 %) following eight hours of isolation from the transgenic source. The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (ALCB), is another commercially managed pollinator used extensively in alfalfa pollination. We evaluated the influence of the ALCB on gene flow between GE and conventional alfalfa seed fields by testing for the presence of the GE trait in pollen provisions collected from domiciles located in conventional alfalfa seed fields planted directly adjacent to GE alfalfa fields. Pollen samples collected from domiciles in conventional seed fields were at variable distances from the adjacent GE fields. Alfalfa seed in the vicinity of each domicile was harvested and tested for the transgene. We found that the ALCB frequently forages at distances which exceed current estimates for ALCB foraging range. Additionally, GE trait expression in harvested conventional seed was detected at rates that surpass established thresholds for varietal purity. Measurable impacts of ALCB-mediated pollen flow were confirmed and can be used to inform science policy regarding the development of best management practices mitigating undesired gene flow between genetically distinct alfalfa varieties.

40|$|Fungicide {{sensitivity}} of honey bee associated fungi Abstract - Honey bees {{are exposed to}} a wide range of pesticides while pollinating agricultural crops. These pesticides residues are found in beeswax, nectar and pollen in the hive. Some of the pesticides found are fungicides which are not generally considered harmful to insects. However, these fungicides may negatively impact mutualistic fungi associated with honey bees causing indirect harm to colony health. Fungi are implicated for helping break down complex protein molecules and therefore allowing the honey bees to attain more nutrients from the food source. The objective of this experiment was to identify if honey bee associated fungi were affected by fungicides that honey bees are exposed to. In order to achieve this objective, a number of fungi were isolated from bee bread and the honey bee digestive tract. Five of these isolates were genetically identified by sequencing of the internal transcriber spacer regions 1 and 4 and selected for fungicide sensitivity testing. Each fungal isolate was subject to five treatments with replications. With the exception of Mucor hiemalis, all fungal species growth was significantly reduced (p ≤ 0. 05) by the fungicides chlorothalonil, iprodione, and boscalid at day 2 of exposure. This research suggests that while fungicides may not directly affect the honey, they may disrupt the normal balance of fungal associates in the hive. This imbalance may result in decreased nutritional attainment from bee bread thus indirectly affecting the health or behavior of the honey bee. More research is needed to identify the functional roles of fungi in honey bees. Tylosin & Fumagillin - Impacts on honey bee midgut bacterial symbionts Abstract- Concern for the managed honey bee population has been developing after drastic losses in the past decade. Suspected causes include new pests, pathogens, pesticides, <b>migratory</b> <b>beekeeping,</b> and nutritional deficiencies from a monoculture diet. To avoid the increasing threat of microbial pathogens, some beekeepers treat hives annually with tylosin and fumagillin, antibiotic compounds. Emerging research has identified the honey bee microbiome as an important aspect of colony health. It is unclear whether annual prophylactic treatments of tylosin and fumagillin applications deplete symbiotic microorganisms in the honey bee digestive tract. The purpose of this research was to gain an initial understanding if tylosin and fumagillin treatments significantly alter composition of Lactobacillus species in the honey bee midgut microbiome. Using a laboratory based, in vitro well-diffusion test and a caged in vivo experiment, four treatment groups consisting of 1) tylosin application, 2) fumagillin application, 3) tylosin with fumagillin application and 4) no chemical application as the control, were each replicated four times. Honey bees were sampled before treatment application, 5 days after treatment and 12 days after treatment. Midgut contents were then homogenized and concentration of Lactobacilli spp. in each midgut was assessed with a plate dilation series on MRS selective media. Colony Formation Units (CFU) were counted after plate inoculation and 72 hours of incubation. Proportions of high, medium and low CFU data were compared between treatment groups. Results suggest a need to further investigate the impact of annual antibiotic treatments and for a better understanding of the honey bee microbiome...|$|E
