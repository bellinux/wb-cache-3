5|$|Dairy {{products}} such as milk, butter, ghee, yoghurt, buttermilk and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle, though the milk of sheep, goat, yak, and buffalo is also used {{in some parts of}} the world and for gourmet products. For example, buffalo <b>milk</b> <b>is</b> used to make mozzarella in Italy and gulab jamun dessert in India, while sheep <b>milk</b> <b>is</b> used to make blue Roquefort cheese in France.|$|E
5|$|In one {{instance}} in the Ramayana, Surabhi is described {{to live in}} the city of Varuna – the Lord of oceans – which is situated below the earth in Patala (the netherworld). Her flowing sweet <b>milk</b> <b>is</b> said to form Kshiroda or the Kshirasagara, the cosmic milk ocean. In the Udyoga Parva book of the Mahabharata, this <b>milk</b> <b>is</b> said to be of six flavours and has the essence of all the best things of the earth. The Udyoga Parva specifies that Surabhi inhabits the lowest realm of Patala, known as Rasatala, and has four daughters – the Dikpalis – the guardian cow goddesses of the heavenly quarters: Saurabhi in the east, Harhsika in the south, Subhadra in the west and Dhenu in the north.|$|E

The fruit body smells harsh, fruit-like and first tastes mild, but then {{slightly}} resinous-bitter and nearly spicy or somewhat astringent.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} tarak-juk {{dates back to}} the {{consumption}} of milk in Korean history. Kingdom of Goryeo (918-1392) kept Yuyuso (milk office), and nobles consumed nakso (cheese). However, <b>milk</b> cows <b>were</b> rare and <b>milk</b> <b>was</b> only available when a cow gave birth. Moreover, the freshness of <b>milk</b> <b>was</b> a vital factor, it could not be delivered long distances. <b>Milk</b> <b>was</b> considered a supplement food for special occasions, or recovery food after illness.|$|R

5|$|Camel <b>milk</b> <b>is</b> {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, he remembers where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered <b>milk</b> <b>is</b> made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he probably also killed Teresa.

5|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>was</b> an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh <b>milk</b> <b>was</b> not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or <b>milk</b> that <b>was</b> soured or watered down. Fresh <b>milk</b> <b>was</b> overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack of}} technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond <b>milk</b> <b>was</b> generally used in its stead.|$|R

5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a mild {{taste with}} a {{slightly}} bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, it is not recommended, as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy.

5|$|Mother's <b>Milk</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} studio album by American funk rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{released}} on August 16, 1989, by EMI Records. After {{the death of}} founding guitarist Hillel Slovak and subsequent departure of drummer Jack Irons, vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea regrouped {{with the addition of}} guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith. Frusciante's influence altered the band's sound by placing more emphasis on melody than rhythm, which had dominated the band's previous material. Returning producer Michael Beinhorn favored heavy metal guitar riffs as well as overdubbing that was perceived by Frusciante as excessive, and as a result Beinhorn and Frusciante constantly fought over the album's guitar sound.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius blennius has a {{flattened}} convex cap that is 4–10cm (1.6–4in) across that later becomes depressed in the centre. In colour, it is pale olive to a greenish grey, sometimes a dull green or pale grey-sepia, and has blotches of darker colouration in concentric bands, though the colour can vary greatly. Heavily spotted specimens are also known, {{and a very}} brown specimen similar to Lactarius circellatus was recorded in Scotland. The cap is very slimy when moist and has a margin that is curved inwards. The stem is a paler colour than the cap, but also very slimy, and measures from 4–5cm (1.6–2in) tall by 1–1.7cm (0.4–0.7in) thick, tapering a little towards the bottom. The flesh is whitish, similar in colour to the gills, which later become a creamy or pale buff colour. The gills turn a brownish-grey colour when wounded, and are crowded. In shape, they are slightly decurrent or adnate, meaning that they run a small way down the stem in attachment, or that they {{are attached to the}} stem by the whole depth of the gills. The <b>milk</b> <b>is</b> white and dries grey, and is very plentiful. L.blennius spores leave a creamy print, and are elliptic with low warts joined by ridges with a small number of cross-connections, measuring from 6–9 by 5.5–7µm.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the genus Crocuta diverged from Hyaena (the genus of striped and brown hyenas) 10 million years ago. The {{ancestors of}} the spotted hyena probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses, which forced them to operate in teams. At one point in their evolution, spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity, {{as is the case}} for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's land. It has been theorised that female dominance in spotted hyena clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills, and thus ensure that enough <b>milk</b> <b>is</b> produced for their cubs. Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of time it takes for cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws, thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females. Its appearance in Europe and China during the Cromerian period coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of Pachycrocuta brevirostris, the giant short-faced hyena. As {{there is no evidence of}} environmental change being responsible, it is likely that the giant short-faced hyena became extinct due to competition with the spotted hyena.|$|E
