25|$|Louhi was {{decommissioned}} in 1986. While {{the hull}} of the vessel was still in acceptable condition, the main engines were worn-out and it was becoming increasingly difficult to find spare parts for the original diesel-electric power plant {{dating back to the}} late 1930s. The Finnish Navy tried to sell the vessel with public newspaper announcement, but after it was determined that most onboard systems had deteriorated beyond repair, it was decided to sell the old icebreaker for scrap. The 1939-built vessel was broken up in Naantali shortly before the 1959-built Murtaja arrived at the same shipbreaker. The name Louhi was later given to a 2011-built <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessel</b> operated by the Finnish Navy.|$|E
25|$|According to Janes {{the navy}} is badly underfunded {{and much of}} its {{equipment}} {{is in need of}} maintenance; as a consequence it is scarcely able to carry out its tasks, with operations often delayed or cancelled. The navy's patrol craft are barely effective; fuel costs and maintenance problems mean that often only one boat is available for sea duty at any time, while the heavy landing craft have high upkeep costs and are nearing the end of their service life. Although the patrol boats may be at times serviceable, the task of patrolling such a large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is too great and they are heavily reliant for information about the presence of foreign ships on daily reports supplied by US satellite surveillance. The main concern is illegal tuna fishing by Japanese vessels. The navy would like larger vessels as the Pacific class experiences difficulties in deep ocean conditions and is exploring the possibility of procuring a 2,000 tonne <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessel,</b> or the conversion of a merchant vessel, for patrol duties.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the new <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessel</b> began on 25 May 2003 when the Ministry of Transport and Communications appointed a work group to investigate the technical requirements and economic aspects of building a new multipurpose icebreaker capable of combating oil and chemical spills around the year. The amount of oil transported in the Gulf of Finland had increased from a mere 15 million tons {{per year in the}} early 1990s to 69 million tons in 2003 and was expected to reach 130 million tons by 2010 after the new Russian oil terminals became operational, increasing the risk of a large spill in the vulnerable sea area considerably. While Finland already had a fleet of vessels with oil recovery equipment, none of them were capable of collecting spilled oil efficiently in heavy seas or in ice. The new multipurpose icebreaker would be designed to be capable of recovering spilled oil and chemicals in both open water and ice conditions, extinguishing shipboard fires and emergency towing of the largest merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Finland. The new vessel would also have sufficient icebreaking capability to assist oil tankers to the Kilpilahti oil refinery in Porvoo during winter. However, in the interim report, published on 30 September 2003, the work group noted that unless other work outside the winter months could be arranged and the new multipurpose icebreaker would have {{to spend the rest of}} the year in pollution control readiness, the operating expenses would be very high.|$|E

40|$|While {{following}} the general objective of modelling and optimizing {{the operation of}} the hot part of the brewing process, we have suggested a new concept for the configuration of the brewhouses, quite different from the one currently in operation, The latter is based on the use of <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessels</b> that could be used indiscriminately as mash mixers, mash coppers or boiling coppers, Moreover, none of these vessels would be equipped with heat exchange surfaces, but external heat exchangers (cookers) would rather be used, With the help of a very detailed simulation model, a large series of simulation runs have been performed {{on the basis of this}} new configuration, and have proven its practical operability, The use of such a configuration with 9 <b>multipurpose</b> <b>vessels</b> would give rise to an increased flexibility of the brewhouses and to large savings in investment costs, which have been evaluated and reach 41 % in terms of unit price of production capacity...|$|R
