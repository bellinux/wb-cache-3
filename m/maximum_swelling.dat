2500|$|Bonobo {{reproductive}} {{rates are}} {{no higher than}} those of the common chimpanzee. During oestrus, females undergo a swelling of the perineal tissue lasting 10 to 20 days. Most matings occur during the <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling.</b> The gestation period is on average 240 days. Postpartum amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) lasts less than one year and a female may resume external signs of oestrus within a year of giving birth, though the female is probably not fertile at this point. Female bonobos carry and nurse their young for four years and give birth on average every 4.6 years. Compared to common chimpanzees, bonobo females resume the genital swelling cycle much sooner after giving birth, enabling them to rejoin the sexual activities of their society. Also, bonobo females which are sterile or too young to reproduce still engage in sexual activity. Mothers will help their sons get more matings from females in estrus. Adult male bonobos have sex with infants. Frans de Waal, an ethologist who has studied bonobos, remarked, [...] "A lot of the things we see, like pedophilia and homosexuality, may be leftovers that some now consider unacceptable in our particular society." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1985, estrous {{synchrony}} {{was reported}} in female chimpanzees. In her study, 10 female chimpanzees were caged, at different times, in two groups of four and six in the same building. The anogenital swelling of each female was recorded daily. Synchrony was measured by calculating the absolute differences in days between (1) the day of swelling onset and (2) the day of <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling.</b> She reported a statistically significant average difference of 5.7 days for onset of swelling and 8.0 days for <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling.</b> Schank, however, noted that due to females who became pregnant and who stopped cycling, most of the data were based on only four animals. He performed a computer simulation study to calculate the expected swelling onset and maximal swelling onset difference for female chimpanzees with the reported mean estrous cycle lengths of 36.7 (with {{a standard deviation of}} 4.3) days. He reported an expected difference of 7.7 days. Thus, a <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling</b> difference of 8.0 days is about what would be expected by chance and given that only four animals contributed data to the study, a 5.7 day onset difference is not significantly less than 7.7 days.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Various {{formulations}} of wood flour and rigid Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) composites were prepared {{and the effects}} of layering and composite composition on their physical properties were studied. Beech wood flour, PVC, Maleic Anhydride Polyethylene (MAPE), and beech veneer were used to produce the composites in a two-step conventional hot press system. Physical property tests, including equilibrium moisture content (EMC), long term water absorption and thickness swelling were carried out. The results indicated that, by the increase in PVC content from 20 % to 30 %, EMC, maximum water absorption and <b>maximum</b> thickness <b>swelling</b> decreased. No significant relationship was observed between PVC content and water diffusion coefficient, whereas layered composites on average had higher water diffusion coefficients in comparison with unlayered composites.

40|$|Outdoor {{application}} of natural fibre reinforced composites is restricted mainly {{due to its}} capability to absorb moisture {{which can lead to}} physical and mechanical degradation. In this work, bamboo fibre/polyester composites subjected to alkalization at 0, 4, 6, and 8 wt. % of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), as well as neat polyester, were immersed in water at room temperature (25 ºC) for 60 days and at 80 ºC for two days. The percentages of weight and thickness increment were recorded until a plateau was observed on the moisture absorption and thickness swelling graphs, or obvious physical degradation was observed on the specimens. At room temperature, all specimens reached equilibrium moisture content and <b>maximum</b> thickness <b>swelling</b> at 60 days, with 6 wt. % NaOH treated composites exhibiting the least absorptivity and swelling. Untreated composites (0 wt. %) experienced the highest percentage of weight gain indicating that alkalization reduces moisture absorption of composites.

50|$|Another {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the expansive clay is its vulnerability to physical changes, according {{to the amount of}} water. For example, in a wet season, the clay has the capacity of swelling, and on a dry season, it can shrink and form cracks. According to Biswas and Kriscna, “there are several types of clay minerals of which Montmorillonite has the <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling</b> potential”.|$|E
50|$|Exaggerated sexual swellings also {{increase}} gradually in size throughout the female’s cycle, beginning after menstruation. For example, research on baboons showed that after 14 days of gradual increase, swellings peaked for 2 days before reducing. These cyclic changes in {{appearance of the}} sexual skin reflect the changes of ovarian hormones (estrogen and progestogen) during the female menstrual cycle. Specifically, the increase in sexual swelling size during the follicular phase is correlated with increased estrogen levels, and the decrease in swelling size during the luteal phase is associated with rising progesterone levels. Indeed, {{it has been shown}} in ovariectomized chimpanzees that swelling can be induced by estrogen and inhibited by progesterone. As a result, the peak size of the swellings often coincides with the highest potential of ovulation, although this is not a perfect association. For example, research on West African chimpanzees showed that higher probabilities of ovulation tended to occur within 7 to 9 days of the onset of <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling</b> of sexual skin. Additionally, a study into wild white-handed gibbons showed that <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling</b> size and ovulation overlapped closely in 80% of menstrual cycles.|$|E
50|$|The obvious-ovulation {{explanation}} of sexual swellings {{is consistent with}} the observation that ovulation often coincides with <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling.</b> Further support that males use swellings in the way set out by this hypothesis to assess the timing of ovulation comes from observations that in wild long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis): males are more aroused and find females more attractive at peak swelling. Others have been critical of this hypothesis, however. According to Stallman and Froehlich's assessment, the hypothesis predicts monandry (i.e. that females will have only one mating partner), which runs counter to observations of species such as Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus), which have exaggerated sexual swellings, yet have been seen to be promiscuous and polyandrous (i.e. mating with multiple males) in their mating behaviours.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The shear {{response}} of polymer brushes is explored {{as a function}} of grafting surface curvature using the Alexander-deGennes ansatz, where the free ends of the chains are localized {{at the tip of the}} brush and all tethered chains in the brush are stretched equally. Brushes adsorbed onto the concave and convex surfaces of a cylinder are found to swell to a maximum of 35 % of their nonsheared brush height in good solvent, larger than the predicted <b>maximum</b> shear <b>swelling</b> of planar brushes of the same grafting density. For significantly convex surfaces, increased surface curvature increases the maximum amount of shear swelling. In contrast, brushes grafted onto concave surfaces with the same grafting density show diminished shear swelling as the grafting surface becomes more concave. The shear {{response of}} nonplanar brushes is important in a variety of possible applications, including the fabrication of pressure-sensitive microvalves and dynamic membranes and an understanding of the rheological behavior of hairy-rod polymers or molecular bottlebrushes.

50|$|The male {{services}} hypothesis {{proposes that}} sexual swellings lead to direct {{benefits for the}} female by encouraging dominant males to engage in consortship behaviours (i.e. forming a partnership). Swellings elicit mate guarding behaviours from males who want to increase their chances of siring the swollen female's offspring, resulting in dominant males acting like bodyguards, to reduce and prevent harassment from other males in the social group. Females may also benefit in that dominant males may later protect the resulting offspring, reducing the threat of infanticide from other males. It has been observed that male primates will attempt to monopolise, or gain exclusive sexual access to, a female {{early on in the}} duration of sexual swellings to ensure he has sexual access at <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling</b> when she is most likely to be ovulating. Though the males in these situations are guarding the females for their own gains (i.e. to ensure {{they will be able to}} sire the female's offspring) it has been observed in rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) that females also benefit from these consortships, and are harassed less by subordinate males when they are with a dominant one.|$|E

40|$|The fitness of a female’s {{offspring}} depends cruicially on the traits, {{genetic and}} paternal, {{that the father}} contributes.

In the second set of results elimination of such effects is attempted. The values so obtained are for the pressure at a point in a coal change throughout carbonisation. These results show that swelling pressure occurs at lower temperatures than the associated property of volume increase, and is not due to volatile evolution through the plastic coal as the latter property is.

40|$|The {{solvation}} {{and swelling}} behaviour of three dialkylaminoethyl methacrylate polymer brushes, of varying hydrophobicity, {{have been investigated}} {{using a combination of}} in situ ellipsometry and a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). At low pH the tertiary amine groups of the three polymers are protonated and all three brushes are significantly solvated and swell by adopting an extended conformation. As the pH is increased the weak polybasic brushes become increasingly deprotonated and collapse via solvent expulsion. By employing high temporal resolution measurements we have found that monomer hydrophobicity has a direct influence on the dynamics of this pH-response. The most hydrophobic poly(2 -diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate (poly(DPA)) brush exhibits the fastest <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling</b> rate. This <b>maximum</b> <b>swelling</b> rate is reduced with decreasing monomer hydrophobicity for the 2 -diethylamino, and even further for the 2 -dimethylamino analogues. For all three brushes, the corresponding collapse transition is slower and compounded by an induction time that decreases with monomer hydrophobicity. Here also, the maximum collapse rate is greatest for the most hydrophobic polymer. This domination of the pH-response kinetics by monomer hydrophobicity is attributed to attractive hydrophobic forces between polymer segments overcoming the repulsive electrostatic forces between the tertiary amine residues...|$|E

Results indicated that thickness swelling was not affected by freeze–thaw cycling while significant relationship was observed between PVC content and thickness swelling and with increase in PVC content, <b>maximum</b> thickness <b>swelling</b> decreased. The values of flexural strength (MOR) and modulus (MOE), were significantly affected by PVC content, layer, and freeze–thaw cycling. Layering of the specimens and higher PVC contents improved MOR and MOE while freeze–thaw cycling decreased them at the first cycle. Repeated freeze–thaw cycling did not exhibit a significant effect on the mechanical properties and the effect of the cycles was confined to the first cycle only. Increase of PVC content had positive effect on both physical and mechanical properties. KEY WORDS: composite, freeze–thaw cycling, wood flour, PVC, mechanical properties...|$|R
