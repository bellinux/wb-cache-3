5|$|After the United States entered World War II on December 7, 1941, the Federal {{government}} {{set up the}} War Shipping Administration {{to manage}} the vitally important <b>maritime</b> <b>shipping</b> and Naval support needs of the U.S. and its Allies, including the power to expropriate civilian-owned boats. On April 1, 1942, the government acquired the Old Bay Line's State of Virginia and State of Maryland. On July 13, the President Warfield and Yorktown were also taken over. Thus, by mid-1942, four of the Old Bay Line's six ships had become government property, leaving the company only the two oldest and smallest ships in its fleet {{for the duration of}} the war, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} the sheep {{industry}} in Australia was explosive. In 1820, the continent held 100,000 sheep, a decade later it had one million. By 1840, New South Wales alone kept 4 million sheep; flock numbers grew to 13 million in a decade. While much of the growth in both nations {{was due to the}} active support of Britain in its desire for wool, both worked independently to develop new high-production breeds: the Corriedale, Coolalee, Coopworth, Perendale, Polwarth, Booroola Merino, Peppin Merino, and Poll Merino were all created in New Zealand or Australia. Wool production was a fitting industry for colonies far from their home nations. Before the advent of fast air and <b>maritime</b> <b>shipping,</b> wool {{was one of the few}} viable products that was not subject to spoiling on the long passage back to British ports. The abundant new land and milder winter weather of the region also aided the {{growth of the}} Australian and New Zealand sheep industries.|$|E
5|$|Any hope of {{resistance}} was centered on two young princes, Emperor Gong's brothers. The older boy, Zhao Shi, who {{was nine years}} old, was declared emperor on June 14, 1276, in Fuzhou. The court sought refuge in Quanzhou, seeking an alliance with the Superintendent of <b>Maritime</b> <b>Shipping,</b> the Muslim Pu Shougeng. However, he secretly formed an alliance with Kublai, so the Song court was forced to flee in 1277. The court then sought refuge in Silvermine Bay (Mui Wo) on Lantau Island. The older brother became ill and died on May 8, 1278 at age ten, and was succeeded by his younger brother who became Emperor Huaizong of Song, aged seven. The Sung Wong Toi monument in Kowloon commemorates his enthronement. On March 19, 1279 the Song army was defeated in its last battle, the Battle of Yamen, fought against the Yuan army led by the Chinese general Zhang Hongfan in the Pearl River Delta. Song Prime Minister Lu Xiufu {{is said to have}} taken the boy emperor in his arms and jumped from his sinking ship into the sea, drowning both of them.|$|E

25|$|In 2010 DFDS {{acquired}} Norfolkline from Maersk. Following restructuring, {{the operations}} of DFDS Tor Line, DFDS Lisco and Norfolkline were integrated into DFDS Seaways. The merger led to changes and additions to freight destinations and an expansion in freight volumes. It {{is at this point}} that the historic Tor Line ceased to exist as a brand and entity, though its contributions to the legacy of North Sea and Baltic Sea <b>maritime</b> <b>shipping</b> remains.|$|E

25|$|Sea {{transport}} {{is extremely}} important for economic integration and for domestic and foreign trade. It is well developed, {{with each of the}} major islands having at least one significant port city. Because Indonesia encompasses a sprawling archipelago, <b>maritime</b> <b>shipping</b> provides essential links between parts of the country. Boats in common use include large container ships, a variety of ferries, passenger ships, sailing ships, and smaller motorised vessels. Traditional wooden vessel pinisi are widely used as the inter-island freight service in Indonesian archipelago.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Wilmington, North Carolina {{became the}} site of a ship {{scrapping}} operation. There were twenty decommissioned U.S.NAVY warships and one <b>maritime</b> <b>ship.</b> Wilmington Resources, Inc.,and Sigma Recycling, LLC, operated the facility. The USS ADROIT MSO 509 was dismantled and scrapped at this facility.|$|R
50|$|Thus on August 11, 1899, the Austrian Daimler Engine Society was founded. Whilst the {{assembling}} parts {{stemmed from}} Stuttgart, in 1900 they built their first automobile which featured 2 cylinders, , and 4 seats. Soon they started producing engines for luxurious cars, trucks, buses, <b>maritime</b> <b>ships,</b> and trains.|$|R
50|$|The Civil War {{period was}} one of booming {{economic}} growth for the BNA colonies. The war in the United States created a huge market for Canada's agricultural and manufactured goods, most of which went to the Union. <b>Maritime</b> <b>ship</b> builders and owners prospered in the wartime trade boom.|$|R
25|$|At that time, {{the ship}} was sold under the MARAD Ship Exchange Program to Sea-Land Service of Wilmington, Delaware. In 1969 Sea Land had Todd Shipyard, Galveston convert her to an 18,455-gross ton {{container}} ship named SS Chicago, USCG ON 516542, IMO 6904806. The ship was sold in 1975 to Navieras de Puerto Rico, {{also known as the}} Puerto Rico <b>Maritime</b> <b>Shipping</b> Authority, of San Juan, Puerto Rico, who renamed her SS San Juan. The veteran ship operated through 1985, and was scrapped in 1988.|$|E
25|$|A San Francisco-based trading company, J.J. Smith & Co. {{acquired}} the Star of Bengal in June 1898. At that time, <b>maritime</b> <b>shipping</b> out of United States Pacific ports was undergoing a major change. After the Long Depression whose affect on the regional shipping peaked in 1896–1897, {{the demand for}} Pacific Coast maritime transportation unexpectedly soared. It was driven by the Nome Gold Rush, which intensified the colonization of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, and created numerous opportunities for new passenger and trade routes. As the result, many old vessels were purchased to service these routes.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} rebuilt as an 11,369 gross ton {{container}} ship by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation Ship Repair Yard in Hoboken, New Jersey after being gutted by the Alabama Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. and renamed SS Brooklyn, USCG ON 513557, IMO 6903149. In 1975 {{the ship was}} sold to Navieras de Puerto Rico, {{also known as the}} Puerto Rico <b>Maritime</b> <b>Shipping</b> Authority and renamed SS Humacao. Eastern Star Maritime Ltd. of Panama renamed her Eastern Light when it purchased her in 1981. Eastern Light left Kobe, Japan on 24 December 1981 to steam to Kaohsiung, Taiwan where she was scrapped.|$|E

25|$|Following an {{invitation}} {{issued by the}} SEF at the first meeting, the head of ARATS, Chen Yunlin, began a visit to Taiwan on 3 November 2008. Items on the agenda raised by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung included direct <b>maritime</b> <b>shipping,</b> chartered cargo flights, direct postal service, and co-operation in ensuring food safety, {{in response to the}} 2008 Chinese milk scandal, while ARATS chairman Chen Yunlin raised the matters of direct freight service, and opening up air routes that directly cross the Taiwan Strait. Previous routes avoided crossing the Strait for security reasons, with planes detouring through Hong Kong or Japan air control areas.|$|E
25|$|A usable Northern Sea Route between {{northern}} Europe to North Pacific ports {{would cut}} time at sea (and resultant fuel consumption) {{by more than}} half. For the corporate players in bulk shipping of relative low-value raw materials, cost savings for fuel may appear as a driver to explore the Northern Sea Route for commercial transits, and not necessarily reduced lead time. The Northern Sea Route allows economies of scale compared to coastal route alternatives, with vessel draught and beam limitation. Environmental demands faced by the <b>maritime</b> <b>shipping</b> industry may emerge as a driver for developing the Northern Sea Route. Increased awareness of environmental benefits and costs for both the Northern Sea Route and Suez routes will probably be important factors in this respect.|$|E
25|$|Title was {{transferred}} to Hudson Waterways Corporation, 16 July 1968, under the MARAD Exchange program for SS Zephyrhills ex-, and she was delivered to Hudson Waterways Corp. on 30 July 1968.

Upon completion she began hauling containerized cargo for Seatrain Lines. On 14 October 1974 the ship was sold to the Puerto Rico <b>Maritime</b> <b>Shipping</b> Authority and she was renamed SS Carolina on 1 March 1975. She was resold to the Point Vigilance Corp. on 10 July 1981 and renamed SS Point Manatee.

She was sold in 1982, the Merchant Terminal Corporation of New York and renamed Amco Trader. She was laid up in New York when sold to Steamco Co. on June 1985. She was resold to Crestwood Corp., 19 November 1985, and renamed Trader. She was scrapped at Taiwan in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{that other}} Japanese car makers were {{allowing}} their dealers in Puerto Rico to transship excess inventory to Latin America and the continental United States, Soler {{asked if it}} could do the same. Mitsubishi refused, saying the vehicles were customized for the Puerto Rican market. They lacked heaters and defoggers {{that they would have}} needed on the mainland, and their engines could not run on the lower-grade leaded gasoline sold in many Latin American countries at that time. Further, Soler had no experience with <b>maritime</b> <b>shipping</b> and would not been able to meet its service obligations under warranty for transshipped cars and trucks. Mitsubishi also was concerned that transshipments to the continental U.S. would be seen as skirting the voluntary import restraints Japanese automakers had been practicing in the American market to mitigate the potential political backlash from their distressed American counterparts.|$|E
