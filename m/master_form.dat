40|$|Conventional {{single stage}} cold {{upsetting}} processes {{are limited to}} upset ratios 2 in micro range due to size effects. To still benefit from the advantages of upsetting, an alternative process chain called 2 ̆ 2 laser rod end melting 2 ̆ 2 is presented in this work. Prior to cold forming, the wrought material is locally melted by a laser beam whilst the surface tension causes the melt to form spherically, called 2 ̆ 2 preform 2 ̆ 2. Experimental investigations show that the <b>master</b> <b>forming</b> stage allows geometrical tolerance IT 9 in diameter of preform. An analytical, non-adiabatic model is set up describing very well the <b>master</b> <b>forming</b> stage in terms of pulse energy, deflection velocity and preform diameter. The dendritic grain structure of preforms does not show any deficits when forming is carried out in cone-shaped dies {{and it is possible}} to replicate surface structures as small as 0, 001 mm. Hence, this work shows that the laser rod end melting process is well suitable to significantly shorten multi-stage cold forming operations...|$|R
