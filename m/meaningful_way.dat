5|$|Suu's {{signature}} {{was required}} to pass the ruling, but he referred the matter to the HNC to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. There was speculation the HNC did this {{as many of them}} were old, and therefore did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors—some South Vietnamese mockingly called the HNC the High National Museum. On December 19, a Saturday, the generals moved to dissolve the HNC by arresting some of its members. The HNC had already ceased to function in any <b>meaningful</b> <b>way,</b> as only 9 of the 17 members were still occasionally attending its meetings, and few on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home in a <b>meaningful</b> <b>way.</b> If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E

5|$|In 849, Calakmul was {{mentioned}} at Seibal where a ruler named as Chan Pet attended the K'atun-ending ceremony; his name {{may also be}} recorded on a broken ceramic at Calakmul itself. However, {{it is unlikely that}} Calakmul still existed as a state in any <b>meaningful</b> <b>way</b> at this late date. A final flurry of activity took place {{at the end of the}} 9th century or the beginning of the 10th. A new stela was erected, although the date records only the day, not the full date. The recorded day may fall either in 899 or 909 with the latter date the most likely. A few monuments appear to be even later although their style is crude, representing the efforts of a remnant population to maintain the Classic Maya tradition. Even the inscriptions on these late monuments are meaningless imitations of writing.|$|E

Two hours after Doudou contacted Zhou, soldiers had still not responded in any <b>meaningful</b> <b>way.</b> Ye and Lin Liguo woke Lin Biao and packed him into a waiting limousine. The party then drove to Shanhaiguan airport, 25 miles away from their residence in Beidaihe, where their plane was waiting. Lin's bodyguards told Doudou and another companion that they were ordered to take them as well, but Doudou and her companion refused.|$|E

Suggested rationales for laser therapy include a potential decrease in fibrosis, stimulation of macrophages and the immune system, and a possible role in encouraging lymphangiogenesis.|$|E

By 1979, Canada sought global channels and forums, namely the United Nations, to vocalize discontent, concerns, and thoughts on inter-American affairs that included trading blocs, nuclear proliferation issues, and human rights abuses (in the case of Argentina).|$|E

25|$|In {{a recent}} study (published May 1, 2013), it is {{suggested}} that the inflammation of the hypothalamus may be connected to our overall aging bodies. They focused on the activation of the protein complex NF-κB in mice test subjects, which showed increased activation as mice test subjects aged in the study. This activation not only affects aging, but affects a hormone known as GnRH, which has shown new anti-aging properties when injected into mice outside the hypothalamus, while causing the opposite effect when injected into the hypothalamus. It'll be some time before this can be applied to humans in a <b>meaningful</b> <b>way,</b> as more studies on this pathway are necessary to understand the mechanics of GnRH's anti-aging properties.|$|E
25|$|Rader {{found that}} the Live Traffic paper was in a {{situation}} much more similar to the uncatalogued thesis in In re Bayer than the publicly disseminated posters in In re Klopfenstein. Rader concluded that the pre-publication Live Traffic paper could not be considered catalogued or indexed in a <b>meaningful</b> <b>way</b> and {{was not intended to}} be disseminated to the public. Rader concluded that, without additional information about the structure of SRI's FTP server, genuine issues of fact should have prevented the Delaware District Court from rendering summary judgment on the patent invalidity issues. The Federal Circuit thus vacated and remanded the Delaware District Court's determination of invalidity based on the Live Traffic paper.|$|E
25|$|While not overtly political, {{the film}} {{documents}} {{that the federal}} government of the United States under the Presidency of George W. Bush joined the auto-industry suit against California in 2002. This pushed California to abandon its ZEV mandate regulation. The film notes that Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card had recently been head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Alliance in California and then joined the White House with Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and other federal officials who were former executives or board members of oil and auto companies. By failing to increase mileage standards in a <b>meaningful</b> <b>way</b> since the 1970s and now interfering in California, the federal government had again served short-term industry interests at the expense of long-range leadership on issues of oil dependency and cleaner cars.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{a seminal}} case {{applying}} this principle is R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Venables (1997). In this case, the Home Secretary had {{taken into account}} public opinion when deciding upon the tariff of 15 years for holding in custody two boys detained at Her Majesty's pleasure for having murdered James Bulger, a two-year-old child, {{when they were both}} ten years old. Lord Steyn held that the public petitions considered were worthless and incapable of informing the Home Secretary in a <b>meaningful</b> <b>way</b> of the true state of public opinion in respect of the tariff. Hence, the reliance on the public petition in coming up with its decision was an irrelevant consideration which justified the setting-aside of the Home Secretary's decision.|$|E
25|$|As Witmer {{believed}} in the appropriate training of these school psychologists, he also {{stressed the importance of}} appropriate and accurate testing of these special children. The IQ testing movement was sweeping through the world of education after its creation in 1905. However, the IQ test negatively influenced special education. The IQ test creators, Lewis Terman and Henry Goddard, held a nativist view of intelligence, believing that intelligence was inherited and difficult if not impossible to modify in any <b>meaningful</b> <b>way</b> through education. These notions were often used as a basis for excluding children with disabilities from the public schools. Witmer argued against the standard pencil and paper IQ and Binet type tests in order to help select children for special education. Witmer's child selection process included observations and having children perform certain mental tasks.|$|E
25|$|No space colonies {{have been}} built so far. Currently, the {{building}} of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges. Space settlements would have to provide for nearly all (or all) the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is very hostile to human life. They would involve technologies, such as controlled ecological life support systems, that have yet to be developed in any <b>meaningful</b> <b>way.</b> They would also {{have to deal with the}} as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term. Because of the present cost of sending anything from the surface of the Earth into orbit (around $2,500 per-pound to orbit, expected to further decrease) a space colony would currently be a massively expensive project.|$|E

25|$|As {{the use of}} {{the long}} drum began to spread across Europe, many composers and musicians started looking for even deeper tones {{that could be used in}} compositions. As a result of this demand, a narrow-shelled, {{single-headed}} drum called the gong drum was introduced in Britain during the 19th century. This drum, which was 70-100 centimeters in diameter and deep-shelled, was similar to the long drum in both size and construction. When struck, the gong drum produced a deep sound with a rich resonance. However, the immense size of the drum, coupled with the fact that there was not a second head to help balance the sound, meant that gong drums tended to produce a sound with a definite pitch. As a result, they fell out of favor with many composers, as it became nearly impossible to incorporate them in an orchestra in any <b>meaningful</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
25|$|Olen Montgomery {{testified that}} he had been alone on a tank car the entire trip, and had not known about the fight or alleged rapes. Ozie Powell said that while he was not a participant, he had seen the fight with the white {{teenagers}} from his vantage point between a box car and a gondola car, where he had been hanging on. He said he saw the white teenagers jump off the train. Roberson, Montgomery, and Powell all denied they had known each other or the other defendants before that day. Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Haywood Patterson testified that they had previously known each other, but had not seen the women until the train stopped in Paint Rock. Knight questioned them extensively about instances in which their testimony supposedly differed from their testimony at their trial in Scottsboro. They did not contradict themselves in any <b>meaningful</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fliegerkorps II {{attacked}} the Chernigov bridgeheads {{to slow down}} Soviet reinforcements while SKG 210 provided close air support. The VVS was in constant action against German bridgeheads on airfields. At the end of August, Luftflotte 4 was down to 320 bombers, around 100 operational fighters, and 35 reconnaissance machines. The VVS North-Western Front and Southern possessed 493 bombers, 473 fighters and 20 reconnaissance aircraft. Most were concentrated in the first Front. The VVS Southern Front could muster only 119 serviceable machines. Its units had sustained heavy losses {{in the past four}} weeks. As Guderian reached the Seym river, halfway between Kiev and Kursk, All three Gruppen of JG 3 and the Slovak 12 Letka, under the command of Ivan Haluznicky, were concentrated in order to protect them, and were involved in intense air battles with the 249 IAP. The Soviets failed to damage the German fighter cover in any <b>meaningful</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
