40|$|Compulsory {{smallpox}} vaccination {{was introduced}} to Algeria by decree on 27 May 1907. After World War I, the combination of public health crises, racialized fears of contagion, and the objective of mise en valeur prompted the colonial state to make Muslim villagers in the communes mixtes a more systematic target of smallpox vaccination. This was achieved in large part thanks {{to the efforts of}} Muslim <b>medical</b> <b>auxiliaries.</b> This article reconstructs the kinds of training, labor, and clerical skills embodied in these agents’ administration of vaccination. It also examines the accommodation and contestation of their presence by officials, politicians, and villagers. The author argues that the administrative bureaucracy generated by vaccination may have preceded and enabled the expansion of state registration in rural areas during the interwar period, but ultimately was more effective at disciplining the <b>medical</b> <b>auxiliary</b> than it was at controlling villagers or the smallpox virus...|$|R

40|$|In Czech literature, {{supervision}} {{is usually}} {{referred to as}} inspection or overview. Certain authors claim that supervision would not be supervision without either of them. Supervision provides an overview, which is important in solving occupational issues and monitoring the workers' quality and professionalism. The theoretical section explains the basic terms {{that are related to}} the title of the essay. It explains the word supervision, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>professions,</b> supervision and its forms, objectives, methods and a supervision contract. The text also specifies who can submit supervision, which criteria the supervisor must fulfil and the relation between the supervisor and the supervised. The essay determines supervising methods (and techniques) used in selected institutions and reveals whether and how the supervisor allows for typology of the clients with whom the institution works. It also ascertains how the supervised persons perceive the supervisors. I specified three research issues: 1. What does supervision give to the supervised? 2. Do the supervisors apply different supervising methods according to the client's typology? 3. Does the supervisor heed typology of clients that are a target group of the given institution? In the practical section of the essay, I applied a form of qualitative research with regard to the specified objectives. For collection of data, I used a research method based on queries and an associated research method of semi-structured interviews. I appended the queries with an observation method. Eighteen persons participated in the interviews. Fifteen of the supervised persons came from three different institutions (a Charity Home for Mothers with Children, a Nursing Home in Havlíčkův Brod and an Institute of Social Care in Zboží) and three persons were supervisors, one from each institution. The essay may help to improve knowledge of persons with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>professions</b> on the supervision and facilitate supervision in various institutions with regard to the clients' typologies...|$|R

In addition,the physicians also need auxiliary informationto help them for checking imaging results.For example, the reading materials and the sharingexperiences fromthe seniors and their colleagues.

These may have a wide margin of error; cataract, trachoma, corneal involvement and glaucoma are the leading causes.

A programme to prevent blindness and control eye diseases has been developed and is being adopted in Zambia.
