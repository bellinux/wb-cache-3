In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required. Grossman believed that this benefited the game's writing, as he and Schafer [...] "were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together". Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised. Some of the dialogue was based on the designers' personal experiences, such as Guybrush's line [...] "I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms", which came from Schafer's own hatred of fungi.|$|E

2500|$|... 2-Iodomelatonin was {{synthesized}} in 1986 and its radioligand, 2--melatonin, {{has been}} useful in finding cellular targets of melatonin. Though the melatonin receptor wasn’t characterized and cloned {{in the human}} being until 1994 {{it was possible to}} start carrying out binding studies in various tissues before that time. As mentioned in the structure-activity relationship chapter above, certain groups are important for the activity. The most important groups are the 5-methoxy group and the acylaminoethyl side-chain, because they bind to and activate the receptors. The –NH group of the indole ring is not important for binding and activation. Therefore it is possible to replace it with other aromatic ring systems. The aromatic ring and the ethyl side-chain hold the correct distance between those two groups. The correct distance is the key to good binding and <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> type of aromatic ring system the analogue contains. Therefore it is possible to use different ring systems in melatonin receptor analogues, if the distance is right.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of individuals who}} become acutely infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) develop chronic infection and suffer from progressive liver damage while approximately 25 % are able to eliminate the virus spontaneously. Despite the recent introduction of new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), {{there is still no}} vaccine for HCV. As a result, new infections and reinfections will remain a problem in developing countries and among high risk populations like injection drug users (IDUs) who have limited access to treatment and who continue to be exposed to the virus. The outcome of acute HCV is determined by the interplay between the host genetics, the virus and the virus-specific immune response. Studies in humans and chimpanzees have demonstrated the essential role of HCV-specific CD 4 and CD 8 T cell responses in protection against viral persistence. Recent data suggest that antibody responses play a <b>more</b> <b>important</b> role <b>than</b> <b>what</b> was previously thought. Individuals who spontaneously resolve acute HCV infection develop long-lived memory T cells and are less likely to become persistently infected upon re-exposure. New studies examining high risk cohorts are identifying correlates of protection during real life exposures and reinfections. In this review, we discuss correlates of protective immunity during acute HCV and upon reexposure. We draw parallels between HCV and the current knowledge about protective memory in other models of chronic viral infections. Finally, we discuss some of the yet unresolved questions about key correlates of protection and their relevance for vaccine development against HCV...|$|R

I also state a hypothesis that scientific ethics are built around cardinal values, with the central ideas having been, throughout history, truth, utility and progress. The central theme of my argument is to show that with advances in technosciences and the ever increasing power of the market, we have 'changed worlds' and that we are now living in a world that I would label as 'a fragile, complex and uncertain world'. Therefore a new cardinal value is required; one that I call precaution. It is my view that it should replace the ideology of progress, and lay out a new method of growth, in particular a new relationship with nature, a new rationality, a new understanding of action. It is in this context alone that the principle of precaution may be understood for what it is: a profoundly innovative principle, for which I will illustrate the ethical dimensions.

40|$|In today’s highly {{competitive}} global economic environment, innovation {{has become the}} engine of business growth and sustainability. Recent years have witnessed two significant shifts {{in the pursuit of}} business growth and sustainability. The first shift centres on building networks of stakeholders (e. g. customers, suppliers, competitors, innovation intermediaries, etc.) for exploring and exploiting both internal and external resources to foster creativity and innovation. For example, P&G pursues a connect-and-develop strategy to create and leverage inputs from stakeholders for the generation of new ideas and new product development. Other firms increasingly rely on innovation intermediaries (e. g. Innocentive and NineSigma) to help transform their economics of innovation through rapid solution delivery and the development of sustainable open innovation programs. The second shift centres on developing business model innovation as a complement to product innovation.

6000|$|Another {{instance}} of the same illogicality I observed the other day at some kind of [...] "At Home." [...] I saw {{what appeared to be}} a human being dressed in a black evening-coat, black dress-waistcoat, and black dress-trousers, but with a shirt-front made of Jaegar wool. What can be the sense of this sort of thing? If a man thinks hygiene <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> convention (a selfish and heathen view, for the beasts that perish are more hygienic than man, and man is only above them because he is more conventional), if, I say, a man thinks that hygiene is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> convention, <b>what</b> on earth is there to oblige him to wear a shirt-front at all? But to take a costume of which the only conceivable cause or advantage is that it is a sort of uniform, and then not wear it in the uniform way--this is to be neither a Bohemian nor a gentleman. It is a foolish affectation, I think, in an English officer of the Life Guards never to wear his uniform if he can help it. But it would be more foolish still if he showed himself about town in a scarlet coat and a Jaeger breast-plate. It is the custom nowadays to have Ritual Commissions and Ritual Reports to make rather unmeaning compromises in the ceremonial of the Church of England. So perhaps we shall have an ecclesiastical compromise by which all the Bishops shall wear Jaeger copes and Jaeger mitres. Similarly the King might insist on having a Jaeger crown. But I do not think he will, for he understands the logic of the matter better than that. The modern monarch, like a reasonable fellow, wears his crown as seldom as he can; but if he does it at all, then the only point of a crown is that it is a crown. So let me assure the unknown gentleman in the woollen vesture that the only point of a white shirt-front is that it is a white shirt-front. Stiffness may be its impossible defect; but it is certainly its only possible merit.|$|R
