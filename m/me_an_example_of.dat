In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, {{he would have been}} recognised as my Master and I as his Pupil. He became, for <b>me,</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many times and I lived to see him broken but I never saw him bow." [...] He further wrote, [...] "Perhaps I should not say, flatly, what I believe – that he is a great painter – among the very greatest; but I do know that great art can only be created out of love, and that no greater lover has ever held a brush." ...|$|E

6000|$|That {{seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the human touch that Rochefoucauld never allows for, the natural goodness, pity, kindness, which can assert itself in {{contempt}} {{of the love}} of self, {{and the love of}} revenge. This is that true clemency which is a real virtue, and not [...] "the child of Vanity, Fear, Indolence, or of all three together." [...] Nor is it so true that [...] "we have all fortitude enough to endure the misfortunes of others." [...] Everybody has witnessed another's grief that came as near him as his own.|$|E
6000|$|She only {{smiled at}} that {{reckless}} forgetfulness of the promise, {{by which he}} had bound himself a few minutes since. [...] "What did you tell me," [...] she asked playfully, [...] "when you called yourself by hard names, and said you didn't deserve my love?" [...] Her smile vanished softly, and left only a look of tender entreaty in its place. [...] "Set <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> firmness, Ovid--don't leave it all to me! Remember what you have made me say. Remember"--she only hesitated for a moment--"remember what an interest I have in you now. I love you, Ovid. Say you will go." ...|$|E
60|$|During the week, Clara came {{twice to}} see me--escaping from home by stealth, as before. On each occasion, she showed the same affectionate anxiety to set <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> cheerfulness, and to sustain me in hope. I saw, with a sorrow and {{apprehension}} which I could not altogether conceal from her, that the weary {{look in her}} face had never changed, never diminished since I had first observed it. Ralph had, from motives of delicacy, avoided increasing the hidden anxieties which were but too evidently preying upon her health, by keeping her in perfect ignorance of our visit to the hospital, and, indeed, of the particulars of all our proceedings since his return. I took care to preserve the same secrecy, during her short interviews with me. She bade me farewell after her third visit, with a sadness which she vainly endeavoured to hide. I little thought, then, that the tones of her sweet, clear voice had fallen on my ear for the last time, before I wandered to the far West of England where I now write.|$|E

6000|$|Dorriforth. Could you, under Falstaff's {{pasteboard}} {{cheeks and}} the sad disfigurement of his mates? There was no excess of scenery, Auberon says. Why, Falstaff's very person {{was nothing but}} scenery. A false face, a false figure, false hands, false legs--scarcely a square inch on which the irrepressible humor of the rogue could break into illustrative touches. And he is so human, so expressive, of so rich a physiognomy. One would rather Mr. Beerbohm Tree should have played the part in his own clever, elegant slimness---that would at least have represented life. A Falstaff all [...] "make-up" [...] is an opaque substance. This seems to <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> what the rest still more suggested, that in dealing with a production like the [...] "Merry Wives" [...] really the main quality to put forward is discretion. You must resolve such a production, as a thing represented, into a tone that the imagination can take an aesthetic pleasure in. Its grossness must be transposed, as it were, to a fictive scale, a scale of fainter tints and generalized signs. A filthy, eruptive, realistic Bardolph and Pistol overlay the romantic with the literal. Relegate them and blur them, to the eye; let their blotches be constructive and their raggedness relative.|$|E
60|$|About this time--it {{would be}} in 1886--I came across a book called The Reminiscences of Judge Edmunds. He was a judge of the U.S. High Courts and a man of high standing. The book gave an account of how his wife had died, and how {{he had been able}} for many years {{to keep in touch with}} her. All sorts of details were given. I read the book with interest, and {{absolute}} scepticism. It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> how a hard practical man might have a weak side to his brain, a sort of reaction, as it were, against those plain facts of life with which he had to deal. Where was this spirit of which he talked? Suppose a man had an accident and cracked his skull; his whole character would change, and a high nature might become a low one. With alcohol or opium or many other drugs one could apparently quite change a man's spirit. The spirit then depended upon matter. These were the arguments which I used in those days. I did not realise that it was not the spirit that was changed in such cases, but the body through which the spirit worked, just as it would be no argument against the existence of a musician if you tampered with his violin so that only discordant notes could come through.|$|E

5000|$|A great {{influence}} on Baldwin was the painter Beauford Delaney. In The Price of the Ticket (1985), Baldwin describes Delaney as ...the first living proof, for me, {{that a black}} man could be an artist. In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, {{he would have been}} recognized as my teacher and I as his pupil. He became, for <b>me,</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many times and I lived to see him broken but I never saw him bow.|$|E

5000|$|Concreteness is {{an aspect}} of {{communication}} that means being specific, definite, and vivid rather than vague and general. A concrete communication uses specific facts and figures. Concreteness is often taught in college communication courses {{as one of the}} aspects of effective communication. Counselors, attorneys, job interviewers, etc. often prod their interviewees to speak with greater concreteness. For instance, if a witness says he gave his wife [...] "a bit of a slap," [...] the cross-examining lawyer might ask how hard he hit her. A job interviewer will often ask probing questions to elicit more concrete information; e.g., [...] "Could you give <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> when you did XXX?" ...|$|E
5000|$|When the Circle of Meaux {{was broken}} up in 1525, Roussel, {{like most of}} its members and unlike Guillaume Farel, stayed within the Catholic Church. He then became the {{personal}} preacher of Marguerite of Navarre, queen consort of Navarre under her patronage, he became bishop of the diocese of Oloron, within the kingdom of Navarre, in 1536. Jean Calvin addressed on this occasion a letter to Roussel, mostly condemnatory, {{in which he said}} :Calling to mind the [...] "former piety" [...] of Roussel, [...] "which I [...] formerly admired, and which was for <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> extreme worth", he called RousselCalvin ended his letter with a condemnation of Roussel's new position : ...|$|E

60|$|And {{all this}} didactic talk comes {{from looking at}} that old green cover of Poe. I am sure that if I had to name the few books which have really {{influenced}} my own life I should have to put this one second only to Macaulay's Essays. I read it young when my mind was plastic. It stimulated my imagination and set before <b>me</b> <b>a</b> supreme <b>example</b> <b>of</b> dignity and force in the methods of telling a story. It is not altogether a healthy influence, perhaps.

60|$|Everything on {{the stage}} is done far better than in real life. This is true of {{introduction}}s.

40|$|What is it, or {{what would}} it be, for a thought (or experience) to be self-reflexive —a thought (or experience) that was {{intrinsically}} about itself? Derek Parfit once suggested to <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the following sort. Alice has insomnia. She has trouble falling asleep {{and part of the}} problem is that she worries about it and realizes that her worrying about it tends to keep from falling asleep. It occurs to her that thinking that she will not be able to fall asleep may be a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. Perhaps she even has a thought that might be expressed like this: “I am not going to fall asleep because of my having this very thought. ” This thought (perhaps correctly) attributes to itself the property of keeping her awake. Could there be such a self-reflexive thought? Someone might suggest that there could not be such a thought, because the supposition that there could be such a thought leads to contradiction via a version of the liar paradox...|$|E
40|$|Guvenen, and Iourii Manovskii for the {{guidance}} they provided {{at each stage}} of this thesis.

5000|$|The story struck some audiences as ridiculous. They {{refused to}} believe that anyone, much less the {{handsome}} Giorgio, could come to love someone so manipulative and relentless, not to mention physically repellent, as Fosca. As the perennial banality would have it, they couldn't [...] "identify" [...] with the main characters. The violence of their reaction, however, strikes <b>me</b> as <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> [...] "The lady doth protest too much." [...] I think they may have identified with Giorgio and Fosca all too readily and uncomfortably. The idea of a love that's pure, that burns with D.H. Lawrence's gemlike flame, emanating from a source so gnarled and selfish, is hard to accept. Perhaps they were reacting {{to the realization that}} we are all Fosca, we are all Giorgio, we are all Clara.|$|R
