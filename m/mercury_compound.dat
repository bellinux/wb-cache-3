5|$|A {{review of}} the data showed that while the vaccine {{schedule}} for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards {{for the first six}} months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different <b>mercury</b> <b>compound</b> with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E
25|$|Vermilion, a toxic <b>mercury</b> <b>compound</b> favored for {{its deep}} red-orange color by old master {{painters}} such as Titian, {{has been replaced}} in painters' palettes by various modern pigments, including cadmium reds. Although genuine Vermilion paint can still be purchased for fine arts and art conservation applications, few manufacturers make it, because of legal liability issues. Few artists buy it, {{because it has been}} superseded by modern pigments that are both less expensive and less toxic, as well as less reactive with other pigments. As a result, genuine Vermilion is almost unavailable. Modern vermilion colors are properly designated as Vermilion Hue to distinguish them from genuine Vermilion.|$|E

25|$|The Chisso Minamata factory {{first started}} {{acetaldehyde}} production in 1932, producing 210tons that year. By 1951, production had jumped to 6,000tons {{per year and}} reached a peak of 45,245 tons in 1960. Throughout, the Chisso factory's output amounted to between a quarter {{and a third of}} Japan's total acetaldehyde production. The chemical reaction used to produce the acetaldehyde used mercury sulfate as a catalyst. Starting August 1951, the co-catalyst was changed from manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide. A side reaction of this catalytic cycle led to the production of a small amount of an organic <b>mercury</b> <b>compound,</b> namely methylmercury. This highly toxic compound was released into Minamata Bay from the change of the co-catalyst in 1951 until 1968, when this production method was discontinued.|$|E
500|$|From the mid-18th to {{the mid-19th}} centuries, {{a process called}} [...] "carroting" [...] {{was used in the}} making of felt hats. Animal skins were rinsed in an orange {{solution}} (the term [...] "carroting" [...] arose from this color) of the <b>mercury</b> <b>compound</b> mercuric nitrate, Hg(NO3)2·2H2O. This process separated the fur from the pelt and matted it together. This solution and the vapors it produced were highly toxic. The United States Public Health Service banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in December 1941. The psychological symptoms associated with mercury poisoning inspired the phrase [...] "mad as a hatter". Lewis Carroll's [...] "Mad Hatter" [...] in his book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was a play on words based on the older phrase, but the character himself does not exhibit symptoms of mercury poisoning.|$|E
500|$|Once {{copernicium}} is ionized, its chemistry {{may present}} several differences {{from those of}} zinc, cadmium, and mercury. Due to the stabilization of 7s electronic orbitals and destabilization of 6d ones caused by relativistic effects, Cn2+ {{is likely to have}} a 5f146d87s2 electronic configuration, using the 6d orbitals before the 7s one, unlike its homologues. The fact that the 6d electrons participate more readily in chemical bonding means that once copernicium is ionized, it may behave more like a transition metal than its lighter homologues, especially in the possible +4 oxidation state. In aqueous solutions, copernicium may form the +2 and perhaps +4 oxidation states. The diatomic ion , featuring mercury in the +1 oxidation state, is well-known, but the [...] ion is predicted to be unstable or even non-existent. Copernicium(II) fluoride, CnF2, should be more unstable than the analogous <b>mercury</b> <b>compound,</b> mercury(II) fluoride (HgF2), and may even decompose spontaneously into its constituent elements. In polar solvents, copernicium is predicted to preferentially form the [...] and [...] anions rather than the analogous neutral fluorides (CnF4 and CnF2, respectively), although the analogous bromide or iodide ions may be more stable towards hydrolysis in aqueous solution. The anions [...] and [...] should also be able to exist in aqueous solution. Nevertheless, more recent experiments have casted doubt on the possible existence of HgF4, and indeed more recent calculations suggest that both HgF4 and CnF4 are actually unbound and of doubtful existence. Analogous to mercury(II) cyanide (Hg(CN)2), copernicium is expected to form a stable cyanide, Cn(CN)2.|$|E

2500|$|Mercury {{occurs as}} salts such as mercuric {{chloride}} (HgCl2) and mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2), the latter {{also known as}} calomel. Because they are more soluble in water, mercuric salts are usually more acutely toxic than mercurous salts. Their higher solubility lets them be more readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. [...] Mercury salts affect primarily the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys, and can cause severe kidney damage; however, as they cannot cross the blood–brain barrier easily, these salts inflict little neurological damage without continuous or heavy exposure. Mercuric cyanide (Hg(CN)2) is a particularly toxic <b>mercury</b> <b>compound</b> {{that has been used}} in murders, as it contains not only mercury but also cyanide, leading to simultaneous cyanide poisoning.

40|$|Mercury is a toxic and non-essential {{metal in}} the human body. Mercury is ubiquitously {{distributed}} in the environment, present in nat-ural products, and exists extensively in items encountered in daily life. There are three forms of mercury, i. e., elemental (or metallic) <b>mercury,</b> inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds,</b> and organic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds.</b> This review examines the toxicity of elemental mercury and inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds.</b> Inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> are water soluble with a bioavailability of 7 % to 15 % after inges-tion; they are also irritants and cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Upon entering the body, inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> are accumu-lated mainly in the kidneys and produce kidney damage. In contrast, human exposure to elemental mercury is mainly by inhalation, followed by rapid absorption and distribution in all major organs. Elemental mercury from ingestion is poorly absorbed with a bio-availability of less than 0. 01 %. The primary target organs of elemental mercury are the brain and kidney. Elemental mercury is lipid sol-uble and can cross the blood-brain barrier, while inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> are not lipid soluble, rendering them unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Elemental mercury may also enter the brain from the nasal cavity through the olfactory pathway. The blood mercury is a useful biomarker after short-term and high-level exposure, whereas the urine mercury is the ideal biomarker for long-term exposure to both elemental and inorganic mercury, and also as a good indicator of body burden.
