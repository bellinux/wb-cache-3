SOII provides little incident-level detail that can help to guide MVC prevention initiatives.

30|$|For the {{discovery}} of industrial fields appropriate to the SMEs, the values of annual sales, CR 3, HHI, and CAGR {{should be taken into}} account synthetically. From this perspective, the subclass with the KSIC code 30392 (Manufacture of electrical equipment for motor vehicles) could not be listed in the industrial fields suitable to the SMEs because of its relatively high values of CR 3 (51, 53 and 50  %) and HHI (1163, 1239 and 1226) from 2010 to 2012 compared to those of other three subclasses (The KSIC code 26221, 30310, and 30320). According to the position of SMEs, it is possible for them to choose the appropriate fields through the following two ways. The first one is that the SMEs can select the industrial area with higher CAGR when their first consideration is in its growth potential. In this case, the subclass of the KSIC code 26221 (Manufacture of printed circuit boards) is able to become the best field by following the basic methodology of this study. On the other hand, the second one is that the SMEs preferentially consider the stable entrance to the initial market having lower value of HHI. For this objective, the SMEs can choose the subclasses of the KSIC code 30310 (Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor engines) and 30320 (Manufacture of parts and accessories for <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>body)</b> as their prospective areas through the selection procedure of SMEs-recommendable industry area from this research. Thus, the SMEs can discover the suitable fields by applying their realistic position and purpose to the basic methodology of this study.|$|E

40|$|Industries {{within this}} subsector produce {{equipment}} for transportation of passengers and cargo by land, air and water. Included are motor vehicles, aircraft, guided missiles, space vehicles, ships, boats, railroad equipment, motorcycles, bicycles, snowmobiles {{and numerous other}} conveyances. The significance of the Transportation Equipment industry is due, in large part, to its sizeable market share {{as well as the}} economic impact of the subsector in North America. In Tennessee, this industry provides a stable labor market with high skill employment at competitive wages. Most of this industry is concentrated in Central and Eastern Tennessee with facilities located in 90 out of the 95 Tennessee counties. As of 2007 there were 409 facilities. Emploment within the transportation equipment manufacturing sector exhibited nearly a twenty-eight percent (28 %) rate of growth rising from 46, 600 in 1991 to 59, 613 in 2007. The average annual wage in this industry was $ 49, 888 in 2007. From 2000 to 2006 the Transportation Equipment manufacturing industry increased its output from $ 4, 756, 000, 000 to $ 8, 213, 000, 000.

40|$|In this study, the {{relationship}} between the U. S. manufacturing and transportation industries was studied from economic and environmental life cycle sustainability perspective. The main objectives were 1) to quantify the life cycle impacts of national freight transportation activities that were triggered by the U. S. manufacturing industries and supply chains, a. k. a. manufacturing transportation nexus, and 2) assess the transportation-focused sustainability performance of manufacturing sectors based on eco-efficiency. Three environmental impact categories were focused, namely: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy use, and water withdrawals along with the economic outputs. To achieve the goals, a novel integrated methodology that consists of Economic Input-Output Life-Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized. The scope of the study consists of 276 U. S manufacturing sectors' economic and environmental impacts associated with four transportation modes including air, rail, truck, and water transportation. Based on EIO-LCA results, food manufacturing sector was found to be responsible for the highest environmental impacts and economic output with a share of over 20 % for GHG emissions, energy use, and water withdrawals and about 12 % for economic output. Motor vehicle manufacturing and <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>body,</b> trailer and parts manufacturing were found to have the second and third largest share of environmental impacts and economic output, respectively. From the result of the eco-efficiency analysis, ordinance and accessory manufacturing (0. 719) was found to have the highest and iron and steel mills manufacturing and agricultural chemical manufacturing (0. 130) were found to have the least eco-efficiency scores. It was also critical to address that a significant negative correlation was observed between the eco-efficiency and the ton-km transportation trends...|$|E

From the Statistics Korea and the KISTI Market Analysis and Prediction System (K-MAPS), the statistical data organized by the Korean Standard Industrial Classification (KSIC) were obtained to conduct this research through the following procedure. First of all, the numbers of enterprises and employees and the annual sales of all industries were investigated and the largest number of workers and the highest annual sales were found in the sector of manufacturing among all sectors of KSIC. Secondly, the top three divisions with the highest annual sales in all divisions of manufacturing sector were selected. Thirdly, the subclasses having high values of annual sales and SMEs proportions among all subclasses in the top three divisions of the previous step were chosen as the candidates of SMEs-recommendable fields. Fourthly, the degree of market concentration was analyzed by using three-firm concentration ratio (CR 3) and Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) of the selected subclasses. Finally, the study for growth potential of chosen subclasses was performed through the analysis of compound annual growth rate (CAGR). After the overall process of this study was carried out with the synthetic consideration of the above-mentioned factors, the three subclasses of KSIC as industrial areas suitable to the SMEs could be found: (1) Manufacture of printed circuit boards, (2) Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor engines, and (3) Manufacture of parts and accessories for <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>body.</b> From this result, {{it was found that the}} values of annual sales, CR 3, HHI, and CAGR can be very useful factors to discover the recommendable industry fields to the SMEs.|$|E
