5|$|More recent investigations, mainly {{based on}} {{original}} medical {{reports from the}} period of the pandemic, found that the viral infection itself was not <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> any previous influenza, but that the special circumstances (malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, poor hygiene) promoted bacterial superinfection that killed most of the victims typically after a somewhat prolonged death bed.|$|E
5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E

5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E
5|$|Back in 1959 a Laotian Lieutenant Colonel of the {{minority}} Hmong tribe had been taken under the wing of the CIA effort in Laos. The highland Hmong were <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> the lowland Lao and Vang Pao was quickly elevated to their leadership in hopes of creating a paramilitary force that would counter the Pathet Lao in the northeast. During 1961, the first weapons were delivered to the Hmong and their training was begun. Nine CIA specialists, nine U.S. Army Special Forces personnel, and 99 Thai members of the Police Aerial Reconnaissance Unit (PARU) participated in the training and equipping of {{what became known as}} the Armée Clandestine or the secret army.|$|E
5|$|Reported to be <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> other stingarees, the sparsely-spotted stingaree readily employs its venomous sting if {{disturbed}} and can inflict {{a painful}} injury on a human. It is edible, but seldom brought to market. Fishing pressure is insignificant across {{large portions of}} this ray's range, including in the Great Australian Bight, though substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries off southeastern and southwestern Australia in beach seines and bottom trawls. The sparsely-spotted stingaree generally survives being captured, sorted, and discarded, though the process often causes it to abort any unborn young. Nevertheless, losses to fisheries appear to be sustainable at present, and thus the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern. There {{are a number of}} small Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within its range, and it would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E

5|$|The {{disagreements}} between Edward and the French Crown {{over the}} Duchy of Gascony {{led to the}} War of Saint-Sardos in 1324. Charles, Edward's brother-in-law, had become King of France in 1322, and was <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> his predecessors. In 1323, he insisted that Edward come to Paris to give homage for Gascony, and demanded that Edward's administrators in Gascony allow French officials there to carry out orders given in Paris. Matters {{came to a head}} in October when a group of Edward's soldiers hanged a French sergeant for attempting to build a new fortified town in the Agenais, a contested section of the Gascon border. Edward denied any responsibility for this incident, but relations between Edward and Charles soured. In 1324, Edward dispatched the Earl of Pembroke to Paris to broker a solution, but the earl died suddenly of an illness along the way. Charles mobilised his army and ordered the invasion of Gascony.|$|E

50|$|Statistics may {{sometimes}} show more favorable outcomes for <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> stages <b>than</b> for less <b>aggressive</b> stages, {{which may be}} caused by <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> treatment and/or random variability in the study groups.

25|$|In addition, a {{study on}} Chilean {{flamingos}} (Phoenicopterus chilensis) found that birds in a bond were much <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> single birds. The paired birds {{were significantly more likely}} to start an agonistic encounter in defense of their mate or young whereas single birds were typically non-breeding and less likely to fight. Not all flamingos can mate in the population because of an unsuitable sex ratio or some dominant flamingos mating with multiple partners. Mates are a fiercely contested resource in many species as the production of offspring is essential for an individual to propagate its genes.|$|E
25|$|The main French (and Israeli) battle tank, the AMX-13, was {{designed}} for mobile, outflanking operations, {{which led to a}} tank that was lightly armoured but very fast. General André Beaufre, who served as Stockwell's subordinate, favoured a swift campaign of movement in which the main objective was to encircle the enemy. Throughout the operation, Beaufre proved himself to be <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> his British counterparts, always urging that some bold step be taken at once. The French Navy had a powerful carrier force which was excellent for projecting power inland, but, like its British counterpart, suffered from a lack of landing craft.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{have for}} a long time been {{interested}} in the relationship between testosterone and aggressive behavior. In most species, males are <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> females. Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on aggressive behavior in males. In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The involvement in crime usually rises in the early teens to mid teens which happen {{at the same time as}} testosterone levels rise. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is difficult since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by a lumbar puncture which is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have often instead used more unreliable measurements from blood or saliva.|$|E

25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{different}} qualities are detected in first impressions {{may be linked to}} what has been important to survival from an evolutionary perspective. For example, trustworthiness and attractiveness were the two traits most quickly detected and evaluated in a study of human faces. People are fairly good at assessing personality traits of others in general, but {{there appears to be a}} difference in first impression judgments between older and younger adults. Older adults judged young adult target photos as healthier, more trustworthy, and less hostile, but <b>more</b> <b>aggressive,</b> <b>than</b> younger adults did of the same photos. Older adults could have a lower response to negative cues due to a slower processing speed, causing them to see facial features on young adults as more positive than younger adults do.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo rats are {{generally}} solitary animals with little social organization. Kangaroo rats communicate during competitive interactions and courtship. They do cluster together in some feeding situations. Groups of kangaroo rats that exist are aggregations and colonies. There {{appears to be}} a dominance hierarchy among male kangaroo rats in competition for access to females. Male kangaroo rats {{are generally}} <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> females and are more dominant over them. Females are more tolerant of each other than males are and have more non-aggressive interactions. This is likely in part because the home ranges of females overlap less than the home ranges of males. Linear dominance hierarchies appear to exist among males but it is not known {{if this is the case}} for females. Winners of aggressive encounters appear to be the most active individuals.|$|E
25|$|Moose often show {{aggression}} {{to other}} animals as well; especially predators. Bears are common predators of moose calves and, rarely, adults. Alaskan moose {{have been reported}} to successfully fend off attacks from black bears, brown bears and grizzlies. Moose have been known to stomp attacking wolves, which makes them less preferred as prey to the wolves. Moose are fully capable of killing bears and wolves. A moose of either sex that is confronted by danger may let out a loud roar, more resembling that of a predator than a prey animal. European moose are often <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> North American moose, such as the moose in Sweden, which often become very agitated {{at the sight of a}} predator. However, like all ungulates known to attack predators, the more aggressive individuals are always darker in color.|$|E

25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} {{has been}} applied to explain criminal or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing, and this is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and be violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.|$|E
25|$|Receptor status. Breast {{cancer cells}} have receptors on their surface {{and in their}} {{cytoplasm}} and nucleus. Chemical messengers such as hormones bind to receptors, and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells {{may or may not}} have three important receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2. ER+ cancer cells (that is, cancer cells that have estrogen receptors) depend on estrogen for their growth, so they can be treated with drugs to block estrogen effects (e.g. tamoxifen), and generally have a better prognosis. Untreated, HER2+ breast cancers are generally <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> HER2- breast cancers, but HER2+ cancer cells respond to drugs such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (in combination with conventional chemotherapy), and this has improved the prognosis significantly. Cells that do not have any of these three receptor types (estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or HER2) are called triple-negative, although they frequently do express receptors for other hormones, such as androgen receptor and prolactin receptor.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{constantly}} recurring claims of radical differences in behaviour and biology, a single annual breeding cycle, seasonal adapted oestrus, monogamy, parental care by the males, {{regulation of breeding}} via ecological and social factors, and howling have all been observed among domestic dogs of most diverse backgrounds. Howling is considered normal for all wild dogs of Australia. Hybrids {{as well as other}} domestic dogs have been observed in tight pack structures and free-ranging domestic dogs in Southeast-Australia have been observed hunting and foraging in groups. Free-ranging dogs in Victoria were generally observed in pairs (54%) or alone (34%), with packs of three to seven dogs in 12% of the sightings. Furthermore, there are also reports of dingoes with more than average size and weight and cases where hybrids were successfully used as working and companion dogs and the Australian Cattle Dog was proven to have dingo ancestors. A generally higher aggression of hybrids could not be confirmed by owners, who worked with respectively investigated them; furthermore hitherto observations and encounters with hybrids in the wild did not reveal any evidence, that hybrids are generally <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> “pure” dingoes.|$|E
