5|$|The CFM56-5A {{series is}} the initial CFM56-5 series, {{designed}} {{to power the}} short-to-medium range Airbus A320 family. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500lbf (98kN and 118kN). Aerodynamic improvements such as an updated fan, low-pressure compressor, high-pressure compressor and combustor make this variant 10–11% <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> efficient than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Airbus began {{development}} of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> efficiency, the B9 {{was seen as a}} viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.|$|E
50|$|In {{the present}} context the {{definition}} of co-firing could be: The use together of two (or <b>more)</b> <b>fuels,</b> the primary being fossil and the secondary from another source (renewable or residual), in a boiler originally designed for fossil fuel, either using the original combustion system or additional devices.|$|R
5|$|The voyage {{taught the}} Navy <b>more</b> <b>fueling</b> {{stations}} were needed around the world, and the strategic {{potential of the}} Panama Canal, which was completed in 1914. The Great White Fleet required almost 50 coaling ships, and during the cruise most of the fleet's coal was purchased from the British, who could deny access to fuel during a military crisis {{as they did with}} Russia during the Russo-Japanese War.|$|R
50|$|Murphy USA {{operates}} over 1,400 retail fueling stations in 26 US states. Over 1,100 locations are located within close proximity of Walmart locations, while over 240 locations are stand alone, {{also known as}} Murphy Express stores. Murphy USA locations vary from small kiosk locations to larger walk-in convenience stores. Murphy Express locations are typically large format locations (1,200-3,400+ square feet) that offer a larger array of products and <b>more</b> <b>fueling</b> lanes.|$|R
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into threeparts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated. The second qualifying period lasted for 15minutes, {{at the end of}} which the fastest ten cars went into the final period, to determine their grid positions for the race. Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race but those competing in it were not, and so carried <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> than they had done in the earlier qualifying sessions.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen nuclear {{reactors}} produce about 3% of India’s electricity, and seven more are under construction. Spent fuel is processed at facilities in Trombay near Mumbai, at Tarapur {{on the west}} coast north of Mumbai, and at Kalpakkam on the southeast coast of India. Plutonium will be used in a fast breeder reactor (under construction) to produce <b>more</b> <b>fuel,</b> and other waste vitrified at Tarapur and Trombay. Interim storage for 30 years is expected, with eventual disposal in a deep geological repository in crystalline rock near Kalpakkam.|$|E

5|$|The Toy Train minigame {{involves}} {{laying a}} railroad track across a complex game board. The toy train must pass through every train station and reach a defined end point, and in harder levels, {{it must be}} timed to avoid cars and other trains. The toy train requires fuel to move, limiting the amount of track that can be placed by a player unless <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> is collected before a track ends.|$|E
5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> to remain in equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|The new 3-litre engines under {{development}} by competing team Ferrari had 12 cylinders. Jack Brabham, owner and lead driver of BRO, {{took a different}} approach to the problem of obtaining a suitable engine. He persuaded Australian company Repco to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him, largely based on available components; the engine would produce less power than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> efficient.|$|E
50|$|<b>More</b> fossil <b>fuel</b> {{is needed}} to build hybrid {{vehicles}} than conventional cars but reduced emissions when running the vehicle more than outweigh this.|$|R
50|$|Co-firing (also {{referred}} to as complementary firing or co-combustion) is the combustion of two different fuels in the same combustion system. Fuels can be solid fuels, liquid fuels or gaseous, and its source either fossil or renewable. Therefore, use of heavy fuel oil assisting coal power stations may technically be considered co-firing. However the term co-firing {{is used in the}} present technological framework to designate combined combustion of two (or <b>more)</b> <b>fuels</b> sustained in time, as a normal daily practice.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{co-firing}} is quite simple. It consists {{in the use}} of two or <b>more</b> <b>fuels</b> inside the same combustion device. It is applicable to all kind of combustion systems traditionally used for power generation (pulverized fuel, fluidized bed combustion and grate firing). Co-firing in cement kilns is already a quite widespread solution for valorization of waste materials mostly, as well as for biomass. The iron industry (blast furnace) and domestic sector (coal stoves) are also sectors where co-firing could be implemented.|$|R
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} Saturday afternoon was split into threeparts. The first part ran for 20minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 16th or lower. The {{second part of}} qualifying lasted 15minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions11 to 15. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} refuel before the race, and as such carried <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> than in the previous sessions.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
5|$|The German Navy {{placed an}} order for 22 Sea King Mk.41s on 20 June 1969 as a {{replacement}} for the Grumman Albatross flying boat in the Search and Rescue Role. This was the first export sale for the Westland Sea King, and was the first dedicated Search and Rescue Sea King variant, with an enlarged cabin and <b>more</b> <b>fuel.</b> The German Sea Kings had similar radar and navigation equipment to the HAS.1, but was not fitted with sonar. The 22 Sea Kings were delivered between April 1973 and September 1974, equipping Marinefliegergeschwader 5 (MFG 5) (Naval Air Wing 5). An additional Sea King was delivered in April 1975 to replace one destroyed in a gale. The surviving Sea Kings were upgraded between 1986 and 1988, adding the capability to carry Sea Skua anti-ship missiles, which required the addition of a Ferranti Seaspray radar in a nose radome.|$|E

5|$|The reactor was {{powered up}} successfully, {{but after a}} few hours the power level dropped and the reactor shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, rather than a {{radioactive}} poison. However, during the night the operators were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison. After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron cross section of the poison, {{which turned out to be}} xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they managed to get the reactor started.|$|E
50|$|Fuel surrogates are {{mixtures}} {{of one or}} <b>more</b> simple <b>fuels</b> {{that are designed to}} emulate either the physical properties (vapor pressure) or combustion properties (laminar flame speed, heating value, etc.) of a <b>more</b> complex <b>fuel.</b> While surrogate mixtures can demonstrate more than one characteristic of the desired <b>fuel,</b> <b>more</b> often than not different components are required in order to emulate the wide variety of properties that are of interest to researchers. Jet fuel {{is an example of a}} fuel requiring a surrogate for experimental research and numerical modelling due to its complexity and high content variability from one batch to the next. Neat hydrocarbon jet fuel surrogate components include decane, dodecane, methylcyclohexane, and toluene. Gasoline surrogate components include n-heptane and iso-octane. Hexadecane is a diesel surrogate component. Biodiesel surrogate components include methyl butyrate and methyl decanoate.|$|R

5|$|During {{the design}} process, the A318 {{encountered}} several problems. The {{first one was}} the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept {{it in the same}} class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the planned refit of HMS Eagle {{to allow her to}} operate the Phantom, a total of 20 airframes that had originally been ordered for the Fleet Air Arm were diverted to the Royal Air Force to serve in the air defence role. At the time, the RAF's primary interceptor was the English Electric Lightning, which suffered badly both in terms of range, loiter time and weapons fit, all of which hampered its effectiveness, especially in long interceptions of Soviet Air Forces and Soviet Naval Aviation bombers and reconnaissance aircraft over the North Sea and North Atlantic. So a new Phantom squadron was formed at RAF Leuchars, the UK's most northerly air defence base at the time, {{to take advantage of the}} improvements that the Phantom provided over the Lightning – it could carry <b>more</b> <b>fuel,</b> and could thus fly further for longer; it was fitted with a more powerful radar; and it could carry more missiles (up to 8, compared to 2 for the Lightning). On 1 September 1969, 43 Squadron was formed at Leuchars, operating as part of the UK's northern QRA zone alongside the Lightnings of 11 Squadron and 23 Squadron until, in 1972, 11Squadron was redeployed to join 5 Squadron at RAF Binbrook and was replaced by the Royal Navy Phantoms of the Phantom Training Flight (PTF) and 892 Naval Air Squadron.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002, after {{airlines}} expressed {{reservations about}} {{its emphasis on}} speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20percent <b>more</b> <b>fuel</b> efficient. The new jetliner was {{the first stage of}} a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.|$|E
