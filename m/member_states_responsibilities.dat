40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} often-voiced {{concern that the}} {{expanding}} activities of international organizations lead to an 'accountability gap' {{in the sense that}} if potentially harmful activities are carried out through an international organization, neither the organization nor its <b>member</b> <b>States</b> can effectively be held to account. Many international organizations are only beginning to establish procedural remedies through which the lawfulness of their activities can be reviewed. In the absence of a direct remedy against the organization, third parties often try to hold the <b>member</b> <b>States</b> responsible in relation to the organization's activities. This thesis investigates under what circumstances <b>member</b> <b>States</b> can be held responsible for wrongful conduct taken within the framework of an international organization. It deals comprehensively with the attribution of conduct in multilateral contexts, with complicity as a ground of <b>member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsibility,</b> with reparation for injuries committed by multiple responsible parties and with the judicial enforcement of <b>member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsibility.</b> In doing so, it demonstrates how with the transposition of the rules on international responsibility to the context of international organizations, certain rules of <b>State</b> <b>responsibility,</b> well-established in an exclusively inter-State context, have been opened up to fundamental questions. The separate legal personality of international organizations can in fact be seen as creating an 'institutional veil' which makes it more difficult to 'see through' and hold States responsible for their conduct qua members. This thesis argues that the possibility of holding <b>member</b> <b>States</b> responsible for unlawful conduct taken within the framework of international organizations not only counters the risk that States could use them as vehicles to carry out unlawful acts, but that it also serves as an incentive for <b>member</b> <b>States</b> to create better procedural remedies against their international organizations. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article {{looks into}} the role of <b>member</b> <b>States</b> as {{governors}} of international organizations and explores the legal constraints imposed thereof {{for the purposes of the}} establishment of international responsibility. At its foundation lies the quest for an international legal order that effectively protects the interests of those affected by institutional operations. To set the scene for the discussion, the article begins by noting how, in adhering to international organizations, (<b>member)</b> <b>States</b> retain sovereign powers which assume the crucial function of steering their oversight duties over institutional operations. Embracing a constitutionalist paradigm, the article moves on to argue that the principles of representativeness and responsiveness must inform <b>member</b> <b>State</b> conduct as creators and participants in institutional undertakings. The procedural implications of these principles are subsequently explored by resorting to due diligence as a standard to evaluate <b>member</b> <b>State</b> behaviour and thereby implement <b>member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsibility.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|It {{is noted}} that {{legislation}} concerning eHealth and teleradiology {{services in the}} EU is very complex. The EU takes steps to harmonise national legislation {{in the area of}} eHealth. As stated in the treaties of the EU, healthcare follows the principle of subsidiarity [33]. It is the <b>Member</b> <b>State’s</b> <b>responsibility</b> to decide on the organisation and delivery of their health services and medical care. Definition of medical acts is a matter for the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> as well. As a general principle, the classification of specific telemedicine services as medical acts should ensure that these meet the same level of requirements as equivalent non-telemedicine services (e.g. teleradiology vs radiology). This principle ensures that adequately regulated health services are not replaced by less well-regulated telemedicine services and it avoids discrimination between providers of the same service, which would be incompatible with the Directive on Electronic Commerce [1, 20].|$|R
40|$|There is a {{fundamental}} contradiction {{at the core of}} health policy in the EU that makes it difficult to draw a line between EU and <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> This raises a number of difficult questions for policy makers and practitioners as they struggle to interpret both 'hard' and 'soft' laws at EU and <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> level and to reconcile tensions between economic and social imperatives in health care. The book addresses these complex questions by combining analysis of the underlying issues with carefully chosen case studies that illustrate how broader principles are played out in practice. Each chapter addresses a topical area in which there is considerable debate and potential uncertainty. The book thus offers a comprehensive discussion of a number of current and emerging governance issues in EU health policy, including regulatory, legal, 'new governance' and policy-making dynamics, and the application of the legal framework in these areas...|$|R

Against this background, the paper explores the opportunities for introducing effective systems of regionalisation through a series of questions concerning methodological approaches (best practice v first principles), how we construe the concepts of region and regionalisation, where to draw the boundaries between Commission and <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> and what do we want our systems to achieve. Four models are posited: an in-house solution (comitology); dispersal of DG staff to the regions; a standing conference of <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> administrations; and a newly styled RAC.

40|$|This article re-examines externalisation – direct {{migration}} {{control by}} <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> of the EU, within third states, i. e., States {{which are not}} members of the EU. The {{nature and extent of}} this control is considered. The instruments of externalisation examined are carrier sanctions and immigration liaison officers. <b>State</b> <b>responsibility</b> for these externalised migration controls is assessed. The jurisdiction of the ECtHR is the trigger for <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsibility.</b> ECtHR jurisprudence {{has made it clear that}} it is the exercise of physical power and control over a person by the State, which is pivotal to deciding jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is engaged where the Court finds that physical power and control to have been ‘effective’. This threshold of ‘effective’ control which has emerged from the Court’s jurisprudence is a demanding hurdle. If State control is found to be ‘effective’, then the State is responsible for the full range of rights contained within the Convention. The question then stands whether or not the ECtHR can keep abreast with these controls which can lead to States evading jurisdiction and thus avoiding fundamental rights responsibilities. One possible interpretation of recent jurisprudence is that the ECtHR is moving toward a broader interpretation of jurisdiction. It is in this context that ‘externalised’ controls have come under renewed scrutiny. A prevailing opinion is that the ECtHR will be able to protect those asylum seekers who encounter externalised control. This article questions any such assumption. The author argues for an alternative reading of the jurisprudence of the ECtHR with regard to jurisdiction. The conclusion reached is that the hurdle of extraterritorial jurisdiction is so demanding that States avoid it despite exercising extensive control over migrants. It is asserted that despite this considerable control, examination by the ECtHR will result in a failure to satisfy the ‘effective’ control threshold. Responsibility can thus be avoided while extraterritorial control is retained. The control level held by the State is still capable of guaranteeing a denial of access to individuals in need of international protection. If jurisdiction is not engaged then this externalised migration control represents a divergence between State control and <b>State</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Taking the threshold for jurisdiction of the ECtHR as a starting point, the author suggests a distinction between externalisation on the one hand and the external dimension on the other. States, oftentimes with facilitation from the Union, pursue one of these two alternatives. Externalisation affords the State stronger and more direct control over the entry of the migrant into the territory of a <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> than the external dimension, where the control is indirect and weaker. This distinction allows for a refined understanding of externalisation and applies it to verifying <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsibility</b> for externalised migration control...|$|R

40|$|Situated as the {{cornerstone}} of the Common European Asylum System, the EU’s Dublin system functions as the legal mechanism for determining <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the processing of asylum claims. Controversial from inception, it has been subject to extensive criticism that speaks not only to the distributional inequalities that it produces among the <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> but also to its potentially detrimental impact on the human rights of asylum seekers. Despite these problems, however, the core features of the system as originally agreed in the 1990 Dublin Convention have remained remarkably resilient over the course of two reforms – one in 2003, and one in 2013. At the same time, the EU’s governance landscape as it pertains to asylum policy-making has undergone a marked transformation. While Dublin I was the product of intergovernmentalism, both Dublin II and Dublin III were negotiated as part of the EU acquis communitaire, the former following the partial communitarisation of asylum policy-making and the latter following its full communitarisation. Though the specific changes to the institutional features of policymaking that this transition has entailed have been both theoretically expected and empirically proven to {{have a positive effect on}} EU policy output, the overall stability of the Dublin system in the face of these changes leaves it unclear as to what extent the ‘promise of communitarisation’ has been delivered in this particular case. How then do we explain the perseverance of a system that has not only failed to provide adequate standards of protection to those seeking it within EU borders, but which has also continually disadvantaged some of the very <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> party to its terms? And what impact, if any, has the communitarisation of asylum policy-making had on the attempts at its reform? This research traces the evolution of the Dublin system from its initial formation through to its current state, by analysing the negotiations that produced each of the three Dublin agreements in order to explain both the system’s emergence and its on-going stability. Using a rational choice institutionalist framework, it finds that the Dublin system’s endurance can ultimately be credited to the deliberate choices that have been made by both the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and the EU’s supranational institutions in pursuit of their preferences (bolstered or weakened by their relative strength of position) in the context of the (either empowering or constraining) institutional settings within which the reform negotiations took place...|$|R

More precisely, it examines {{the extent to which}} the European Union and its <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> bear <b>responsibility</b> for the violations of an international agreement committed as a consequence of the implementation of EU Law. The specific features of the multilevel system implementation of EU Law poses a series of very interesting questions as regards the EU’s relations with its <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and their <b>responsibility</b> under International Law. The EU primarily implements its law through its Member States’ authorities. As such, should the EU bear responsibility for a violation committed by a <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> organ because it was implementing EU Law? Should a <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> which, in complying with a piece of EU legislation, violated an international obligation be held liable? This thesis examines these questions from a practical perspective. It examines how international bodies approach the issue. In this regard, the thesis sets out to examine whether there is a common thread in the way international courts and tribunals deal with the EU’s international responsibility. The thesis is structured in four parts.

40|$|This {{issue is}} {{the outcome of a}} {{workshop}} on "Governance of Migration in the EU: Home Affairs or External Policy?" organised at the European University Institute on 19 October 2012. Article 79 TFEU contains competences of the European Union to regulate immigration {{as an integral part of}} the area of freedom, security and justice. Under this purely internal competence, the Union should establish a common immigration policy aimed at the efficient management of migration flows, fair treatment of third-country nationals and fight against illegal immigration. Over the past decade, the Union has adopted a number of directives under this internal competence. Yet, both prior to the introduction of an explicit Union power to regulate immigration and currently in parallel with this power, the Union and <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> implement immigration policy externally via international agreements with third states and more subtle policy tools. The purpose of this workshop is to break with the conventional understanding of immigration as an internal policy of the Union and to look at EU’s immigration policy form the outside, discussing immigration as an external, as opposed to internal, policy of the Union. The contributors test the external component of immigration as a tool in market integration, trade liberalization, development, foreign policy and promotion of mobility. The underlying assumption is that the nature of the policy, objectives, powers and instruments may differ and conflict with each other depending on whether immigration policy is shaped internally or externally. The presentations offer a multidisciplinary analysis of the role of migration governance in the EU and the role of the Union in migration governance globally. -KOCHAROV, Anna - Governance of migration in the EU : home affairs or foreign policy?, pp. 239 – 243 -JACOBSSON, Johanna - Liberalisation of service mobility in the EU's international trade agreements : as external as it gets, pp. 245 – 261 -GARCÍA ANDRADE, Paula - The legal feasibility of the EU’s External Action on legal migration : the internal and the external intertwined, pp. 263 – 281 -PAPAGIANNI, Georgia - Forging an External EU Migration Policy: From Externalisation of Border Management to a Comprehensive Policy?, pp. 283 – 299 -KORNEEV, Oleg - EU migration governance in Central Asia : everybody’s business – nobody’s business?, pp. 301 – 318 -MC NAMARA, Frank - <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsibility</b> for migration control within third states : externalisation revisited, pp. 319 – 33...|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction. Throughout the EU, {{policy makers}} and voters are {{uncertain}} about the best way forward for policies on asylum, immigration, and immigrant integration. The number of asylum seekers who enter the EU irregularly has declined sharply from its peak in late 2015, offering a much-needed respite to over-stretched reception systems in the few EU countries that have received most asylum seekers. However, the policies that brought about this reduction – mainly, the EU’s agreement with Turkey to curb irregular migration and the closure of land borders in the Western Balkans to irregular migrants – {{will be difficult to}} sustain. It is not clear how the humanitarian emergencies that currently afflict migrants in Greece and the Western Balkans can be addressed without encouraging a resurgence of irregular immigration. It will also be difficult to implement similar measures along the central Mediterranean migrant route from Libya to Italy, where the number of new arrivals has been roughly constant for several years, and there is no other country on that route that could conceivably host refugees to the extent that Turkey does. Finally, there is no viable reform in sight for the EU asylum system (the ‘Dublin’ regulations) to ensure that EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> share <b>responsibility</b> for hosting refugees more equitably...|$|R
40|$|This {{special issue}} is {{concerned}} with re-imagining the protection of vulnerable non-citizens, asking whether effective protection can be achieved within existing statist frameworks, or whether more radical institutional imaginations are required. To this end, this article argues {{that in spite of}} the limitations of the state system, the durability of state authority over protection requires us to engage, albeit imaginatively, with it. The article focuses in particular on the current refugee ‘crisis’. The lack of an effective response can be understood as a crisis of imagination, which is symptomatic of a wider protection crisis in which neither states nor the international community seem able to respond effectively to chronic conflict or protracted displacement. The article proceeds in three stages. First, it sets the context, outlining the recent failure of the European Union (EU) to implement its decisions on relocation of refugees from Italy and Greece to other <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> The second section of the article seeks to understand these failings, and to consider the future possibility of the EU and its <b>member</b> <b>states</b> taking <b>responsibility</b> for the protection of refugees. The final section of the article examines the possibilities for reimagining protection on more cosmopolitan lines in the light of current failings. The article argues in conclusion that while on the one hand, the prospects for protection look bleak, the constitutive role of political will also represents a condition of possibility. The conclusion further points to the implications for articulating ‘concrete utopias’ or more ‘embedded’ visions of cosmopolitanism. Peer-reviewedPre-prin...|$|R
40|$|The book {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of the principle of free movement and places a special emphasis on the notion of boundaries that limit such freedom. The primary purpose of the investigation is to assess whether a satisfying concept and legal explanation may be provided for the broad interpretation given by the European Court of Justice in matters of free movement with respect to the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The author insists on {{the emergence of a new}} constitutional dimension in which <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> have considerable <b>responsibilities</b> to the citizens of the Union, as citizens rather than mere economic actors. Relevant aspects such as: the processing of the term of discrimination, the notion of non-discriminatory barrier, non-discriminatory barriers to the right of residence and free circulation of workers, the shortcomings of the access to the market are also included in the book...|$|R
40|$|The law of {{international}} responsibility, as currently devised, {{does not offer}} a consistent analytical framework to assess <b>member</b> <b>State</b> participation in International Organisations. Inescapably, {{this state of affairs}} runs counter to an effective human rights protection and hampers individual attempts to obtain reparation for damage, or the risk thereof, caused by wrongdoing <b>member</b> <b>States.</b> Using International Financial Institutions as case studies, the investigation will attempt to devise the contours of a legal regime whereby <b>State</b> <b>responsibility</b> may be invoked for conduct performed in an institutional setting. In this way, the study aims to offer a concrete contribution to the understanding of how <b>member</b> <b>States</b> may secure their international (human rights) obligations after having transferred competences to an International Organisation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Health is an {{important}} priority for Europeans. We expect to be protected against illness and disease. We want to bring up our children in a healthy environment, and demand that our workplace is safe and hygienic. When travelling within the European Union, we need access to reliable and high-quality health advice and assistance. The <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> have a <b>responsibility</b> to ensure that these concerns are reflected in their policies, but, although the EU doesn't usually intend to make health policy but in practice other policies often {{to do with the}} union's origins as a free market affect health care. Thus, the EU complements the national health policies and has a vital role to play through the obligations placed on it by the European Treaties, bringing European added value through its action to the EU sustainable development strategy. For these reasons, the present paper will focus on the EU’s Health Policy and the related strategies to achieve its goals...|$|R
