5|$|The Perseids are a {{prominent}} annual <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> {{that appear to}} radiate from Perseus from mid-July, peaking in activity between 9 and 14 August each year. Associated with Comet Swift–Tuttle, they have been observed for about 2,000 years. The September Epsilon Perseids, discovered in 2012, are a <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> with an unknown parent body in the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|During November, the Taurid <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> {{appears to}} radiate {{from the general}} {{direction}} of this constellation. The Beta Taurid <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> occurs during the months of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques. Between 18 and 29 October, both the Northern Taurids and the Southern Taurids are active; though the latter stream is stronger. However, between November 1 and 10, the two streams equalize.|$|E

5|$|The Ursids, a {{prominent}} <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> {{that occurs in}} Ursa Minor, peaks between December 18 and 25. Its parent body is the comet 8P/Tuttle.|$|E
5|$|The Coma Berenicids <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> peaks around 18 January. Despite the shower's low {{intensity}} (averaging {{one or two}} meteors per hour) its meteors {{are some}} of the fastest, with speeds up to 65km/s (40 mps).|$|E
5|$|Discovered by Dick McCloskey and Annette Posen of the Harvard Meteor Program in 1959, the Leonis Minorid <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> peaks between October18 and October29.

5|$|The September Lyncids are a minor <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> {{that appears}} around 6 September. They were {{historically}} more prominent, described as such by Chinese observers in 1037 and 1063, and Korean astronomers in 1560. The Alpha Lyncids {{were discovered in}} 1971 by Malcolm Currie, and appear between 10 December and 3 January.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{runs through}} the constellation, {{featuring}} prominent objects such as the open cluster NGC 5823 and the planetary nebula NGC 5315. Circinus hosts a spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way. The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.|$|E
40|$|The {{forecasting}} of <b>meteor</b> <b>showers</b> {{is currently}} {{very good at}} predicting the timing of meteor outbursts, but still needs further work regarding {{the level of a}} given shower. Moreover, uncertainties are rarely provided, leaving the end user (scientist, space agency or the public) with no way to evaluate how much the prediction is trustworthy. A confidence index for the forecasting of <b>meteor</b> <b>showers</b> is presented. It allows one to better understand how a specific forecasting has been performed. In particular, it underlines the role of our current knowledge of the parent body, its past orbit and past activity. The role of close encounters with planets for the time period considered is quantified as well. This confidence index is a first step towards better constrained forecasting of future <b>meteor</b> <b>showers.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid <b>meteor</b> <b>shower,</b> for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E
5|$|Circinus is {{the radiant}} of an annual <b>meteor</b> <b>shower,</b> the Alpha Circinids (ACI). First {{observed}} in Queensland in 1977, the meteors {{have an average}} velocity of 27.1km/s and {{are thought to be}} associated with a long-period comet. In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a radiant close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.|$|E
5|$|Halley {{may have}} been {{recorded}} as early as 467BC, but this is uncertain. A comet was recorded in ancient Greece between 468 and 466 BC; its timing, location, duration, and associated <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> all suggest it was Halley. According to Pliny the Elder, that same year a meteorite fell {{in the town of}} Aegospotami, in Thrace. He described it as brown in colour and the size of a wagon load. Chinese chroniclers also mention a comet in that year.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the P/Machholz's meteoroid stream was simulated. It shows that this stream may produce eight <b>meteor</b> <b>showers.</b> There are the known observed <b>meteor</b> <b>showers</b> such as the Quadrantids, Ursids, Northern and Southern delta-Aquarids, Daytime Arietids, and alpha-Cetids. A satisfactory agreement of the theoretical and observed geocentric radiants and orbits allows one {{to conclude that the}} above showers could have been resulted from the decay of the P/Machholz nucleus. The age of the stream is estimated to be 7. 5 millennia...|$|R

5|$|The 11 Canis-Minorids, {{also called}} the Beta Canis Minorids, are a <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> that arise near the fifth-magnitude star 11 Canis Minoris and were {{discovered}} in 1964 by Keith Hindley, who investigated their trajectory and proposed a common origin with the comet D/1917 F1 Mellish. However, this conclusion has been refuted subsequently {{as the number of}} orbits analysed was low and their trajectories too disparate to confirm a link. They last from 4 to 15 December, peaking over 10 and 11 December.|$|E
5|$|The Aurigids are {{normally}} a placid Class II <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> that {{peaks in the}} early morning hours of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year. Though the maximum zenithal hourly rate is 2–5 meteors per hour, the Aurigids are fast, with an entry velocity of /sec. The annual Aurigids have a radiant located about two degrees north of Theta Aurigae, a third-magnitude star in the center of the constellation. The Aurigids end on September 4. Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9–30 meteors per hour.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix is {{the radiant}} of two annual meteor showers. The Phoenicids, {{also known as}} the December Phoenicids, were first {{observed}} on 3 December 1887. The shower was particularly intense in December 1956, and is thought related to the breakup of the short-period comet 289P/Blanpain. It peaks around 4–5 December, though is not seen every year. A very minor <b>meteor</b> <b>shower</b> peaks around July 14 with around one meteor an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower {{is referred to as the}} July Phoenicids.|$|E
40|$|Cooperation {{and data}} sharing among {{national}} networks and International Meteor Organization Video Meteor Database (IMO VMDB) resulted in European viDeo MeteOr Network Database (EDMOND). The {{current version of}} the database (EDMOND 5. 0) contains 144 751 orbits collected from 2001 to 2014. In our survey we used EDMOND database {{in order to identify}} existing and new <b>meteor</b> <b>showers</b> in the database. In the first step of the survey, using Dsh criterion we found groups around each meteor within similarity threshold. Mean parameters of the groups were calculated and compared using a new function based on geocentric parameters (solar longitude, right ascension, declination, and geocentric velocity).

5|$|Some comets {{have been}} {{observed}} to break up during their perihelion passage, including great comets West and Ikeya–Seki. Biela's Comet was one significant example, when it broke into two pieces during its passage through the perihelion in 1846. These two comets were seen separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular meteor showers were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A minor <b>meteor</b> <b>shower,</b> the Andromedids, occurs annually in November, and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.|$|E
