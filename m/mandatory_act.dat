40|$|In 2002, the {{government}} of Saudi Arabia issued a <b>mandatory</b> <b>act</b> of fortifying white wheat flour with folic acid due to reported incidences of neural tube defects in {{different regions of the}} country. No available study examines folate status before or after the fortification act. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate folate status for adult healthy Saudi males and females in Riyadh region. 309 subjects were recruited, 157 males and 152 females. Folate status was evaluated by determining folate concentration in serum and red blood cell (RBC). Results showed that mean serum folate concentrations were 7. 3 ± 2. 0 ng/ml and 14. 6 ± 6. 0 ng/ml for males and females respectively. Mean concentrations in RBC were 3321 ± 78. 3 ng/ml and 444. 2 ± 107. 3 ng/ml for males and females, respectively. Both indices were significantly lower in male group compared to female group. The study used cut-off values of < 3 ng/ml and < 160 ng/ml for serum and RBC folate concentration, respectively to determine deficiency and cut-off values of ≥ 5 ng/ml and ≥ 200 ng/ml for serum and RBC folate concentration, respectively to determine adequacy. Based on serum cut-off values, 1. 9 % (n= 3) of male participants had folate deficiency and 88. 5 % (n= 139) had adequate status whereas 97. 3 % (n= 148) of females had adequate status and no one had deficiency. Based on cut-off values of RBC, 96. 2 % (n= 151) of males and 98 % (n= 149) of females had adequate status and no one had deficiency among the two groups. Results also showed that a high percentage of participants had excess status of folate. The study suggests that the fortification act improved folate status and eradicates folate deficiency that is due to inadequate folate intake. In addition, the eradicates folate deficiency that is due to inadequate folate intake. In addition, the study suggests that more studies are needed to evaluate potential adverse effects associated with excess intake of folate such as vitamin B 12 deficiency among elderly and exceeding the upper tolerable limit of folate intake among children and users of dietary supplements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cointegration {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to assist the testing for price delineation in antitrust and merger cases as a way of deepening econometric evidence. This paper examines the impact of the Livestock <b>Mandatory</b> Reporting <b>Act</b> (1999) instigated in 2001. By addressing the industry as a cointegrated system containing retail, wholesale and farm prices, short run and long run relationships were examined. Cointegration analysis between farm, wholesale and retail sectors suggests that the wholesale sector plays an important role within system. The econometric estimations find that long run wholesale pricing is weakly exogenous whilst farm and retail prices follow the same trend. This finding suggests that it may be as a result of market inefficiency and calls for further analysis of the role that the wholesale sector plays within the industry...|$|R

40|$|The Livestock <b>Mandatory</b> Reporting <b>Act</b> (MPR) of 1999 was {{implemented}} in April 2001. Empirical evidence indicates {{a significant change}} in intra-week price dispersion associated with publicly reported fed cattle grid premiums and discounts occurring after MPR implementation. The research objective is to evaluate the effect of increased market transparency resulting from implementation of MPR, on grid intra-week premium and discount dispersion levels. Empirical results suggest that increased transparency is compatible with intra-week dispersion levels increasing. Increased dispersion suggests that during the pre-MPR period weekly premium and discount data may have been drawn from a non-representative sample. From the empirical evidence, it is concluded that reform of the livestock price-reporting system appears to have been necessary in the case of publically reported grid premiums and discounts. fed cattle, grid pricing, market transparency, price dispersion, price volatility, mandatory livestock price reporting, Agricultural and Food Policy, Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

Specific legal issues also arise concerning the AMT Act, including its potentially discriminatory application to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The program only permits referral by police, {{despite the fact that it}} is ostensibly a medical intervention.
