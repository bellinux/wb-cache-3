5|$|The {{most widely}} {{recognized}} {{legacy of the}} 1966 smog was the political reaction to it, which galvanized the nascent environmental <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and prompted demand for sweeping air-pollution control laws. The smog has been remembered for various purposes by scientists, historians, journalists, writers, artists, activists, and political commentators.|$|E
5|$|The {{progressive}} <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> was at {{its height}} during the early 20th century.

More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E

5|$|Anne Dallas Dudley (née Annie Willis Dallas; November 13, 1876 – September 13, 1955) was a {{prominent}} activist in the women's suffrage <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> After founding the Nashville Equal Suffrage League and serving as its president, she moved {{up through the ranks}} of the movement, serving as President of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association and then as Third Vice President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, where she helped lead efforts to get the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution ratified, giving women the right to vote nationwide. She is especially noted for her successful efforts to get the Nineteenth Amendment ratified in her home state of Tennessee, the final state necessary to bring the amendment into force.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E
5|$|The White Night riots were {{a series}} of violent events sparked by an {{announcement}} of the lenient sentencing of Dan White for the assassinations of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and of Harvey Milk, {{a member of the}} city's Board of Supervisors who was among the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. The events took place on the night of May 21, 1979 (the night before what would have been Milk's 49th birthday) in San Francisco. Earlier that day, White had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the lightest possible conviction for his actions. That White was not convicted of first-degree murder (of which he was originally charged) had so outraged the city's gay community that it set off the most violent reaction by gay Americans since the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City (which is credited as the beginning of the modern gay rights <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States).</b>|$|E
