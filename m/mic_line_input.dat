50|$|ISA 430 (1999) The ISA 430 brought {{together}} the circuitry {{of the original}} ISA110, with its transformer-based <b>mic</b> and <b>line</b> <b>inputs,</b> HPF/LPF and parametric EQ section, with the ISA 130 compressor/limiter and expander/gate, designed by Trevor Stride and Rupert Neve, which later appeared in the Red 3. In addition to uniting these two units in the same 2U enclosure, ISA 430 introduced additional features such as an optional 24/96 A/D converter with synch to Pro Tools’ Superclock and other sources. A dedicated insert could be placed in three locations in the signal path (after the preamp, pre-EQ; between EQ and dynamics; and after EQ and dynamics but before the main output). EQ and dynamics sections could be swapped, and the unit could run as a single channel path nor be split into two independent processors with separate EQ and dynamics. An upgraded Class A VCA design {{was used in the}} compressor, though the sidechain was identical to that in the original ISA 130. Both a VU Meter and LED bar metering was included, the latter for use with the A/D. An improved de-esser design was included and a “frequency adaptive” optical limiter.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{intended}} by designers {{that the line}} out of one device {{be connected to the}} <b>line</b> <b>input</b> of another. <b>Line</b> <b>inputs</b> are designed to accept voltage levels in the range provided by line outputs. Impedances, on the other hand, are deliberately not matched from output to input. The impedance of a <b>line</b> <b>input</b> is typically around 10 kΩ. When driven by a line output's usual low impedance of 100 to 600 ohms, this forms a [...] "bridging" [...] connection in which most of the voltage generated by the source (the output) is dropped across the load (the input), and minimal current flows due to the load's relatively high impedance.|$|R

50|$|As cables between {{line output}} and <b>line</b> <b>input</b> are {{generally}} extremely short {{compared to the}} audio signal wavelength in the cable, transmission line effects can be disregarded and impedance matching need not be used. Instead, line level circuits use the impedance bridging principle, in which a low impedance output drives a high impedance <b>input.</b> A typical <b>line</b> out connection has an output impedance from 100 to 600 Ω, with lower values being more common in newer equipment. <b>Line</b> <b>inputs</b> present a much higher impedance, typically 10 kΩ or more.|$|R

50|$|Users of analog VCRs, DVRs, {{or other}} {{recording}} devices which lack a digital tuner {{have a unique}} problem of no longer being able to record programs across multiple channels.

A probe returns the set of probe points which are the intersections of the probe's horizontal line (the probe <b>line)</b> with all <b>input</b> <b>lines.</b> We assume {{that none of the}} <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> is horizontal, so a probe <b>line</b> intersects every <b>input</b> <b>line.</b> Our goal is to reconstruct the set of <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> using a small number of probes. Aoki, Imai, Imai, and Rappaport [1] observed that if one is allowed to place the probe lines after seeing the results of previous probes, then the number of probes required is at most three. This paper addresses the problem of fixed probes; in our setting the locations of the probes must be chosen before the input is examined. We show that for each natural number n there is a set of n + 1 probe lines that will serve to determine any arrangement of n <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> and that [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} unity {{power factor}} converter system which {{is able to}} operate from a 150 V three-phase supply whilst delivering the required 200 V DC voltage has been built and tested. This circuit functions as a high power factor low harmonic rectifier based on the concept that the peak capacitor voltages are proportional to the <b>line</b> <b>input</b> currents. Hence the low frequency components of the capacitor voltages are also approximately proportional to the <b>line</b> <b>input</b> currents. The system can be designed to achieve nearly sinusoidal supply input currents, when operated with discontinuous resonant capacitor voltages Output power control is achieved by variations of the IGBTs switching frequency. The converter is therefore able to compensate for any changes in the load resistance. The proposed topology offers advantages, including: a relatively simple power, control and protection circuits, high power capability, and high converter efficiencies...|$|R
