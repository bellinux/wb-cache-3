40|$|Until the 1800 s Indian warriors of the Plains {{recorded}} significant heroic {{events from}} their adventures and pursuits in pictographs, on hide. Then, {{during the nineteenth}} century, these pictographs began to be produced on paper as well. About {{the same time that}} paper was coming into use, canvas and muslin became available, and the drawings that had formerly been composed on hide began to appear on these new materials. Typically, Indian men made use of discarded or captured ledgers, memorandum books, or rosters to render their exploit narratives; the representation of such events on these materials is referred to as ledger art. 1 The subject matter in ledger biography was much {{the same as that of}} hide painting, where narratives revealing coup scenes appeared on tipi-liners, mats, and robes. These scenes included horse captures, counting coup, and other confrontations with enemies. The great theme of Plains Indian biographic narrative was counting coup, and integral to this was the chase. Touching an enemy with a coup stick, defeating an enemy in battle, and capturing enemy horses are visual instantiations of this theme. Used as a text in the social context of oratory, the pictorial narratives were echoed by song, dance, and drama. In cultures with oral narrative traditions, storytelling is a vibrant communal force, and occasions for oral narrative are numerous. Among Plains Indi ns, pictography and oral narrative were sustained together as a social medium-they dramatized society 2 ̆ 7 s view of the world, as well as appropriate behaviors and relationships. Among Plains warriors, what have been called autobiographies were particularly common. 2 These records represented important events of valor in their lives as warriors, deeds that entitled them to special honors. 3 The pictographic narratives were primarily concerned with representing scenes of interaction, usually involving pursuit or confrontation. Features of the surrounding environment are likely to be sparse. People and horses are the primary figures in these interactions, in scenes that typically refer to the opposition of two embattled individuals or groups. Warriors rose in esteem not only by behaving honorably but just as importantly by committing these deeds to public record. When a warrior 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>deeds</b> were socially acknowledged and honored, he gained rank, respect, and influence. 4 This essay looks at three picto-narratives that chronicle Sitting Bull 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>deeds</b> as a warrior. The earliest is thought to have been composed around 1870, before captivity, and the other two after his surrender. The three records are commonly referred to by the family name of those who donated them to a particular museum. All are considered fundamentally traditional in both subject matter and technique. The Kimball and Smith records are in the possession of the National Anthropological Archives of the Smithsonian Institution. The Quimby record is held by the Fort St. Joseph Museum of Niles, Michigan. Figure 1 is from the Kimball record, which is the earliest document. Sitting Bull later acknowledged creating an original and leaving it in the care of his 2 ̆ 2 brother, 2 ̆ 2 Jumping Bull. While in Jumping Bull 2 ̆ 7 s care, at least two copies of the record were made by Four Horns, Sitting Bull 2 ̆ 7 s uncle. According to some sources, warriors would carry their picto-narratives with them into battle, reenacting their deeds in camps along the way. 5 Many of the ledger drawings in collections today were taken from the bodies of slain Indians. Others, such as this one from the Kimball record, were sold, traded for provisions, or given as gifts. In August 1870 the Kimball record was brought to Fort Buford by an Indian and traded for provisions worth 1. 50...|$|R

Zato je jubilej 2000. na koji nas Ivan Pavao II. zove i sprema sjećanje na prošlost koja traje i vodi u budućnost koja je počela. Biblijski pojam spomena (zikkaron, anamnesis) sadrži povijesno i liturgijsko prisjećanje na prošle Božje zahvate od kojih Božji narod živi u sadašnjosti. Takav je šabat kao tjedni spomen stvorenosti na sliku Božju, oslobođenja iz ropstva i uključenosti u narod Božji. Takva je Pasha kao godišnji spomen izbavljenja već dogođenog i stalno iščekivanog. Takva je Isusova i naša molitva da dođe kraljevstvo Očevo kojemu se Isus stavljao potpuno na raspolaganje te traži da i mi tako postupamo. Crkva uprisutnjujući prošla djela Božja vrši svoje poslanje kao narod Božji koji putuje prema eshatonu, a budućnost ljudi i svemira gleda kao ostvarenje Božjih obećanja. John Paul II in {{his opening}} and {{concluding}} chapters of Tertio millenio adveniente quotes several times Heb 13, 8 : »Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever«. This article is an exegetical analysis of New Testament texts on which the Pontiff relies in calling the Christians of our {{time to prepare for}} ending second millenium and for entering the third millenium. Biblical concepts of zikkaron and anamnesis involve not only remembering God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>deeds</b> but re-enacting them in each new generation of God 2 ̆ 7 s people. 1. Shabbath as weekly memorial of creation in God 2 ̆ 7 s image, deliberation from slavery and inclusion into God 2 ̆ 7 s people. In Genesis 2, 1 - 4; Exodus 20, 8 - 11; Deutoronomy 5, 12 - 15 these three aspects of shabbath are present and especially the third one was decive for the Jews of diaspora in preserving their religious and national identity. In 1 Co 16, 1 - 4; Acts 20, 7 - 12; Rev 1, 10 Christians celebrate their eucharist on first day of the week but they keep all aspects of Old Testament shabbath in their weekly day of rest and prayer. 2. Passover is yearly memorial of redemption which has taken place but its final enactment is faithfully being expected. In Exodus 13, 8 every Jewish family celebrating the Passover festival repeats: »This is because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt. « God 2 ̆ 7 s people enact God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> past <b>deeds</b> in their Passover feast and expect the full appearence of God 2 ̆ 7 s salvation. In 1 Cor 5, 7 Christians are reminded that »our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed«. This and other texts on eucharist in 1 Cor are a trace of last supper as Jesus 2 ̆ 7 Passover. In committing his disciples »to do this in memory of me« (Lk 22, 19 d = 1 Cor 11, 24 c) Jesus gave paschal character to his farewell meal. Maranatha (1 Cor 16, 22; Rv 22, 20) reflects eschatological aspect of the eucharist and of the Church, who is being constituted and manifested at her eucharist. 3. Your kingdom come. This prayer of Jesus involves his preaching and enacting of God 2 ̆ 7 s reign. It includes his experience of God as Abba and his willingness to seek first the kingdom of God (Mt 6, 32 - Lk 12, 31). In his words and deeds Jesus has taken away the apocalyptic veil from the concept of kingdom (entapokalyptisiert - H. Schürmann) but he kept the eschatological aspect of it. When we Christians pray this prayer of our Lord we should recognize the signs of God 2 ̆ 7 s presence in our world and be obedient instruments of his saving activity. 4. Eschatological, not cataclysmic orientation of pilgrim Church on earth. In immediate context of Heb 13, 7 - 9 first generation of Christian hegoumenoi (leaders of a group living in diaspora) have died but Jesus remains our high priest forever. Celebration of the second millenium of incarnation is a kairos or favorable opportunity and challenge to reaffirm the Christian view of future. It is »paradigm for transcendence« (J.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} and to explain Peking 2 ̆ 7 s policy toward Taiwan during the 1970 s. To be more specific, the questions which this study seeks to answer are, was there a consistent Taiwan policy of the PRC during the 1970 s? If yes, what was that and why?^ This study treats Peking 2 ̆ 7 s policy vis-a-vis Taiwan as a strategy, the means aimed at the eventual goal of take-over. Hence one of John P. Lovell 2 ̆ 7 s three analytical frameworks as developed in his book Foreign Policy in Perspective, the strategic perspective, is used by this study. ^ The first part of the study, the theoretical basis of the strategy, tries to work out a hypothetical rationale for Peking 2 ̆ 7 s policy through evaluating the five key variables suggested by Lovell 2 ̆ 7 s framework. These variables include: parties and alignments involved in the issue; Peking 2 ̆ 7 s stakes in the issue; Peking 2 ̆ 7 s estimates of its own capability and of the strategy of other parties; and rules of the conflict. The rationale will then be subject to verification through analyzing Peking 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> real <b>deeds</b> [...] the implementation of the strategy. This is done in the second part of the study. ^ It has been found that Peking has had a relatively stable trend in its efforts to claim Taiwan during the 1970 s which could be considered a consistent strategy. The strategy is a process of endeavour to gain or to preserve Peking 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 free hand 2 ̆ 2 in the future solution of the Taiwan issue while at the same time to ascertain that Taiwan would not be frightened into pursuing some risky options out of desperation which might make Peking 2 ̆ 7 s eventual goal unattainable.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent to which organizational infrastructure and institutional leadership facilitated or hindered institutionalizing service learning as pedagogy at a small health professions college. Through interviews and content and discourse analysis, we found that data supported the notion that service learning 2 ̆ 2 fit 2 ̆ 2 the mission, however, data also revealed some resistance to using service learning on the part of some faculty members and administrators. Consequently, governance and communication channels appeared as barriers to institutionalization because the administration 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> words and <b>deeds</b> were incongruent. Nursing faculty 2 ̆ 7 S espoused values and actual behaviors were congruent thus forcing them to lead for change from the bottom of their College hierarchy. Increased research on service learning as pedagogy can be found in the literature (Elyer 2 ̆ 6 Giles, 1999; Furco, 2001; Giles 2 ̆ 6 Elyer, 1998; Weglarz 2 ̆ 6 Seybert, 2004). Service learning as pedagogy advocates for a combination of higher education curricula partnerships with community agencies by providing community services while creating learning centered, reflective environments for students. This pedagogical approach is particularly suited to nursing and to social work professions, typically female-dominated fields where much of service learning research was conducted (Hamner, Wilder, Avery, 2 ̆ 6 Byrd, 2002). Gilligan (1982) realized that women often make decisions based on their connection with others. Gelmon, Holland, and Shinnamon (1998) found that sustainability for service learning in curriculum was a direct relationship between faculty and community partners, not surprising given the natural interaction between health care providers and the community.

40|$|How {{to explain}} {{the rise and fall}} of the Taiwan {{independence}} policy? As the Taiwan Strait is still the only conceivable scenario where a major power war can break out and Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> words and <b>deeds</b> can significantly affect the prospect of a cross-strait military conflict, to answer this question is not just a scholarly inquiry. I define the Taiwan independence policy as internal political moves by the Taiwanese government to establish Taiwan as a separate and sovereign political entity on the world stage. Although two existing prevailing explanations [...] electoral politics and shifting identity [...] have some merits, they are inadequate to explain policy change over the past twenty years. Instead, I argue that there is strategic rationale for Taiwan to assert a separate sovereignty. Sovereignty assertions are attempts to substitute normative power [...] the international consensus on the sanctity of sovereignty [...] for a shortfall in military-economic-diplomatic assets. So when Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s security environment becomes more perilous as a result of adverse power shift and domestic constraints hinder internal balancing efforts, Taiwan is more likely to resort to sovereignty assertions, while favorable power shift and enhanced domestic mobilizational capacity reduce the incentive to assert sovereignty. Using congruence procedure and process tracing and drawing a large amount of historical and qualitative data, I test my argument in five periods: the early Lee Teng-hui years (1988 - 1994), the late Lee Teng-hui years (1995 - 1999), Chen Shui-bian 2 ̆ 7 s early moderation (2000 - 2001), the Chen Shui-bian era (2002 - 2007), and the Ma Ying-jeou era (2008 - 2010). I find that my theory focusing on external and internal constraints offer a better explanation of the Taiwan independence policy. My findings suggest that balancing, as a survival and security strategy, can take a political face under certain circumstances, and international norms do matter in political leaders 2 ̆ 7 strategic calculations. An important policy implication is that in contrast to the conventional understanding that Taiwan independence grows out of the Taiwanese soil, it actually has an overlooked external origin...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} parodic Biblical language employed by medieval and early modern staged heretics. The plays 2 ̆ 7 coupling of parody and heresy forges ideological {{connections between the}} two, as when they disrupt authorized, orthodox models of the Word, as both the Scriptures and the Host. My Introduction addresses the theological controversies over the relationship between language and meaning that arise from Lollard, Catholic, and Protestant heresies. Chapter two analyzes how, in the Chester cycle, Antichrist 2 ̆ 7 s theological and verbal dissents are eerily similar to orthodox models. That framework forces the audience {{to depend on the}} context of the heretic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> words and <b>deeds,</b> rather than the words and deeds themselves, to interpret meaning. Chapter three examines Mankind 2 ̆ 7 s construction of orthodox and parodic registers of language and its mapping of Mankind 2 ̆ 7 s fall and ascent through his transition from one register to the other. Chapter four addresses how the Croxton Play of the Sacrament defends the doctrine of the Real Presence by aligning the transformative power of the consecratory words with the transformative power of believers 2 ̆ 7 confessions at conversion, wherein both enact a transubstantiation. Chapter five argues that John Bale 2 ̆ 7 s Three Laws relies on the dichotomy of the letter and the spirit to characterize his parodic Catholic vices as legalistic adherents to the Word and his Protestant heroes as spiritually-enlightened believers. Chapter six analyzes how Falstaff 2 ̆ 7 s Puritan parody, in the Henry IV plays, locates meaning in the audience rather than the speaker, particularly through dramatic irony, equivocation, and allusions. Lastly, chapter seven examines how, in Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s Doctor Faustus, the spectrum of orthodox and parodic language use collapses into Faustus 2 ̆ 7 s idiom, and I contend that Faustus 2 ̆ 7 s heresy is ultimately his indecision. My conclusion ultimately finds that the univocity between language and meaning is a specious construction, and, collectively, these texts demonstrate that language may be a marker but not a maker of meaning...|$|R

Systematic excavations led by Stjepan Gunjačafrom 1947 until 1954, enriched the holdings ofpre-Romanesque sculpture from the church but the finds were not studied systematically. Their attention was drawn by two architraves of the altar screen, mainly because ofthe inscription ofthe donor and not because oftheir artistic qualities. According to the paleographic features, the inscription was therefore dated to the 9 th- 10 th century and its content also confirmed the continuity ofthe titular until the present. The greatest number ofpre-Romanesque sculptural fragments are parts of altar screens (cancellum), altars and architectural decorative elements: portal framings, lintels and jambs. The altar screen fragments mostly belong to its lower part (pilasters and plutei) found in minor pieces. There are also two completely preserved architraves and part of the pediment belonging to the upper part (trabeation), while a smaller capitalfragment and a smaller column fragment (presently misplaced) are alt that is left from the central part. Of all the fragments it was possible to determine three pilasters (Cat. no. 1, 12 and 25) andfour plutei (Cat. no. 2, 4 - 11 and 26). It was not possible to determine the function of a smaller number offragments (Cat. no. 3 and 21), while Cat. no 24 is likely to have been part of the cancellum stipes. According to these finds, a sketch reconstruction of the altar screen was proposed (Crtež la-b). Preserved openings for placing the architrave in the side walls clearly determined its position. The altar remains are the mensa supporter (Cat. no. 17) andfragments ofthe mensa (Cat. no. 19) which was reconstructed. Of the portal framing, three fragments were found (Cat. no. 19, 20 and 28), while the fourth fragment was walled in as a spolium when the presbytery was added in the late Middle Ages. (Cat. no. 22; its decorative field was deliberately etched in the late 1980 s due to increasing religious intolerance). The function offragment no. 23 was not exactly determined, while the rest are fragments of the portal jamb and lintel). From the reconstruction it is evident that the cancellum belonged to an aisleless church whose outer columns were in the axis of the altar conch corners. The lower part is rhythmically composed oftwo wider and two narrow plutei as well as four pilasters. Their decorative fields bear geometric compositiOns of various types of grid all of them interlaced. The pilasters bear a number of "eights 2 ̆ 7; and untied circles interlaced in a grid of rhombs. Particularly important are compositions of grids on plutei, because, along with the decorative field on the trabeations -they are the crucial element of art expression by means of which it is possible to attribute the work to a certain stone-mason or workshop. Plutei from the Church ofSt Saviour bear two compositions of grids. Grid a on narrow plutei, as on thepilaster on the right hand to the entrance to the presbytery and Grid b on targerplutei that is literally decorated by a "dense" interlace. The architraves are divided into two longitudinal strips, separated from one another by a prominent rib that has a stylized cymatium chiselled on its lower part. The upper parts have characteristic high motifs of rnnning dog with j 1. uted lower parts, while the donoris inscription is carved in the lowerpart. (ref paper by Vedrana Uelonga in this volume). The pediment framing follows the scheme ofthe architrave, but only its minor fragment from the left side was found. Jt bears the remainder ofthe zone with rnnning dog and a smallfragment of the central jield with usual iconographic representation of the cross with two birds under its arms. The preservedpart ofthe cross shows lined and undecorated arms, as welt as the larger part of the bird to the lejt, probably holding a bunch ofgrapes in its beak. The schematic bird is a shallow relief whose feathers and wing are only indicated by parallel lines. The running dog motif on each architrave are divided into two opposite rows, separated from each other by small crosses ofidenticalfeatures as the cross on the pediment. The portalfragments also bears a reduced variant ofGrid a, whose circles are tied in a raw. The mentioned work has uniformed stylistiC features clearly denoting that they date from the same period. The only exception are altar elements, i. e. the cross on the supporter of the mensa whose features are completely different from those ofthe crosses on the pediment and architraves. Such crosses were very common in pre-Romanesque sculpture in Churches in Trogir, and it is likely that they had been made in one ofits workshops, either then or later. Since the fragments have not been systematically published, when studying the sculpture from St Saviour, until the present, researchers only considered architraves and compared their stylistic features with the same or similarfinds. Their style and date was for the first time determined more precisely by Jvo Petriciali who compared them to similar elements from a number of other churches (Šapat, Ždrapanj, Biskupija-Bukorovića podvornica) and dated them to the time ofprince Branimir (879 - 892). These results, somewhat supplemented, were accepted by Miljenko jurković, and further elaborated by Nikola jakšić (ref his work "The Stone-cutting Workshop from the time of Prince Branimir" in this volume. He considered tbat tbe sculpture from some otber sites also belonged to tbis group: that from Biskupija -Crkvina, 2 nd phase, unknown site (tbe 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Bibać 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Society collection, Split or Solin (the Bihać SOCiety collection), Livno-Rapovine, Vrba (Glamoč) and Plavno (Knin). He noticed tbat details of their decorative compositions were identical or very similar by treatment or structure which is wby be assigned them all to the same workshop (jar all analogies refer to Fig. 1 - 32). Apart from tbe trabeation he also related plutei fragments witb Grid afrom the following sites: Zdrapanj, Biskupija, Crkvina, BiskupijaBukarovićapodvornica. As tbe main characteristics oftbe workshop production jakšić brings poor quality ofexecution, and the lack of a longer crajtsmansbip tradition. The entire worksbop production is accordiong to him a "Significant discantinuation " of tbe stonecutting tradition in Dalmatian towns. He agrees with the dating by Petriciali, but due to a greater number ofsites whose sculptural decoration was considered to be produced in worksbops, it is likely that they have existed somewbat later as well. Considering the workshop within the historicalframework ofthe time, tbe crajtsmen wbo worked at tbe court at tbe time wben Branimir discontinued relations with Byzantine towns along tbe coast, according tojakšić, belonged to this workshop, wbicb explains the "discontinuation of tbe stonecutting tradition of those towns". Therefore, be assigns the jinds from the Bibać collection to the unknown church at Solin. The reconstrnction of the altar screen from St Saviour and the publisbing of pre-Romanesque finds from various sites, enabled an analysis of the mentioned workshop enriched with new details which resulted in new facts. Because ofthe congruent composition and certain motifs that are treated in the same manner, fragments of the cancellum from the Church of St Saviour, apart from the already determined sites, parts of the altar screen from other sites may be assigned to the same workshop as well. Such are the fragments from Oton near Knin (BenderCrkvina) and at Droar (Spasovina, Šobića cemetery). They are accidental finds, and the sites have not been excavated yet so that not all main pieces of the altar screen are known oj, particularly the trabeation. The pilasters bear a Grid b (Bender-Crkvina and Droar-Spasovina), and the plutei bear Grid a (Droar-Šobića groblje), that also appears on the pluteus from Biovičino selo (Knin) and on one from the town of Knin. As both variants of meshes (with tied circies, and that with untied anes) appear on a number of pilasters and plutei from the eastern Adriatic coast, both in towns and in the hinterland, plutei from Bikovičina selo and Knin cannot be considered to be workshop products with certainty. Special attention in this paper was paid to two monuments from the Bihać collection -the pediment from an unknown site and the ciborium arch that was in literature first referred to as a find from Solin and ajterwards considered to have belonged to the finds of the belfry near the Split cathedral. I was more likely to believe in Split as their provenance and not to include Solin as a town of the workshopis activity. Products of this workshop, would, in that case be those at Cetina -St Saviour, Biskupja Bukarovića podvornice, Biskupija -Crkvina (St Marija), Biskupija -St Trinity, Livno -Rapovine (St Peter), Šapat -Crkvina, Ždrapanj and Plavno, and most probably Vrba (Glamoć) and Droar Spasovina, Šobića cemetery. As most of these sites were not systematically excavated, this analysis might require certain corrections and supplements upon completion ofexcavations. Believing that the pediment and arch, with characteristics of a workshop production were found in Split, I suppose they originally belonged to the church furnishings, particularly because this site yietded no ciborium with pre-Romanesque features after the 8 th c. Considering the historic circumstances, the time ofprince Branimir, the centre ofthe workshop must have been in Split, in spite ofthe poor craftsmaship of the entire work, which is undeniable. The period of prince Branimir was accompanied by intensive reconstructions and construction of new churches throughout Croatia, proved by quality sculpture at Muć, Otres near Bribir and Nin (all architraves were dated by the inscription ofthe saidprince), sculpturalfinds of lesser quality prove that even such workshop stood out, just as in towns where the quality ofpreRomanesque products varied. As a tangible evidence of intensive Christianization in Croatia at the end of the 9 th c., this process also denotes an increased influence ofthe Split archbishopry. Although its see was in the town of Byzantine province of Dalmatia -it took advantage of the decreasing Frankish influence on Croatia and thus the influence of the Aquileian patriarchate on religious circumstances and acts in accordance with the papal policy on the eastern Adriatic [...] This process reached its climax during the well-known Councils in the time of king Tomislav (925 and 928), when the Split metropolitan became the ecclesiasticalprimas ofCroatia. The relation ofthe Split church with the court that had been established during the rule ofprince Trpimir in the mid 9 th c, and particularly intensified when the Nin bishop, i. e. Croatian bishop Theodosius lalthough being an Aqui!eian suffraganl became archbishop in the time ofprince Branimir was very strong. In spite ofvaried political relations within global processes at the time, its strength was proved by the unpreserved Branimir 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>deed</b> ofgift to the Split church, and was recorded in the deed ofgift of the Hungaro-Croatian king Gejza II to the same church from 1158. This explains the activity of a number of workshops from Split or Trogir in Croatia, among which is the one analyzed here, that produced the furnishings in the Church of St Saviour. Due to the large number ofchurches that it worked for, its activity must have lasted very long, and its activity should therefore be extended anto the period of prince Mucimir (around 892 - 910), particularly anto churches further inland, on the present-day territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Drvar, Livno, Glamoč), that be!onged to Croatia under the Trpimirović dynasty. Apart from Croatia, the workshop was proved to work in Split as well, most probab!y producing the stone furnishings for the cathedra!, among which the ciborium as well. Since the church ofSt Saviour was not chronologicatly precise!y determined, the construction andfurnishing ofthe church should be dated to the approximate time of the workshop 2 ̆ 7 s activity: the rule ofBranimir and Mucimir (around 879 - 910), not excluding the possibility that it might have been built earlier, in the time ofprince Branimir...|$|R
