5|$|Combat is {{staged in}} a ghostly virtual arena, and Amaterasu can fight enemies using a {{combination}} of weapons, fighting techniques and Brush methods to dispatch the foes. At the end of combat, money (as yen) is rewarded to Amaterasu, with bonuses for completing a battle quickly and without taking damage. The <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> spent on numerous items from merchants across the land, including healing goods, better weapons, tools and key items for completing quests. The money {{can also be used to}} buy new combat techniques at dojos throughout the land.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format and set in the fictional town of Black Rock. The player takes {{on the role of}} Sheriff Quickdraw, and the main objective of the game is to track down and kill a gang of outlaws who are hiding in the town. The game begins with a first-person perspective targeting minigame in which vertically scrolling bags of <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> shot at using crosshairs. Shooting the bags give the player initial sums of money which can be used to purchase ammunition.|$|E
5|$|With many 9th century Tang era merchants {{avoiding}} {{the weight and}} bulk of so many copper coins in each transaction, this led them to using trading receipts from deposit shops where goods or money were left previously. Merchants would deposit copper currency into the stores of wealthy families and prominent wholesalers, whereupon they would receive receipts that could be cashed {{in a number of}} nearby towns by accredited persons. Since the 10th century, the early Song government began issuing their own receipts of deposit, yet this was restricted mainly to their monopolized salt industry and trade. China's first official regional paper-printed <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traced back to the year 1024, in Sichuan province.|$|E

25|$|The President, {{while having}} {{to enforce the}} law, also {{possesses}} wide discretion in deciding how and even when to enforce laws. He also has a range of interpretive discretion in deciding the meaning of laws he must execute. When an appropriation provides discretion, the President can gauge when and how appropriated <b>moneys</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> spent most efficiently.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> purchased with real money within the game.|$|E
5|$|The player {{collects}} {{money by}} exploring Rapture {{and from the}} bodies of defeated foes; this <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used at vending machines to restock on ammunition, health and EVE, and other items; like security cameras, vending machines can also be hacked to reduce the costs of items from it. The player will also receive rewards {{in the form of}} ADAM from completing some tasks, as well as from either saving or killing the Little Sisters after defeating their Big Daddy guardian. ADAM is used to purchase new plasmids from Gatherer's Garden machines scattered around Rapture. In addition to plasmids, the player will also collect and buy tonics that provide passive bonuses, such as increasing Jack's strength, using EVE more efficiently, or making Jack more resistant to damage. The player can only have a limited number of plasmids and tonics active at any time, and can swap between the various plasmids and tonics at certain stations located throughout Rapture.|$|E

25|$|Game {{publishers}} usually {{prohibit the}} exchange of real-world money for virtual goods, but others actively promote the idea of linking (and directly profiting from) an exchange. In Second Life and Entropia Universe, the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly linked. This means that real <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> deposited for game money and vice versa. Real-world items have also been sold for game money in Entropia, and some players of Second Life have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.|$|E
25|$|Calvin {{criticized the}} use of certain {{passages}} of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others {{of them had been}} rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of Aristotle) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> made fruitful.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, the war {{on drugs}} led governments again to turn to money-laundering rules in an attempt to seize {{proceeds}} of drug crimes in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit from a law enforcement point of view of turning rules of evidence upside down. Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to get a conviction. But with money laundering laws, <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> confiscated and {{it is up to the}} individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate if they want the funds back. This makes it much easier for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower burdens of proof.|$|E
25|$|As with {{previous}} Rock Band titles, the players {{has the ability}} to create custom avatars for their band members within the game, which are displayed in the background visuals while playing through a song. The avatars have several custom aspects such as hair styling, make-up, clothing, and instruments. In-game <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to purchase more customization options, while some come as rewards for completing certain parts of the game. Rock Band 4 ships with more pre-made characters to allow players to get into the game faster, and atop more options from previous games, removes restrictions on gender-fixed items; for example, mustaches and beards were only an option for male characters in previous games.|$|E

25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to pick up customers and take them to their chosen destination as quickly as possible. Along the way, <b>money</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> earned by performing stunts such as near misses with other vehicles. The player is directed to a destination by a large green arrow {{at the top of the}} screen. The arrow does not adjust based on obstacles, but rather points in the general direction of the destination. Once the player arrives near the destination, they must stop within a specified zone. When the destination is reached, that customer's fare is added to the player's total money earned. Ratings are then awarded depending on how long the player took to complete the journey. If the customer's timer runs out before the player reaches the destination the customer jumps from the taxi without paying the driver.|$|E

She is also reported to have contributed {{several hundred thousand dollars}} for rehabilitation therapies for war veterans who have lost limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
