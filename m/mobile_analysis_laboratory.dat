40|$|This report {{describes}} Android secure coding rules, guidelines, and {{static analysis}} that were developed {{as part of}} the <b>Mobile</b> Source Code <b>Analysis</b> <b>Laboratory</b> (SCALe) project. The project aims to create a set of rules that can be checked (and potentially enforced) and to develop checkers for these rules. These efforts are intended to increase confidence in continued safe and secure operation of mobile devices and the networks on which they operate. The focus for this phase of the project is the Android platform for mobile devices. Work described in this report involved three activities: (1) preparing the Java Coding Guidelines book for publication, (2) developing Android secure coding rules for the Android section of the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java wiki, and (3) developing software that does static analysis of a set of Android apps for data flows between them so that security leaks can be detected.

The objective of the laboratory is to provide accurate onsite chemical analyses {{in a timely manner}} that results in preservation of the sample integrity and the efficient implementation of a test program. The laboratory is built on a standard 40 -ft truck trailer bed. The trailer chassis has been modified to carry requisite gas cylinders, compressor, and vacuum pump equipment in undercarriage bins, and has been equipped with air-ride shock absorbers to minimize road vibrations...|$|R

50|$|By 1955 OA had matured to {{the point}} that the United States Bureau of Naval Weapons began a major {{research}} program to adopt wear metal analysis for use in aircraft component failure prediction. These studies formed the basis for a Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) involving all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. The JOAP results proved conclusively that increases in component wear could be confirmed by detecting corresponding increases in the wear metal content of the lubricating oil. In 1958 Pacific Intermountain Express (P.I.E.) was the first trucking company to set up an in-house used oil <b>analysis</b> <b>laboratory</b> to control vehicle maintenance costs which was managed by Bob Herguth. In 1960 the first independent commercial oil <b>analysis</b> <b>laboratory</b> was started by Edward Forgeron in Oakland, CA.|$|R
