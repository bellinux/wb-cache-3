25|$|On July 22, 2008, the Social Security Administration {{introduced}} a new online benefits estimator. A worker who has enough Social Security credits to qualify for benefits, but who is not currently receiving benefits {{on his or her}} own Social Security record and who is not a Medicare beneficiary, can obtain an estimate of the retirement benefit that will be provided, for different assumptions about age at retirement. This process is done by opening a secure online account called <b>my</b> <b>Social</b> Security. For retirees who have non FICA or SECA taxed wages the rules get complicated and probably require additional help.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} Captain Fabbroni's finest moment. He testified in 21 {{hearings}} and his testimony filled 285 pages.

[...] "I am the victim of yellow journalism," [...] he told the judge. [...] "I have been ruined by the Carabinieri. The story that I have been {{the head of the}} Camorra is a legend.

2500|$|The most {{important}} program of 1935, {{and perhaps the}} New Deal as a whole, was the Social Security Act, drafted by Frances Perkins. It established a permanent system of universal retirement pensions (Social Security), unemployment insurance, and welfare benefits for the handicapped and needy children in families without a father present. It established the framework for the U.S. welfare system. Roosevelt insisted {{that it should be}} funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund; he said, [...] "We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits.

[...] "My books for children have messages in them that come from <b>my</b> <b>social</b> work experience...differences, friendship, loyalty, and social action," [...] Brodsky told journalist Michael Cousineau in a 2008 interview in the New Hampshire Sunday News. [...] "I {{feel very strongly that}} all of us can be productive and contribute, even if we may be different in some way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{expected}} that his party would lose several {{races in the}} 1934 Congressional elections, as the president's party had done in most previous midterm elections, but the Democrats picked up seats {{in both houses of}} Congress. Empowered by the public's apparent vote of confidence in his administration, the first item on Roosevelt's agenda in the 74th Congress was the creation of a social insurance program. The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor and the sick. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, [...] "We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap <b>my</b> <b>social</b> security program." [...] Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But {{for the first time the}} federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and the handicapped. Against Roosevelt's original intention for universal coverage, the act only applied to roughly sixty percent of the labor force, as farmers, domestic workers, and other groups were excluded.|$|E

2500|$|Blyth {{was born}} 22 March 1948 in Chessington; {{his father was}} an {{architect}} and his mother a teacher and painter. He was schooled {{from an early age}} in Epsom, Surrey, England. He began studying the piano at the age of four years, and in his teens worked to gain a scholarship to Trinity College of Music in London. There, he learned the play the organ, then transferred to the University of Bristol in 1966 to study electronic engineering, a decision made easier because he was [...] "hopelessly infatuated with an astonishingly pretty girl from <b>my</b> <b>social</b> group at home who'd gone up the year before." [...] At Bristol, Blyth founded the Student Music Society, and studied orchestra conducting; as a senior he conducted a performance of Bach's complex masterpiece St Matthew Passion. After college, he obtained a position with the Compton Organ Company in their research department where he met Bill Kelsey, his early mentor, who showed him how to lay out circuits on printed circuit boards. Compton was [...] "on its last legs", according to Blyth, and he left to join Graseby Instruments where he designed electronic filters for underwater weapons to satisfy Admiralty contracts. Blyth spent evenings at Kelsey's Notting Hill flat helping him assemble a large mixing desk, one used by Emerson, Lake & Palmer at the [...] "legendary" [...] Isle of Wight Festival 1970. With this success, Kelsey left Compton to form with a business partner the professional audio equipment company Kelsey & Morris.|$|E

2500|$|... A {{few weeks}} later, our dog {{got hit by}} a {{snowplow}} and I forgot all about the problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) {{in the same way that}} Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, <b>my</b> <b>social</b> life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? [...] " ...|$|E
