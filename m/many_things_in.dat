5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

500|$|Marceline has a close {{relationship}} with Finn and Jake. Marceline and Finn have <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> common with one another; in the episodes [...] "Evicted" [...] and [...] "Henchman" [...] it is stated that the reason Marceline befriended Finn is because he simply enjoys being himself. Although she has kissed Finn platonically on the cheek twice, Ward has noted that there is no romantic subtext between the two. On the other hand, Marceline and Jake share a more complex relationship. In her initial appearances, she derived pleasure from scaring Jake, who was terrified [...] "of her vampire bite". Jake, in turn, felt that she was evil and had managed to take over Finn's mind. Due to this, Jake attempted to kill her several times, to no avail. However, after the events of [...] "Henchman", Jake seems to have forgotten his fear of her; in [...] "Memory of a Memory", he even refers to her as a [...] "friend" [...] in one of her memories.|$|E

500|$|The {{script is}} also {{thought to have}} been {{inspired}} by Lynch's fear of fatherhood; his daughter Jennifer had been born with [...] "severely clubbed feet", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child. Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of Eraserhead. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, [...] "I saw so <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> Philadelphia I couldn't believe...

500|$|After {{appearing}} in minor roles in Fall and Home Alone 3 (both 1997), Johansson garnered wider attention for her {{performance in the}} film The Horse Whisperer (1998), directed by Robert Redford. The drama film, based on the 1995 novel {{of the same name}} by Nicholas Evans, {{tells the story of a}} talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses who is hired to help an injured teenager (played by Johansson). The actress received an [...] "introducing" [...] credit on this film, although it was her seventh role. On Johansson's maturity, Redford described her as [...] "13 going on 30". Todd McCarthy of Variety commented that Johansson [...] "convincingly conveys the awkwardness of her age and the inner pain of a carefree girl suddenly laid low by horrible happenstance". For the film, she was nominated for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress. She believed that the film changed <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> her life, realizing that acting is the ability to manipulate one's emotions. On finding good roles as a teenager, Johansson said it was hard for her as adults wrote the scripts and they [...] "portray kids like mall rats and not seriously ... Kids and teenagers just aren't being portrayed with any real depth".|$|E

[...] This led to songs that while not eschewing [...] "the bad side of life", ended up [...] "facing it from a more positive point of view, {{looking for a way}} to solve it. In the past we said: what a shit, this stinks, that sucks, everything sucks... Now it's time to say: stop, let's look for a solution, let's be positive." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by literary works, including Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita ("Pilate"), Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael ("Do the Evolution"), and the writings of Charles Bukowski ("In Hiding").
