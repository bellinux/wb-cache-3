5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). Fumaric acid has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton {{is removed from the}} cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the <b>maleate</b> H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E

30|$|Soybean oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{available}} biodegradable and sustainable edible oils. From the angle of the chemical structure, soybean oil is a triglyceride with two dominant fatty acid residues, linoleic acid and oleic acid, and an average number of double bonds per molecule of 4.6. The average molecular weight of soybean oil is about 874, and it contains 51 % of linoleic acid, 25 % of oleic acid, 11 % of palmitic acid, 9 % of linolenic acid, and 4 % of stearic acid residues[23]. The existence of the unsaturated double bonds in soybean oil molecules supplies opportunities for designing and modifying of soybean oil-based biodegradable polymers.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new catalytic activity of a commonly used metathesis catalyst and demonstrates {{the viability of}} directly coupling two powerful C-C bond forming strategies: cross-metathesis and ylide transformations, both proceeding via metal-catalysed carbene transfer. Catalytic C-C bond formation reactions are highly significant; my studies focus on such transformations involving metallocarbenes. Grubbs' 2 nd generation Ru catalyst is {{the most commonly used}} catalyst in olefin metathesis to generate thermodynamically preferred trans -olefms. During the course of my studies, I established that Grubbs 2 nd generation catalyst (0. 5 mol%) can also dimerise diazoacetates to give cis -enediesters (<b>maleates)</b> in good to excellent yields (74 - 99 %) with high stereoselectivity (Z : E > 95 : 5). The reaction between two different diazoacetates, catalysed by Grubbs catalyst gave access to unsymmetrical cis -enediesters with high stereoselectivity (Z : E > 95 : 5, generally 99 : 1). The catalyst was found to retain its alkene metathetical activity during diazo coupling; building on this latter observation a novel route to access dienyl dilactones by head -to- head dimerisation of unsaturated diazoacetates was developed. Cross-metathesis was found to be chemoselective in the presence of diazo functionality (when flanked by two carbonyl groups), allowing the functionalisation of tethered olefin. The elaborated diazocarbonyl olefms were subjected to Rh 2 (OAc) 4 catalysed ylide formation and subsequent transformations. Significantly, one-pot cross-metathesis/ylide transformations (1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition and [2, 3]-simgatropic rearrangement) also proved to be viable, establishing that the spent Ru catalyst following metathesis does not affect the subsequent Rh(II) -catalysed transformation. </p...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this thesis was to expand the substrate scope of the iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation, which represents an extremely useful methodology for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral molecules. While this chemistry has been developed and investigated mainly for the hydrogenation of unfunctionalized olefins, so far only little attention has been given to functionalized olefins. Therefore, the different research projects presented in this thesis dealt with the application of iridium catalysts to the reduction of particularly valuable substrates that are difficult to hydrogenate enantioselectively with other methods. The first chapter of this thesis gives a general introduction on asymmetric hydrogenation and the role of iridium catalysts in this context. The following two chapters deal with the investigation of new substrates in the iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation using various N,P ligands developed in the Pfaltz group, and give an account of the superior results that have been obtained with such catalysts compared to those representing the state-of-the-art. In particular, chapter two concerns the reduction of vinylsilanes, for which the judicious choice of the best catalyst for each specific substrate was required to achieve good results in term of both chemical and optical yield. On the contrary, a pyridinyl phosphitine bearing a 2, 6 -difluorophenyl group on the oxazoline ring was best suited for a broad array of 2 -alkyl- and aryl- substituted maleic acid dimethyldiester, as reported in chapter three. Such process turned out to be enantioconvergent, allowing the hydrogenation of mixtures of <b>maleates</b> and fumarates in high enantiomeric excesses. In chapter four the deployment of environmentally friendly solvents such as THF and 2 -MeTHF in the iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 3, 3 -disubstituted allylic alcohols is described. Finally, chapter five of this dissertation deals with the development of new NHC ligands for the iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of acid-labile substrates such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl protected allylic alcohols. Experimental details and characterization of the substances discussed in the main body of this manuscript is reported in the experimental section that constitutes chapter six...|$|R
