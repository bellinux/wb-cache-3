Presence of GCC in any other tissue of the body represents colorectal metaplasia. Because of its high sensitivity, RT-PCR screening for GCC greatly reduces underestimation of disease stage.

50|$|The similarity-based virtual {{screening}} (a kind of ligand-based virtual screening) {{assumes that}} all compounds in a database {{that are similar}} to a query compound have similar biological activity. Although this hypothesis is not always valid, quite often the set of retrieved compounds is considerably enriched with actives. To achieve high efficacy of similarity-based screening of databases containing millions of compounds, molecular structures are usually represented by <b>molecular</b> <b>screens</b> (structural keys) or by fixed-size or variable-size <b>molecular</b> fingerprints. <b>Molecular</b> <b>screens</b> and fingerprints can contain both 2D- and 3D-information. However, the 2D-fingerprints, which are a kind of binary fragment descriptors, dominate in this area. Fragment-based structural keys, like MDL keys, are sufficiently good for handling small and medium-sized chemical databases, whereas processing of large databases is performed with fingerprints having much higher information density. Fragment-based Daylight, BCI, and UNITY 2D (Tripos) fingerprints are the best known examples. The most popular similarity measure for comparing chemical structures represented by means of fingerprints is the Tanimoto (or Jaccard) coefficient T. Two structures are usually considered similar if T > 0.85 (for Daylight fingerprints). However, it is a common misunderstanding that a similarity of T > 0.85 reflects similar bioactivities in general ("the 0.85 myth").|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the feasibility of <b>molecular</b> <b>screening</b> of tumour samples for matching patients with cancer to targeted therapies. However, {{most of them have}} been carried out at institutional or national level. Herein, we report on the pilot phase of AURORA (NCT 02102165), a European multinational collaborative <b>molecular</b> <b>screening</b> initiative for advanced breast cancer patients. Forty-one patients were prospectively enroled at four participating centres across Europe. Metastatic tumours were biopsied and profiled using an Ion Torrent sequencing platform at a central facility. Sequencing results were obtained for 63 % of the patients in real-time with variable turnaround time stemming from delays between patient consent and biopsy. At least one clinically actionable mutation was identified in 73 % of patients. We used the Illumina sequencing technology for orthogonal validation and achieved an average of 66 % concordance of substitution calls per patient. Additionally, copy number aberrations inferred from the Ion Torrent sequencing were compared to single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and found to be 59 % concordant on average. Although this study demonstrates that powerful next generation genomic techniques are logistically ready for international <b>molecular</b> <b>screening</b> programs in routine clinical settings, technical challenges remain to be addressed in order to ensure the accuracy and clinical utility of the genomic data. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Ethambutol (EMB) is a {{first-line}} {{drug for}} the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Resistance to EMB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates is mediated by mutations in several genes involved in arabinan synthesis notably three emb (arabinosyl transferase) and iniA (isoniazid-inducible) genes. Most epidemiologically unrelated EMB-resistant M. tuberculosis strains contain mutations at embB codons 306, 406 and 497, embC-embA intergenic region (IGR) and iniA codon 501 (iniA 501). Objective To develop a more comprehensive <b>molecular</b> <b>screen</b> for EMB-resistance detectioamong epidemiologically unrelated EMB-resistant M. tuberculosis strains previously analyzed for embB codon 306, 406 and 497 mutations by including analysis of mutations at iniA 501 and in embC-embA IGR. Methods Fifty consecutive and phenotypically documented EMB-resistant and 25 pansusceptible M. tuberculosis strains isolated from 75 different TB patients over a four-year period in Kuwait were analyzed. Mutations at iniA 501 were detected by PCR amplification followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns generated with Hpy 99 I. Direct DNA sequencing was used to confirm RFLP results and for detecting mutations in embC-embA IGR. Results Nearly same number of EMB-resistant M. tuberculosis strains were resistant to EMB alone and EMB together with additional resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid (9 of 50, 18 % and 11 of 50, 22 %, respectively). All the 25 pansusceptible strains contained wild-type sequences at iniA 501 and in embC-embA IGR. The analysis of 50 EMB-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates showed that only one strain contained a mutated iniA 501 while no mutation was detected in embC-embA IGR in any of the isolate. Conclusion Analysis of iniA 501 and embC-embA IGR in epidemiologically unrelated EMB-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates in Kuwait indicate that mutations at these locations occur very infrequently and their inclusion {{for the development of a}} comprehensive <b>molecular</b> <b>screen</b> will make only minor contribution towards rapid EMB resistance detection. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: A major {{outbreak}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurred in locations C and Z of our hospital and lasted for several years. It affected 1, 230 patients and 153 personnel. Methods: Outbreak management was installed {{according to the}} Dutch "search and destroy" policy. A rapid, high-throughput method for <b>molecular</b> <b>screening</b> of potential MRSA carriers was implemented. Outbreak isolates were retrospectively genotyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Costs of <b>molecular</b> <b>screening</b> were compared with screening by culture. Results: Genotyping results revealed 4 distinct epidemic MRSA clones. Three were present in hospital C. Because of a merger of hospitals, these clones spread to hospital Z. Another clone of MRSA affected other health care-related institutions in the region. Because of the implementation of strict containment measures of the "search and destroy" policy, the annual number of tests decreased from 100, 000 to 18, 000. The disposables and reagents used in polymerase chain reaction technology are more expensive than those of conventional methods. However, the clinical and economic benefits of fast results in regard to expenses of the hospital clearly outweigh the higher costs of screening. Conclusion: The implementation of a rapid, high-throughput <b>molecular</b> <b>screening</b> system greatly contributed {{to the effectiveness of}} strict containment measures of the "search and destroy" policy.

The objectives of this review are to address two questions concerning this issue: (1) {{are there any}} alternatives for improving consistency in oocyte yields? (2)   {{is it possible to}} develop a molecular diagnostic test for oocytes with blastocyst potential? Studies in sheep with a heterozygous inactivating mutation in the oocyte-derived growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP 15), report increased oocyte yields and significantly more offspring. Moreover, partial immuno-neutralization of BMP 15 bioactivity increases oocyte yield without modifying gonadotropin or ovarian steroid secretion. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the development of BMP 15 antagonists may prove them to be suitable alternatives to exogenous gonadotropins.

In contrast to previous reports, several of these Ds elements lack direct repeats flanking the deletion junctions and filler DNA in the donor Ac.

40|$|Embryonic {{polarity}} of invertebrates, amphibians {{and fish}} is specified largely by maternal determinants, which fixes cell fates early in development. In contrast, amniote embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. How is their polarity determined?

A <b>molecular</b> <b>screen</b> to find upstream regulators of cVg 1 in normal embryos and in embryos manipulated to form twins now uncovers the transcription factor Pitx 2 as a candidate.

For the majority of the targets, the consensus enrichment for multiple models was better than or comparable to that of the holo and apo X-ray structures.
