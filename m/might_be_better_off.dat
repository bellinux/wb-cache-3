500|$|In {{a review}} of the Virtual Console release, Lucas M. Thomas of IGN praised KOF '94 for its graphics, {{including}} fluid animation and vibrant colors, but concluded that buyers <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> waiting for the improved sequels to arrive on the Virtual Console. According to IGN's Jeremy Dunham, the game [...] "was essentially a cross between Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting," [...] with a faster control response. He added commented that the creation of three-on-three battles was an advanced feature for a game from 1994 and the idea of 'borrowing' characters from other games from the company was also innovative. Reviewing the Virtual Console release, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer identified the use of characters from multiple franchises and the Team Battle Mode as the most distinctive points. He concluded the game to be [...] "a solid, technical fighting game that, like most SNK outings, skews more towards the hardcore player than the casual punching aficionado." [...] According to Kyle Knight of Allgame, the graphics and sounds, while better than most games of the time, were subpar by SNK standards. He concluded The King of Fighters '94 is [...] "a very good fighting game, but it lacks some refinements that would have made it great." ...|$|E

Kelefa Sanneh, writing in The New York Times, felt that it missed the harmonies Beyoncé had in Destiny's Child records and that she is more effective [...] "when she's got a posse behind her". Rob Fitzpatrick of NME called it [...] "a cruel glimpse of a talent that occasionally blazes but is frustratingly inconsistent". Uncut called its ballads [...] "self-pitying/self-mythologising", while Q stated, [...] "She has good songs, but no great songs". Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols expressed that it [...] "demonstrates vocal finesse [...] But, especially on the ballads, [...] often drags things out with diva acrobatics". The Guardians Adam Sweeting wrote that [...] "the desperate urge to cover every musical base from dancefloor to soul-ballad {{means that there is}} barely a track here with any distinctive identity or even a tune". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy" [...] as the album's highlights and quippedly remarked, [...] "Dangerously in Love ... with her daddy, the bonus cut reveals—as if we didn't know." [...] He gave the album a one-star honorable mention, indicating [...] "a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like." [...] In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that [...] "the first half is good enough to make Dangerously in Love one of the best mainstream urban R records released in 2003, and makes a strong case that Beyoncé <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> fulfilling this destiny instead of reuniting with Destiny".|$|E

In the long run, getting water proves a problem, and dragging {{it all the}} way from the distant spring becomes a backbreaking experience. Jean asks to borrow Ugolin's mule, but is met only with vague excuses. Then, when the rain does come, it falls on the surrounding area but not where it is needed. Jean loudly berates God, whom he thinks has already given him enough trouble by deforming him. Later, the dusty winds of the sirocco also arrive, bringing the farm to near-catastrophe. Jean is undeterred, and decides to dig a well. At this point Ugolin sees it fitting to try and convince Jean that his project is hopeless, and that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> selling. Jean asks how much he could expect to receive for the farm, and Ugolin gives an estimate of around 8,000 francs. Jean has no intention of leaving though, but wants to use the value of the property to take up a mortgage of half that sum. Ugolin is not happy, but Papet again sees opportunity: he will himself grant the mortgage; that way he will either earn the interest, or drive Jean away for good. From the money Jean buys dynamite to finish the well, but in his first blast is hit by a flying rock and falls into the cavity. At first the injuries seem minor, but it turns out his spine is fractured and when the doctor arrives he declares Jean dead. Ugolin returns with the news to Papet, who asks him why he's crying. [...] "It is not me who's crying," [...] he responds, [...] "it's my eyes".|$|E

6000|$|If but one work of Ruskin {{is to be}} read, let it be Sesame and Lilies (1865), {{which is}} one of the books that no {{intelligent}} reader can afford to neglect. The first chapter, [...] "Of Kings' Treasuries," [...] is a noble essay on the subject of reading. The second, [...] "Of Queens' Gardens," [...] is a study of woman's life and education, a study which may appear old-fashioned now, but which has so much of truth and beauty that it must again, like Colonial furniture, become our best fashion. These two essays [Footnote: A third essay, [...] "The Mystery of Life," [...] was added to Sesame and Lilies. It is a sad, despairing monologue, and the book <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> without it.] contain Ruskin's best thought on books and womanly character, and also an outline of his teaching on nature, art and society. If we read Sesame and Lilies in connection with two other little books, Crown of Wild Olive, which treats of work, trade and war, and Ethics of the Dust, which deals with housekeeping, we shall have the best that Ruskin produced for his younger disciples.|$|E

60|$|There {{was another}} {{attraction}} in his profession: it wanted reform, {{and gave a}} man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its venal decorations and other humbug, and to be the possessor of genuine though undemanded qualifications. He went to study in Paris with the determination that when the provincial home again he would settle in some provincial town as a general practitioner, and resist the irrational severance between medical and surgical knowledge {{in the interest of}} his own scientific pursuits, {{as well as of the}} general advance: he would keep away from the range of London intrigues, jealousies, and social truckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as Jenner had done, by the independent value of his work. For it must be remembered that this was a dark period; and in spite of venerable colleges which used great efforts to secure purity of knowledge by making it scarce, and to exclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in relation to fees and appointments, it happened that very ignorant young gentlemen were promoted in town, and many more got a legal right to practise over large areas in the country. Also, the high standard held up to the public mind by the College of which which gave its peculiar sanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction obtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not hinder quackery from having an excellent time of it; for since professional practice chiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> with more drugs still, if they could only be got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic prescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees. Considering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to the number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist in the teeth of all changes, it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the units was the most direct mode of changing the numbers. He meant to be a unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that spreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the averages, and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an advantageous difference to the viscera of his own patients. But he did not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He was ambitious of a wider effect: he was fired with the possibility that he might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link in the chain of discovery.|$|E
