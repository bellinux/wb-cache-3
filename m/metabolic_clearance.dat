25|$|The {{evidence}} {{for or against}} the importance of limiting caffeine intake during pregnancy is insufficient and of low quality. There are conflicting reports in the scientific literature about caffeine consumption during pregnancy. A 2011 risk analysis review found that caffeine consumption during pregnancy {{does not appear to}} increase the risk of congenital malformations, miscarriage or growth retardation even when consumed in moderate to high amounts. There is some evidence that the hormonal changes during pregnancy slow the <b>metabolic</b> <b>clearance</b> of caffeine from the system, causing a given dose to have longer-lasting effects (as long as 15hours in the third trimester). There is some evidence that higher caffeine intake by pregnant women may be associated with a higher risk of giving birth to a low birth weight baby, and may be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss. A systematic review, analyzing the results of observational studies, suggests that women who consume large amounts of caffeine (greater than 300mg/day) prior to becoming pregnant may have a higher risk of experiencing pregnancy loss.|$|E

40|$|Effect of {{folic acid}} on {{methionine}} and homocysteine metabolism in {{end-stage renal disease}}. BackgroundThe pathogenesis of hyperhomocysteinemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is unclear. Folic acid lowers, but does not normalize, the plasma homocysteine level in patients with ESRD, but its effect on whole body metabolism of homocysteine is unknown. MethodsWe studied the effect of 3 weeks of oral treatment with 5 mg folic acid per day on homocysteine metabolism in six chronic hemodialysis patients and six healthy controls. Primed, continuous infusions with [2 H 3 -methyl- 1 - 13 C] methionine {{were used to determine}} flux rates of methionine transmethylation, homocysteine remethylation, and homocysteine transsulfuration. <b>Metabolic</b> homocysteine <b>clearance</b> was defined as the ratio of transsulfuration and plasma homocysteine level. ResultsFolic acid treatment lowered plasma homocysteine significantly by 39 % (95 % CI 5 to 73) in the ESRD group, but plasma homocysteine remained higher than baseline values in the control group. In ESRD patients, homocysteine remethylation and methionine transmethylation rate increased by 34 % (95 % CI 5 to 62) and 22 % (95 % CI 5 to 39), respectively (i. e., levels that were similar to the baseline values of the control group). Transsulfuration rate and <b>metabolic</b> homocysteine <b>clearance</b> were not significantly altered by folic acid treatment in both the ESRD and the control group. ConclusionIn ESRD patients, folic acid treatment lowers, but does not normalize plasma homocysteine, whereas homocysteine remethylation and methionine transmethylation increase to levels found in untreated healthy controls.

40|$|Increased {{metabolism}} of thyroid hormones {{was observed}} in rats adapted to an ambient temperature of 4 °C. The increased hormonal degradation was manifested in enhanced metabolic, urinary deiodinative, biliary, and fecal clearances of iodothyronines. Increased <b>metabolic</b> <b>clearances</b> were due to stimulation of cellular hormonal disposition, evidenced by elevated intrinsic cellular clearances. After adaptation, the concentration of protein-bound iodine in plasma was decreased, and the binding of the hormones by plasma proteins was increased. The enhanced rate of metabolism of iodothyronines was associated with stimulation of the binding of these hormones by diverse tissues, suggesting the participation of extrahepatic degradative foci in the increased hormonal deiodination observed in vivo. Increased hepatocellular binding and a significantly enlarged hepatic distribution space of thyroxine were noted. Hepatocellular binding of triiodothyronine was similarly augmented, and a smaller but {{significant increase in the}} hepatic space of this iodothyronine was detected. Analysis of the hepatic subcellular partition of iodothyronines 35 min after the intravenous administration of isotopically labeled thyroid hormones disclosed increased hormonal binding by the microsomal fraction in cold-adapted animals and an attendant increase in the microsomal protein concentration. Partial microsomal subfractionation in a discontinuous sucrose gradient indicated that the observed stimulation of microsomal hormonal binding was associated with proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum...|$|R

One early analogue substituted the amino acid L-alanine (abbreviated as Ala or A) at the 2nd position of the peptide structure for its optical isomer (mirror image), D-alanine (abbreviated as D-Ala). This substitution resulted in a peptide bond between D-Ala and the 3rd amino acid in the structure aspartic acid (Asp) more able to resist rapid cleavage by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4, a cleavage which had previously led to an inactive peptide fragment.

Measurements were carried out in steady state; a range of insulinemia from 50 μ U/ml to 6 U/ml was tested. The kinetics of insulin catabolism by the kidney was not significantly influenced by the increase in concentration and by the iodination of the hormone; the degradation of the molecule was rapid and complete leading to a release of free iodide balancing the uptake of labeled insulin. The hepatic rate of catabolism was rapidly altered by increasing the plasma level and by iodination. The labeled insulin taken up was only partially degraded to free iodide and partially remained trapped within hepatic tissues.

The infusion of furosemide increased urine volume, sodium excretion, osmolal clearance, and PRA, but decreased circulating ANP levels and urinary clearance and fractional excretion of AVP. Since there was a positive correlation between circulating ANP and urinary clearance of AVP in these experiments, we infused human aANP in physiological amounts and found increases in the urinary and <b>metabolic</b> (nonurinary) <b>clearances</b> of AVP. The changes in urinary clearance of AVP in all three experiments occurred even in relation to creatinine clearance. These observations demonstrate that urinary clearance of AVP does not correlate with urine volume, sodium or solute excretion, or PRA.

Quinapril and quinaprilat concentrations were determined in perfusate, urine, and perfusate ultrafiltrate using a specific and sensitive reversed-phase HPLC procedure with radiochemical detection, coupled to liquid scintillation spectrometry.

The total renal learance of quinapril (CLr) was calculated as Dose/AUC (0 -∞), and is represented by the sum of its urinary and <b>metabolic</b> <b>clearances.</b> The urinary clearances (CLe) of quinapril and quinaprilat were calculated as urinary excretion rate divided by midpoint perfusate concentration for each respective species.

The clearance ratio of quinapril [CR=CLr/(fu·GFR) ] was 41. 0, a value representing extensive tubular secretion into the renal cells.

The commercial SABAs, salbutamol and terbutaline are resistant to COMT but are slowly metabolised by MAO, while the LABAs are resistant to both COMT and MAO. Also, the long duration of action for salmeterol is related to increased lipophilicity of the molecules, allowing it to remain for a longer time in the lungs. β2-agonists are mainly eliminated by the renal process after parenteral administration, while after oral administration a more pronounced <b>metabolic</b> <b>clearance</b> (high first pass effect) is responsible for a low bioavailability.
