40|$|Erythropoietin (EPO) is a {{glycoprotein}} {{produced by}} the kidney which stimulates red blood cell production. It is generally accepted that hypoxia is the main stimulus for its production. Recently some groups have suggested that other mechanisms than hypoxia might as well result in increased EPO synthesis. It {{is not clear whether}} this new mechanism of EPO production can be widely accepted. Therefore, getting new insights into the EPO production {{is one of the main}} objectives of this research project. In addition to its known erythropoietic effects, over the past 20 years numerous unexpected nonhematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. Besides the kidney and liver, several organs and sites have been discovered to secrete EPO, including cardiomyocytes, neurons, astrocytes, microglia, peripheral endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, ovarian cells and <b>many</b> <b>others.</b> <b>Studies</b> indicate that the use of Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESAs) is associated with serious side effects. There is an increased risk of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney failure patients when serum hemoglobin (Hb) levels exceed the recommended values of < 13 g/dL. 3 So considering the side-effects of ESAs, and keeping in mind the potential pleiotropic properties of EPO, we sought if stimulating endogenous EPO production within physiologic range could provide any organ protective effects, in particular cardioprotection in a clinical model of ischemia/ reperfusion.

Nine surveys {{have been carried out}} since the first one in 1989, covering nine representative provinces of China including Liaoning, Shandong and Jiangsu in the east, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei and Hunan in the Central region, and Guizhou and Guangxi in the west. The survey contains information on demographic characteristics, employment and work, consumption and expenditure, diet and nutrition, health condition, and leisure time activities. While CHNS has been used mainly for studies of health related topics, it contains rich information that has allowed for studies of labor issues (Chen et al. 2014), children’s education (Chyi and Zhou 2014), income inequality (Ward 2014) and <b>many</b> <b>others.</b> <b>Studies</b> on minimum wage issues in China have started to use micro-level data only in recent years because micro-level data are limited and are often not publicly available for research.

40|$|Organizational {{structures}} of any agency determine {{the efficiency of}} that agency in the fulfillment of its mandate in service delivery since it galvanizes the operations therein. In an attempt to address the various environmental problems defacing the cities, the Nigerian government had set up environmental protection agencies with the sole mandate of protecting and developing the environment. This task seems so challenging to these agencies that despite what seem to be their spirited efforts over the years; the problems persist and even {{seems to be on}} the increase including erosion, flooding, traffic congestion, pollution and solid waste management problems among <b>many</b> <b>others.</b> <b>Studies</b> have established that factors such as manpower, funding, equipment, and even changes in administration among others do have significant influence on the performance of these agencies. It is evident that there had been an increment in government budgetary provisions for the services of these agencies to the tune of billions of naira and yet, there is little or nothing to show for it. This study therefore looks into the Organizational structure of the environmental management agency in the cities of Awka and Onitsha in Anambra State, Nigeria with a view to examining its composition and operations towards addressing the challenges of urban environmental problems of the cities.

40|$|The {{progress}} {{of science in}} search of new techniques of the nerve regeneration and the functional repair in reinnervated muscle has {{been the target of}} many researchers around the world. Consequently, nerves and muscles in different body segments asked for more enlightenment of their morphology, their interrelation with other anatomic structures and their peculiarities. One of the most significant areas that need deeper studies is the region of the head and neck, since they are often affected by important pathologies. In order to offer the researcher`s community a morphological myoneural interaction model, this study elected the levator labii superioris muscle and its motor nerve, the buccal branch of the facial nerve (VII pair) not only for its special characteristics, but also its value on the facial expression. The rat was chosen for this investigation for being easy to obtain, to keep, to manipulate and to compare this experiment with <b>many</b> <b>others</b> <b>studies</b> previously published. The techniques used were Mesoscopic (dissection), histoenzymologic and morphometric ones. In the results the muscle proved to have a predominance of fast twich fibers (FG and FOG) and superficial location, with a proximal bone and a distal cutaneous insertion. Its motor nerve, the buccal branch of the facial nerve (VII pair), breaks through the muscle belly into its deep face, and comprised a heterogeneous group of myelinic nerve fibers disposed in a regular form in all fascicle. Near the motor point, the nerve showed to be composed of two fascicles with different sizes. Due to the small nerve dimensions, the nerve fibers have a smaller diameter if compared to the motor nerve of pectineus muscle of the cat. Further studies with neural tracers have already had a start in order to provide more information about the distribution and the architecture of these fibers. FAPES...|$|E

40|$|Recently, Birsen Cakir et al. {{have defined}} {{a role for}} the abscisic acid {{signalling}} ASR peptide in the regulation of heterotrophic sugar metabolism, highlighting the importance of cross-talk between these signal trans-duction pathways in a broad species range. Analyses of developmental changes in tomato fruit metabolism suggest that the import of hexoses is also similarly regulated in this species. Taken together with the pre-viously defined characteristics of ASR peptides, these findings should facilitate further dissection of the chan-ging sugar and hormonal signal circuitry during fruit development. Recent work by Birsen Cakir and colleagues [1] suggests a novel function for the ASR [abscisic acid (ABA), stress and ripening] protein family in fruit sugar metabolism. By means of a yeast one-hybrid approach, these authors isolated the grape ASR gene (VvMSA), a transcriptional regulator, using a proximal promoter region of the grape hexose transporter VvHT 1 [2] as bait. This genomic region compromises two ‘sugar boxes ’ (sucrose box 3 and SURE 1 sequences [3]) and its activity has previously {{been shown to be}} induced by sugars in tobacco plants [4]. The authors demonstrated specific binding of VvMSA to these elements at the VvHT 1 promoter. Moreover, regulation of VvHT 1 by VvMSA was shown in vivo by using promoter::reporter gene fusions to conduct co-expression experiments. These important findings, together with the unexpected absence of these proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, allow us to conceive new ways for studying the cross-talk between sugar metabolism and ABA signalling in fruits. Discovery of ASR genes To give historical perspective to the recent findings of Cakir et al. [1], we will briefly describe the key papers that preceded this work.
