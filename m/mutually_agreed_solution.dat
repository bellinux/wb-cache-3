[...] "The decision to deny the plea of Massimiliano Latorre for an extension of his stay in Italy for medical treatment and to refuse Salvatore Girone permission to spend the Christmas period at home is disappointing, as a long awaited <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>solution</b> has not yet proved possible," [...] said Mogherini, a former Italian foreign minister, in a statement. [...] "The situation of these two European military personnel has been pending for almost three years now. The EU has consistently called for a mutually agreeable solution, in the interest of both Italy and India, based on international law. The issue has the potential to impact the overall European Union-India relations and has also a bearing on the global fight against piracy, to which the EU is strongly committed," [...] she stated.|$|E
40|$|In a {{conventional}} compulsory arbitration, the arbitrator faces no restraints {{in terms of}} deciding how to settle the dispute. Such arbitrations have certain disadvantages, namely, {{parties to the dispute}} have little incentive to reach a mutually satisfactory solution to their dispute during negotiations, and parties also have little incentive to act constructively during arbitration. The World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system does favor parties to reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>solution</b> to their dispute. Thus, one may wonder why WTO arbitrations have been carried out so far as conventional compulsory arbitrations. It arguably makes sense to ask if it would make sense to change the arbitration procedure, in order to better achieve the aims of WTO dispute settlement...|$|E

40|$|The {{natural and}} social {{sciences}} have recognized {{for some time that}} when rational agents use a shared resource (a "commons") near its capacity, the resource is doomed. This is the tragedy of the commons. The same problem will also arise when agents in a distributed AI system share a resource. In this paper, we examine the tragedy of the commons as it applies to DAI and discuss several potential solutions, including conventions, privatization of the resource, and mutual coercion <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> upon. <b>Solutions</b> to this problem in DAI testbeds will likely also contribute to understanding how to avoid the tragedy of the commons in many areas of current interest to society, such as fisheries management, preservation of whale and other species populations, global climate change, and preservation of tropical rainforests.

40|$|Agent {{negotiation}} {{is a form}} {{of decision}} making where two or more agents jointly search for a <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>solution</b> to a certain problem. In multi-issue negotiation, with information available about the agents 2 ̆ 7 preferences, a negotiation may result in a mutually beneficial agreement. In a competitive negotiation environment, however, self-interested agents may not be willing to reveal their preferences, and this can increase the difficulty of negotiating a mutually beneficial agreement. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a Bayesian-based approach which can help an agent to predict its opponent 2 ̆ 7 s preference in bilateral multi-issue negotiation. The proposed approach employs Bayesian theory to analyse the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s historical offers and to approximately predict the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s preference over negotiation issues. A counter-offer proposition algorithm is also integrated into the prediction approach to help agents to propose mutually beneficial offers based on the prediction results. Experimental results indicate good performance of the proposed approach in terms of utility gain and negotiation efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Every third dispute {{brought to}} the WTO and not {{withdrawn}} early is settled amicably through a <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>solution</b> (MAS). This includes high-profile and long-standing WTO disputes such as EC-Bananas or Softwood Lumber. By offering a negotiated solution to hard cases, MAS have added stability to the multilateral trading system. MAS, however, also raise concerns. Settlements favour the instant resolution of disputes, but may conflict with third party interests and collective stakes. Where WTO members use their MAS to contract out of WTO law (‘WTO+'/‘WTO-'MAS), the multilateral trading system may be at risk. In addition, new forms of bilateral (interim-) settlements not foreseen in the DSU have recently emerged which currently escape multilateral disciplines. This article assesses how well the DSU balances the competing interests involved in amicable settlements, preserving the contractual flexibility of disputants while safeguarding multilateral interests. Contributing to current DSU reform debates, the article rejects the need for greater MAS enforceability, endorses the strengthening of procedural and substantive safeguards protecting collective stakeholders in settlements, and calls for new DSU disciplines on interim-settlement...|$|E
40|$|One {{innovation}} {{submitted for}} {{the review of}} the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) has been to extend the interim review to the appeal procedure before the Appellate Body. The proposal seeks to enhance Members control over the outcome of the dispute settlement proceeding. In contrast, numerous commentators have argued for the elimination of the interim review from the DSU by questioning its utility and giving preference to time savings for the proceedings. The merits of both proposals, elimination or extension, should be evaluated {{on the basis of the}} interim review's contribution to the effective resolution of disputes between parties. Based on past experience, this article evaluates the interim review's role to reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>solution</b> (MAS) and to provide parties the opportunity to introduce new evidence, raise new legal arguments or request clarifications and corrections. To that effect, it examines the scope of the interim review as interpreted by the adjudicative bodies of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and identifies the limitations on the scope of Member's control during the interim review. The article concludes that an extension to the appeal stage would be of limited utility and potentially even incompatible with essential prerequisites of a legalistic procedure. As regards the panel stage, parties' rights would not be prejudiced by the removal of the interim review from the proceedings.

40|$|In May 2003, the United States, Canada, and Argentina {{initiated}} {{a dispute with}} the European Union concerning the EU’s de facto moratorium on biotechnology product approvals, in place since 1998. Although the EU effectively lifted the moratorium in May 2004 by approving a genetically engineered (GE) corn variety (MON 810), the three complainants pursued the case, in part because a number of EU member states continue to block already approved biotech products. Industry estimates are that the moratorium costs U. S. corn growers some $ 300 million in exports to the EU annually. Corn gluten exports from the United States to the EU have been blocked since 2007 because of a zero tolerance policy governing the accidental presence of non-approved U. S. GE corn in such shipments. On November 21, 2006, the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the dispute panel’s report, which ruled that a moratorium had existed, that bans on EU-approved GE crops in six EU member countries violated WTO rules, and that the EU failed to ensure that its approval procedures were conducted without “undue delay. ” The EU announced it would not appeal the ruling. The United States and EU agreed on November 21, 2007 (subsequently extended to January 11, 2008), as a deadline for EU implementation of the panel report. On January 11, 2008, the U. S. Trade Representative announced that, while it was reserving its rights to retaliate, it would hold off seeking a compliance ruling while the United States sought to normalize trade in biotechnology products with the EU. In the meantime, co-complainants Canada (July 15, 2009) and Argentina (March 18, 2010) have reached “final settlements” in the biotech dispute with the EU. Canada, Argentina, and the EU notified the DSB of their <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>solution</b> under Article 3. 6 of the DSU. The parties agreed to establish a bilateral dialogue on agricultural biotech market access issues of mutual interest. U. S. agricultural and trade officials continue to criticize the EU for its biotech approval processes. During the second session of the 111 th Congress, Members with agricultural interests may debate {{the issue of whether}} to continue a dialogue with the EU on re-establishing trade in biotechnology products or to seek retaliation for presumed lack of EU compliance with the panel decision...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} impact of shared {{heritage}} practices on local, non-Western, communities {{by means of a}} comparison between the Dutch Shared Cultural Heritage (GCE-) policy and the UNESCO 1972 World Heritage Convention. Specific emphasis is put on the local views regarding these practices, in an attempt to move beyond the Western and neocolonial discourse that has dominated the field for the past decades. Through the execution of an in depth literature study on the history and rationale of both the GCE-policy and the UNESCO Convention, and through the assessment of a never before published comprehensive study on the functioning and effects on the local communities of the GCE-policy, and the execution of an original study on the local views of (designation of) World Heritage Sites through the case study of Stone Town of Zanzibar, Tanzania, {{it can be said that}} in order for the shared heritage policies and practices to become more successful, they need to start taking local communities into account. At the moment the cooperation in most cases only runs through local authorities or one or two local heritage specialists, but the rest of the community is not truly taken into account. As such, their ideas, wishes, and most importantly needs are not implemented in the projects and heritage practices, which as a result struggle to survive without the initiating party’s continuous efforts and money. The Dutch and UNESCO strife to make the local communities see the intrinsic value of the heritage concerned, that they feel is so important themselves, but fail to see that all parties value specific heritage differently or for very differing reasons. For the partner countries, the main incentive to join the shared heritage practices is an economic one. Instead of judging this, both UNESCO and the Dutch heritage organizations should appreciate that this is the reality that their local counterpart organizations have to deal with, and as such they should carefully listen to the local demands in order to come to a <b>mutually</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>solution</b> to any problems regarding the heritage. Only if local communities are taken into account in the implementation of shared heritage projects and policies, can they become sustainable and self-sufficient. What is important in shared heritage practices are not shared values regarding the heritage, but a shared understanding of all the disparate values concerned...|$|E
