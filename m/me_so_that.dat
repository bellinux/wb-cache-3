And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> <b>that</b> was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{data showed}} crime was {{decreasing}} nationally, a 25–26 July Forum Research poll for the National Post suggested that Canadians believed otherwise.

As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> <b>that</b> was one of my first albums that I loved."

2500|$|In 2004, Hagen {{delivered}} {{a speech at}} a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord, where he stated that [...] "we Christians are very much concerned with children.

In the case {{that he could have}} said the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world." [...] He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would [...] "bow under to Islam," [...] if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. [...] "They have, {{in the same manner as}} Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – and then we have to fight back." [...] He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders within Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco, and chargé d'affaires of Tunisia made an unusually strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper Aftenposten.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the alleged}} {{members of the group}} of bombers, Ramiro Helmeyer, told police that Halvorssen was the leader. Helmeyer {{initially}} recanted his confession, claiming that the police [...] "tortured <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> I would accuse Thor Halvorssen". Helmeyer was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Helmeyer lost every appeal and took his case to the Supreme Court. In 1994, Halvorssen wrote a Wall Street Journal editorial stating that he had investigated Banco Latino for money laundering and for being a Ponzi scheme. Halvorssen was arrested in Caracas one day after a Banco Latino official asked him to come to Venezuela from New York for a meeting with the bank's chairman. Halvorssen was warned by a U.S. Treasury Department agent that the meeting with Banco Latino was a trap. Halvorssen went anyway and was arrested. Banco Latino {{went on to become the}} largest bank fraud in Venezuelan history. While serving his prison sentence for murder, in February 1998, Helmeyer changed his story to say the bombing campaign was financed by the Banco Latino by way of its president Gustavo Gómez López and now said that Halvorssen (who was supposedly investigating Banco Latino) was the key organizer. Helmeyer was a relative of the family that founded the Banco Latino.|$|E

2500|$|Herod {{appears in}} the Gospel {{according}} to Matthew (...) , which describes an event known as the Massacre of the Innocents. According to this account, {{after the birth of}} Jesus, some magi (astrologers) from the East visited Herod to inquire the whereabouts of [...] "the one having been born king of the Jews", because they had seen his star in the east (or, according to certain translations, at its rising) and therefore wanted to pay him homage. Herod, as King of the Jews, was alarmed at the prospect of a usurper. Herod assembled the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the [...] "Anointed One" [...] (the Messiah, Greek: Ὁ Χριστός, ho Christos) was to be born. They answered, in Bethlehem, citing [...] Herod therefore sent the magi to Bethlehem, instructing them to search for the child and, after they had found him, to [...] "report to <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> I too may go and worship him". However, after they had found Jesus, they were warned in a dream not to report back to Herod. Similarly, Joseph was warned in a dream that Herod intended to kill Jesus, so he and his family fled to Egypt. When Herod realized he had been outwitted, he gave orders to kill all boys of the age of two and under in Bethlehem and its vicinity. Joseph and his family stayed in Egypt until Herod's death, then moved to Nazareth in Galilee to avoid living under Herod's son Archelaus.|$|E
2500|$|James Melville {{studied at}} Montrose in 1569 {{under the tutelage}} of Mr Andrew Milne. Melville rehearsed Calvin's Catechisms and read Virgil's Georgics amongst other works. He used these words to {{describe}} his years of instruction: [...] " [...] The maister of the scholl, was a lerned, honest, kynd man, whom also for thankfulness I name, Mr. Andro Miln. I never got a stroke of his hand; howbeit, I committed twa stupid faults, as it were with fire and sword :—Having the candle in my hand, on a winter night, before six o'clock, in the school, sitting in the class, bairnly and negligently playing with the bent, with which the floor was strewed, it kindled, so that we had much ado to put it out with our feet. The other was being molested by a condisciple, who cut the strings of my pen and ink-horn with his pen-knife I aiming with my pen-knife to his legs to fley him he feared, and lifting now a leg and now the other, rushed on his leg upon my knife, and struck himself a deep wound in the shin of the leg, which waa a quarter of a year in curing. In the time of the trying of the matter, he saw me so humble, so feared, so grieved, yield so many tears, and by fasting and mourning at the school all day, that he said he could not find in his heart to punish me farther. But my righteous God let me not slip that fault, but gave me a warning, and remembrance what it was to be denied with blood, although negligently; for within a short space, after I had caused a cutler, newly come to the town, to polish and sharp the same pen-knife, and had bought a pennyworth of apples, and cutting and eating the same in the links, as I put the slice in my mouth, I began to lope up upon a little sand brae, having the pen.knife in my right hand, I fell, and struck myself, missing my belly, an inch deep in the inward side of the left knee, even to the bean, whereby the equity of God's judgment, and my conscience struck <b>me</b> <b>so,</b> <b>that</b> I was the more wary of knives all my days." ...|$|E
