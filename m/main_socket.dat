50|$|On the superstructure, {{pre-stressed}} twisted-strand cables {{invented by}} the designer {{were used to}} advantage on both the main strands and the suspenders, meaning the time-consuming and expensive field adjustments were unnecessary. These cables debuted in the U.S. in 1931 on Steinman and Robinsonâ€™s Waldo-Hancock Bridge near Bucksport, Maine, and their St. Johns Bridge in Portland, Oregon. A new connection method, which used sleeve nuts to connect each <b>main</b> strand <b>socket</b> to its anchorage rod, was also used. These connections, invented by Robinson and first used on the Thousand Islands Bridge the previous year, made small adjustments to the main strands very easy.|$|R
2500|$|BS 1363 [...] "13 A plugs, socket-outlets, {{adaptors}} {{and connection}} units" [...] is the <b>main</b> plug and <b>socket</b> type {{used in the}} United Kingdom. According to the IEC it is also used in over 50 countries worldwide. Some of these countries have national standards based on BS 1363, including: Ireland, Malaysia, Malta, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a 3-way 2-circuit switch is {{incorporated}} {{together with a}} regular socket, {{to be used as}} the <b>main</b> lamp <b>socket</b> in a lamp with a night light. In this configuration, the switched lamp one live terminal for the night light socket is exposed externally on the base of the socket, to be wired to the remote candelabra socket. Hence, this type of socket has a Hot terminal, a Neutral terminal, and a switched Hot terminal. This creates a confusing situation in which a keyed 3-way socket (which has a 3-contact socket at the top of it) has only two terminal screws, while a night-light socket (which does not have a 3-contact socket at the top) has three terminal screws on the base.|$|R
50|$|For use {{outdoors}} or {{in other}} wet locations (but not bathrooms) special sockets are made. These {{can be divided into}} three <b>main</b> groups, industrial <b>sockets</b> which are totally different from the standard sockets; sockets with the same pinout as normal sockets but that will only seal properly when the correct plug and socket are used together (e.g., the 5 A, 13 A, and 15 A variants of Lewden sockets) and sockets that completely enclose a normal plug with a seal around the flex (e.g., MK Masterseal).|$|R

Electric foil sockets are fixed so that the body cord plugs into the weapon at the fencer's wrist. There are two <b>main</b> varieties of <b>socket</b> in use today: the two-prong variety which has unequal diameter prongs and is held in place by a retaining clip, and the single-prong [...] "bayonette" [...] which twist-locks into place.|$|R
5000|$|All the 64-bit {{processors}} sold by AMD so {{far have}} their genesis in the K8 or Hammer project. On June 1, 2004, AMD released new versions of both the ClawHammer and Newcastle core revisions for the newly introduced Socket 939, an altered Socket 940 {{without the need for}} buffered memory. Socket 939 offered two <b>main</b> improvements over <b>Socket</b> 754: the memory controller was altered with dual-channel architecture, doubling peak memory bandwidth, and the HyperTransport bus was increased in speed from 800 MHz to 1000 MHz. Socket 939 also was introduced in the FX series {{in the form of the}} FX-55. At the same time, AMD also began to ship the [...] "Winchester" [...] core, based on a 90 nanometer process.|$|R
50|$|Machine {{depicts the}} story of racing enthusiasts Sarah (Kiara Advani) {{daughter}} of very rich businessman Balraj Thapar (Ronit Roy) and Ransh (Mustafa), who meet each other due to circumstances. Sarah is beaten by Ransh at a car race event, Sarah later finds out Ransh; new in town, is her new classmate. As their bond becomes stronger, they eventually {{fall in love and}} after the accidental death of her friend/secret lover Aditya (Eshan Shanker) their common friend, they get married. However, Ransh deceived Sarah as he is told to and kills her for her money and property by throwing her off a cliff. She is eventually saved by her college lover Aditya's twin brother Raj (Eshan Shanker) who is a Commando in the Indian Army. Then Sarah and Raj come to know the exact reason about her killing when they find out Ransh was doing all this on someone's orders and he is duping another rich businessman's daughter. They trace him and find that her own father had planned all these due to a very convoluted reason. He is not Sarah's biological father and they come to know that he only raised her as his own daughter for her wealth. He even kills Sarah's parents by planning it like an accident. When he was about to pull his gun to shoot her, Sarah shoots him and burns him alive with all the money he looted so far by shooting the <b>main</b> power <b>socket.</b> They both eventually take revenge from Ransh and he dies in the end committing his true love for Sarah leaving Sarah sad.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of brimless compared with ischial ramus containment (IRC) prosthetic sockets when using vacuum-assisted suspension (VAS) on persons with a unilateral transfemoral amputation (TFA). A randomized crossover design with a 2 d accommodation was used. People with unilateral TFA (n = 9 analyzed) were enrolled. Interventions were IRC VAS and brimless VAS <b>sockets.</b> <b>Main</b> outcome measures included coronal hip angle and vertical and lateral socket movement as measured by X-ray, skin pressure measured by Tekscan, and preference measured subjectively. The brimless design was statistically equivalent to IRC in all measured coronal hip angles and vertical and lateral socket displacement. The peak/stance mean pressure in the medial proximal aspect of the socket was 322 mmHg in the IRC compared with 190 mmHg in the brimless condition. Except for medial proximal pressure, no other measures reached statistical significance. All subjects reported the brimless design to be more comfortable than the IRC in short-term preference. Brimless VAS socket design may be a clinically viable choice for people with TFA...|$|R
40|$|Usage control generalizes {{access control}} {{to what happens}} to data in the future. We {{contribute}} to the enforcement of usage control requirements {{at the level of}} system calls by also taking into account data flow: Restrictions on the dissemination of data, for instance, as stipulated by data protection regulations, of course relate not to just one file containing the data, but likely to all copies of that file as well. In order to enforce the dissemination restrictions on all copies of the sensitive data item, we introduce a data flow model that tracks how the content of a file flows through the system (files, network <b>sockets,</b> <b>main</b> memory). By using this model, the existence of potential copies of the data is reflected {{in the state of the}} data flow model. This allows us to enforce the dissemination restrictions by relating to the state rather than all sequences of events that possibly yield copies. Generalizing this idea, we describe how usage control policies can be expre ssed in a related state-based manner. Finally, we present an implementation of the data flow model and state-based policy enforcement as well as first encouraging performance measurements...|$|R
5000|$|There are two <b>main</b> {{types of}} <b>socket</b> wrenches: impact sockets and hand sockets. Common sockets are colloquially {{referred}} to by {{counting the number of}} [...] "points" [...] (pointed corners of walls) present {{in the shape of the}} socket nut opening. For example, the hexagon shape is commonly called a [...] "6 point" [...] socket because the hexagon forms 6 [...] "points" [...] where walls intersect to create six sharp pointed corners. This system of description using [...] "points" [...] generally works well in avoiding confusion, with the exception of [...] "8-point" [...] and [...] "12-point" [...] where two very incompatible shapes exist with both having 8 [...] "points" [...] and 12 [...] "points". The vast majority of larger common nut and bolt heads are produced with the 6-point hexagonal gripping shape. Less frequently used shapes include the square 4-point, triple square 12-point (not to be confused with 12-point double hexagon), octagonal 8-point (not to be confused with the more common 8-point double square shape). These less common shapes are typically found in special applications or particular industries such as aircraft, PVC plumbing fittings or German and UK made automobiles. With rail cars, valve adjustment screws and pipe plugs the 4-point square shaped driver can still be found in wide use both male and female configurations. Nuts and bolt heads are also produced in 12-point double hexagon shapes and various types of splines more common to aircraft and aerospace applications. Most manufacturers of sockets for larger bolts produce them in 6-point (hexagonal) and limited sizes of 12-point (double-hexagonal) configurations.|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} different types of polyethylene, bone cements and one design of uncemented fixation with porous and ceramic coating using radiostereometry, bone densitometry, conventional radiography and clinical parameters. Materials and methods: Study 1 : 201 patients were extracted from 5 prospective randomised studies to evaluate femoral head penetration at two years with radiostereometry in four basic designs, cemented Lubinus and Reflection cups, uncemented Trilogy and Reflection cups. Studies II and III. 60 patients (61 hips) were randomised to receive either highly cross-linked or conventional all PE cups. 32 patients with bilateral arthrosis received hybrid THA with highly cross-linked PE on one side and conventional on the contra lateral side. Femoral head penetration and the migration of the cups were evaluated with radiostereometry in the supine and standing positions. DEXA and conventional radiography were used to {{evaluate the}} bone mineral density and radiolucencies around the cemented acetabular component. Studies IV and V: 90 patients (97 and 96 hips respectively) were stratified depended on age, gender, diagnosis and preoperative BMD to create 3 <b>main</b> groups of <b>socket</b> fixation. In the first group fluoride containing cement was used, in the second group Palacos cum Gentamicin and in the third hybrid THA with porous coated HA/TCP cup. In the hybrid group the fixation of the femoral component was again randomised to either of the two cements. The results on femoral and acetabular sides are presented separately in studies IV and V, respectively. Results: Study I: Cups with polyethylene sterilized in EtO had almost twice the proximal and 3 D penetration rates compared with gamma-sterilized polyethylene. Regression analysis showed that the type of sterilization, age and weight was the most important factors affecting the penetration rate. Studies II and III: In the cemented study the proximal penetration was lower in the study group independent of position at 3 years, while in the hybrid study the penetration was lower in the study group only in the supine position at 2 years. The migration of the cup did not differ between the plastics in both studies. At 2 years the periprosthetic radiolucency and BMD did not differ significantly between the 2 types of PE used in the cemented study. Study IV: The subsidence of the stem did not differ between the groups, but the periprosthetic BMD decreased more in fluoride cement group at 2 years. Conventional radiography revealed higher progression of radiolucent lines in the Palacos group, but only in one region. Study V: The proximal migration of the cup was almost similar in all three groups. The three dimensional migration was increased in patients with osteoporosis. Postoperative radiolucent lines tended to disappear with use of porous coating covered with HA/TCP. Conclusions: Study I: EtO sterilized polyethylene increased the femoral head penetration. Age and weight were also important predictors of the penetration rate. Studies II and III. The highly cross-linked polyethylene decreased the penetration rate mainly after one year probably reflecting less wear. The different mechanical properties of the two types of PE studied did not affect the early fixation of the cemented cup. Study IV: There were no obvious advantage of addition of fluoride to acrylic bone cement when used to fixate the femoral component. Study V: Use of fluoride containing cement or uncemented fixation did not improve the early stability of the socket compared to Palacos with Gentamicin...|$|R
