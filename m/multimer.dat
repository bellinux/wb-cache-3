2500|$|When vWD is suspected, {{blood plasma}} {{of a patient}} must be {{investigated}} for quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of vWF. [...] This is achieved by measuring the amount of vWF in a vWF antigen assay and the functionality of vWF with a glycoprotein (GP)Ib binding assay, a collagen binding assay, or a ristocetin cofactor activity (RiCof) or ristocetin induced platelet agglutination (RIPA) assays. Factor VIII levels are also performed because factor VIII is bound to vWF which protects the factor VIII from rapid breakdown within the blood. Deficiency of vWF can then lead {{to a reduction in}} factor VIII levels, which explains the elevation in PTT time. Normal levels do not exclude all forms of vWD, particularly type 2, which may only be revealed by investigating platelet interaction with subendothelium under flow, a highly specialized coagulation study not routinely performed in most medical laboratories. A platelet aggregation assay will show an abnormal response to ristocetin with normal responses to the other agonists used. A platelet function assay [...] may give an abnormal collagen/adrenaline closure time, and in most cases, a normal collagen/ADP time. Type 2N may be considered if factor VIII levels are disproportionately low, but confirmation requires a [...] "factor VIII binding" [...] assay. Additional laboratory tests that help classify sub-types of vWD include von-willebrand <b>multimer</b> analysis, modified ristocetin induced platelet aggregation assay and vWF propeptide to vWF antigen ratio propeptide. In cases of suspected acquired von-Willebrand syndrome, a mixing study should be performed. Detection of vWD is complicated by vWF being an acute phase reactant with levels rising in infection, pregnancy, and stress.|$|E

The importance of the mechanical force induced functional change is manifested in the multimeric VWF’s crucial role in blood coagulation, when high fluid shear stress activates pVWF <b>multimers</b> to bind platelets. Here we showed that a pathological level of high shear flow exposure of pVWF <b>multimers</b> results in domain conformational changes, and the subsequent shifts in the unfolding force allow us to use force as a marker to track the dynamic states of multimeric VWF. We found that shear-activated pVWF <b>multimers</b> (spVWF) are more resistant to mechanical unfolding than non-sheared pVWF <b>multimers,</b> as indicated in the higher peak unfolding force.

Treatment of the high molecular weight <b>multimers</b> with 2 -mercaptoethanol at concentrations of 0. 005 - 0. 5 % {{in the presence of}} 1 % dodecyl sulfate resulted in a shift to lower molecular weight <b>multimers.</b> Between mercaptoethanol concentrations of 0. 01 and 0. 5 %, the predominant species was the dimer of the basic subunit.

An artificial multimeric series was prepared by cross-linking von Willebrand factor subunits with dimethylsuberimidate. Comparison of the <b>multimers</b> produced by reduction with the <b>multimers</b> produced by cross-linking, demonstrated the absence of odd-numbered <b>multimers</b> from the reduced series. Thus, the protomeric unit appears to be the dimer. High molecular weight <b>multimers</b> had both ristocetin cofactor activity and Factor VIII procoagulant activity. Reduction of the protein in the absence of denaturing agents, caused a gradual shift to lower molecular weight species and a concomitant loss of von Willebrand factor activity. In contrast, Factor VIII activity was unchanged by reduction. These studies suggest that the moieties having von Willebrand factor activity and those having Factor VIII activities are covalently linked by disulfide bonds...|$|R

Here, we evaluated the functional significance of HNM in HV-dependent replication by ectopically expressing wild type and mutant forms of satRNA <b>multimers</b> in planta either in (+) or (−) -strand polarity. Comparative replication profiles revealed that (−) -strand <b>multimers</b> with complementary HNM (cHNM) are the preferred initial templates for HV-dependent replication than (−) -strand monomers and <b>multimers</b> lacking the cHNM. Further mutational analyses of the HNM accentuate that preservation of the sequence and native length of HNM is obligatory for efficient replication of satRNA.

The binding of VWF <b>multimers</b> to platelets, as well as VWF proteolysis, is regulated by shear stresses that alter VWF multimeric conformation. We used single molecule manipulation with atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the effect of high fluid shear stress on soluble dimeric and multimeric forms of VWF. VWF dimers are the smallest unit that polymerizes to construct large VWF <b>multimers.</b> The resistance to mechanical unfolding with or without exposure to shear stress was used to evaluate VWF conformational forms. Our data indicate that, unlike recombinant VWF <b>multimers</b> (RVWF), recombinant dimeric VWF (RDVWF) unfolding force is not altered by high shear stress (100 dynes/cm 2  for 3 min at  37 ∘C).

50|$|The {{advantages}} of the Streptamer technology become clear in comparison with other methods that aim to identify and purfify T cells. The main drawback using MHC multimers is that these multimers represent the natural ligand bound to the TCR. Therefore, placement of MHC multimer-stained cells into in vitro cell culture is expected to suffer from functional alterations of purified T cellpopulations like TCR internalization, activation, overstimulation and cell death. A strong negative influence on the function and phenotype in term of function and survical of MHC multimer-stained T cells was also found in vivo.This intrinsic problem of MHC <b>multimer</b> staining substantially limits the applications of the technology for basic T cell research {{as well as in}} clinical medicine.

40|$|SummaryThe normal {{functions}} and pathologic {{facets of the}} small presynaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn) are of exceptional interest. In previous studies, we found that α-syn attenuates synaptic exo/endocytosis [1, 2]; however, underlying mechanisms remain unknown. More recent evidence suggests that α-syn exists as metastable <b>multimers</b> and not solely as a natively unfolded monomer [3 – 8]. However, conformations of α-syn at synapses—its physiologic locale—are unclear, and potential implications of such higher-order conformations to synaptic function are unknown. Exploring α-syn conformations and synaptic function in neurons, we found that α-syn promptly organizes into physiological <b>multimers</b> at synapses. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that α-syn <b>multimers</b> cluster synaptic vesicles and restrict their motility, suggesting a novel role for these higher-order structures. Supporting this, α-syn mutations that disrupt multimerization also fail to restrict synaptic vesicle motility or attenuate exo/endocytosis. We propose a model in which α-syn <b>multimers</b> cluster synaptic vesicles, restricting their trafficking and recycling, and consequently attenuate neurotransmitter release...|$|R

The data suggest that ARA-induced oligomers are alpha-helical, resistant to fibril formation, more prone to disaggregation, enzymatic digestion and degradation by the 26 S proteasome, and lead to lower neuronal damage and reduced activation of microglia compared to the oligomers formed in the absence of ARA. These <b>multimers</b> can be formed at physiologically-relevant concentrations, and pathological mutants of αS form less <b>multimers</b> than wild-type αS.
