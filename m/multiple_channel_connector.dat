40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{behavior}} of <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors,</b> embedded in a concrete slab, with different concrete materials. The results {{of a series of}} limited push-out specimens were presented and discussed. The push-out tests comprise of <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors</b> in different types of concrete. Reinforcement was included in some specimens, as well. The results showed that using reinforcements in concrete slab, enhances the ductility and shear capacity of the composite system and using channels embedded in unconfined normal concrete, has a brittle performance. The channel shear capacity is less in the lightweight aggregate concrete, compared to the normal ones. Adequate ductility was reported for the <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors</b> in most of the concrete types. In addition, it was verified that the <b>channel</b> <b>connector</b> presents a very rigid behavior, during the primary phase of loading. Using <b>channel</b> <b>connectors</b> with longer length can increase the ductility of the system. In general, the <b>channel</b> shear <b>connector</b> showed a ductile behavior. The results verified using <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors,</b> embedded in tested concrete, in composite structures. The results also discussed the effect of different concrete types, on the ductility and load–displacement performance of the specimens.

40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an experimental investigation involving the testing of push-out specimens with <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors.</b> The test program involved the testing of 78 push-out specimens and was aimed at the development of new equations for <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors</b> embedded in solid concrete slabs and slabs with wide ribbed metal deck oriented parallel to the beam. The test specimens were designed to study the effect of a number of parameters on the shear capacity of <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors.</b> Six series of push-out specimens were tested in two phases. The primary difference between the two phases was the height of the <b>channel</b> <b>connector.</b> Other test parameters included the compressive strength of concrete, the length and the web thickness of the channel. Three different types of failure mechanisms were observed. In specimens with higher strength concrete, failure was caused by the fracture of the channel near the fillet with the channel web acting like a cantilever beam. Crushing-splitting of concrete was the observed mode of failure in specimens with solid slabs when lower strength concrete was used. In most of the specimens with metal deck slabs, a concrete shear plane type of failure was observed. In the specimens involving this type of failure, the <b>channel</b> <b>connector</b> remained intact and the concrete contained within the flute in front of channel web sheared off along the interface. The load carrying capacity of a <b>channel</b> <b>connector</b> increased almost linearly with the increase in channel length. On average, the increase was about 39 % when the channel length was increased from 50 mm to 100 mm. There was a further increase of 24 % when the channel length was increased from 100 mm to 150 mm. The influence of web thickness of <b>channel</b> <b>connector</b> was significant when the failure occurred due to channel web fracture but was minimal for a concrete crushing-splitting type of failure. The specimens with solid concrete slabs carried higher load compared to those with metal deck slabs. The increase in load capacity was 33 % for specimens with 150 mm long channels but only 12 % for those with 50 mm long <b>channel</b> <b>connectors.</b> This investigation resulted {{in the development of a}} new equation for predicting the shear strength of <b>channel</b> <b>connectors</b> embedded in solid concrete slabs. The proposed equation provides much better correlation to test results than those obtained using the current CSA equation. The results of specimens with metal deck slabs were used to develop a new equation for predicting the shear capacity of <b>channel</b> <b>connectors</b> embedded in slabs with metal deck oriented parallel to the beam. The values predicted by the proposed equation were in good agreement with the observed test values...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} network {{consists of a}} set of computing nodes interconnected via communication channels. It is commonly assumed that, for each pair of network nodes u and v, there is at most one channel from u to v. However, it is often desirable to have <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> between nodes. That is, for every pair of network nodes u and v, there may be <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> from u to v. In this paper, we consider the problem of providing deterministic quality of service guarantees when there are <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> between nodes. We show that any packet scheduling protocol that operates over a single channel can be modified to operate over <b>multiple</b> <b>channels.</b> In addition, this transformation increases the packet delay through the node by only a small amount. However, having <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> between nodes may cause packet reorder. This reorder significantly increases the upper bound on end-to-end delay. We show how this increase in delay is avoided through the use of efficient sorting techniques. ...|$|R

The IEEE 802. 11 standard allows {{for the use of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> available at the physical layer, but its MAC protocol is designed only for a single channel. A single-channel MAC protocol does not work well in a multi-channel environment, because of the multi-channel hidden terminal problem. Our proposed protocol enables hosts to utilize <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> by switching channels dynamically, thus increasing network throughput while increasing network analysis time. The protocol requires only one transceiver per host, but solves the multi-channel hidden terminal problem using temporal synchronization. Our scheme improves network throughput significantly, especially when the network is highly congested.

40|$|ABSTRACT:- The {{aggregate}} capacity of wireless mesh networks {{can be improved}} significantly by equipping each node with multiple interfaces and by using <b>multiple</b> <b>channel</b> {{in order to reduce}} the effect of interfaces. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have the potential for improving network capacity by employing multiple radios and <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> (MRMC). Several efforts have been made to increase capacity. One such effort is by utilization of multiple radios and <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> for data transmission which improves network throughput. Research is in progress to offer optimal network throughput by efficiently utilizing <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> in multi-hop networks. This paper focuses on the channel assignment algorithm for multi-interface multichannel wireless mesh networks based on the traffic flow of the link, which equitably distribute equalization for the business flow between nodes so that the distribution through the link on the flow is equal. The channel assignment improves network capacity by setting the value to reduce interference with the overall network interference...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{performance}} of steel-concrete composite structures relies deeply {{on the characteristics}} of the shear connectors. Recently, great attention has been focused on the implementation of C-shaped connectors due to numerous advantages when used in composite beams. However, very little information is available in regard to the response of such connectors when embedded in the high strength concrete (HSC). To address this research gap, sixteen experiments on push-out specimens were conducted to compare the {{performance of}} channel and angle shear connectors embedded in HSC. The shear resistance and ductility of the connectors were primarily investigated by applying static and cyclic loadings. Results were also compared with the cases when using normal reinforced concrete. Furthermore, the evaluation of the available equations suggested by the American and Canadian codes for estimating these connectors' capacities when using HSC was carried out. In general, <b>channel</b> <b>connectors</b> exhibited 6. 8 - 30. 1 % more shear strength than those of angle under monotonic loading, and up to 18. 5 % more when subjected to cyclic loading. Angle connectors were also less ductile than <b>channel</b> <b>connectors</b> and did not satisfy the ductility criteria specified in the codes' requirements. Connector fracture mode of failure was recorded for both connector types...|$|R
