500|$|According to Smith, [...] "The song {{is about}} hyperventilating—kissing and fainting to the floor." [...] The lyrics were {{inspired}} by a trip with his then-girlfriend (and later wife) Mary Poole to Beachy Head in southern England. Smith said the opening line of the song ("Show <b>me,</b> <b>show</b> <b>me,</b> <b>show</b> me how you do that trick") refers to his childhood memories of mastering magic tricks, but added [...] "on another , it's about a seduction trick, from much later in my life".|$|E
500|$|The game's repetitiveness was criticised by many reviewers. Sam Zucchi of Kill Screen {{said that}} the game got tedious and that the repetitiveness of {{clicking}} on objects was sometimes trivial. He {{said that it was}} as though the game was saying: [...] "No, you really don't understand. Let <b>me</b> <b>show</b> you". Alessandro Baravalle of Eurogamer said that although parts of the game were poorly managed or redundant, it did have some exciting moments. Eric Swain {{said that the}} story is great but the game as a whole is let down by the repetitiveness of some parts and, as a result, becomes exhausting to play.|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let <b>me</b> <b>show</b> you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E

[...] "Electric" [...] made its debut on the Sverigetopplistan singles chart at number eight on 22 April 1999. The next week, it ascended to acquire a peak position at number six. It became Robyn's third top-ten single on the chart, following [...] "Do You Really Want <b>Me</b> (<b>Show</b> Respect)" [...] and [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)". [...] "Electric" [...] stayed in the top-ten for four weeks, and remained on the chart for fourteen weeks in total. On 18 May 1999, it received a gold certification by the Swedish Recording Industry Association (GLF) for sales of 15,000 units.

2500|$|Robyn {{started her}} career in the pop music {{industry}} {{at the age of}} 16. She signed a record deal with RCA Records in 1994 to release her debut single, [...] "You've Got That Somethin'", in Sweden. Later that same year, her Swedish breakthrough came with the single [...] "Do You Really Want <b>Me</b> (<b>Show</b> Respect)". These singles became part of the album Robyn Is Here, released in October 1995. Robyn contributed vocals to Blacknuss' 1996 single [...] "Roll with Me." [...] She entered Sweden's pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, as co-writer and producer of the song [...] "Du gör mig hel igen" [...] ("You Make Me Whole Again"), which was performed by Cajsalisa Ejemyr.

American MC Bukue One (Tion Torrence) appears for a guest verse on [...] "Deaf Can Hear". The track is credited to Lambert, Smith, Francis, Hare and Torrence. The album {{was released}} independently but with financial assistance from Arts SA – the band were inspired, in 2005, to {{set up their own}} Hilltop Hoods Initiative, to help local artists.

2500|$|Robyn's US {{breakthrough}} came in late 1997, {{when the}} dance-pop singles [...] "Show Me Love" [...] and [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] {{reached the top}} 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. She performed on the children's show All That in 1997, singing [...] "Show Me Love", proving her growing popularity in the US. The songs also performed well in the UK. Robyn re-released [...] "Do You Really Want <b>Me</b> (<b>Show</b> Respect)" [...] internationally {{but it did not}} fare {{as well as the other}} releases. In the US, it was ineligible to chart because there was no retail single available, but it reached number 32 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The song [...] "Show Me Love" [...] was used prominently in the 1998 Lukas Moodysson film Fucking Åmål, and the song's title was used as the film's title in English-speaking countries. As Robyn's popularity grew across the globe, and especially in the US, she was diagnosed with exhaustion and returned to Sweden to recover.|$|E
2500|$|Then Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, {{preferred}} Sony's console to {{the competition}} from Sega, saying [...] "Our game designer likes the Sony machine." [...] Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, Famicom Tsūshin would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation {{a few weeks after}} its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is [...] "fairly average", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, [...] "To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war." [...] An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, [...] "Live in your world. Play in ours." [...] It is stylised as, [...] "LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS." [...] Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled [...] "You Are Not Ready" [...] or [...] "U R NOT [...]" [...] Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that [...] "it's the ultimate challenge.
