40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this study}} the {{numerical}} analysis and simulation of the <b>microstress</b> field for the polymer matrix composites are achieved by combining the finite element method with the homogenization theory {{at the location of}} the crack tip where macrostress concentration occurs. The relation of the macro–micro stress concentration is investigated, and the results obtained show that the <b>microstress</b> concentration coefficients are relevant to the material property of inclusion at the microstatus, but not with the inclusion volume fraction or the location at the macrostructure. The <b>microstress</b> field is obtained in which the material property of inclusion is changed from flexibility to rigidity and the inclusion material possesses different volume fractions. The distribution rule of concentration coefficient for the principal stress, the radial stress, the tangential stress, and the Von Mises stress is displayed along the circumferential interface of inclusion respectively.

The microstructure was examined with light microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy and Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (orientation imaging microscopy). Microhardness and scratch resistance variations inside the coating {{are related to the}} local microstructure influenced by additional heating and by melt convection during the laser track overlapping.

Neutron irradiation significantly changes the material properties by di placement of lattice atoms and the generation of helium and hydrogen by nuclear transmutation. Another important aspect of neutron irradiation is that the fast neutron can produce dense ionization at deep levels in the materials. Th polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibre of raw denier value, 78 × 2, were irradiated by fast neutron of energy, 4 × 44 MeV, at different fluences ranging from 1 ´ 109 n/cm 2 to 1 ´ 1012 n/cm 2.

40|$|The {{residual}} stress state {{in both the}} cementite and ferrite phases of cold-drawn pearlitic wires has been measured by neutron diffraction. The phase <b>microstress</b> in the axial direction is obtained. It is found that the cementite lamellae are subjected to a high tensile stress, up to 2000 MPa, after cold drawing. Measurements on etched wires showed that the phase <b>microstress</b> is nearly constant with {{the distance to the}} wire axis. Combination of these data with complementary X-ray diffraction measurements on the ferrite determines the response of each phase to the macrostress or an applied stress. Additionally, the peak broadening and texture of both phases have been studied using the neutron diffraction technique. The texture is less sharp in the cementite than in the ferrite. In the cold-drawn samples the diffraction peaks are very broad, which suggests plastic deformation of the cementite lamellae. Copyright (C) 1996 Acta Metallurgica Inc. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to minimize the residual matrix stresses in metal matrix composites. Fabrication parameters such as temperature and consolidation pressure are optimized concurrently with the characteristics (i. e., modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, strength, and interphase thickness) of a fiber-matrix interphase. By including the interphase properties in the fabrication process, lower residual stresses are achievable. Results for an ultra-high modulus graphite (P 100) /copper composite show a reduction of 21 percent for the maximum matrix <b>microstress</b> when optimizing the fabrication process alone. Concurrent optimization of the fabrication process and interphase properties show a 41 percent decrease in the maximum <b>microstress.</b> Therefore, this optimization method demonstrates the capability of reducing residual microstresses by altering the temperature and consolidation pressure histories and tailoring the interphase properties for an improved composite material. In addition, {{the results indicate that}} the consolidation pressures are the most important fabrication parameters, and the coefficient of thermal expansion is the most critical interphase property...|$|E
40|$|A new {{physical}} {{theory for}} the effects of long-term aging and drying on concrete creep is proposed. The previously proposed solidification theory, in which the aging is explained and modeled by the volume growth (into the pores of hardened Portland cement paste) of a nonaging viscoelastic constituent (cement gel), cannot explain long-term aging because the volume growth of the hydration products is too short-lived. The paper presents a revision of solidification theory in which the viscosity of the flow term of the compliance function is treated as a tangential viscosity of a nonlinear viscous power law governing very large and highly localized <b>microstress</b> in the hardened cement paste. This <b>microstress</b> is called the microprestress because it is produced during hydration by very large and highly localized volume changes, independent of loading.

INTRUDUTION Diamond film has a wide range of potential applications such as fabrication of wear-resistant protective coatings, abrasives, heat sinks and high-temperature semiconducting and optical devices, due to its exceptional unique properties. However, the residual stress in diamond fnm generated during the process of diamond growth is mostly tensile. It makes the diamond fihn brittle and easy to peel off, and becomes one of the obstacles that hinder the wide application of diamond film. To understand the origin of the residual stress in diamond film and to find ways to relax them, it is important to analyze residual stress in diamond film. There are various kinds of stress measurement methods for ‘diamond film such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) (‘I, Raman spectroscopy I 21 and the vibrating membrane method [31.

In addition to the flow rule, nonstandard boundary conditions are obtained, and as an aid to finite element solution a variational formulation of the flow rule is deduced.
