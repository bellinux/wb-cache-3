5|$|The Moon {{is thought}} to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> {{explanation}} is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> {{theory of}} the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the {{collision}} of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements {{and the fact that}} its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{concept is}} that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after {{the removal of the}} gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.|$|E

5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters {{has occurred in}} recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted,</b> but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E
5|$|Like other lambeosaurines such as Parasaurolophus and Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus had a {{distinctive}} crest {{on the top}} of its head. Its nasal cavity ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions have been made for the function or functions of the crest, including housing salt glands, improving the sense of smell, use as a snorkel or air trap, acting as a resonating chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes of the same species to recognize each other. Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> of the various hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|The ethnogenesis of Croats is {{uncertain}} {{and there are}} several competing theories, Slavic and Iranian being the most frequently put forward. The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> of these, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of White Croats from the territory of White Croatia during the Migration Period. Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin, based on Tanais Tablets containing Greek inscription of given names Χορούαθ, Χοροάθος, and Χορόαθος (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as anthroponyms of Croatian people.|$|E

5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> {{theory about}} the origin of cricket is that it first {{developed}} in early medieval times to the south and south-east of London in the geographical areas of the North Downs, the South Downs and the Weald. The counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey were therefore the earliest centres of excellence and it was from here that the game reached London, where its lasting popularity was ensured, and other southern counties like Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire and Middlesex. As early as c.1611, a cricket match was recorded at Chevening in Kent between teams representing the Downs and the Weald.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} challenges for art historians {{in establishing the}} names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists' biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an ongoing and often contentious debate. Even the <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> attributions are typically only {{as a result of}} decades of scientific and historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century. Some painters, such as Adriaen Isenbrandt and Ambrosius Benson of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.|$|E
5|$|These organisms {{appear to}} form two groups: the fractal rangeomorphs and the simpler erniettomorphs. Including such fossils as the iconic Charnia and Swartpuntia, {{the group is}} both the most iconic of the Ediacaran biota and the most {{difficult}} to place within the existing tree of life. Lacking any mouth, gut, reproductive organs, or indeed any evidence of internal anatomy, their lifestyle was somewhat peculiar by modern standards; the <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> hypothesis holds that they sucked nutrients out of the surrounding seawater by osmotrophy or osmosis. However, others argue against this.|$|E

5|$|This {{view was}} {{the norm for}} some time after Boece and is {{reflected}} in the Statistical Accounts for Aberlemno. It took until the mid-19th century for it to be pointed out that not only was there no evidence that the stones were Scandinavian in origin, there was also ample evidence that the stones were Pictish/Scottish in origin. The kirkyard stone predates the Battle of Barry by three centuries and the <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> interpretation is that the stone commemorates the Pictish victory at the historical Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 AD.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why {{secondary}} infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> hypothesis is that of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It {{may be caused by}} poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction. There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications, and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the complement system.|$|E
5|$|The first Brahmousin cattle were {{produced}} from a multiple embryo transfer from a French-imported Limousin dam. The resulting progeny were then crossed with Brahman cattle {{to achieve an}} F1 hybrid. Further crosses over a broader base led {{to the production of}} the 5/8 Limousin – 3/8 Brahman Brahmousin purebred, a mix which {{has been found to be}} the <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> and most useful for the majority of the USA. The American Brahmousin Council allows animals that are not purebred to be recorded as percentage animals as long as they are at least one-quarter Limousin and one-quarter Brahman. In order to be recorded as a purebred Brahmousin, the animal must then be sired by a registered purebred or fullblood Limousin bull, registered Brahman bull or a registered purebred Brahmousin bull.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created by}} Rembrandt in 1637. It was not given an official title. The current one is the <b>most</b> recent, <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> one. Prior and alternate names include Portrait of a Slav Prince, Portrait d'un Turc, and Man in Russian Costume. Its authenticity was supported by {{an analysis of the}} panel's wood, which showed that it was cut from a tree felled around 1635 that was also used in the painter's River Landscape with Ruins (1650). The painting underwent restoration in 1985 and has been X-rayed.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the large}} {{differences}} between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often need to agree on particular scoring rules before a game, in order to eliminate possible disputes during the game. As with gameplay, many {{attempts have been made}} to create an international standard of scoring, but <b>most</b> are not <b>widely</b> <b>accepted.</b>|$|R
40|$|While other philosophic bases {{exist for}} interpretive research, hermeneutics {{is one of}} the <b>most</b> {{original}} and <b>widely,</b> <b>accepted</b> Yet it is still largely misun-derstood by and, in many cases, un-known to persons studying commu-nication in the United States.

5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> {{model used}} to explain the {{evolution}} of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in Papilio polytes is controlled by the doublesex gene.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalent}} {{opinion is}} that the church was constructed and painted in the early 14th century, which coincides with the lifetimes of the individuals <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> as represented by the figures depicted in the church's frescoes. At the time, the village of Donja Kamenica, along {{with much of the}} Timočka Krajina region, belonged to the Vidin appanage of the Second Bulgarian Empire. However, alternative theories place the construction of the church in the mid-14th century, the mid-15th century or even the 16th century. The church and its frescoes were restored in 1958. The church was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1982, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to estimate the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33–36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} zeaspora {{is not well}} known, being an obscure and rarely {{contracted}} disease. There are several theories regarding its origin. The <b>most</b> likely, <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> by biologists, pathologists, and veterinarians alike is that it arose in the moist subtropical climate of Tierra Del Fuego, first spread by birds in the wet, foggy conditions. From there, it {{is believed to have}} been transmitted to resident human populations as well as domesticated livestock and spread northwards. The condition is transmitted in a variety of ways: predominantly through sporing and airborne infection, but physical contact with infected parts can also result in development.|$|R
30|$|However, most of {{the models}} used {{sunshine}} duration to estimate solar radiation (Al-Mostafa et al. 2014). The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> used and <b>accepted</b> method is that of Angstrom (1924) who proposed a linear relationship between the ratio of average daily global radiation to the corresponding value {{on a clear day}} and the ratio of average daily sunshine duration to the maximum possible sunshine duration.|$|R
5|$|After the Bolshevik {{revolution}} in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations {{for the release}} of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> account was that the family had been murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.|$|E
5|$|Amy Dudley's death {{caused a}} scandal. Despite the inquest's outcome, Robert Dudley was widely {{suspected}} to have orchestrated his wife's demise, a view {{not shared by}} most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth's closest favourite, but with respect to her reputation she could not risk a marriage with him. A tradition that Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley's violent death evolved early, and Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Robsart's fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott's novel, Kenilworth. The <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have probed murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner's report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February 1722, Cantillon married Mary Mahony, {{daughter}} of Count Daniel O'Mahony—a wealthy merchant and former Irish general—spending {{much of the}} remainder of the 1720s travelling throughout Europe with his wife. Cantillon and Mary had two children, a son who died at an early age and a daughter, Henrietta, who would go on to marry William Howard Earl of Stafford in 1743. Although he frequently returned to Paris between 1729 and 1733, his permanent residence was in London. In , his residence in London was burned to the ground, and it is generally assumed that Cantillon died in the fire. While the fire's causes are unclear, the <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> theory is that Cantillon was murdered. One of Cantillon's biographers, Antoine Murphy, has advanced the alternative theory that Cantillon staged his own death to escape the harassment of his debtors, appearing in Suriname under the name Chevalier de Louvigny.|$|E

50|$|The <b>most</b> {{comprehensive}} and <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> explanation, at least within economic theory, {{is that of}} Paul Krugman's New Trade Theory. Krugman argues that economies specialise {{to take advantage of}} increasing returns, not following differences in regional endowments (as contended by neoclassical theory). In particular, trade allows countries to specialise in a limited variety of production and thus reap the advantages of increasing returns (i.e., economies of scale), but without reducing the variety of goods available for consumption.|$|R
