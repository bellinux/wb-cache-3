By having good <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> <b>product</b> demanded by costumer can reach the costumer’s hand without any or with less damage. Container is one of material handling tools designed to move materials in one big unit load, but the container stability in weight is a problem that has to be considered for the safeties and easiness when the container will be transported to another place or location. This paper proposes an analytical model to optimize the weight distribution in one container. The model has capability in optimizing the cargo position inside the container to get the most stable cargo weight distribution. A case study example is also presented to illustrate the model...|$|E

50|$|Product handling: in {{conveyor}} systems {{that may be}} suited {{for a wide variety}} of products, such as those in distribution centers, it is important that each new product be deemed acceptable for conveying before being run through the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> equipment. Boxes that are too small, too large, too heavy, too light, or too awkwardly shaped may not convey, or may cause many problems including jams, excess wear on conveying equipment, motor overloads, belt breakage, or other damage, and may also consume extra man-hours in terms of picking up cases that slipped between rollers, or damaged product that was not meant for <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> If a <b>product</b> such as this manages to make it through most of the system, the sortation system will most likely be the affected, causing jams and failing to properly place items where they are assigned.

There are many factors affects the storage assignment. For example, order picking method, size and layout of the storage system, <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system, <b>product</b> characteristics, demand trends, turnover rates and space requirements. Selecting appropriate storage assignment policies (i. e. random, dedicated or class-based) and routing methods (i. e. transversal, return or combined) with regards to above factors is a possible solution to tackle this problem. However, the efficiency of these policies is interdependent. This paper aims to present a simulation study of a real case regarding storage assignment problem of a manual-pick and multi-level rack warehouse. Performance of the case is measured in terms of travel distance and order retrieval time. The results of the study indicate that the key to effective implementation of a storage assignment system is to match the types of warehouse storage system and the variety of items in the customer order.

40|$|One of {{the factors}} that has a {{significant}} impact on the socio-economic development of the Russian Federation’s regions is the logistics infrastructure. It provides integrated transportation and distribution service of material flows. One of the main elements of logistics infrastructure is a storage infrastructure, which includes distribution center, distribution-and-sortout and sortout warehouses. It is the most expedient to place distribution center in the vicinity of the regional center. One of the tasks of the distribution network creation within the regions of the Russian Federation is to determine the location, capacity and number of stores. When determining regional network location of general purpose warehouses methodological approaches to solving the problems of location of production and non-production can be used which depend on various economic factors. The mathematical models for solving relevant problems are the deployment models. However, the existing models focus on the dimensionless power storage. The purpose of the given work is to develop a model to determine the optimal location of general-purpose warehouses on the Russian Federation area. At the first stage of the work, the authors assess the main economic indicators influencing the choice of the location of general purpose warehouses. An algorithm for solving the first stage, based on ABC, discriminant and cluster analysis were proposed by the authors in earlier papers. At the second stage the specific locations of general purpose warehouses and their power is chosen to provide the cost minimization for the construction and subsequent maintenance of warehouses and transportation heterogeneous products. In order to solve this problem the authors developed a mathematical model that takes into account the possibility of delivery in heterogeneous goods from suppliers and manufacturers in the distribution and storage sorting with specified set of capacities. The model allows determining the capacity and location of the home network of warehouses in the Russian Federation regions based on the minimization of the total costs associated with the delivery of goods from suppliers / manufacturers to the warehouse and from the warehouse to customers, <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>products,</b> and annual operating costs for the maintenance of the core network of warehouses...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 22, 2016 - June 22, 2018 Small and medium-sized enterprises that are characterized by high-mix, low-volume, and highly variable production operations often have unstructured material movement processes that are prone to <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. These sub-optimal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems are oftentimes a result of small and medium-sized enterprise's limited resources. Current tools to assist organizations in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are resource intensive, complex, or too vague. <b>Material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are defined in this research as: a) inappropriate <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> b) operator search time, and c) inefficient forklift routing. To help {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} reduce <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes it is hypothesized that tailored visual management systems 1) can be designed from the analysis of three <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes, and 2) can yield a low resource intensive solution to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. In order to test these hypotheses, a methodology to design an ad-hoc <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is developed, tested via a case study, and validated via two alternate scenarios. Results show that ad-hoc visual management systems can be designed from low resource intensive analysis and are capable of increasing the efficiency of in-house material movements in small and medium-sized enterprises.

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{production}} logistics, <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> {{is concerned with the}} internal material flow, which consist of inventory management and transportation. The overall goal with <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> is to ensure the production system access to <b>material,</b> where the <b>handling</b> is to be performed without any damage to neither material nor personnel. In a manufacturing company, a sufficient part of the total production cost can be directly derived from internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> According to Lean Production both transportation and inventory should be considered as waste. Therefore, it is important to improve the efficiency of the internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, though it must not be on the expense of the delivery precision or compromising the safety. The study assumes that the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system is supposed to provide the productions system with the right materials, in the right quantity, at the right time, and doing so in cost effective manner. The purpose with this study is to identify and analyze <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> in order to develop and present recommendations for a safer and more cost efficient <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> with preserved delivery precision. The study is a case study, which has been conducted on site at Sandvik Mining in Sandviken. Sandvik Mining produces drill bits, drill rods and adapters, which are used for rock drilling. The data collection has been done through interviews and observations, where the authors have been interviewing employees from Sandvik Mining as well as conducting direct observations of the processes within the field of study. The study was complemented by a literature review, where the most influential fields of study where <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and Lean Production. The report presents a map of current material transportation flows within Sandvik Mining as well as how the management of these flows is conducted. From the map, problem areas have been identified and the underlying cause of these can be derived from the variations within the working methods. The variations occur due to the fact the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system does not meet the six aspects of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> equation, namely: why, what, where, when and how materials should be transported as well as by who the transportation should performed. In order to create an effective <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> the study presents recommendations that aims to define and standardize <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities, which could be done by material-dedicated buffer zones. The study claims that these material-dedicated buffer zones would serve as reference points for the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, and based on which, it is possible to define the different <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities. The buffer zones can also provide necessary control to the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system {{as well as to the}} production system.
