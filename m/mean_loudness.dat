40|$|In a pilot {{experiment}} on loudness of road-traffic noises, {{it has been}} shown that the loudness estimated by subjects could not be predicted by the value of N 5 only (calculated using the model of Zwicker and Fastl, 1999). Nevertheless, it appeared that estimated loudness could be predicted by a combination of N 5 and <b>mean</b> <b>loudness</b> averaged over time. Thus, we decided to run specific experiments on synthesized sounds, to get a precise control of these two parameters. Non-steady sounds were created with different profiles of amplitude variation in time (total duration of 6 s). These signals were a 1 -kHz pure tone, the vowel « a » and a low-pass noise with a cut-off frequency of 4 kHz. For each category (pure tone, vowel and noise) two sets of signals were made: one with constant N 5, the second with a constant <b>mean</b> <b>loudness.</b> Loudness was evaluated by 14 listeners using magnitude estimation. We looked for a model of loudness that would include both N 5 and <b>mean</b> <b>loudness.</b> A forward regression between evaluated loudness, N 5 and <b>mean</b> <b>loudness</b> shows that a model that does take into account <b>mean</b> <b>loudness</b> explains the major part of the variance of estimated loudness for the low-pass noise. For the pure tone, <b>mean</b> <b>loudness</b> and N 5 explain a part of the variance, but the model must be improved. For the vowel, the result obtained cannot permit us to conclude...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{parameters}} influencing {{the performance of}} active control systems for the reduction of vibration or noise is {{the placement of the}} active components of the system (actuators) on the host structure. In active vibration control systems the actuators are normally placed following a criterion related to the kinetic energy on the structure, whereas in active noise reduction systems they are placed taking into account a sound pressure related metric. This numerical study investigates the placement of point force actuators on a generic plate structure within an active structural acoustic control system. Two setups are tested: a plate radiating in free field, and a plate radiating into a rectangular cavity. In both setups the plate is excited in its first natural frequencies by an incident diffuse sound field. The optimal placements of the actuators on the plate determined for a minimal sound power radiated in free field or a minimal acoustic potential energy radiated into the cavity are compared to the optimal actuator placements determined for a minimal <b>mean</b> <b>loudness</b> over the area of interest. The effect of the different actuator placements on the ttenuation of the dominant radiation modes is analysed. The possible benefits of using the psychoacoustic loudness as an actuator placement criterion are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use {{empirical}} loudness modeling {{to explore a}} perceptual sub-category of the dynamic range problem of auditory neuroscience. Humans are able to reliably report perceived intensity (loudness), and discriminate fine intensity differences, over a very large dynamic range. It is usually assumed that loudness and intensity change detection operate upon the same neural signal, and that intensity change detection may be predicted from loudness data and vice versa. However, while loudness grows as intensity is increased, improvement in intensity discrimination performance does not follow the same trend and so dynamic range estimations of the underlying neural signal from loudness data contradict estimations based on intensity just-noticeable difference (JND) data. In order to account for this apparent paradox we draw on recent advances in auditory neuroscience. We test the hypothesis that a central model, featuring central adaptation to the <b>mean</b> <b>loudness</b> level and operating on the detection of maximum central-loudness rate of change, can account for the paradoxical data. We use numerical optimization to find adaptation parameters that fit data for continuous-pedestal intensity change detection over a wide dynamic range. The optimized model is tested on a selection of equivalent pseudo-continuous intensity change detection data. We also report a supplementary experiment which confirms the modeling assumption that the detection process may be modeled as rate-of-change. Data are obtained from a listening test (N = 10) using linearly ramped increment-decrement envelopes applied to pseudo-continuous noise with an overall level of 33 d...|$|E
40|$|In psychoacoustic experiments, the {{reduction}} of road traffic noise obtained by sound absorbing road surfaces was studied. Loudness of pass-by sounds produced by passenger cars on different road surfaces was rated by a magnitude estimation procedure {{in relation to the}} loudness produced for a standard ISO 10844 road surface. In a first set of experiments, always the same tire was used in combination with different road surfaces. In a second set, for a relatively "silent " road surface, the influence of using different tires was studied. The results of the psychoacoustic evaluations are compared to data from physical measurements. When using A-weighted level and the well-known rule of thumb “ 10 dB less <b>means</b> half <b>loudness</b> ” the noise reduction of sound absorbing road surfaces as perceived by the broad public can be considerably underestimated. On the other hand, subjective evaluations of sound absorbing road surfaces can be predicted by physical measurements of the percentile loudness N 5 with a loudness analyzer...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the correlation between the optical-UV (Lo) and X-ray (Lx) luminosities of quasars by means of Monte Carlo simulations, using a realistic luminosity function. We find, for a quasar population with an intrinsically constant, <b>mean</b> X-ray <b>loudness</b> alpha_ox, that the simulated alpha_ox - Lo relation can exhibit various `apparent' properties, including an increasing alpha_ox with Lo, similar to what has been found from observations. The determining factor for this behavior {{turns out to be the}} relative strength of the dispersions of the luminosities, i. e. their deviations from the mean spectral energy distribution at the optical and X-ray bands, such that a dispersion larger for the optical luminosity than for the X-ray luminosity tends to result in an apparent correlation. We suggest that the observed alpha_ox - Lo correlation can be attributed, at least to some extent, to such an effect, and is thus not an underlying physical property. The consequences of taking into account the luminosity dispersions in an analysis of the observed luminosity correlations is briefly discussed. We note that similar considerations might also apply for the Baldwin effect. Comment: A&A Latex v. 3, 7 pages, 7 PS-figures, to appear in A&A (June 1998...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} both the radio-loud fraction (RLF) and (using stack-ing analysis) the mean radio-loudness of quasars. We consider how these values evolve {{as a function of}} redshift and luminosity, black hole (BH) mass and accretion rate, and parameters related to the dominance of a wind in the broad emission line region. We match the FIRST source catalog to samples of luminous quasars (both spectroscopic and photometric), primarily from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. After accounting for catastrophic errors in BH mass estimates at high-redshift, we find that both the RLF and the mean radio luminosity increase for increasing BH mass and decreasing accretion rate. Similarly both the RLF and <b>mean</b> radio <b>loudness</b> increase for quasars which are argued to have weaker radiation line driven wind components of the broad emission line region. In agreement with past work, we find that the RLF increases with increasing luminosity and decreasing redshift while the mean radio-loudness evolves in the exact opposite manner. This difference in behavior between the mean radio-loudness and the RLF in L − z may indicate selection effects that bias our understanding of the evo-lution of the RLF; deeper surveys in the optical and radio are needed to resolve this discrepancy. Finally, we argue that radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ) quasars may be parallel sequences but where only RQ quasars at one extreme of the distribution are likely to become RL, possibly through slight differences in spin and/or merger history...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of polyethylene terephthalate implants in the soft palate to modify disturbing snoring. Design: Interventional study, before-after trial. Setting: Referral center, institutional practice, hospitalized care. Patienits: Twelve consecutive patients with disturbing snoring and an apnea-hypopnea index less than 15 per hour and a body mass index of 30 or less were recruited. One patient with no adverse effects was lost to follow-up. Extrusion of implants occurred in 2 patients. Complete data in 9 patients were available for analysis. Intervention: Polyethylene terephthalate implants were inserted in the soft palate. Main Outcome Measures: Safety of the procedure and evaluation of the loudness of snoring by bed partners using a visual analog scale. Results: There were no complications of infection or bleeding. Extrusion of implants occurred in 2 patients with no clinical sequelae. The <b>mean</b> (SD) <b>loudness</b> of snoring at baseline, as assessed by bed partners using a visual analog scale of 0 to 100, was 79 (17. 2). This significantly decreased to 48 (20. 4) at 3 months (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P=. 008). Daytime sleepiness as measured with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale also decreased from an average score of 8. 9 at baseline to 5. 7 at 3 months (P =. 007). There were no {{significant changes in the}} apnea-hypopnea index and body mass index from baseline to 3 months' follow-up. Conclusions: Polyethylene terephthalate implants in the soft palate are safe. Snoring decreased significantly at 3 months after surgery. Polyethylene terephthalate implants in the soft palate should be further explored as a treatment for snoring. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of music surprise can be evoked by various musical features, such as intensity, melody, harmony, and rhythm. In this preliminary study we {{concentrate on the}} aspect of intensity. We formulate surprise as a critical derivation from the predicted next intensity value, based on the “immediate ” past (∼ 7 s), slightly longer than the short-term memory. Higher level cognition, processing the long range structure of the piece and general stylistic knowledge, is not considered by the model. The model consists of a intensity calculation step and a prediction function. As a preprocessing method we compare instantaneous energy (root <b>mean</b> square), <b>loudness,</b> and relative specific loudness. This processing stage {{is followed by a}} prediction function for which the following alternative implementations are compared with each other: 1) discrete temporal difference of intensity functions, 2) FIR filter, and 3) polynomial extrapolation. In addition, we experimented with different analysis window length, sampling rate and hop size of the intensity curve. Good results are obtained for loudness and polynomial extrapolation based on an analysis frame of 7 s, a sampling rate of the loudness measures of 1. 2 s, and a hop size of 0. 6 s. In the polynomial extrapolation a polynomial of degree 2 is fitted to the loudness curve in the analysis window. The absolute difference between the extrapolated next loudness value and the actual value is then calculated and divided by the standard deviation within the analysis window. If the result is above a threshold value we predict surprise. The method is preliminarily evaluated with a few classical music examples...|$|R

The efficacies of transmeatal low-level laser irradiation for tinnitus treatment were reported before. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of low level laser therapy on tinnitus and ECochG and DPOAEs parameters. Materials and Methods: The study design was prospective, quasi experimental. This investigation conducted on 16 ears (10 patients) with disabling tinnitus. All patients underwent ENT examination, complete audiological evaluation, tinnitus study, ECochG and DPOAEs, and finally completing tinnitus data sheet. The results were compared before and after irradiation. Results: <b>Means</b> of tinnitus <b>loudness</b> (LMT) and CAP amplitudes were significant different before and after irradiation (p< 0. 005).

40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{acknowledged that the}} presence of additive and convolutional noise and speech level variations can seriously deteriorate the performance of a speech recognizer. In case an auditory model is used as the acoustic front-end, it turns out that compensation techniques such as spectral subtraction and log-spectral mean subtraction can be outperformed by time-domain techniques operating on the band-pass filtered signals which are supplied to the haircell models. In [1] we showed that additive noise could be removed effectively by means of center clippers put in front of the haircell models. This technique, which was called linear noise magnitude subtraction (NMS), is further improved in this paper. The nonlinear NMS proposed here outperforms the linear one, especially for low Signal-to-Noise Ratios. To compensate for speech level variations and convolutional noise, we have adopted the same filosophy: remove the effects before the signal is supplied to the haircell models. This is accomplished by introducing normalization gains in front of the haircell models. It is shown that this <b>loudness</b> <b>mean</b> normalization (LMN) technique when used in combination whith NMS offers a highly robust speech representation...|$|R

This <b>means</b> that the <b>loudness</b> or intensity of tinnitus can be changed by sensory or motor stimuli such as muscle contractions, mechanical pressure on myofascial trigger points, transcutaneous electrical stimulation or joint movements. The neural connections and integration of the auditory and somatosensory systems of the upper cervical region and head have been confirmed by many studies. These connections can {{give rise to a}} form of tinnitus known as somatosensory tinnitus. To date only a handful of publications have focussed on (cervicogenic) somatosensory tinnitus and manual therapy. Broadening the current understanding of somatosensory tinnitus would represent a first step towards providing therapeutic approaches relevant to manual therapists.

The conceptual phase of this study aims to uncover underlying mechanisms linking the auditory and somatosensory systems in relation to subjective tinnitus through (i) review of the literature (part 1) and (ii) through design of a pilot study that will explore characteristics of the study population and identify relevant components and outcomes of manual therapy in patients with cervicogenic somatosensory tinnitus (part 2).

40|$|Besides the {{influence}} of dopaminergic neurotransmission on negative symptoms in schizophrenia, {{there is evidence that}} alterations of serotonin (5 -HT) system functioning also {{play a crucial role in}} the pathophysiology of these disabling symptoms. From post mortem and genetic studies on patients with negative symptoms a 5 -HT dysfunction is documented. In addition atypical neuroleptics and some antidepressants improve negative symptoms via serotonergic action. So far no research has been done to directly clarify the association between the serotonergic functioning and the extent of negative symptoms. Therefore, we examined the status of brain 5 -HT level in negative symptoms in schizophrenia by <b>means</b> of the <b>loudness</b> dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP).

The LDAEP of the N 1 /P 2 component was evaluated by dipole source analysis and single electrode estimation at Cz. Psychopathological parameters, nicotine use and medication were assessed to control for additional influencing factors. Schizophrenic patients showed significantly higher LDAEP in both hemispheres than controls.

40|$|Recent {{behavioral}} {{studies have}} suggested that the human auditory nerve of cochlear implant (CI) users is mainly excited by the positive (anodic) polarity. Those findings were only obtained using asymmetric pseudomonophasic (PS) pulses where the effect of one phase was measured {{in the presence of a}} counteracting phase of opposite polarity, longer duration, and lower amplitude than the former phase. It was assumed that only the short high-amplitude phase was responsible for the excitation. Similarly, it has been shown that electrically evoked compound action potentials could only be obtained in response to the anodic phases of asymmetric pulses. Here, experiment 1 measured electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses to standard symmetric, PS, reversed pseudomonophasic, and reversed pseudomonophasic with inter-phase gap (6 ms) pulses presented for both polarities. Responses were time locked to the short high-amplitude phase of asymmetric pulses and were smaller, but still measurable, when that phase was cathodic than when it was anodic. This provides the first evidence that cathodic stimulation can excite the auditory system of human CI listeners and confirms that this stimulation is nevertheless less effective than for the anodic polarity. A second experiment studied the polarity sensitivity at different intensities by <b>means</b> of a <b>loudness</b> balancing task between pseudomonophasic anodic (PSA) and pseudomonophasic cathodic (PSC) stimuli. Previous studies had demonstrated greater sensitivity to anodic stimulation only for stimuli producing loud percepts. The results showed that PSC stimuli required higher amplitudes than PSA stimuli to reach the same loudness and that this held for current levels ranging from 10 to 100 % of the dynamic range. 19 page(s...|$|R

In other words, due to a possible high amount of description items, an entity who will create descriptions of multimedia (MM) documents, according to MPEG- 7 standard specifications (i. e. a description provider), shall highlight the items most representative {{for the kind of}} document being described in order to facilitate user needs (such as queries, navigation etc.).

Methods: This prospective clinical trial study {{has been done in}} Alzahra and Kashani hospitals in Isfahan, Iran during 2010 - 2011. Simple sampling was used to select patients who were then divided into two groups of true acupuncture group and placebo group. The number of patients in each group was 27. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), tinnitus severity index questionnaire, and tinnitus loudness scale were completed by the patients. Two latter questionnaires were completed again after the 5 th and 10 th sessions of acupuncture treatment. The case group was treated with effective acupuncture with true acupuncture needles while the control group was treated ineffectively, i. e. similar to the usual acupuncture method but with fake needles. Independent t-test was used to compare the mean of tinnitus severity index and loudness scores between the two groups. We also used repeated measures ANOVA test to compare the mean of tinnitus severity index and loudness for different assessments in either group. Results: After the 5 th and 10 th sessions of treatment, the mean of tinnitus severity index reduced significantly only in the case group (p = 0. 002, and p = 0. 001, respectively).

40|$|In this document, {{we propose}} an {{extension}} for the MPEG- 7 Generic DS [2].

40|$|In this document, {{we propose}} some {{modifications}} to the MPEG- 7 Description Scheme (DS) [1] in order to enrich {{the structure of the}} Syntactic DS and Semantic DS by addressing some functionalities for semantically characterizing segments and for highlighting and ordering key-items in a multimedia document. In our opinion, the Generic DS and in particular the syntactic DS can demonstrate some weakness in describing hierarchically organized documents. In other words, even if it is enunciated [1] that the Syntactic DS should act as the Table of Contents for the multimedia document being described, the description of the document temporal structure seems complicated. Therefore we start our discussion by implementing the ToC DS part of our old MPEG- 7 proposal (the ToCAI DS [3]) using the MPEG- 7 Generic DS [1]. In our opinion, due to the simpler structure of the ToC DS, this implementation allows to show the complexity of the MPEG- 7 DS. For overcoming such a problem, we propose a simble extension of the Syntactic DS of the MPEG- 7 Generic DS in order to handle semantic aspects of each segment directly at the Segment DS level. Another issue that we analyze in this document is a possible extension of the MPEG- 7 Generic DS for the inclusion of some important functionalities: the capability to (1) highlight description items (e. g. images, sounds, events, objects etc.) most relevant to the purpose for which a certain content description of a multimedia (MM) document has been created and (2) the capability of description information ordering. In other words, due to a possible large amount of description items, an entity who will create descriptions of multimedia (MM) documents, according to MPEG- 7 specification (i. e. a description provider), shall highlight certain items most representative for the kind of document being described in order to facilitate user queries.

40|$|Worldwide, Cochlear Implants (CIs) {{have already}} {{partially}} restored hearing to over 219000 profoundly hearing-impaired people. CIs attempt {{to stimulate the}} survival Auditory Nerve (AN) fibers directly by means of electrical pulses. Electrical stimulation is provided via an array of electrodes implanted inside the cochlea, which directly activates the AN fibers by means of biphasic Symmetric (SYM) pulses, i. e. an initial phase followed by a second phase with the same amplitude but with opposite polarity. Because electrical stimulation is delivered extracellularly, AN fibers could become depolarized and hyperpolarized at several neural sites and the excitation may be substantially different depending on AN status, electrode-neuron interface, and polarity. The necessity of charge balanced stimulation has precluded the use of monophasic stimuli (pulses consisting only in one phase) to study polarity effects in human CI users {{and most of the}} research concerning polarity effectiveness has been investigated in animal and computational models. However, recently, asymmetric charge-balanced pulse shapes and CI devices with recording capabilities have allowed researchers to study polarity effectiveness on CI users either by means of Electrically evoked Compound Action Potential (ECAP) or by means of behavioral measurements. Contrary to the majority of the results obtained with animals and computational models, those studies suggest that the positive (anodic) current stimulates the AN more effectively than the cathodic one in human CI users. The studies presented in this document aim to examine how neurons at different sites are affected by different stimulus shapes as well as the potential benefits of combining non-standard pulse shapes by means of objective ECAP and Electrically evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (EABR) as well as behavioral experiments. In chapter 2 we study whether the high sensitivity to the anodic current observed formerly for an electrode {{in the middle of the}} array, can be generalized to stimulation at the base and apex of the CI array. Threeexperiments studied the effect of stimulus polarity on the ECAP obtained with the masker-probe paradigm on different sites along the cochlea in CI users. The results of all the experiments extend those of a previous study, showing that the AN in humans is preferentially activated by anodic stimulation, to different sites along the cochlea by means of Monopolar (MP) stimulation. In chapter 3 we present a quantitative analysis of ECAP responses in order to determine an objective detection criterion based on the statistical properties of the noise. The study quantitatively investigates the properties of the Background Noise (BN) and the remaining post average Residual Noise (RN) in ECAP responses recorded from human CI users with the Across-sweeps Noise Estimator (ASNE) method. The analysis of the statistical properties of the noise indicated that a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 1. 7 dB as a detection criterion corresponds to a false positive detection rate of 1 % with the used measurement setup. In chapter 4 we study whether the high sensitivity to the anodic current is also observed in Bipolar (BP) stimulation mode. Spreads of Excitation (SOEs) produced by different masking pulse shapes presented in MP and BP mode are examined by means of the ECAP, obtained using the forward-masked paradigm in human CI users. The SOEs obtained with the MP masker showed a main excitation peak close to the masker electrode, whereas SYM maskers produced bimodal excitation patterns showing two peaks close to the electrodes of the masker channel. The SOEs obtained using Symmetric with a long Inter-Phase Gap (SYM-IPG) (for which the maskers second phase is responsible for most of the masking) and Pseudomonophasic (PS) maskers were more pronounced close to the masker electrode for which the effective phase was anodic. These results showed that the anodic polarity is the most effective one in BP mode and that the bimodal patterns produced by SYM maskers could be partially reduced by using asymmetric pulses. Chapter 5 investigates polarity effects at the level of the brainstem. Previous behavioral studies showing that the human AN of CI users is mainly excited by the anodic polarity have only been obtained with asymmetric PS, and it was assumed that only the short high-amplitude phase was responsible for the excitation. Similarly, in our previous studies it has been shown that ECAPs could only be obtained in response to the anodic phases of asymmetric pulses. However, it is possible that ECAP responses to cathodic responses were not detected due to the characteristics of the effective place of excitation across and along the AN fibers. In this chapter we measured EABRs to SYM and asymmetric pulse shapes presented for both polarities. It is shown that responses were time-locked to the short high-amplitude phase of asymmetric pulses, and were smaller, but still measurable, when that phase was cathodicthan when it was anodic. A behavioral experiment studied the polarity sensitivity at different intensities by <b>means</b> of a <b>loudness</b> balancing task between asymmetric stimuli of opposite polarity. The results showed that cathodic stimuli required higher amplitudes than anodic stimuli to reach the same loudness at different stimulus levels. This study provides the first evidence that cathodic stimulation can excite the auditory system of human CI listeners, and confirms that this stimulation is nevertheless less effective than for the anodic polarity. nrpages: 245 status: publishe...|$|R
