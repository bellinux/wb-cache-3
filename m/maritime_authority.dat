25|$|Minister of Trade and Industry Trond Giske took {{initiative}} in June 2010 {{to investigate a}} merger of the Norwegian Ship Registers and the Norwegian <b>Maritime</b> <b>Authority.</b> An internal ministry committee concluded on 1 November that a merger would be favorable. It cited that a common organization would be more uniform, user-friendly and competitive, allowing shipping companies to relate to a single organization. The handling of the registers would remain in Bergen, despite the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Authority</b> being based in Haugesund. The merger took effect on 1 January 2012. At the time there were eighteen employees in the agency.|$|E

25|$|The changes {{took effect}} on 1 July 2008. In {{addition}} to the investigation aspect which was issued to the board, the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Authority</b> established a division to work with strategic safety. Criminal investigation of marine accidents became the responsibility of an office at Rogaland Police District.|$|E

25|$|Ship {{registration}} in Norway became codified in 1902 and {{the task}} was {{handed over to the}} district courts and their magistrates and city clerks. At first having about 50 registers, this was reduced to 27 in 1972. The responsibility was centralized and taken over by the Norwegian Ship Registers in 1992. It was merged into the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Authority</b> in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Parliament {{looked into}} the {{possibility}} of centralizing the local ship registers in 1990, but the issue was postponed to consider a merger with NIS. The Ministry of Justice established a commission {{to look into the}} matter. They concluded in July 1991 that the registers should be centralized and located to Bergen. They proposed that the new register be administratively part of the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Authority.</b> The issue was concluded in March, when the government decided to create the Norwegian Ship Registers. Located in Bergen, it would be organized as a government agency subordinate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{committee}} proposed an independent investigation {{board for the}} maritime sector, either {{as part of the}} Norwegian <b>Maritime</b> <b>Authority</b> or as an independent agency subordinate to the Ministry of Justice. During the political discussions a joint board was favored instead. Parliament approved the new jurisdiction in 2004. However, it took four years to implement the decision, and nine years from the conclusions of {{the committee}} were presented. The delays were caused by the legal implications and complexity of the investigations. Because the board was only to investigate from a safety point of view, a new legal and administrative framework had to be implemented to ensure that the Norwegian Police Service take over the responsibility for criminal investigation of the marine accidents.|$|E
50|$|IMO {{regularly}} enacts regulations, {{which are}} broadly enforced by {{national and local}} <b>maritime</b> <b>authorities</b> in member countries, such as the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG).

Memoranda of Understanding (protocols) were signed by some countries unifying Port State Control procedures among the signatories.|$|R

25|$|AIBN's goal is {{exclusively}} {{to look into}} the safety aspects of accidents, with the overall goal to uncover causes and the line of events in order to learn, improve safety and hinder similar accidents from happening again. The board is not involved in any assessment of blame or liability, whether under criminal or civil law. Criminal investigation is carried out by the Norwegian Police Service and prosecution by the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority. In particular, the board can accept testimonies which can remain anonymous and which will under no circumstances be handed over to the police or prosecuting authorities. The board's responsibilities are delineated towards that of the Police Service and the Prosecution Authority, {{as well as that of}} the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway, the Norwegian <b>Maritime</b> <b>Authority,</b> the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the Norwegian Railway Authority.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the second}} Algérie Ferries charter, the Fantaasia was {{chartered}} to the Norway-based Kystlink {{for three months}} (with an option for three additional months) from October 2007 onwards to replace their MS Pride of Telemark {{that was out of}} service following an accident when the ship rammed the breakwater at Hirtshals, Denmark. Before entering service for Kystlink, Fantaasia was docked at Cityvarvet, Gothenburg. On 15 November, the Swedish <b>Maritime</b> <b>Authority</b> Sjöfartsinspektionen deemed the ship unsafe and prohibited it from leaving Cityvarvet until 18 faults found during the inspection were fixed. Twelve of the faults were considered severe, including several permanently open watertight doors, a non-functional loudspeaker system, blocked emergency exists and non-functional winches used for lowering lifeboats. According to Tallink, the inspection was made while refitting of the ship was still in process, which they cited as the reason why several onboard systems were turned off-line and normal safety procedures were not observed. On 11 December, the ship entered service with Kystlink on its Langesund–Hirtshals and Langesund–Strömstad routes.|$|E
