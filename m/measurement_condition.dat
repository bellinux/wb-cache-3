The eigen values of a posteriori estimate error covariance matrix depend on measurement conditions, such as geometries of specimens, structure of experimental sets, locations of measurements and types of measurements. The optimal <b>measurement</b> <b>condition</b> is obtained by minimizing the maximum eigen value of a posteriori estimate error covariance matrix.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of optical brightening agents (OBAs) in substrates for printing is well documented, as are the complications surrounding spectrophotometric color measurement when OBAs are present. In an effort to better address measurement of OBAs, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has published ISO 13566 : 2009, where the illuminations utilized in spectrophotometric instrumentation is more clearly defined than in previous standards. It is recognized that moving ahead the illuminant utilized in spectrophotometers {{should be able to}} better correlate to standardized viewing conditions, including the amount of ultra-violet (UV) present in the illuminant, as the effect of the OBAs is dependent on the amount of UV. Of particular note, ISO 13655 : 2009 recognizes <b>measurement</b> <b>condition</b> M 0 as a 2 ̆ 7 legacy 2 ̆ 7 condition, representative of the wide range of spectrophotometers utilized in the field.

While M 1 instruments are being utilized more and more frequently in the field, there is a large population of legacy M 0 instruments also in use. For those interested in understanding the variation that can be expected in the comparison of various instruments, the question of how much variation can be eliminated through the exclusive adoption of M 1 instruments is especially germane...|$|E
