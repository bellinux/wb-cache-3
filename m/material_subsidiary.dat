Today consumer {{is more concerned with}} the quality of the products it consumes, and as such companies must adopt strict and effective systems to monitor and ensure the quality of their products. Security is a fundamental requirement for quality, because without security you can-not guarantee quality.

In January 2000, was published the White Book on the European Food Safety Authority. This book relates the importance of traceability of food, ingredient and it appear to the basics for the European food safety policy. This concern for food safety was also expressed at the political level rising Regulation (EC) No. 178 / 2002 of 28 January, in force since 1 January 2005 requires that all the supply chain (farmers, food producers and feed retailers, transporters, etc.) Are able to identify the origin of all raw materials and ingredients, and retain information about who sold their products.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} three core-collapse supernova remnants (SNR) - the Cygnus Loop in the Milky Way and 0453 - 68. 5 and 0540 - 69. 3 in the Large Magellanic Cloud - {{of varying}} ages and in varying states of {{interaction with the}} surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), using X-ray imaging spectroscopy with Chandra and supplemental data from other wavelengths. We use results from our analysis to address three main questions. First, we examine {{the applicability of the}} common Sedov-Taylor adiabatic blast wave model to core-collapse supernovae. Second, we determine the elemental abundances around the shell of these supernova remnants to determine if the use of SNRs as a gauge of abundances in the ISM is justified. Finally, we examine the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in 0453 - 68. 5 and 0540 - 69. 3 and search for evidence of interaction between these PWNe and their immediate surroundings. We see highly inhomogeneous ISM surrounding all three surveyed SNRs, contrary to the key assumption in the Sedov-Taylor model of a uniform surrounding medium. In all three studied SNRs, we find that shock speeds are dependent on the density of the surrounding <b>material.</b> As <b>subsidiary</b> results, we also find depleted elemental abundances of oxygen, magnesium, and silicon, relative to typical ISM, around all three studied supernova remnants. Although this subsidiary result is not conclusive, we believe that it merits a followup study. In 0540 - 69. 3 and 0453 - 68. 5, which contain central pulsars, we find that the explosion directionality, which can be inferred from the pulsar 2 ̆ 7 s proper motion relative to the SNR, is not related to the morphology of the SNR itself. We conclude from this that the asymmetric shapes common in core-collapse supernova remnants can be more a function of the complex environments surrounding the progenitors of core- collapse supernovae than of the supernova explosions themselves. Finally, we see that the PWN in 0453 - 68. 5 shows signs of having mixed with the surrounding thermal- emitting material, while the PWN in 0540 - 69. 3 appears to have not mixed with or interacted with the surrounding SNR material to any substantial degree. We believe that this result may indicate that the degree of interaction between a PWN and its surroundings is dependent on age and possibly shell morphology, although further study is needed...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} elegant legal {{innovations}} {{to emerge from the}} Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 is the FDIC’s single-point-of-entry (SPOE) initiative, whereby regulatory authorities will {{be in a position to}} resolve the failure of large financial conglomerates (corporate groups with regulated financial entities as subsidiaries) by seizing a top-tier holding company, downstreaming holding-company resources to distressed subsidiaries, wiping out holding-company shareholders while simultaneously imposing additional losses on holding-company creditors, and allowing the government to resolve the entire group without disrupting the business operations of operating subsidiaries (even those operating overseas) or risking systemic consequences for the broader economy. Although there is much to admire in the creativity underlying SPOE, the approach’s design also raises a host of novel and challenging questions of implementation. This chapter explores a number of these questions and elaborates upon the following points. First, in contrast to traditional approaches to resolving financial conglomerates, SPOE is premised on the continued support of all <b>material</b> operating <b>subsidiaries,</b> thereby potentially extending the scope of government support and thus posing the possibility of mission creep and expanded moral hazard. Second, SPOE contemplates the automatic downstreaming of resources to operating subsidiaries in distress, but effecting that support is likely to be more difficult than commonly understood. If too much support is positioned in advance, there may be inadequate reserves at the top level to support a single subsidiary that gets into an unexpectedly large amount of trouble. Alternatively, if too many reserves are retained at the holding-company level, commitments of subsidiary support may not be credible (especially to foreign authorities) and it may become difficult legally and practically to deploy those resources in times of distress. SPOE is most easy to envision operating in conjunction with the FDIC’s expanded authority under its Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) established under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. However, the act’s preferred regime for resolving failed financial conglomerates is the U. S. Bankruptcy Code (where Lehman was resolved) and not OLA. Several complexities could arise were a bankruptcy court today called upon to implement an SPOE resolution plan. While many legal experts are working on legislative proposals to amend the Bankruptcy Code to facilitate SPOE resolutions, there are a number of legal levers that federal authorities could deploy under current law to increase the likelihood that the SPOE strategy could be effected through traditional bankruptcy procedures. The task would be challenging and would require considerable advanced planning. But there are substantial benefits to be had from taking steps now to increase the likelihood that the bankruptcy option represents a viable and credible alternative for effecting SPOE transactions without resort to OLA and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act...|$|R
30|$|Re-birth {{design has}} been much used in the apparel industry. Lee and DeLong (2016 a) {{analysed}} successful reverse design at the manufacturing level with an apparel company willing to collaborate using their unsold stock. Five levels of re-birth design were outlined {{in the process of}} redesigning products from a company’s inventory. Re-birth level 1 involved changes in <b>subsidiary</b> <b>materials</b> or the addition or removal of embellishments. The main reason for poor sales determined in level 1 products may be weak brand image or the absence of details that differentiate an existing product from other brands, details that may increase the attractiveness of a product when worn. At level 2, changes in pattern or material characteristics were applied to the relevant stock item to enhance its practicality or functionality. At level 3, part of an existing design was combined with a different material to create a new design, simultaneously enhancing both its practicality and brand image. Level 4 involved taking the product apart completely and recreating it into a new design, thereby recreating stock from different brands using recombined designs to fit the new design concept. For example, men’s suits became long vests for women; jackets were made from tent materials and creative uses were found using the back pockets of denim jeans. Thus, designs remained up to date despite their origin and, in fact, became one-of-a-kind items. Finally, re-birth level 5 was the category in which products were taken apart to become the raw material for fashion items other than clothes, i.e. a jacket becomes a purse, a padded jacket, or a bag. With each level, the degree of transformation increased, along with the skills needed in the redesign process. To be successful, the key point discovered in this re-birth project was to enhance the brand’s concept and image, and increase the practicality of products that fit the release period, product sales period, and consumer needs (Lee and DeLong 2016 a).|$|R
40|$|Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) are {{a popular}} {{strategy}} companies undertake {{in order to}} create value and synergies, and also to increase the competitiveness of the firm.   Findings from previous studies show that many M&As fail to create value, however there is also existing evidence that they do, where the execution plays a major role. The success of an M&A depends on both internal and external factors such as the competitive strengths of the firm, strategic fit, and growth of the market. It is argued that problems such as poor management within M&A processes could affect the outcome of the M&A in a negative way. Previous research shows that middle managers {{play a key role in}} strategic change processes such as M&As. When companies go through strategic change, the entire company gets involved; however the middle manager is the one who must keep in contact with co-workers, customers, suppliers, and top management at the same time. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate middle managements’ perception of changed competitiveness after an M&A has been completed. In order to fulfill the purpose, we used a qualitative approach where we conducted a case study and made interviews with middle managers at Toyota <b>Material</b> Handling’s German <b>subsidiary</b> that had recently gone through an M&A process. Our findings show that when a company is buying another company it needs to see the positive assets from another perspective than only through possible gains in market shares and synergies. When the two companies merge they must take advantage of each other’s specific resources that have made each company successful. Furthermore what fosters increased competitiveness after a merger is good information and communication about goals and strategies. What in turn hinders increased competitiveness after a merger is low flexibility in terms of not being able to adapt to market changes fast enough, and to have an organization that does not make it possible for employees to bring up their opinions...|$|R

However, the region with "High Risk, High Return" also {{has a lot of}} risk factors for foreign investors. In case of Korea, companies which have entered into the Russian market have some difficulties caused by a strict import clearance and little information on the market. Various problems exist across the Federation for Korean companies to push into the market in the Far East Russia. First, one of major obstacle is the authority's control policy for its natural resources. The Russian Federation recently accelerate its efforts to upgrade the national status in the world by controlling natural resources and nationalizing energy industries. Although the region is called the repository of natural resources, {{it is not easy to}} develop the resources because of the severe climate and poor transportation infrastructure. In addition, the ocean/air freight charge to the region is too high to promote personal and material exchange. Other barrier is the demand on container is more than supplies. The port in the Far East Russia has great volume of shipment to western Russia and Central Asia, which can lead to the difficulties in securing containers. Yeonhaeju. the Maritime Province of Russia, aims to develop as a logistics hub on the Asia and the Pacific region into the world-class logistics center using the Trans-Siberian Railroad(TSR). However, a strict clearance and high freight rate become a barrier to achieve the goal. The underdeveloped practices and systems caused by bureaucracy and corruption have created the problem of lower production efficiency. Furthermore, more regulations and intervention by the government have scared foreign investment. Russia is not an easy market to enter into, In this regard, investors necessarily have to conduct a thorough survey on the market and establish strategies. First, they should prepare countermeasures against risk factors including changes in the exchange rate and policies. Pre-survey on tax system, environment law, labor law and social infrastructure is also requisite for developing a new market in Russia. In addition, investors must check whether the local procurement of raw&# 8228 <b>subsidiary</b> <b>materials</b> is possible due to high logistical cost and bad circumstances such as cold weather. The investigation on business partner in Russia is also required to start a business in Russia. As bureaucracy and corruption spread across the society, investors have to verify information on the partner's relationship, influence, financial situation, experiences and credibility. Russian language proficiency is essential to keep a partnership with Russian people. That's because it is difficult to employ a Russian-speaking interpreter and keep the business secret. Russia has still been vulnerable to a financing sector. That's why investors secure sufficient fund for their businesses in Russia. It may be difficult to receive the money from financing industries and burdened themselves with a high interest. These efforts I mentioned above can be an answer to have an international competitiveness for domestic companies in the market of the Far East Russia. More than anything else, the government-level policies and measures are required to expand the logistics business to the Russian market. &# 51228 &# 47168 &# 52264 &# 4778...|$|R
40|$|O Brasil é um país de forte vocação agrícola, que necessita lugares adequados para armazenagem de matérias subsidiárias, como por exemplo, óleos, detergentes, tintas, fertilizantes entre outros; de armazenagem de ferramentas, instrumentos, dispositivos, madeiras. As maiorias dos galpões são feitos de concreto, aço, madeira, porém existem aqueles chamados mistos. Com isso o projeto busca atender as necessidades de empresas que buscam poder armazenar seus fertilizantes em galpões feitos com madeira de reflorestamento, que é o Eucalipto Citriodora. A técnica construtiva aplicada pretende ter mais rapidez para que a estrutura fique pronta para o uso, além de economizar em mão-de-obra, materiais mais baratos e por fim, contribuindo para o uso sustentável da madeira no Brasil e procurando inspirar que não só aqui no Brasil e como vários lugares do mundo que é necessário que todos se conscientizem e preservem o “verde” do planeta. Será feito todo o estudo necessário para que este tipo de modelo, cujas dimensões para analise são de 5, 6 e 7, 5 metros de comprimento, por 30 metros de largura e 15 metros de altura esteja de acordo com as normas. A estrutura terá uma série de pórticos, utilizando-se duas peças de madeira roliças para cada um deles e travadas em sua parte mais delgada através de uma ligação em forma de capuz metálico, formando um ângulo de 90 o entre as peças. Para travar os 2 pórticos é utilizada uma peça roliça de madeira que usará conectores metálicos para fazer a ligação e estará posicionado a três quartos da altura do pórtico. Na base do poste há um tensionamento diminuindo o vão do pórtico de 31, 5 m para 30, 0 m utilizando-se um cabo de aço e retirando-o quando colocado na base da fundação. Os cálculos teóricos da estrutura foram realizados seguindo as NBR 7190 : 1997 e NBR 6123 : 1988; e através de [...] . Brazil is {{a country}} of strong {{agricultural}} vocation, which requires adequate sites for storage of <b>subsidiary</b> <b>materials</b> such as oils, detergents, paints, fertilizers, among others, storage of tools, instruments, appliances, wood. The majority of houses are made of concrete, steel, wood, however there are those called mixed. Thus the project aims {{to meet the needs}} of companies seeking to be able to store their fertilizers in sheds made of wood from reforestation, which is lemon eucalyptus. The construction technique used aims to have more speed for the structure to be ready for use, and saves on manpower, materials cheaper and ultimately contributing to the sustainable use of wood in Brazil and looking to inspire not only here in Brazil and how many places around the world that all must be aware and preserve the green the planet. It will be done all the studies required for this type of model to analyze the dimensions are 5, 6 and 7. 5 meters long by 30 meters wide and 15 meters in height is consistent with the standards. The structure will have a series of frames, using two pieces of wood for each of them plump and locked in its thinnest part through a link-shaped metal hood, forming an angle of 90 ° between the parts. To lock the two frames is used a plump piece of wood that will use metal connectors to connect and be positioned at three-quarters of the height of the portico. At the base of the pole there is a tension reducing the span of the portico of 31. 5 m to 30. 0 m using a rope and pulling it while stationed at the foundation. Theoretical calculations of the structure were carried out using the NBR NBR 7190 : 1997 and 6123 : 1988, and by a numerical model developed in SAP 2000 software, you can examine its behavior when subjected to proper weight and due to wind action. Concluding that it is not feasible to apply the tension and inclination of 30 ° is more appropriate, since the maximum span between frames is 6 feet...|$|R
