40|$|We {{argue that}} the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> in {{cross-border}} mergers and acquisitions (M&As) can mitigate country-level governance risk for the acquirer. We find a greater use of stock as the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> in cross-border deals involving targets from countries with high governance risk relative {{to that in the}} acquirer’s country. This increased use of stock in riskier cross-border deals is consistent with the optimal reaction of the acquirer to avoid overpayment, even though we also show that the use of stock (instead of cash) as the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> in cross-border deals is associated with a lower likelihood of deal completion. Furthermore, for more recent periods (i. e., after 2000) we show that the use of stock (cash) has increased (decreased) significantly in cross-border deals, resulting in convergence with the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> used in domestic deals...|$|R
25|$|Criticism {{has been}} {{directed}} at the cost to users of the SmartRider system compared to its predecessor, the MultiRider.

A 10% discount is available for all other <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> This was raised in Parliament by Liberal MP Katie Hodson-Thomas, who claimed that passengers would end up paying $324 more a year for public transport under SmartRider. In February 2006, The West Australian reported criticism by trial users who claimed that their failure to tag off, either by accidentally forgetting to do so or due to a non-working machine, resulted in a four-zone fare being charged to the SmartRider regardless of distance travelled.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the choice <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>method</b> in mergers and {{acquisitions}} using the dividend clientele hypothesis. We hypothesize that the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> {{is more likely to}} be stock if the dividend policies of the two firms involved in a merger or acquisition are quite similar, but more likely to be cash if the dividend policies are much different. The empirical data support the relevance of the dividend clientele hypothesis for the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> in acquisitions. Dividend Policy, <b>Method</b> <b>of</b> <b>Payment</b> in Acquisitions, and Stock Price Performance The two most common currencies for payments in corporate mergers or acquisitions are cash and stock. Not all firms exclusively use one currency or the other; a mixture of both currencies is also widely observed. During the 1990 s stock as a payment method became increasingly important, due in part to the fact that stocks appreciated significantly during that period. Studies on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> have identified many possible factors that influence the choice <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>method</b> used in mergers and acquisitions. In this paper, we look at how dividend policies of the two firms involved in an acquisition may affect the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> and stock price performance after the acquisition...|$|R

40|$|Merger and {{acquisition}} (M&A) transactions {{have been the}} subject of numerous studies over the years. The effect <b>of</b> the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> in M&A transactions has been studied in first world countries where information transfer is regarded as being highly efficient. The aim of this research was to study the effect <b>of</b> the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> to both acquirer and target companies post the announcement of M&A transactions within the context of emerging economies. South African JSE listed firms were used as a proxy for emerging market companies. Event study methodologies are only as sound as the statistical methodologies used to conduct the tests as well as the accuracy with which expected returns can be calculated. This being so, the aim of the research was to apply rigorous testing using various event study methodologies and making use of the literature to ensure that the findings were robust and the testing thorough. The various testing methodologies did not always provide the same findings further emphasising that the results are only as conclusive and robust as the methodologies used. Using the well substantiated event study methodology it was found that target companies do not significantly outperform acquirer firms. Although target companies showed a 12. 5 % increase over the longest event window being a 120 day window, whilst acquirers only reported 6. 40 % the difference was not found to be significant. The additional returns to target companies are likely due to the bid premium to stave off competition. Results indicate that acquirer companies using shares as the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> do send a negative signal to the market that their shares used as the currency of exchange in the M&A transaction is inflated. As a result acquirer companies using shares underperformed acquirer companies using cash as the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Finally target companies bought where cash was used as the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> outperform targets bought using shares as the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> This is likely due to the capital gains tax implications in the year the M&A transaction takes place where cash is the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Although South Africa is regarded as being a less efficient market than first world economies with regards to information transfer, based on the study (which focused on large capitalisation companies with high trading volumes) South Africa does show similar results to those of first-world economies for acquirer cash against acquirer share returns as well as for target cash against target share returns, when looking at the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> as a market signal in M&A transactions. This research did not however find significantly higher positive returns for target companies against acquirer companies returns. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.
