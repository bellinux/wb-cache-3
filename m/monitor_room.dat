Initially a whole new network structure is set in order to assure that the perimeter security system that will benefit from it will work properly. To continue, the perimeter security structure is installed, and once this is done, it will be integrated onto the network structure. All devices will receive and IP address and the permissions to communicate with the programmable logic controllers and consequently with the <b>monitor</b> <b>room</b> that will be located in the headquarters and that will manage the whole security of the enterprise.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{successfully}} shown {{the use of}} electrical resistance (ER) measurements to <b>monitor</b> <b>room</b> temperature damage accumulation in SiC fiber reinforced SiC matrix composites (SiCf/SiC) Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs). In {{order to determine the}} feasibility of resistance monitoring at elevated temperatures, the present work investigates the temperature dependent electrical response of various MI (Melt Infiltrated) -CVI (Chemical Vapor Infiltrated) SiC/SiC composites containing Hi-Nicalon Type S, Tyranno ZMI and SA reinforcing fibers. Test were conducted using a commercially available isothermal testing apparatus as well as a novel, laser-based heating approach developed to more accurately simulate thermomechanical testing of CMCs. Secondly, a post-test inspection technique is demonstrated to show the effect of high-temperature exposure on electrical properties. Analysis was performed to determine the respective contribution of the fiber and matrix to the overall composite conductivity at elevated temperatures. It was concluded that because the silicon-rich matrix material dominates the electrical response at high temperature, ER monitoring would continue to be a feasible method for monitoring stress dependent matrix cracking of melt-infiltrated SiC/SiC composites under high temperature mechanical testing conditions. Finally, the effect of thermal gradients generated during localized heating of tensile coupons on overall electrical response of the composite is determined...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This {{paper will}} report {{some of the}} final results of a {{doctoral}} study {{on the effect of}} acoustics on vocal strain of Opera singers. The research presents singers' objective voice dosimetry and subjective perception data together with the room acoustic parameters with the aim of establishing the preferred practice room conditions for Opera singers. Methodology: For this purpose 117 Opera singers from the Royal Academy of Music participated in the research. The pilot stage of the research was undertaken at the acoustic laboratories of London South Bank University in order to validate the research methodology in controlled environment, and the field stage was undertaken at four practice rooms of Royal Academy of Music. Singers’ subjective data was collected via questionnaires validated during the pilot stage, and singers’ objective voice dosimetry data was collected via Ambulatory Phonation <b>Monitor.</b> <b>Room</b> acoustic measurements were undertaken separately for each practice room when the rooms were unoccupied. Statistical analysis were performed to establish the relationship between the room acoustics and the singers’ data. Results: The students' subjective response to the different acoustic conditions of the practice rooms showed significant change and very strong correlations were observed with the measured T 30 room acoustic parameter at the 4 k octave band and C 80 parameter at 500 Hz to 4 kHz. Using this information and the practice room geometries, Opera singers’ ideal practice room conditions were established...|$|E
