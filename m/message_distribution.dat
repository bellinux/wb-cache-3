Computer simulations are used to show that our implementation of a minimal-path fully-adaptive virtual cut-through algorithm outperforms both deterministic and adaptive wormhole switching methods under both uniform random <b>message</b> <b>distributions</b> and clustered distributions such as the matrix transpose. A hardware-efficient implementation of adaptive virtual cut-through has been implemented using a semi-customdesigned router chip that requires only 2. 30 more area than a comparable deterministic wormhole router chip.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} error correction for a cooperative data exchange (CDE) system, where some clients are compromised or failed and send false messages. Assuming each client possesses {{a subset of the}} total messages, we analyze the error correction capability when every client is allowed to broadcast only one linearly-coded message. Our error correction capability bound determines the maximum number of clients that can be compromised or failed without jeopardizing the final decoding solution at each client. We show that deterministic, feasible linear codes exist that can achieve the derived bound. We also evaluate random linear codes, where the coding coefficients are drawn randomly, and then develop the probability for a client to withstand a certain number of compromised or failed peers and successfully deduce the complete message for any network size and any initial <b>message</b> <b>distributions...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Note that in {{practice}} entropically-secure encryption algorithms are only [...] "secure" [...] {{provided that the}} <b>message</b> <b>distribution</b> possesses high entropy from any reasonable adversary's perspective. This is an unrealistic assumption for a general encryption scheme, since one cannot assume that all likely users will encrypt high-entropy messages. For these schemes, stronger definitions (such as semantic security or indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) are appropriate. However, there are special cases {{in which it is}} reasonable to require high entropy messages. For example, encryption schemes that encrypt only secret key material (e.g., key encapsulation or Key Wrap schemes) can be considered under an entropic security definition. A practical application of this result is the use of deterministic encryption algorithms for secure encryption of secret key material.|$|E

50|$|Most {{communication}} {{within the}} GTD-5 was performed via direct memory-mapped I/O. The APC and each TPC were each connected to three common memory units. These common memory units each contained 16 megabytes of memory which were allocated to shared data structures, both dynamic structures related to dynamic call data and static (protected) data {{related to the}} office database. The APC, TPC, and TCUs all connected to a smaller shared memory, the <b>Message</b> <b>Distribution</b> Circuit (MDC). This was an 8k word 96 port memory {{that was used to}} place small packetized messages into software defined queues. The MXU, RLU, and RSU were all sufficiently far from the base unit that they could not participate in the shared memory based communication directly. A special circuit pack, the Remote Data Link Controller (RDLC) was installed in the DT-FIU of the remote unit and its host TCU. This allowed a serial communication link over a dedicated timeslot of a DS1 carrier. The host TCU was responsible for forwarding messages from the remote unit through the MDC.|$|E

We show that the whole encoder function need not be fixed or shared a priori for an effective cryptosystem, and this can be exploited to increase the equivocation over an a priori shared encoder.

40|$|Abstract—Consider a sender, Alice, {{who wants}} to {{transmit}} private messages to two receivers, Bob and Calvin, using unreliable wireless broadcast transmissions and short public feedback from Bob and Calvin. In [1], we assumed that Bob and Calvin provide honest feedback, and characterized the secure capacity region of the private messages under the requirement that Bob and Calvin do not learn each other’s message. In this paper, we assume that Bob (or Calvin) may provide dishonest feedback; or even control the input <b>message</b> <b>distributions,</b> as is commonly assumed in cryptography literature. We characterize the capacity region {{in the case of}} dishonest adversaries, as well as an achievable region for the case when the adversary has complete control on the <b>distribution</b> of the <b>messages.</b> We also design polynomial time protocols for both cases, that rely on the use of coding techniques to mix and secure the private messages. As a side result, we define an extended notion of semantic security for this problem and using a similar approach to [2], we show the equivalence of different security notions. I...|$|R
