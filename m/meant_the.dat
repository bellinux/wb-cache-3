5|$|An {{administrative}} error <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> club {{did not enter}} the FA Cup in 1895.|$|E
5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines. For these reasons, , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.|$|E
5|$|In the league, a 4–1 {{win against}} Leeds United in September <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> club broke {{the record for}} scoring in {{consecutive}} games (47), and away league games without defeat (22). The club began 2003 in first position, but subsequently floundered; a draw to Aston Villa in April allowed Manchester United to move joint top. A further draw at Bolton Wanderers <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> league championship was, mathematically, out of Arsenal's hands and defeat to Leeds a week after ended their chances of retaining the league. Consolation came in retaining the FA Cup; a solitary goal scored by midfielder Robert Pirès was enough to beat Southampton in the 2003 final.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> verse <b>meant</b> that <b>the</b> {{brothers}} {{should not}} fall into sin. Bellman's Epistle, however, supposes that going astray <b>meant</b> picking up <b>the</b> wrong glass in a tavern.|$|R
60|$|It <b>meant,</b> in <b>the</b> first place, {{that the}} lawsuit was over at last. It <b>meant,</b> in <b>the</b> second place that the owner of Windygates, wanting money, had decided on letting <b>the</b> {{property}}. It <b>meant,</b> in <b>the</b> third place, that the property had found a tenant, and was to be renovated immediately out of doors and in. The Owls shrieked as they flapped along the lanes in the darkness, And that night they struck at a mouse--and missed him.|$|R
5|$|The {{reorganisation}} <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> {{number of}} appliances was reduced, until only three {{remained at the}} station. The control room at London Road closed in 1979, replaced by a single computerised control room at brigade headquarters in Swinton.|$|E
5|$|The resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> final was {{a repeat}} of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final, which Uruguay had won 2–1 after a replay.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, most battleships, {{dreadnought}} and pre-dreadnought alike, were disarmed {{under the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Largely this <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> ships being broken up for scrap; others were destroyed in target practice or relegated to training and supply duties. One, Mikasa, was given a special exemption to the Washington Treaty and was maintained as a museum and memorial ship.|$|E
50|$|The Allied {{capture of}} French ports <b>meant</b> that <b>the</b> U-boat threat was {{drastically}} reduced. This <b>meant</b> that <b>the</b> units posted to St Eval {{could be better}} used elsewhere and by the autumn of 1944 the airfield was a shadow of its former self.|$|R

5|$|At home to Juventus, Arsenal won 2–0 with goals from Fàbregas and Henry; {{the match}} was {{overshadowed by the}} return of former captain Vieira. A goalless draw at the Stadio delle Alpi <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> club progressed into the semi-finals against Villarreal.|$|E
5|$|Between May and July 1918, {{military}} stores from White City, Wormwood Scrubs and Baker Street {{were moved}} to the site, with items kept in the completed sheds. A shortage of bricks in October <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> widening of the bridge over the railway was delayed, as was {{the construction of the}} railway line into the site.|$|E
5|$|Broadside {{armament}} {{also had}} disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, {{the adoption of}} ramming as an important tactic <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> need for ahead and all-round fire. These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.|$|E
50|$|In 1996 the {{discovery}} of the rare Desmoulin's whorl snail on <b>the</b> reserve <b>meant</b> that <b>the</b> Newbury bypass was almost stopped, but the high court ruled in the developers' favour. The decision to continue with the construction of <b>the</b> road <b>meant</b> that <b>the</b> nature reserve was cut in size, losing half its area.|$|R
50|$|The {{relatively}} {{sparsely populated}} areas crossed by {{the line and}} the absence of significant long-distance freight traffic <b>meant</b> that <b>the</b> Vogelsberg railway was mainly limited to regional traffic. That <b>meant</b> that <b>the</b> line was built as a single track line, although various engineering structures were prepared for the building of a second track.|$|R

5|$|Conroy {{effectively}} barred Victoria {{from anyone}} other than the Duchess or his relatives and the princess was prevented from becoming close to her extended family. The enforced isolation <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> only companions of her own age whom she frequently {{came into contact with}} were Conroy's daughters, who included Victoire, a girl a few months older than Victoria. Victoria {{does not appear to have}} been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E
5|$|Constantine Doukas' {{wife was}} shorn and exiled to her husband's estate in Paphlagonia {{and his younger}} son Stephen was castrated. Along with the deaths of Constantine's son and nephew, this <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> {{extinction}} of this branch of the Doukas family: {{the relation of the}} later bearers of the Doukas name with Andronikos and Constantine is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the mines in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed in the mines {{in the early days of}} industrialisation are incomplete and a few are contradictory.|$|E
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> loss of their outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of a new line in Western New Guinea. The Admiralties operation also indicated the Allies were becoming more ambitious and might bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E
5|$|Further {{progress}} in the 1970s was made {{with the arrival of}} the microchip, and the ensuing exponential increase in processing power has <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> development of fast and powerful systems.

Cole's last episode was shown on 5 November 2009 and his departure <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> end of a 22-year association with the programme.|$|E
5|$|Having {{made only}} 5 and 18 in the {{previous}} Test, Jack Crapp was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury. The England selectors were widely condemned for their decisions, which were seen as an investment in youth rather than necessarily picking the best players available at the time. Their frequent changes <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> home team had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Great Southern {{expanded}} into organic olives, acquired some existing beef cattle MIS businesses, and bought forest products company Sylvatech, including its A$700 million of assets.
