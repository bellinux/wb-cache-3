5|$|After {{escaping}} the Machias men, the Margaretta {{was forced to}} jibe into brisk winds, {{which resulted in the}} <b>main</b> <b>boom</b> and gaff breaking away, crippling its navigability. Once Moore was in Holmes Bay he captured a sloop and took its spar and gaff to replace the Margaretta's. Moore also took its pilot, Robert Avery, captive. The Unity crew of about 30 Machias men elected Jeremiah O'Brien as their captain and sailed out to chase down the Margaretta. Since the Unity was a much faster sailing vessel, O'Brien's crew quickly caught up to the crippled Margaretta, while the Falmouth Packet lagged behind.|$|E
5|$|Maritime losses as {{a result}} of the {{hurricane}} were considerable. On the evening of 31August, the 140-ton British vessel Spring, which originated from Liverpool, was beached near Cape Romain within the vicinity of the Raccoon Keys. Massive waves caused the boat to disintegrate, and the crew fled on a longboat toward Charleston, South Carolina, surviving but losing the ship's cargo. The craft Brutus, meanwhile, overturned while en route toward Charleston from New York City, suffering the loss of its rigging and <b>main</b> <b>boom.</b> Despite experiencing damage to its cargo of cheese and potatoes, the ship arrived in Charleston safely. Meanwhile, off of Savannah, Georgia, the storm dismasted the clipper Richmond Packet which was delivering Spanish wine. Along the coast of Charleston, high waves prevented ships from docking at port, and boats did not remain with their moorings, with one breaking free and washing aground at James Island. Moving up the coast, the storm leveled fields of cotton, pushed salt water upstream, and destroyed dams protecting rice fields on the Cooper River, destroying the year's harvest. An editor of the newspaper Savannah Republican composed a poem reflecting upon and lamenting the plight of seamen who died in the storm. At Sullivan's Island near Charleston, the hurricane beached several vessels, and from Charleston to Georgetown, intense gusts and copious rainfall ruined cotton and rice fields in low-lying regions.|$|E

50|$|A boomkin {{is a short}} spar {{that may}} project either fore or aft on a sailing vessel, {{depending}} on its function. Traditionally, it was a strong, usually wooden spar extending forward over the bow of a Western sailing ship holding a block through which the tack of the foresail was passed; on some modern sailing yachts with long <b>main</b> <b>booms</b> it is a short spar extending aft from the stern anchoring a central backstay.|$|R

25|$|Lieutenant John Thicknesse {{replaced}} Williams. Shortly thereafter, on 16 October 1798 the French 14-gun privateer Enfant Prodigue captured Charlotte off Cap Français or Cape François, Hispaniola. Charlotte suffered one man wounded {{before she}} struck her colours. A second, smaller schooner and two large armed launches supported Enfant Prodigue {{in the attack}} on Charlotte, which suffered considerable damage. Her <b>main</b> <b>boom</b> topping lift and all the braces had been shot away. One gun had been dismounted and two others disabled by broken breeches, leaving her with only five guns to continue the action. Surrounded by the enemy and unable to manoeuvre, Thicknesse was forced to surrender. Charlottes low casualty rate was {{a consequence of the}} French tactic of firing high to disable rigging. The subsequent court-martial honourably acquitted Thicknesse of the loss.|$|E

She drifted into the American line where she struck her colors to the USS Saratoga. She had lost six men killed and 16 wounded. At McGhie's court martial for the loss of his ship, the board severely reprimanded him for not coming into action properly and for failing to anchor properly.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 February 1825, the Ferret {{was under}} the command of Charles H. Bell. While patrolling the waters off the north shore of Cuba the Ferret capsized during a gale force storm and heavy seas, about 8 miles off the port of Canasi. [...] The next morning Ferret was almost {{completely}} under water and was now settling at a faster rate. The surviving sailors fashioned a raft by lashing the foremast and <b>main</b> <b>boom</b> together while several of the best swimmers headed for shore to get help. Commander Bell (and other survivors) remained with the capsized vessel for twenty-one hours before finally being rescued by the USS Jackal. By the time the storm finally subsided five crew members had perished while many others were wounded.|$|E
50|$|A smack was a {{traditional}} fishing boat used {{off the coast}} of Britain and the Atlantic coast of America for most of the 19th century and, in small numbers, up to the Second World War. Many larger smacks were originally cutter-rigged sailing boats until about 1865, when smacks had become so large that cutter <b>main</b> <b>booms</b> were unhandy. The smaller smacks retain the gaff cutter rig. The larger smacks were lengthened and re-rigged and new ketch-rigged smacks were built, but boats varied from port to port. Some boats had a topsail on the mizzen mast, while others had a bowsprit carrying a jib.|$|R
60|$|Another day of heart-breaking and {{dangerous}} toil saw us in camp {{with the two}} topmasts to the good. The day following I was desperate, and I rafted together the foremast, the fore and <b>main</b> <b>booms,</b> and the fore and main gaffs. The wind was favourable, and I had thought to tow them back under sail, but the wind baffled, then died away, and our progress with the oars was a snail’s pace. And it was such dispiriting effort. To throw one’s whole strength and weight on the oars and to feel the boat checked in its forward lunge by the heavy drag behind, was not exactly exhilarating.|$|R

Almost immediately the receding waves sucked her back, only to send her on the rocks again. The mate, Carlson, called out that there was no use trying to launch the lifeboat, and that their only chance was to make for the rocks. Carlson later reported that the captain, Ingstrom, appeared to be confused, and may have been injured by the <b>main</b> <b>boom,</b> which was [...] "flying about in all directions". The other three crewmembers - Carlson, Holm, and the ship's cook - reached the shore safely, although not without injury. They lit a fire and took shelter under a rock until morning.|$|E

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} design of the control dewar and vacuum pump platform that is to be installed on the D-Zero detector. It's purpose is twofold. Firstly it is a summary and repository of the final design calculations of the structure. Secondly, it documents that design follows the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) manual and applicable OSHA requirements with respect to walking working surfaces. The information contained in the main body of this note is supported by raw calculations included as the appendix. The platform is a truss type frame strucrure constructed primarily of rectangular steel tubing. The upper platform is for support of the control dewar (cryogenic/electrical interface for the solenoid), visible light photon counter (VLPC) cryogenic bayonet can, and infrequently, personnel during the connection and disconnection of the detector to building services. Figure 1 shows a layout of the structure as mounted on the detector and with the installed equipment. The connection of the platform to the detector is not conventional. Two <b>main</b> <b>booms</b> cantilever the structure to a location outside of the detector. The mounting location and support booms allow for the uninhibited motion of the detector components...|$|R

60|$|I had {{solved the}} problem which had arisen through the {{shortness}} of the shears. By means of the watch-tackle (I had made a new one), I heaved {{the butt of the}} foremast across the rail and then lowered it to the deck. Next, by means of the shears, I hoisted the <b>main</b> <b>boom</b> on board. Its forty feet of length would supply the height necessary properly to swing the mast. By means of a secondary tackle I had attached to the shears, I swung the boom to a nearly perpendicular position, then lowered the butt to the deck, where, to prevent slipping, I spiked great cleats around it. The single block of my original shears-tackle I had attached {{to the end of the}} boom. Thus, by carrying this tackle to the windlass, I could raise and lower the end of the boom at will, the butt always remaining stationary, and, by means of guys, I could swing the boom from side to side.

On deck she found a moonless night with a velvety tepid feeling in the air, and in the sky a mass of blurred starlight, like the tarnished tinsel of a worn-out, very old, very tedious firmament. The usual routine of the yacht had been already resumed, the awnings had been stretched aft, a solitary round lamp had been hung as usual under the <b>main</b> <b>boom.</b> Out of the deep gloom behind it d'Alcacer, a long, loose figure, lounged {{in the dim light}} across the deck. D'Alcacer had got promptly in touch with the store of cigarettes he owed to the Governor General's generosity.

D'Alcacer reproached himself for an unwonted light-heartedness which had somehow taken possession of him. He had not experienced that sort of feeling for years.

It was for all the world as though some archangel with a huge sword had slashed it with the figure of a cross; all hands ran to secure the slatting canvas; and in the sudden uproar and alert, Tommy Hadden lost his head. Many of his days have been passed since then in explaining how the thing happened; of these explanations it will be sufficient to say that they were all different, and none satisfactory; and the gross fact remains that the <b>main</b> <b>boom</b> gybed, carried away the tackle, broke the mainmast some three feet above the deck and whipped it overboard.
