40|$|The exotic {{options that}} are {{examined}} in this thesis have a combination of non-standard characteristics {{which can be found}} in shout, multi-callable, pathdependent and Bermudan options. These options are called reset options. A reset option is an option which allows the holder to reset, one or more times, certain terms of the contract based on pre-specified rules during the life of the option. Overall in this thesis, an attempt has been made to tackle the modeling challenges that arise from the exotic properties of the reset option embedded in segregated funds. Initially, the relevant literature was reviewed and the lack of published work, advanced enough to deal with the complexities of the reset option, was identified. Hence, {{there appears to be a}} clear and urgent need to have more sophisticated approaches which will model the reset option. The reset option on the <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee</b> of segregated funds is formulated as a non-stationary finite horizon Markov Decision Process. The returns from the underlying asset are modeled using a discrete time approximation of the lognormal model. An Optimal Exercise Boundary of the reset option is derived where a threshold value is depicted such that if the value of the underlying asset price exceeds it then it is optimal for the policyholder to reset his <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee.</b> Otherwise, it is optimal for the policyholder to rollover his <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee.</b> It is noteworthy that the model is able to depict the Optimal Exercise Boundary of not just the first but of all the segregated fund contracts which can be issued throughout the planning horizon of the policyholder. The main finding of the model is that as the segregated fund contract approaches its maturity, the threshold value in the Optimal Exercise Boundary increases. However, in the last period before the maturity of the segregated fund, the threshold value decreases. The reason for this is that if the reset option is not exercised it will expire worthless. The model is then extended to re ect on the characteristics of the range of products which are traded in the market. Firstly, the issuer of the segregated fund contract is allowed to charge a management fee to the policyholder. The effect from incorporating this fee is that the policyholder requires a higher return in order to optimally reset his <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee</b> while the total value of the segregated fund is diminished. Secondly, the <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee</b> becomes a function of the number of times that the reset option has been exercised. The effect is that the policyholder requires a higher return in order to choose to reset his <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee</b> while the total value of the segregated fund is diminished. Thirdly, the policyholder is allowed to reset the <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee</b> at any point in time within each year from the start of the planning horizon, but only once. The effect is that the total value of the segregated fund is increased since the policyholder may lock in higher market gains as he has more reset decision points. In response to the well documented deficiencies of the lognormal model to capture the jumps experienced by stock markets, extensions were built which incorporate such jumps in the original model. The effect from incorporating such jumps is that the policyholder requires a higher return in order to choose to reset his <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee</b> while the total value of the segregated fund is diminished due to the adverse effect of the negative jumps on the value of the underlying asset.

40|$|Motivated by the {{importance}} of withdrawal benefits for enhancing sales of variable annuities, we propose a new equity-linked product which provides a dynamic withdrawal benefit (DWB) during the contract period and a minimum guarantee at contract maturity. The term DWB is coined to reflect the duality between it and dynamic fund protection. Under the Black-Scholes framework and using results pertaining to reflected Brownian motion, we obtain explicit pricing formulas for the DWB payment stream and the <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee.</b> These pricing formulas are also derived by means of Esscher transforms, which is another seminal contribution by Gerber to finance.

In these products the contributions are invested on the capital market, which involves investment risk for the client. To protect the contribution payers against this risk the modern pension frames include performance guarantees.

This paper proposes a pricing model for <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantees</b> embedded in retirement saving plans. A deterministic guaranteed rate of return and periodic contributions are considered. Since <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantees</b> have long-term character, an approach is needed that models the long-run behaviour of the market prices of securities.

For guarantee pricing WEBB’s (2003) option pricing for Markov switching model is applied, {{which is based on}} the Esscher transform.

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{investments}} available in the Canadian market today is a mutual fund with the added feature of a long term <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantee.</b> These types of investments are known as segregated funds.

These contracts contain multiple embedded shout options which permit the holder to reset the guarantee level and the maturity date for which it applies many times during the life of the contract. These funds also provide mortality benefits if the investor dies prior to the maturity date. This paper explores the valuation of segregated funds using an approach based on the numerical solution of a set of linear complementarity problems.

We consider only unit-linked contracts, but our methodologies and, to some extent, our numerical results would apply also to with profits contracts. The Report of the Annuity Guarantees Working Party, Bolton et al.

There was no consensus at that time among the companies on how to reserve for such options. The Report discussed several approaches to reserving but concluded that it was unable to recommend a single approach. This paper is an attempt to fill that gap. We investigate two approaches to reserving and pricing. In the first sections of the paper we consider quantile, and conditional tail expectation, reserves. The methodology we adopt here is very close to that proposed by the <b>Maturity</b> <b>Guarantees</b> Working Party in its Report to the profession, Ford et al. (1980).

40|$|Segregated {{funds have}} been an {{extremely}} popular Canadian investment vehicle {{during the past few}} years. These instruments provide long term <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantees</b> and often include extremely complex option features. One heavily debated feature is the reset feature; the ability to lock in market gains. In typical cases, investors have the ability to do this two or four times per year. The valuation of this embedded optionality has been controversial. Recently, regulators have announced that firms offering these products will be subject to new capital requirements. In this paper we discuss the effects of market parameters, such as volatility and interest rates, on the cost of providing a segregated fund guarantee. We also demonstrate how the level of optimality in investors' use of the reset feature affects the cost of providing such a guarantee. For each scenario, we provide the appropriate management expense ratio (M. E. R.) which should be charged as well as demonstrating the current liability using a given fixed M. E. R.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze {{deterministic}} <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantees.</b> Such guarantees are embedded in modern individual pension products {{in order to protect}} the customer from downside investment risk. In particular, we focus on four issues: guarantee pricing, shortfall risk analysis, solvency requirements, and expected return. Other risk sources, such as mortality, early contract cancelation, or other problems such as hedging are left to further research. The first main contribution of this thesis is the implementation of a model with a stochastic volatility of the return rate of risky assets backing the guarantee. This constitutes the main difference to previous papers, which usually assume that the risky asset underlying the guarantee follows the geometric Brownian motion. We decided to use the Markov regime switching model introduced by Hamilton (1989) as it outperforms the linear and GARCH models. The use of the Markov switching model implies the incompleteness of the financial market. To address this issue we chose the Esscher martingale measure, which is well-known in actuarial science, in order to price the guarantee. This is the second main contribution of this thesis. Third, we proposed measuring the risk of the guarantee with several lower partial moments and conditional lower partial moments. In order to quantify the solvency capital, we proposed the mean excess loss. Furthermore, we have shown how risk managers can control the price and risk associated with a guarantee by making a suitable choice among several risk factors such as guarantee level, stock proportion, and time/contract term, or use a suitable investment strategy. Last, we have shown how to construct the so-called zero-bond investment strategy, which provides a costless/riskless guarantee...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The durability and lifetime of photovoltaic (PV) modules {{is one of the}} chief concerns for an industry which is rapidly approaching <b>maturity.</b> <b>Guaranteeing</b> the economic viability of potential PV installations is paramount to fostering growth of the industry. Whilst certification standards have helped to improve the reliability of modules, with a significant reduction in early failures, long-term performance degradation and overall lifetimes are yet to be addressed in a meaningful way. For this, it is necessary to quantify the effects of use-environment and module design. Long-term degradation of the solder bonds in PV modules causes steady power loss and leads to the generation of more devastating, secondary mechanisms such as hot-spots. Whilst solder bond degradation is well-recognised and even tested for in certification protocols, the potential rate of degradation is not well understood, particularly with respect to different environmental conditions and material selection. The complex nature of a standard silicon PV module construction makes it difficult to observe the stresses experienced by the various components during normal operation. This thesis presents the development of a finite-element model which is used to observe the stresses and strains experienced by module components during normal operating conditions and quantifies the degradation of solder bonds under different environmental conditions. First, module operating temperatures are examined across a range of climates and locations to evaluate the thermal profiles experienced by modules. Using finite-element techniques, the thermomechanical behaviour of modules is then simulated using the same thermal profiles and a quantification of solder bond degradation potential in each location is achieved. It is shown that hot climates are responsible for the highest degradation potential, but further to this, hot environments with many ii clear sky days, allowing for large swings in module temperature, are significantly more damaging. A comparison is drawn between indoor accelerated stress procedures and outdoor exposure, such that an equivalence between test duration and location-dependent outdoor exposure can be determined. It is shown that for the most damaging climate studied, 86 standard thermal cycles is appropriate for one-year of outdoor exposure whereas the least damaging environment would require 11 standard thermal cycles. However, these conclusions may only be applicable to the specific module design which was modelled as the material selection and interaction within a device {{plays a major role in}} the thermomechanical behaviour and degradation potential. In addition to a study on the influence of use-environment, a study on the influence of the encapsulating material is conducted with a particular focus on the effects of the viscoelastic properties of the materials. It is shown that the degradation of solder bonds can vary depending on the encapsulating material. Furthermore, the intended use-environment could inform the selection of the encapsulating material. The temperature-dependency of the material properties means that some materials will mitigate thermomechanical degradation mechanisms more than others under certain conditions i. e. hotter or colder climates...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop more realistic long term asset models based on L´evy processes and discuss their applications to risk management of unitised with-profits policies. We investigate the behaviour of long-term returns of the UK total share return index by testing the common statistical properties for financial data, so-called “stylised facts”. We show that for the monthly U. K. share total return indices, the Gaussian return hypothesis is rejected in series of tests. The local distribution of the returns has higher kurtosis and heavier tails than the Gaussian. In addition, the returns series show significant nonlinear autocorrelation, extreme returns appear in clusters. The first long term asset model purposed in this thesis is the exponential L´evy model with non-Gaussian increment. We describe the Generalised Hyperbolic distributions with their subclasses. They are considered as candidate distributions for the increments of the driving L´evy processes. We estimate model parameters to the UK share gross total return index using two approaches, maximum likelihood (MLE) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit tests demonstrate that these L´evy driven models give more accurate fits to the historical equity index returns data. For the liability model we consider long term participating life insurance products specifically unitised with-profits contracts. The payouts of unitised with-profits policies are simulated {{under a variety of}} asset models driven by L´evy processes. At first a basic model policy is considered with limited insurer operations and no risk controls. We look into various risk measures of the maturity loss for the insurer xiii and compare the statistical properties for different non-Gaussian increment L´evy models. It is found that the classical Gaussian model substantially underestimates the risk measures in unitised with-profits policies. The L´evy driven models which have semi-heavy tailed increments are aggregate to normal distributions in the long run. Then we consider different retrospective bonus mechanisms by varying the participating rate and the smoothing period. As a comparison we use a bonus earning power method with deterministic projected maturity asset share and 25 percent terminal bonus cushion. We study the joint distributions of the maturity asset shares and guarantees under these two bonus mechanism. With similar risk measures, there are larger expected <b>maturity</b> <b>guarantees</b> under bonus earning power method than retrospective bonus. Declaring bonuses on a more frequent basis is then tested, which has the desired effect of reducing the risk measures when declaring monthly bonuses using bonus earning power mechanism. We make observations on two different investment strategies, a diversified investment strategy and a hedging based investment strategy. The former method tries to reduce the variance of the invest return distribution while the hedging investment strategy, on the other hand, narrows the left tail of the maturity loss distribution by paying an extra amount of expenses. Finally, the L´evy models are extended by using GARCH(1, 1) -m type volatility. Both maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators using Markov Chain Monte Carlo are presented. The statistical tests on the devolatilised data show that the GARCH model reduces the non-linear autocorrelation in the conditional return processes and furthermore improve the fitting of the asset models. Also, multi-variable models are considered. Stochastic bridges driven by L´evy processes are constructed while the yearly returns follow the Wilkie model.

40|$|Losses may {{accrue to}} depositors at {{insolvent}} banks both at {{and after the}} time of official resolution. Losses at resolution occur because of poor closure rules and regulatory forbearance. Losses after resolution occur if depositors'' access to their claims is delayed or "frozen. " While the sources and implications of losses at resolution have been analyzed previously, the sources and implications of losses after resolution have received little attention. This paper examines the causes of delayed depositors'' access to their funds at resolved banks, describes how the FDIC provides immediate access, reports on a special survey of access practices in other countries, and analyzes {{the costs and benefits}} of delayed access in terms of both the effects on market discipline and depositor pressure to protect all deposits.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} life insurance products to have emerged in recent years in the Romanian insurance market has been the unit-linked contract. Unit-linked insurance products are life insurance policies with investment component. A unit-linked life insurance has two important components: protection and investment. The protection component refers to the insured sum in case of the occurrence of insured risks and the investment component refers to the policyholders’ account that represents the present value of the units from the chosen investment funds. Due to the financial instability caused by the Global Crisis and the amplification of market competitiveness, insurers from international markets have started to incorporate guarantees in unit-linked products. So a unit- linked life insurance policy with an asset value guarantee is an insurance policy whose benefit payable on death or at maturity consists of the greater of some guaranteed amount and the value of the units from the investment funds. One {{of the most}} challenging issues concerns the pricing of minimum death benefit and <b>maturity</b> benefit <b>guarantees</b> and the establishing of proper reserves for these guarantees. Insurers granting guarantees of this type must estimate the cost and include the cost in the premium. An important component of the activity carried out by the insurance companies is the investment of the premiums paid by policyholders in various types of assets, in order to obtain higher yields than those guaranteed by the insurance contracts, while providing the necessary liquidity for the payment of insurance claims in case of occurrence of the assumed risks. So the guaranteed benefits can be broadly matched or immunized with various types of financial assets, especially with fixed-interest instruments. According to Romanian legislation which regulates the unit-linked life insurance market, unit-linked life insurance contracts pass most of the investment risk to the policyholder and involve no investment risk for the insurer. Although the Romanian legislation authorizes the Romanian insurers to offer unit-linked contracts without investment guarantees, this research provides a proposal of a theoretical and empirical basis for pricing the unit-linked insurance contracts with incorporated investment guarantees...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 73 - 79). This thesis {{reviews the}} origins, development and uses of asset-liability modelling, {{as well as}} existing largely stochastic investment models, notably those of the <b>Maturity</b> <b>Guarantees</b> Working Party (1980), Wilkie (1986, 1995) and Thomson (1996). A stochastic investment model is developed which describes returns from equities, bonds and cash, as well as inflation and economic growth. The model is consistent with economic theory, adequately fits past data, and is relatively parsimonious compared with other models. A series of assumptions about the causal relationships between inflation, economic growth and interest rates are made based on standard economic theory. It is noted that consensus does not exist {{on some of the}} economic theory. Similarly a series of assumptions on the pricing of assets are made based on financial economic theory on market efficiency, expectations and asset pricing. Notably, it is assumed that financial markets are efficient. An economic model is described for inflation, economic growth and interest rates based on the set of assumptions. Each variable is modelled such that its value in one period is a function of its value in the previous period, the value of the other economic variables in the current and previous period, and a normally distributed residual. The model is a mixture of a random walk and autoregressive process that has two special cases of a (non-mean-reverting) pure random walk, and a (mean-reverting) pure autoregressive process. A financial market model is described for bond and equity returns based on the set of assumptions. Expected returns are derived from the expected real interest rate plus a risk premium, where the risk premium is linearly related to the standard deviation of real return. Bond yields are modelled as the sum of expected future short term real interest rates, expected future inflation, and a risk premium. Share prices are modelled as the present value of expected future distributable earnings, discounted at a rate equal to the sum of expected future short term real interest rates, expected future inflation, and a risk premium. The growth in earnings per share is modelled as the sum of inflation, real economic growth and a normal residual, and is also linked to real interest rates. Dividends are modelled as a smoothed function of earnings, with unit-gain from earnings to dividends. Annual data for a 15 year period is used to parameterise the model for the United States, Britain and South Africa respectively. The modelled volatilities of financial market returns, together with the economic data, are used to fit the economic model. The procedure is similar to the method of moments for statistical estimation. Parameters in the economic model that are not statistically significant or are not consistent with the assumptions are excluded. It was found that neither the random walk nor the autoregressive special case models could adequately explain observed volatility in financial markets, so the general case (mixture model) was adopted for economic variables. The parameterised models for the three countries studied exhibited a ""cascade structure"" where all variables are a function of one or two ""driving variables"", without any circularity/""feedback"". The models for the United States and Britain all have inflation as the driving variable, whereas the South African model has both inflation and economic growth as driving variables. The model achieves the objectives of consistency with economic theory as well as parsimony (when compared to Wilkie (1995)). With regards to the criterion of producing reasonable output, the model has advantages over existing models. These include that financial market returns simulated by the model are non-normal and exhibit significant leptokursis (fat-tails) with higher probabilities of severe down-market returns than are predicted by normal or log-normal distributions. Simulated returns also exhibit the weak and slow mean reversion that is observed in markets, and the simulated yield curve exhibits non-parallel shifts and inversions. However, simulated interest rates (particularly nominal interest rates), and even bond yields can become negative, although the probability of negative nominal interest rates is small in the model, and that of negative bond yields is negligible. Two areas where a good fit was not achieved were in the models of risk premiums and dividends. It is recommended that alternative approaches for estimating risk premiums be used. The poor fit to dividend data is not regarded as a significant weakness because modelled equity returns are not dependent on dividends...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the effects of the {{maturities}} of credit-enhanced debt contracts on the value of an insurer's loan-guarantee portfolios. Design/methodology/approach – The paper proposes a contingent-claims model and uses as measure of credit insurance risk, the market value of the private guarantee, which accounts for projects' and guarantor's specific risks, correlations as well as financial leverage. Findings – The results indicate that in the case of insuring the debts of two parallel projects with different specific risks, one high-risk and the other low-risk, the tradeoff between <b>maturities</b> of the <b>guarantees</b> increases with the projects' expected losses, hence the maturity choice decision is crucial for portfolios subject to high expected losses. For a two sequential projects loan-guarantee portfolio, the paper finds that, regardless of the order of execution of the projects, it is the maturity of the debt supporting the high-risk project that drives the risk exposure of the portfolio. Practical implications – Since the management of portfolios of guarantees is of significant importance to many organizations both domestically and internationally, this paper proposes a simple and tractable model to gauge the impact of maturity choices for loan-guarantee portfolios. Originality/value – This is a first attempt at modeling multiple maturities in the context of portfolios of vulnerable loan guarantees. Credit, Debts, Portfolio investment, Project finance...|$|R
40|$|For {{households}} seeking {{retirement income}} security, short-term deposits (such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and Treasury bills) seem an ideal and appropriate investment choice – particularly given the recent extraordinary turbulence {{in the financial}} markets. Over the past year, an investment in short-term deposits would have actually outperformed investments in corporate bonds and far outperformed corporate stocks. Retired households exhibit a strong preference for holding such apparently safe investments. One study found that 86 percent of households nearing retirement (ages 60 - 64) had bank accounts, while only 33 percent owned stocks directly and only 7 percent owned bonds directly. And the desire for short-term investments increased with age. But short-term investments, while safe, produce uncertain returns. This Issue in Brief highlights the trade-off that households must make between a guaranteed return of capital and a guaranteed return on capital – they cannot have {{both at the same}} time. Short-term deposits provide a guaranteed return of capital, but offer no guarantees as to the return the household will receive on its capital. In contrast, a portfolio of Treasury bonds of appropriate <b>maturities</b> provides a <b>guaranteed</b> return on capital, but with the return of capital <b>guaranteed</b> only at <b>maturity.</b> This brief argues that retired households seeking a secure and dependable income should prioritize return on capital over return of capital. For such households, the true risk-free asset is a portfolio of bonds and, in particular, inflation-protected bonds of appropriate maturities. ...|$|R
