5|$|Alboin's {{death had}} a lasting impact, as it {{deprived}} the Lombards {{of the only}} leader they had that could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents {{the death of the}} last of the line of the hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for <b>many</b> <b>centuries</b> in epic poetry, with Saxons and Bavarians celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.|$|E

5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and roads were built along these <b>many</b> <b>centuries</b> ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It was a place of great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
5|$|For <b>many</b> <b>centuries</b> thereafter, the {{settlements}} around the Mont Blanc massif comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats. Some {{farmers in the}} valley of Chamonix joined their counterparts from the neighbouring valleys of Maurienne, Beaufortain and Tarentaise and crossed the Alps into southern Germany, Austria and northern Italy to sell their products and bring back goods for sale in local markets.|$|E
5|$|For <b>many</b> <b>centuries,</b> {{the people}} within the Nri hegemony were {{committed}} to peace. This religious pacifism was rooted in a belief that violence was an abomination which polluted the earth. Instead, the eze Nri could declare a form of excommunication from the odinani Nri against those who violated specific taboos. Members of the Ikénga could isolate entire communities via this form of ritual siege.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Leigh was {{originally}} the centre of a large ecclesiastical parish covering six vills or townships.

5|$|The {{production}} process was {{and still is}} chemically straightforward, effectively dissolving lead in aqua fortis (nitric acid), and subsequently harvesting the precipitate. However, the production remained small-scale for <b>many</b> <b>centuries,</b> and the commercial production of lead(II) nitrate as raw material for the manufacture of other lead compounds was not reported until 1835. In 1974, the U.S. consumption of lead compounds, excluding pigments and gasoline additives, was 642tons.|$|E
5|$|The short-finned {{pilot whale}} has also been hunted for <b>many</b> <b>centuries,</b> {{particularly}} by Japanese whalers. Between 1948 and 1980, hundreds of whales were exploited at Hokkaido and Sanriku {{in the north and}} Taiji, Izu, and Okinawa in the south. These fisheries were at their highest in the late 1940s and early 1950s; 2,326 {{short-finned pilot whale}}s were harvested in the mid- to late 1980s. This had decreased to about 400 per year by the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} a long history of {{association}} with humans, having been extensively hunted as a pest and furbearer for <b>many</b> <b>centuries,</b> as well as being represented in human folklore and mythology. Because of its widespread distribution and large population, the red fox is one of the most important furbearing animals harvested for the fur trade. Too small to pose a threat to humans, it has extensively benefited from the presence of human habitation, and has successfully colonised many suburban and urban areas.|$|E
5|$|After the Iberian king Pharasmanes I had his son Rhadamistus (r.51–55AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, Vologeses I of Parthia (r. c.51–77AD) {{planned to}} invade and place his brother, the later Tiridates I of Armenia, on the throne. Rhadamistus was {{eventually}} driven from power, and, {{beginning with the}} reign of Tiridates, Parthia would retain firm control over Armenia—with brief interruptions—through the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. Even {{after the fall of}} the Parthian Empire, the Arsacid line lived on through the Armenian kings. However, not only did the Arsacid line continue through the Armenians, it as well continued through the Georgian kings with the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and for <b>many</b> <b>centuries</b> afterwards in Caucasian Albania through the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania.|$|E
5|$|Before the 19th century {{there were}} no {{universities}} in Northern England. The University of Durham was founded in 1832, and is sometimes counted with the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge, although it post-dates them by <b>many</b> <b>centuries.</b> The next universities built in the North {{were part of the}} wave of redbrick universities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, there are seven Northern institutions in the Russell Group of leading research universities: Durham, the redbricks of Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield and the later plate glass university of York. These universities, together with plate-glass Lancaster, form the N8 Research Partnership.|$|E
