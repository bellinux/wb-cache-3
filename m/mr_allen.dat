5|$|Wallace, {{pointing}} out that he often journeyed expressly to obtain specimens, describes the birds-of-paradise in detail, {{and the effects of}} sexual selection by the females. He covers the great, king, red, magnificent, superb, golden or six-shafted, standard wing, twelve-wired, and epimaque or long-tailed birds-of-paradise, as well as three New Guinea birds which he considers almost as remarkable. He suggests they could live well if released in the Palm House at Kew Gardens. In all he knows of 18 species, of which 11 are from New Guinea and 8 are endemic to it and Salwatty, or 14 in the general New Guinea area (1 being from the Moluccas and 3 from Australia). His assistant <b>Mr</b> <b>Allen</b> runs into trouble as the people were suspicious of his motives. A year of five voyages had produced only 5 of the 14 species in the New Guinea area.|$|E

25|$|Prolific {{inventor}} Joseph Bramah {{began his}} professional career installing water closets (toilets) that {{were based on}} Alexander Cumming's patented design of 1775. He found that the current model being installed in London houses {{had a tendency to}} freeze in cold weather. In collaboration with a <b>Mr</b> <b>Allen,</b> he improved the design by replacing the usual slide valve with a hinged flap that sealed the bottom of the bowl.|$|E
25|$|Surprise {{is not yet}} to {{be broken}} up; Admiral Ives sends Aubrey {{on a mission to}} protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from the USS Norfolk, sailing on HMS Surprise on his first voyage around Cape Horn. Aubrey makes all haste to prepare his ship with men and supplies. He {{recruits}} <b>Mr</b> <b>Allen,</b> a new master with an in-depth knowledge of whalers, takes on Mr Martin as schoolmaster to the midshipmen, and Mr Hollom, an ageing midshipman. Aubrey wonders if his kindness takes aboard a Jonah with Hollom.|$|E
25|$|Most {{accounts}} seem {{to agree}} that at least three mob members were wounded by Smith's gunfire, {{but there is no}} other evidence that any of them died as a result. John Wills was shot in the arm, William Voras was shot in the shoulder, and William Gallaher was shot in the face. Others claimed that a fourth unnamed man was also wounded. Wills, Voras, Gallaher, and a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen</b> (possibly the fourth man) were all indicted for the murder of the Smiths. Wills, Voras, and Gallaher, perhaps conscious that their wounds could prove that they were involved in the mob, fled the county after being indicted and were never brought to trial. Apart from Taylor's report of what he had heard, {{there is no evidence that}} Wills, Voras, Gallaher, or Allen died from their wounds.|$|E

50|$|Mr Blunden, {{an elderly}} solicitor, visits <b>Mrs</b> <b>Allen,</b> a widow {{who lives with}} her three {{children}} Jamie, Lucy and the baby, in Camden Town, London, England. He tells her that his firm {{are looking for a}} suitable person to act as a caretaker to an old, abandoned house in the country until such time as the descendants of the original owners can be traced. When <b>Mrs</b> <b>Allen</b> leaves the room to tend to her baby, Mr Blunden mentions to Jamie and Lucy that there are rumours that the old house is haunted but that ghosts can often appear as ordinary people, perhaps children like themselves, and that ghosts are often people in need of help... Jamie and Lucy confirm that they wouldn't be scared of ghosts that appeared in that form and would help, if they could. Before <b>Mrs</b> <b>Allen</b> returns, <b>Mr</b> Blunden leaves, giving Jamie an old, faded card for the firm Blunden, Blunden and Claverton, where <b>Mrs</b> <b>Allen</b> should call the next day to inquire about the post.|$|R
25|$|The Surprise sails to the {{farthest}} east point of Brazil, where the bowsprit is burnt by lightning. During the repairs in Penedo, Pullings sees the USS Norfolk pass by. Mrs Horner, the gunner's wife, engages in {{an affair with}} Hollom, and becomes pregnant. Maturin will {{not interfere with the}} pregnancy, so she turns to his assistant, Higgins, who leaves her near death. Maturin saves her life. In the Atlantic, Surprise retakes the packet Danaë, with Lieutenant Lawrence in command. Tom Pullings sails the Danae back to England, after Maturin and Aubrey take possession of a hidden brass box, per instructions to Maturin. Surprise rounds Cape Horn with some losses, and then reaches the Juan Fernández Islands to refit and recover. There, the gunner kills his wife and Hollom, and re-boards the ship. Off Chile, Horner learns that Higgins performed an abortion on his wife; Higgins disappears from the ship and Horner hangs himself in his cabin. In the Pacific, with information from a Spanish merchantman, Surprise retakes the valuable whaler Acapulco with Caleb Gill in command, nephew to the Norfolks captain. <b>Mr</b> <b>Allen</b> negotiates with the agent for the whaler in Valparaiso, where the American prisoners are left ashore. Taking the whaler restores the spirit to the crew.|$|E
500|$|He {{is blown}} far off course {{while trying to}} reach his assistant, <b>Mr</b> <b>Allen,</b> losing some men who went ashore, {{dragging}} anchor, running on to a coral reef, and guided by an incorrect map; it took 8 days [...] "among the reefs and islands of Waigiou" [...] {{to return to a}} safe harbour. He sends a boat to rescue his men; it returns 10 days later without them, but he pays them again, and on the second attempt it returns with his two men, who had survived for a month [...] "on the roots and tender flower-stalks of a species of Bromelia, on shell-fish, and on a few turtles' eggs." ...|$|E
500|$|Small Time Crooks starred Grant, in {{the words}} of film critic Andrew Sarris, as [...] "a petty, petulant, faux-Pygmalion art dealer, David, [...] is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic {{characters}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen</b> has ever created." [...] In a role devoid of his comic attributes, the New York Times wrote: [...] "Mr. Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation." [...] A year later, his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) was proclaimed by Variety to be [...] "as sly an overthrow of a star's polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory". The film, adapted from Helen Fielding's novel of the same name, was an international hit, earning $281million worldwide. Grant was, according to the Washington Post, fitting as [...] "a cruel, manipulative cad, hiding behind the male god's countenance that he knows all too well".|$|E

2500|$|Penniman was 18 when Ethan Allen, {{liberated from}} the Tower of London, {{returned}} to his native State. [...] "I should like," [...] said Penniman, one evening in a mixed company in her step-father's parlor, [...] "above all things to see this <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen,</b> of whom we hear such incredible things." [...] This saying reached the ears of Allen, who soon after {{paid a visit to}} the house of Mr. Wall, and was introduced to Penniman. There was a mutual and agreeable surprise, both manifestly pleased with the tone of thought and conversation, which ran on with a natural flow, and developed traits of kindred sympathies of intellect and feeling. It was late in the evening before <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen</b> rose. He had not failed to observe the interest his conversation had excited in Penniman. [...] "And now," [...] said he, as he stood erect before her, and was about to depart—" [...] and now, Miss Brush, allow me to ask, how do you like this Mr. Allen?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Allen again {{made a few}} changes, {{including}} the singing DeMarco Sisters, to whom he'd been tipped by arranger-composer Gordon Jenkins. [...] "We did four years with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen</b> and got one thousand dollars a week," [...] Gloria DeMarco remembered. [...] "Sunday night was the best night on radio." [...] Sunday night with Fred Allen seemed incomplete on any night listeners didn't hear the DeMarco Sisters, whose breezy, harmonious style became as familiar as their cheerfully sung [...] "Mr. Al-len, Mr. Alll-llennnn" [...] in the show's opening theme. During the theme's brief pause, Allen would say something like, [...] "It isn't the mayor of Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga, kiddies." [...] That device became a signature for {{three of the four}} years.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the film}} was released, New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther, liked the {{direction}} of the film and the acting, writing, [...] "Yet such is the role that Mr. Sinatra plays in Suddenly!, a taut little melodrama that... shapes up as one of the slickest recent items in the minor movie league... we have several people to thank—particularly Richard Sale for a good script, which tells a straight story credibly, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen</b> for direction that makes both excitement and sense, Mr. Bassler for a production that gets the feel of a small town and the cast which includes Sterling Hayden, James Gleason and Nancy Gates." [...] Crowther especially liked Sinatra's performance. He wrote, [...] "Mr. Sinatra deserves a special chunk of praise...In Suddenly! he proves it in a melodramatic tour de force." ...|$|E

2500|$|The two {{countries}} have maintained diplomatic relations since the Netherlands' recognition of Indonesian sovereignty in 1949. Indonesia's first representative to Australia, Dr Usman Sastroamidjojo, was initially sent to Australia in 1947. Dr Usman returned to Canberra in 1949, opening Indonesia's embassy in the Hotel Canberra, {{before moving to}} a permanent building in Yarralumla in 1971. Indonesian consulates are located in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth, and honorary consuls are located in Darwin and Adelaide. The Indonesian Consulate in Darwin was first headed by the Honorary Consul, [...] <b>Mr</b> <b>Allen</b> Keith Wilson (December 1974) and followed by Indonesian appointed Consuls : Mr Soedhoro (August 1980), Mr R. Soerodjo Pringgowirono (January 1982), Mr Benedictus Sarjono [...] (September 1991), Mr Louis Roesli (April 2000), Mr Zacharias Manongga (2003), Mr Harbangan Napitupulu (2007), Mr Ade Padmo Sarwono (2012) and Mr Andre Omer Siregar (December 2014).|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{contact between}} the armies {{occurred}} at 9 a.m. on June 29. On the farm and orchards owned by a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen,</b> about [...] west of Savage's Station, two Georgia regiments from the brigade of Brig. Gen. George T. Anderson fought against two Pennsylvania regiments from Sumner's corps {{for about two hours}} before disengaging, suffering 28 casualties to the Pennsylvanians' 119. The highest ranking casualty was Confederate Brig. Gen. Richard Griffith, who was mortally wounded by a Union shell fragment. Magruder, who was alleged to be under the influence of morphine to combat a bout of indigestion, was confused and became concerned that he might be attacked by a superior force. He requested reinforcements from Lee, who ordered two brigades from the division of Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger to assist, under the condition {{that they would have to}} be returned if they were not engaged by 2 p.m.|$|E
6000|$|The {{thought of}} it was too much. I ran to my {{grandfather}} crying: [...] "Not <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen,</b> sir, not <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen.</b> Any one else you please,--Mr. Fairbrother even." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Allen {{had only}} one small hot-house, which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Allen</b> had the use of for her plants in winter, {{and there was a}} fire in it now and then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed, {{it looks}} very nice. But, dear <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Allen,</b> are you sure there is nobody you know in all this {{multitude}} of people? I think you must know somebody." ...|$|R
50|$|As of 2008 {{there were}} about 50 {{students}} enrolled from at least five different schools. The school had five teachers: Mrs. Woodard, Ms. Janson, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Allen,</b> Ms. Jones and Mrs. Nelson.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{announced}} your intention of 'standing by' <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen,</b> as you express it. Have you reflected {{that there are}} some others who deserve to be consulted and considered beside <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen</b> and yourself?" ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the second}} {{day at the office}} Hal was {{astonished}} to learn that the <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen</b> of the firm was the man he had seen in company with Mr. Hardwick on the Pennsylvania ferry-boat. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen</b> did not recognize him, and the youth thought it just as well not to mention the meeting. During the afternoon Mr. Sumner and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen</b> went out together. They were hardly gone when Hardwick put on his hat and coat and followed, leaving the youth in sole charge.|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>Mr.</b> <b>Allen,</b> {{the second}} officer, {{came up with}} the two lads.|$|E
60|$|All {{this was}} good tonic for Wallace, {{and an hour}} later he sipped broth, while <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Allen</b> and the Deacon and Herman stood {{watching}} the process with apparently consuming interest. Mattie was still soundly sleeping.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Allen</b> {{looked down}} at the two bright, girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly, [...] "I think I can, but I am not sure my choice will please you. Why not ask Miss Price?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and is <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Allen</b> Brownlow. Poor child, you rescued {{her from}} a sad fate. She {{believed}} to the last you were coming with her, and she lost your note, or you would have heard from us sooner." ...|$|R
