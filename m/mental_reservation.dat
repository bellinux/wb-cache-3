40|$|We {{have already}} {{developed}} a legal reasoning system by analogy {{based on a}} framework, called Goal-Dependent Abstraction (GDA), to detect similarities dependent on given goals. According to the framework, two legal concepts are regarded as similar ones, provided they share the same explanation of a legal purpose as the goal to be explained. Consequently, we can automatically capture similarities between the premises of legal rules and cases in inquiry, depending on the purposes of legal rules. In this article, we further show that this approach works well in an actual case for which Japanese Supreme Court has analogically applied the Article 93 of the Civil Code of Japan, which prescribes <b>mental</b> <b>reservations,</b> to an act as an agent. Furthermore, to illustrate our reasoning procedure, we also demonstrate the overview and GUI of our legal reasoning system adopting an object-oriented logic programming language to describe legal knowledge. ...|$|R

But all this was inconclusive, for the reason that Mrs. Smiley was not fastened as she is now. I took it all with a pinch of salt. My <b>mental</b> <b>reservations</b> must have reached the minds of the 'guides,' for with startling suddenness they left the table and fell upon the top of the piano.

60|$|The venerable {{inhabitants}} of that venerable pile seemed, in those times, to be encamped {{there like a}} sort of civilised gipsies. There was a temporary air about their establishments, {{as if they were}} going away the moment they could get anything better; there was also a dissatisfied air about themselves, as if they took it very ill that they had not already got something much better. Genteel blinds and makeshifts were more or less observable as soon as their doors were opened; screens not half high enough, which made dining-rooms out of arched passages, and warded off obscure corners where footboys slept at nights with their heads among the knives and forks; curtains which called upon you to believe that they didn't hide anything; panes of glass which requested you not to see them; many objects of various forms, feigning to have no connection with their guilty secret, a bed; disguised traps in walls, which were clearly coal-cellars; affectations of no thoroughfares, which were evidently doors to little kitchens. <b>Mental</b> <b>reservations</b> and artful mysteries grew out of these things. Callers looking steadily into the eyes of their receivers, pretended not to smell cooking three feet off; people, confronting closets accidentally left open, pretended not to see bottles; visitors with their heads against a partition of thin canvas, and a page and a young female at high words on the other side, made believe to be sitting in a primeval silence. There was no end to the small social accommodation-bills of this nature which the gipsies of gentility were constantly drawing upon, and accepting for, one another.|$|R
6000|$|In ninety-nine cases out of {{a hundred}} they will accept the system still, they will accept it with <b>mental</b> <b>reservations.</b> They will see that to {{repudiate}} the system {{by more than a}} chance word or deed is to become isolated, to become a discontented alien, to lose even the qualified permission to do something in the world. In most cases they will take the oaths that come in their way and kiss the hands--just as the British elementary teachers bow unbelieving heads to receive the episcopal pat, and just as the British sceptic in orders will achieve triumphs of ambiguity to secure the episcopal see. And their reason for submission will not be absolutely despicable; they will know there is no employment worth speaking of without it. After all, one has only one life, and it is not pleasant to pass through it in a state of futile abstinence from the general scheme. Life, unfortunately, does not end with heroic moments of repudiation; there comes a morrow to the Everlasting Nay. One may begin with heroic renunciations and end in undignified envy and dyspeptic comments outside the door one has slammed on one's self. In such reflections your children of the exceptional sort, it may be after a youthful fling or two, a [...] "ransom" [...] speech or so, will find excellent reasons for making their peace with things as they are, just as if they were utterly commonplace. They know that if they can boast a knighthood or a baronetcy or a Privy Councillorship, they will taste day by day and every day that respect, that confidence from all about them that no one but a trained recluse despises. And life will abound in opportunities. [...] "Oh, well!" [...] they will say. Such things give them influence, consideration, power to do things.|$|R

6000|$|Inextricably {{confused}} {{with the question of}} Slavery, and essential {{to an understanding of the}} motives and character of the Southern people as distinguished from their politicians, is the doctrine of State Rights. On this topic also Mr. Greeley furnishes all the data requisite to a full understanding of the matter. The dispute resolves itself substantially into this: whether the adoption of the Constitution established a union or a confederacy, a government or a league, a nation or a committee. This also is a question which can only be determined by a knowledge of what the Convention of 1787 intended and accomplished, and the States severally acceded to,--it being of course understood that no State had a right, or at the time pretended any right, to accept the Constitution with <b>mental</b> <b>reservations.</b> On this subject we have ample and unimpeachable testimony in the discussions which led to the calling of the Convention, and the debates which followed in the different conventions of the States called together to decide whether the new frame of government should be accepted or rejected. The conviction that it was absolutely necessary to remodel the Articles of Confederation was wrought wholly by an experience of the inadequacy of the existing plan (under which a single State could oppose its veto to a law of Congress), from, the looseness of its cohesion and its want of power to compel obedience. The principle of coercive authority, which was represented as so oppressively unconstitutional by the friends of Secession in the North as well as the South four years ago, was precisely that which, as its absence had brought the old plan to a dead-lock, was deemed essential to the new. The formal proposal for a convention, originated by Hamilton, was seconded by one State after another. Here is a sample of Virginian public sentiment at that time, from the [...] "instructions to their representatives," [...] by several constituencies: [...] "Government without coercion is a proposition at once so absurd and self-contradictory that the idea creates a confusion of the understanding; it is form without substance, at best a body without a soul." [...] Oliver Ellsworth, advocating the adoption of the Constitution in the Convention of Connecticut, says: [...] "A more energetic system is necessary. The present is merely advisory. It has no coercive power. Without this, government is ineffectual, or rather is no government at all." [...] Earlier than this Madison had claimed [...] "an implied right of coercion" [...] even for the Confederate Congress, and Jefferson had gone so far as to say that they possessed it [...] "by the law of nature." [...] The leading objections to the new Constitution were such as to show the general belief that the State sovereignties were to be absorbed into the general government in all matters of national concern. But the unhappy ingenuity of Mr. Jefferson afterwards devised that theory of strict construction which would enable any State to profit by the powers of the Constitution so long as it was for her interest or convenience, and then, by pleading its want of powers, to resolve the helpless organization once more into the incoherence of confederacy. By this dexterous legerdemain, the Union became a string of juggler's rings, which seems a chain while it pleases the operator, but which, by bringing the strain on the weak point contrived for the purpose, is made to fall easily asunder and become separate rings again. An adroit use of this theory enabled the South to gain one advantage after another by threatening disunion, and led naturally, on the first effective show of resistance, to secession. But in order that the threat might serve its purpose without the costly necessity of putting it in execution, the doctrine of State Rights was carefully inculcated at the South by the same political party which made belief in the value of the Union a fanaticism at the North. On one side of Mason and Dixon's line it was lawful, and even praiseworthy, to steal the horse; on the other, it was a hanging matter to look over the fence.|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest that there was a need for a psychometric measure to assess attitudes {{specifically}} towards offenders with mental health problems. The “Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill” scale (CAMI; Taylor and Dear, 1981) was adapted to create a new psychometric measure; the “Police and Community Attitudes towards Offenders with Mental Illness” scale (PACAMI-O). Design/methodology/approach A sample of police and community participants (n= 178) completed this scale through the online surveying system, Psychdata. The new psychometric measure utilised the same 40 items featured in the CAMI; although, the wording was adapted. Findings The internal reliability for the combined sample was high (α= 0. 929), which implied very good internal reliability. An exploratory factor analysis identified four new factors: Self-Preservation, Societal <b>Reservation,</b> <b>Mental</b> Health Awareness and Treatment Ideology. A t-test revealed there was a significant difference between the scores of the police and community sample, with the effect size depicting a large magnitude between the means (t(176) =p= 0. 019, η 2 = 0. 16). Practical implications The PACAMI-O scale appears adequate for measuring attitudes towards its targeted sample and has shown utility with; a professional group (police officers and custody sergeants) who potentially face such offenders (primarily in the context of using Section 136 of the Mental Health Act). It therefore has practical implications in assessing attitudes with other groups within forensic mental health. Originality/value Assessing attitudes towards offenders with mental health problems would enable a better understanding of the formation of negative attitudes and stigmatisation and therefore, ways of tackling treatment, rehabilitation and also community reintegration...|$|R
