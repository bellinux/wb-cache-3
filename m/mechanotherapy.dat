40|$|Introduction. Rehabilitation of {{patients}} with cerebral palsy (CP) remains a very difficult task. Stable and growing movement restrictions in such patients cause a life-long need for treatment and rehabilitation. Neurorehabilitation of children with CP at various stages includes not only traditional physical rehabilitation methods, but also extensive use of robotic <b>mechanotherapy</b> techniques and new technologies {{in the field of}} neurophysiology. One of such technology is non-invasive percutaneous electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. Aim of the study: To assess the effect of transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the spinal cord to improve the motor function of children with spastic diplegia using the “Lokomat” robotic <b>mechanotherapy</b> system. Materials and methods. A clinical rehabilitation study of 26 patients aged 6 – 12 years with CP was conducted. The treatment group included 11 patients who received one course of robotic <b>mechanotherapy</b> using the “Lokomat” system combined with transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. The control group included 15 patients who received one course of robotic <b>mechanotherapy</b> only. Results. A comparative analysis of the two groups {{based on the results of}} clinical examinations using specific scales (GMFCS, GMFM- 88, Modified Ashworth Scale of Muscle Spasticity), locomotor tests (L-FORCE, L-ROM), and evaluations of muscle activity using electromyography showed that one course of rehabilitation resulted in improvement in motor function in all patients of both groups, but positive dynamics were more significant in the treatment group that underwent percutaneous electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. Conclusion. Based on clinical data, changes in indicators of the locomotor tests L-FORCE and L-ROM, as well as assessment of changes in muscle activity, showed that motor rehabilitation of children with spastic diplegia using the “Lokomat” robotic <b>mechanotherapy</b> system combined with transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation was more effective than robotic <b>mechanotherapy</b> only...|$|E
40|$|Physical medicine, {{which in}} the context of this article {{includes}} <b>mechanotherapy,</b> hydrotherapy, balneotherapy, electrotherapy, light therapy, air therapy, and thermotherapy, became a new field of labor in the healthcare domain in the Netherlands around 1900. This article gives an account of the introduction and development of <b>mechanotherapy</b> as a professional activity in the Netherlands in the 19 th century. <b>Mechanotherapy,</b> which historically included exercises, manipulations, and massage, was introduced in this country around 1840 and became one of the core elements of physical medicine towards the end of that century. In contrast to what one might expect, mostly physical education teachers, referred to as “heilgymnasts,” dedicated themselves to this kind of treatment, whereas only a few physicians were active in this field until the 1880 s. When, in the last quarter of the 19 th century, differentiation and specialization within the medical profession took place, physicians specializing in physical medicine and orthopaedics began to claim the field of <b>mechanotherapy</b> exclusively for themselves. This led to tensions between them and the group of heilgymnasts that had already been active in this field for decades. The focus of attention in this article is on interprofessional relationships, on the roles played by the different professional organizations in the fields of physical education and medicine, the local and national governments, and the judicial system, and on the social, political, and cultural circumstances under which developments in the field of <b>mechanotherapy</b> took place. The article concludes with the hypothesis that the intra- and inter-occupational rivalries discussed have had a negative impact on the academic development of physical medicine, orthopaedics, and heilgymnastics/physical therapy in the Netherlands in the first half of the 20 th century...|$|E

40|$|Background: Modern {{concepts}} of treating inflammatory periodontal disease aim at {{changes in the}} subgingival ecosystems within the periodontal pockets to alter the complex microbial community into a microbiota compatible with good periodontal health. Systemic antimicrobial therapy, although effective, involves a relatively high dose with repeated intakes over a prolonged {{period of time to}} achieve the required inhibitory concentrations in the sulcular fluid. The adjunctive use of local drug delivery may provide a beneficial response, especially in specific areas where conventional forms of therapy might fail. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy of two local drug delivery systems, one containing metronidazole and the other containing tetracycline hydrochloride as adjuncts to <b>mechanotherapy</b> in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: There were three groups that were labeled as group A (Scaling &#x 002 B; Tetracycline), group B (Scaling &#x 002 B; Metronidazole), and group C (Scaling alone). A microbiological analysis was carried out to determine the efficacy of these systems in changing the pathogenic flora in deep pockets. In addition, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction was carried out to confirm the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), and Tannerella forsythensis in the flora associated with chronic periodontitis. Results: There was clinical improvement in groups A and B, which correlated with an improvement in the microbiological parameters; these results were sustained for 90 days following therapy. In Group C, the flora showed a shift towards baseline at the end of 90 days. Conclusions: According to this study, both the local antibiotic therapies resulted in greater improvement in microbiological parameters when used as an adjunct to <b>mechanotherapy</b> as compared to <b>mechanotherapy</b> alone...|$|E

40|$|Life is mechanobiological: {{mechanical}} stimuli play {{a pivotal}} role in the formation of structurally and functionally appropriate body templates through mechanobiologically-driven cellular and tissue re/modeling. The body responds to mechanical stimuli engendered through physical movement in an integrated fashion, internalizing and transferring forces from organ, through tissue and cellular length scales. In the context of rehabilitation and therapeutic outcomes, such mechanical stimuli are referred to as <b>mechanotherapy.</b> Physical therapists use <b>mechanotherapy</b> and mechanical interventions, e. g., exercise therapy and manual mobilizations, to restore function and treat disease and/or injury. While the effect of directed movement, such as in physical therapy, is well documented at the length scale of the body and its organs, a number of recent studies implicate its integral effect in modulating cellular behavior and subsequent tissue adaptation. Yet the link between movement biomechanics, physical therapy, and subsequent cellular and tissue mechanoadaptation is not well established in the literature. Here we review mechanoadaptation in the context of physical therapy, from organ to cell scale mechanotransduction and cell to organ scale extracellular matrix genesis and re/modeling. We suggest that physical therapy can be developed to harness the mechanosensitivity of cells and tissues, enabling prescriptive definition of physical and mechanical interventions to enhance tissue genesis, healing, and rehabilitation...|$|E
