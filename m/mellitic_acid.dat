It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, multivalent atoms.

At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330°C or 7,820°F), so it sublimes at about 3,900K. Graphite is much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack.

40|$|Phosphate is an {{essential}} nutrient on Earth, used by life for ATP, DNA, RNA, and phospholipid membranes. Therefore, if life is or ever was present on Mars, phosphorus may have {{played an important role}} in determining the habitability of an environment. Phosphorus does not have a significant volatile phase; its release from minerals is consequently critical to phosphorus availability and prebiotic chemistry. Phosphate release from Mars-relevant minerals such as merrillite and chlorapatite has been previously found to differ significantly from phosphate release from fluorapatite, the dominant phosphate phase on Earth. However, the environments in which phosphate release would have been most relevant to potential early martian life likely did not contain solely inorganic solutions. Instead, early potentially habitable environments likely contained abundant organic matter delivered by carbonaceous chondrites and interplanetary dust particles. To determine the effect of Mars-relevant organic compounds on dissolution of Mars- relevant minerals, batch dissolution experiments dissolving merrillite, whitlockite, chlorapatite, and fluorapatite in solutions of one of acetic, succinic, methylsulfonic, <b>mellitic,</b> and oxalic <b>acids</b> were conducted. Minerals were chosen to include the dominant phosphate-bearing minerals in martian meteorites (merrillite and chlorapatite), whitlockite, which is similar to merrillite and potentially relevant to Mars, and fluorapatite, the dominant primary phosphate-bearing mineral on Earth. Organic compounds were chosen based on compounds measured in carbonaceous chondrites and interplanetary dust particles and therefore likely to be present in the martian soils, as well as the proposed breakdown products of refractory organic matter in martian soils. Results of our dissolution experiments indicate that a range of organic compounds likely to be present in martian soils are capable of enhancing nutrient release from the dominant phosphate minerals present in martian meteorites. Phosphate release from chlorapatite, whitlockite, and merrillite was enhanced by four of the organic <b>acids</b> examined (<b>mellitic,</b> oxalic, succinic, and acetic) – methylsulfonic had no effect to slightly inhibitory effect. The effects of the organic acids could be explained by the denticity of the ligand, the strength of the complex formed with calcium, and the extent of saturation of the solutions. Interestingly, the more quickly dissolving Mars-relevant minerals (merrillite, whitlockite, and chlorapatite) were more strongly affected by the organic compounds used than fluorapatite. With recent detections of organic compounds on Mars, these results suggest that organic matter has played an important role on weathering and nutrient release on that planet...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{physical}} properties {{as well as}} the potential for organic material in the Martian near-surface environment can give us a glimpse into the history of the site with regards to water, soil formation processes, {{as well as the}} conditions necessary for life. This work is done to support the interpretation of data from the Phoenix Mars Lander as well as other past and future landed missions. The Antarctic Dry Valleys are a hyper-arid cold polar desert that is the most Mars-like place on Earth. Soils from two different soil and climate regimes are analyzed to determine their physical properties such as mineralogy, particle size, shape, color, and specific surface area. These data are used to describe the sample locations in Antarctica and infer properties of Martian soils by comparison to Antarctic sites. I find that the particle size distribution can be used to determine the water history of the site and that the behavior of soluble species in the soil {{can also be used to}} trace the movement of water through the soil and could be instructive in understanding how soil organic material is processed by the environment. Continuing with the theme of soil organic matter, we revisit the Viking conclusions with regards to organics on Mars and look at the Phoenix data on the same subject. First, we assume that Mars receives organic material from meteoritic infall. These organics will be processed by chemical oxidants as well as UV light down to 200 nm. Chemical oxidation is predicted to produce molecules such as <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid,</b> which could preserve up to 10 % of the original organic mass. Using <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid</b> and other similar organic molecules, we irradiate these molecules with Mars-like ultraviolet light, analyzing the gases that come off as irradiation takes place. We find that organic molecules can survive Mars-like UV conditions as layers of UV-resistant organics build up, shielding the remaining organic material. Additionally, the gas products of irradiation depend on the composition of the original organic molecule, implying that even irradiated molecules will carry some information about the composition of the original molecule. Finally, we take this irradiated organic/soil stimulant mixture and analyze it via pyrolysis, similar to the Viking GC/MS and TEGA instruments that are the only instruments operated on Mars capable of detecting organics. We find that the pyrolysis of <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid</b> (and other similar) molecules primarily produces inorganic fragments but that the reduced carbon fragments released depend on the composition of the original organic. However, the introduction of perchlorate, discovered on Mars by the Phoenix Lander, complicates the issue by creating the conditions for molecular oxidation. The high-oxygen content and high pyrolysis temperatures lead to organic combustion during thermal analysis, meaning that, regardless of the initial composition, most soil organics will be oxidized to CO₂ during the detection process. By assuming that organic material was oxidized to CO₂ in the Phoenix and Viking samples. We show that this assumption gives organic concentrations consistent with meteoritic accumulation rates.

Understanding the chemical evolution of organic molecules under current Martian environmental conditions is essential to support the analyses performed in situ. What molecule can be preserved?

This paper {{presents the results of}} laboratory investigations dedicated to monitor the evolution of organic molecules when submitted to simulated Mars surface ultraviolet radiation (190 - 400 nm), mean temperature (218 ± 2 K) and pressure (6 ± 1 mbar) conditions. Experiments are done with the MOMIE simulation setup (for Mars Organic Molecules Irradiation and Evolution) allowing both a qualitative and quantitative characterization of the evolution the tested molecules undergo (Poch et al., 2013). The chemical structures of the solid products and the kinetic parameters of the photoreaction (photolysis rate, half-life and quantum efficiency of photodecomposition) are determined for glycine, urea, adenine and chrysene. Mellitic trianhydride is also studied in order to complete a previous study done with <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid</b> (Stalport et al., 2009), by studying the evolution of mellitic trianhydride. The results show that solid layers of the studied molecules have half-lives of 10 to 103 hours at the surface of Mars, when exposed directly to Martian UV radiation. However, organic layers having aromatic moieties and reactive chemical groups, as adenine and <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid,</b> lead to the formation of photoresistant solid residues, probably of macromolecular nature, which could exhibit a longer photostability. Such solid organic layers are found in micrometeorites or could have been formed endogenously on Mars. Finally, the quantum efficiencies of photodecomposition at wavelengths from 200 to 250 nm, determined for each of the studied molecules, range from 10 - 2 to 10 - 6 molecule photon- 1 and apply for isolated molecules exposed at the surface of Mars. These kinetic parameters provide essential inputs for numerical modeling of the evolution of Mars' current reservoir of organic molecules. Organic molecules adsorbed on Martian minerals may have different kinetic parameters and lead to different endproducts.

40|$|Mars is an {{important}} target for Astrobiology. A key goal of the MSL mission {{was to determine whether}} Mars was habitable in the past, a que-tion that has now been definitely determined to be yes. Another key goal for Mars exploration is to understand the origin and distribution of organic material on Mars; this question is being addressed by the SAM instrument on MSL, and will also be informed by two upcoming Mars exploration missions, ExoMars and Mars 2020. These latter two missions have instrumentation capable of detecting and characterize organic molecules. Over the next decade, these missions will analyze organics in surface, near-surface and sub-surface samples. Each mission has the capability to analyze organics by different methods (pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [py-GC-MS]; laser desorption and thermal volatilization GC-MS; and Raman spectroscopy). Plausibly extraterrestrial organics were recently discovered by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), providing {{an important}} first step towards understanding the organic inventory on Mars [1]. The compounds detected were chlorobenzenes and chloroalkanes, but it was argued that chlorination of these compounds occurred during pyrolysis of samples containing unchlorinated organics in the presence of perchlorate. A recent report analyzed a suite of aromatic (benzene, toluene, benzoic acid, phthalic acid, and <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid)</b> and aliphatic (acetic acid, propane, propanol, and hexane) by pyrolysis under SAM-like conditions in the presence of perchlorate to attempt to constrain possible precursor molecules for the organic molecules detected on Mars. For aromatic compounds, the aromatic acids all readily produced SAM-relevant chlorobenzes, whereas benzene and toluene did not. This observation suggests that the chlorobenzene detected on Mars could have derived from compounds like <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid,</b> consistent with the previous hypothesis by Benner et al. [3]. Among the aliphatic molecules, it was shown that pyrolysis of alkanes and alcohols in the presence of perchlorates produced polychlorine containing chloro-alkanes similar to what was observed on Mars. Surpris-ingly, however, similar treatment of acetic acid pro-duced chloroketones, instead, and no chloroalkanes were reported. This suggests that the chloroalkanes detected in the Sheepbed mudstone were not derived from aliphatic carboxylic acids, but instead were from more reduced alcohols or even alkanes, or perhaps were degradation products of more complicated organic material. Because organics analyses on mars will rely heavily on py-GC-MS of perchlorate-containing samples over the next decade, {{it is important to understand}} the fate of organic molecules of biotic and abiotic origin under such conditions.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{interaction}} between <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid</b> (benzene hexacarboxylic acid) and the common soil mineral goethite (alpha-FeOOH) has been investigated as a function of pH and ionic strength by use of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Molecular orbital calculations of the theoretical vibrational frequencies of the mellitate ion (L 6 -) and dihydrogen mellitate (H 2 L 4 -) have allowed the measured absorption frequencies to be accurately assigned. At pH values above 6, adsorption involves outer-sphere complexation of the deprotonated L 6 - ion. At lower pH values, there is evidence of a second outer-sphere surface complex involving a partially protonated species, although the extent of protonation of the surface species is significantly less than that found for the solution species at the same pH. While {{there is no evidence of}} inner-sphere complexation, increasing the ionic strength to 2. 0 M does not displace the adsorbed species but does increase the fraction present on the surface as the fully deprotonated L 6 -. The small effect of ionic strength suggests that the adsorptive interaction, although outer-sphere in character, is still relatively strong, which indicates that hydrogen bonds may play a significant role. Hydrogen bonding may also help to account for the observed outer-sphere complexation at pH values above the pH(iep) of goethite...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes into electronic, optical and consumer products will inevitably {{lead to the}} presence of these anthropogenic compounds in the environment. To date, there have been few studies isolating these materials from environmental matrices. Here we report a method commonly used to quantify black carbon (BC) in soils, the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method, for measurement of two types of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), two types of fullerenes and two forms of soot. The distribution of BC products (BPCAs) from the high pressure and high temperature oxidation illustrates the condensed nature of these compounds because they form predominantly fully substituted <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid</b> (B 6 CA). The conversion of carbon nanoparticles to BPCAs was highest for fullerenes (average of 23. 2 ± 4. 0 % C recovered for both C 60 and C 70) and lowest for non-functionalized SWCNTs (0. 5 ± 0. 1 % C). The recovery of SWCNTs was 10 times higher when processed through a cation-exchange column, indicating the presence of metals in SWCNTs compromises the oxidation chemistry. While mixtures of SWCNTs, soot and sediment revealed small losses of black carbon during sample processing, the method is suitable for quantifying total BC. The BPCA distribution of mixtures did not agree with theoretical mixtures using model polyaromatic hydrocarbons, suggesting the presence of a matrix effect. Future work is required to quantify different types of black carbon within the same sample. © 2009...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{search for}} organic {{molecules}} {{at the surface}} of Mars is a top priority of the next Mars exploration space missions: Mars Science Laboratory (NASA) and ExoMars (ESA). The detection of organic matter could provide information {{about the presence of}} a prebiotic chemistry or even biological activity on this planet. Therefore, a key step in interpretation of future data collected by these missions is to understand the preservation of organic matter in the martian environment. Several laboratory experiments have been devoted to quantifying and qualifying the evolution of organic molecules under simulated environmental conditions of Mars. However, these laboratory simulations are limited, and one major constraint is the reproduction of the UV spectrum that reaches the surface of Mars. As part of the PROCESS experiment of the European EXPOSE-E mission on board the International Space Station, a study was performed on the photodegradation of organics under filtered extraterrestrial solar electromagnetic radiation that mimics Mars-like surface UV radiation conditions. Glycine, serine, phthalic acid, phthalic acid {{in the presence of a}} mineral phase, and <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid</b> were exposed to these conditions for 1. 5 years, and their evolution was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy after their retrieval. The results were compared with data from laboratory experiments. A 1. 5 -year exposure to Mars-like surface UV radiation conditions in space resulted in complete degradation of the organic compounds. Half-lives between 50 and 150 [*]h for martian surface conditions were calculated from both laboratory and low-Earth orbit experiments. The results highlight that none of those organics are stable under low-Earth orbit solar UV radiation conditions...|$|E
40|$|Due to its {{symmetric}} {{structure and}} abundance of carboxyl groups, <b>mellitic</b> <b>acid</b> (MA-benzenehexacarboxylic acid) has an uncommon capacity to form highly ordered molecular networks. Dissolved in water, MA dissociates to yield various mellitate anions with pronounced tendencies to form complexes with cations including protonated amines. Deprotonation of MA at physiological pH produces anions with high charge densities (MA 5 - and MA 6 -) whose influence on co-dissolved proteins {{has not been}} thoroughly studied. As electrostatic attraction between highly symmetric MA 6 - anions and positively charged low-symmetry globular proteins could lead to interesting self-assembly patterns we have chosen hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), a basic stably folded globular protein as a cationic partner for mellitate anions to form such hypothetical nanostructures. Indeed, mixing of neutral HEWL and MA solutions does result in precipitation of electrostatic complexes with the stoichiometry dependent on pH. We have studied the self-assembly of HEWL-MA structures using vibrational spectroscopy (infrared absorption and Raman scattering), circular dichroism (CD), atomic force microscopy (AFM). Possible HEWL-MA 6 - molecular docking scenarios were analyzed using computational tools. Our results indicate that even at equimolar ratios (in respect to HEWL), MA 5 - and MA 6 - anions are capable of inducing misfolding and aggregation of the protein upon mild heating which results in non-native intermolecular beta-sheet appearing in the amide I' region of the corresponding infrared spectra. The association process leads to aggregates with compacted morphologies entrapping mellitate anions. The capacity of extremely diluted mellitate anions (i. e. at sub-millimolar concentration range) to trigger aggregation of proteins is discussed {{in the context of}} mechanisms of misfolding...|$|E
