40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis work was to carry out initial studies on Scania’s {{possibility}} to have plastic rearview <b>mirror</b> glasses as that for example may reduce costs and problems for Scania’s customers and enable another design of the <b>mirror</b> assembly. It was performed by studying the legislative and Scania demands regarding rearview <b>mirrors</b> to write a test program, find and order plastic <b>mirrors,</b> and then perform the tests and evaluate the <b>mirrors</b> {{to see if they}} seem good enough for Scania’s trucks. A Scania technical regulation for rearview <b>mirror</b> glass was also written.   The tested <b>mirrors</b> were a Scania glass <b>mirror</b> as reference, a PC <b>mirror</b> from Sabic, a PC and a PMMA <b>mirror</b> from Specchidea, a <b>mirror</b> from SMR automotive, an ABS <b>mirror</b> from Ficocipa/Renault, an ABS <b>mirror</b> from Ford and a PC plastic from Bayer and they were tested for scratch resistance, temperature variations, impact resistance, corrosion and chemical resistance in that order. If a sample did not pass a certain test, it was not subjected to the next one.   Of all samples it was only the SMR <b>mirror</b> and the reference glass <b>mirror</b> that passed the first test (scratch resistance). The others became too scratched and were not tested further. The SMR and the glass <b>mirror</b> also withstood all the following tests very good, the SMR <b>mirror</b> was the best one of the tested <b>mirrors.</b> Probably the SMR <b>mirror</b> was the best one because many of the other <b>mirrors</b> did not seem to have been made for outdoor conditions and because it seemed to be the most modern <b>mirror</b> with a good abrasion resistant coating.   It was concluded that there is a future for plastic <b>mirror</b> glasses, that {{it would be interesting to}} do more tests on the <b>mirrors,</b> for example a UV test and a distortion test, and to test more <b>mirrors</b> as a new generation of plastic <b>mirror</b> glass seem to be underway.
