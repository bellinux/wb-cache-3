40|$|In {{this study}} we present an {{alternative}} wind gust warning guideline for <b>Meteoalarm,</b> the severe weather warning website for Europe. There are unrealistically large differences in levels and issuing frequencies of all warning levels currently in use between neighbouring <b>Meteoalarm</b> countries. This study provides a guide for the <b>Meteoalarm</b> community to review their wind gust warning thresholds. A more uniform warning system is achieved by using one pan-European return period per warning level. The associated return values will be different throughout Europe because they depend on local climate conditions, {{but they will not}} change abruptly at country borders as is currently the case for the thresholds. As return values are a measure of the possible danger of an event and its impact on society, they form an ideal basis for a warning system. Validated wind gust measurements from the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D, [URL] were used to calculate return values of the annual maximum wind gust. The current thresholds are compared with return values for 3 different return periods: 10 times a year return periods for yellow warnings, 2 yr periods for orange and 5 yr periods for red warnings. So far 10 countries provide wind gust data to ECA&D. Due to the ECA&D completeness requirements and the fact that some countries provided too few stations to be representative for that country, medians of the return values of annual maximum wind gust could be calculated for 6 of the 10 countries. Alternative guideline thresholds are presented for Norway, Ireland, The Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic and Spain and the need to distinguish between coastal, inland and mountainous regions is demonstrated. The new thresholds based on uniform return periods differ significantly from the current ones, particularly for coastal and mountainous areas. We are aware of other, sometimes binding factors (e. g. laws) that prevent participating counties from implementing this climatology based warning system...|$|E
40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{performance}} of CRAHI's algorithm for rainfall nowcasting at European scale using the mosaics produced within the EUMETNET project OPERA (with a resolution of 4 km and 15 minutes) {{in the framework of}} the European Civil Protection research project HAREN (www. haren-project. eu). Systematic evaluation has been carried out since June 2012, focusing on the space-time variability of the nowcasting skills, and its dependence on the scale of the forecasted precipitation systems and on rainfall intensities. Also, the probabilistic nowcasting technique SBMcast (Berenguer et al. 2011) has been adapted to the use of OPERA mosaics at European scale to assess the uncertainty in the produced nowcasts. The performance of this probabilistic technique has been evaluated over a number of cases. Finally, the work analyzes the usefulness of these nowcasts for hazard assessment at European scale, based on exceeding the regional rainfall thresholds used by the EUMETNET project <b>METEOALARM.</b> Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY On the 15 th and 27 th of February 2014, COSMIC {{held its}} first {{regional}} stakeholder engagement workshops respectively in Thessaloniki, Greece and Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The workshops provided a multi-disciplinary space for stakeholders interested in the contribution of new media to crisis management activities. This was also {{a good opportunity to}} invite the members of the Advisory Board to concretely participate in the COSMIC activities. The Dutch member from Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), Arnout de Vries, attended the workshop held in Nijmegen. At the first workshop, COSMIC presented its key findings and gave participants an opportunity to discuss these results and provide their own insights and experiences. The discussions at this workshop highlighted several key points and conclusions. Firstly, the workshop found that there is limited use and exploitation of social media from the Greek public agencies that are involved in disasters and major accidents; secondly, it found that communication among public authorities is essentially obsolete. As such, {{there is a need to}} develop a protocol, i. e., an action scenario that will be followed by the involved agencies in emergency cases. Furthermore, there is a need to raise awareness about <b>Meteoalarm</b> 1 (a webbased service to warn people travelling in Europe of severe weather). Participants stressed the importance of social media and cross-checking information, along with increased communication among public agencies. The second workshop focused on the identification of new media methods and techniques, as used in the Netherlands, to improve the assistance (including search and rescue) to citizens during, and immediately following a crisis. Particular attention was placed on two processes: alerting citizens and engaging citizens, for example, by the police. Secondly, it aimed to get an overview of the scientific knowledge of the effects and/or impact of these methods during crises. The feedback has now been analysed by project partners and will be taken into consideration for the development of the guidelines for citizens, government authorities, first responders and industry for the most effective use of ICTs to aid citizen security during a crisis (WP 6). In parallel, the project website is currently being redesigned in order to have a dedicated section on workshops, thereby, ensuring that all presentations from events are publicly available. The present document reports on both national workshops for WP 2, task 2. 5...|$|E
