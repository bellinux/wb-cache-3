5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>other</b> stressors do.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>other</b> letters.

DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E

5|$|In dry tall grasslands in monsoonal areas, {{the change}} in {{vegetation}} may be so great due to either fires or wet season growth that birds may be more nomadic and change territories <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>other</b> fairywrens. They form more stable territories elsewhere, such as in coastal areas. Cooperative breeding is less common with this species than with other fairywrens; helper birds have been sporadically reported, but the red-backed fairywren has been little studied.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a white}} bird {{adorned with}} buff plumes in the {{breeding}} season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>other</b> heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal.|$|E
5|$|Politics in the Bay Area {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most liberal in California and in the United States.

According to research by the Public Policy Institute of California, the Bay Area and the North Coast counties of Humboldt and Mendocino were the most consistently and strongly liberal areas in California.|$|E

5|$|Troops are {{classified}} as multi-male groups, with a matriline as the core group. As with most lemurs, females socially dominate males in all circumstances, including feeding priority. Dominance is enforced by lunging, chasing, cuffing, grabbing and biting. Young females do not always inherit their mother's rank and young males leave the troop between three and five years of age. Both sexes have separate dominance hierarchies; females have a distinct hierarchy while male rank is correlated with age. Each troop has one to three central, high-ranking adult males who interact with females <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>other</b> group males and lead the troop procession with high-ranking females. Recently transferred males, old males or young adult males {{that have not yet}} left their natal group are often lower ranking. Staying at the periphery of the group they tend to be marginalized from group activity.|$|E
5|$|Hairspray {{debuted in}} 3,121 theaters in North America on July 20, 2007, the widest debut of any modern movie musical. The film earned $27.5 {{million in its}} opening weekend at #3, behind I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This made Hairspray the record-holder for the biggest opening weekend for a movie based on a Broadway musical. This record was later broken by the release of Mamma Mia!, which grossed $27.8 million on its opening weekend. Hairspray has since gone {{on to become the}} fourth highest {{grossing}} musical in U.S. cinema history, surpassing The Rocky Horror Picture Show ($145 million) and Dreamgirls ($103 million), released seven months prior. Ending its domestic run on October 25, 2007, Hairspray has a total domestic gross of $118.9 million and $202.5 million worldwide. Its biggest overseas markets include the United Kingdom ($25.8 million), Australia ($14.4 million), Japan ($8 million), Italy ($4.6 million), France ($3.9 million) and Spain ($3.8 million). This made Hairspray the third musical film in history to cross $200 million internationally, behind 1978's hit Grease ($395 million) and 2002's Chicago ($307 million). It is the seventh highest-grossing PG-rated film of 2007, and has grossed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>other</b> higher-budgeted summer releases like Ocean's Thirteen ($117 million) and Evan Almighty ($100 million).|$|E
