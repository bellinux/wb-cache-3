All Saiga rifles have a hammer-forged chrome-lined barrel, which influences the Saiga's reliability by making the inside of the barrel more resilient to corrosion and enabling the rifle to withstand more rounds to be fired out of the barrel without an adverse effect on accuracy. This allows the firearms barrel to be cleaned easier than that of a non-chrome lined bore.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{wheels of}} {{planetary}} rovers {{that are used}} in space explorations sometimes slip or lose contact with the ground while traversing a sandy terrain. In order to estimate the behavior of these rovers <b>moving</b> on <b>loose</b> soil, it is very im-portant to accurately estimate the drawbar pull of their wheels. Some wheel-soil interaction models based on terramechanics have been proposed for the estimation of the normal stress distribution and drawbar pull of such rovers. However, our experimental results (normal stress distributions are directly measured using a pressure sensor array, which is attached to the wheels of a rover) show that the distribution range of normal stress for small wheeled rovers obtained using the proposed method is considerably smaller than that obtained by using conventional method. Consequently, the drawbar pull estimated using conventional methods is inaccurate. Therefore, in this study, the normal stress distribution is directly measured using pressure sensors in order to estimate drawbar pull accurately. From the data obtained using the sensors, a soil parameter, which is generally very difficult to measure, is estimated. Then, the drawbar pull is estimated using this parameter. The drawbar pull estimated by using the proposed method is more accurate than that estimated using conventional methods. In this study, we propose a new method for the estimation of drawbar pull and also validate this method. I...|$|R

In antiquity, an equivalent of the hand shovel or hoe and head basket—and masses of men—were used to move earth to build civil works. Builders have long used the inclined plane, levers, and pulleys to place solid building materials, but these labor-saving devices did not lend themselves to earthmoving, which required digging, raising, <b>moving,</b> and placing <b>loose</b> materials.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel methodology {{for determining the}} velocity and location of multiple moving targets using a single stripmap synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor. The so-called azimuth position uncertainty problem is therefore solved. The method exploits {{the structure of the}} amplitude and phase modulations of the returned echo from a moving target in the Fourier domain. A crucial step in the whole processing scheme is a matched filtering, depending on the moving target parameters, that simultaneously accounts for range migration and compresses two-dimensional signatures into one-dimensional ones without <b>loosing</b> <b>moving</b> target information. A generalized likelihood ratio test approach is adopted to detect moving targets and derive their trajectory parameters. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated with synthetic and real data covering a wide range of targets velocities and signal to clutter ratios (SCRs).

50|$|The {{crescent}} honeyeater is arboreal, foraging mainly {{among the}} foliage and {{flowers in the}} understory and tree canopy on nectar, fruits and small insects. It has been recorded eating the honeydew of psyllids, soft scale and felt scale insects. It feeds primarily by probing flowers for nectar, and gleaning foliage and bark and sallying for insects. While regularly observed feeding singly or in pairs, the crescent honeyeater has also been recorded <b>moving</b> in <b>loose</b> feeding flocks, and gathering in large groups at productive food sources. A study in forest near Hobart in Tasmania found that the crescent honeyeater's diet was wholly composed of insects during the breeding season, but nectar was a significant component during winter. Insects consumed include moths and flies, and the tree trunks were the site of foraging around two-thirds of the time, and foliage a third. It fed on nectar as plants came into flower in the autumn and winter, and then foraged in Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) during the breeding season in spring. The flowering of royal grevillea (Grevillea victoriae) over summer in subalpine areas in the Snowy Mountains attracted large numbers of crescent honeyeaters. It feeds intensively when sources are plentiful and when feeding on flame heath (Astroloma conostephioides) it was recorded visiting an average of 34 flowers per minute. Other plants it has been recorded visiting include a number of Banksia species, waratah (Telopea), tubular flowered genera including Astroloma, Epacris and Correa, mistletoes of the genus Amyema, and eucalypts in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. In Bondi State Forest it was also recorded feeding at cluster-flower geebung (Persoonia confertiflora), native holly (Lomatia ilicifolia), tall shaggy-pea (Oxylobium arborescens), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and blackthorn (Bursaria spinosa). Local differences in flower foraging patterns have been observed in South Australia; populations on Kangaroo Island forage more often at Adenanthos flowers {{than those in the}} nearby Fleurieu Peninsula, while the latter forage more often at eucalypt blooms, and at a higher diversity of plants overall.|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{labelling}} for wide-timeframe {{free-form surface}} matching This paper addresses {{the problem of}} estimating dense correspondence between arbitrary frames from captured sequences of shape and appearance for surfaces undergoing free-form deformation. Previous techniques require either a prior model, limiting the range of surface deformations, or frame-to-frame surface tracking which suffers from stabilisation problems over complete motion sequences and does not provide correspondence between sequences. The primary contribution {{of this paper is}} the introduction of a system for wide-timeframe surface matching without the requirement for a prior model or tracking. Deformationinvariant surface matching is formulated as a locally isometric mapping at a discrete set of surface points. A set of feature descriptors are presented that are invariant to isometric deformations and a novel MAP-MRF framework is presented to label sparse-to-dense surface correspondence, preserving the relative distribution of surface features while allowing for changes in surface topology. Performance is evaluated on challenging data from a <b>moving</b> person with <b>loose</b> clothing. Ground-truth feature correspondences are manually marked and the recall-accuracy characteristic is quantified in matching. Results demonstrate an improved performance compared to non-rigid point-pattern matching using robust matching and graph-matching using relaxation labelling, with successful matching achieved across wide variations in human body pose and surface topology. 1...|$|R

The task expanded the focus of evaluating reliability effects targeted for device examination. FY 11 work highlighted the need to test many more parts and to examine more operating conditions, in order to provide useful recommendations for NASA users of these devices. This year's efforts focused on development of test capabilities, particularly focusing on those {{that can be used to}} determine overall lot quality and identify outlier devices, and test methods that can be employed on components for flight use. Flight acceptance of components potentially includes considerable time for up-screening (though this time may not currently be used for much reliability testing). Manufacturers are much more knowledgeable about the relevant reliability mechanisms for each of their devices. We are not in a position to know what the appropriate reliability tests are for any given device, so although reliability testing could be focused for a given device, we are forced to perform a large campaign of reliability tests to identify devices with degraded reliability. With the available up-screening time for NASA parts, it is possible to run many device performance studies. This includes verification of basic datasheet characteristics. Furthermore, it is possible to perform significant pattern sensitivity studies. By doing these studies we can establish higher reliability of flight components. In order to develop these approaches, it is necessary to develop test capability that can identify reliability outliers. To do this we must test many devices to ensure outliers are in the sample, and we must develop characterization capability to measure many different parameters.

Originally released in a blank sleeve under the title The Lady With The Golden Stockings, the album had gained its current title, and sleeve by Richard Pedreguera, by 1969. In common with most releases by Sun Ra at the time, the record was printed in extremely limited numbers and primarily available at concerts and mail-order. The record was reissued by Impulse! in 1974, and on CD by Evidence in 1993, backed with the contemporaneous album Angels and Demons at Play."The Nubians of Plutonia... evidence an Arkestra <b>moving</b> into ever <b>looser,</b> more abstract ground.

'Nubia', 'Africa' and 'Aiethopia' continue this excursion into more mystical, rhythm-based territory.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} of {{an initial}} summary of Study I {{which is my}} licentiate thesis in business administration. Study I is a literature study on internal control. Thereafter follows Study II which is {{a case study of}} Swedish insurance organization. The case study adopts a contingency perspective and attempts to find environmental and firm-level factors that influence the design, use and outcome of internal control. Study II is a longitudinal study that accounts for key internal-control developments that occurred between 2000 - 2010. This case study finds that there are two environmental influences that significantly affected internal-control design, use and outcome. They consist of environmental uncertainty and regulatory and supervisory forces. Their influences differ in nature but jointly they act to set boundaries and frame in-ternal-control design, use and outcome. There are two firm-level influences of governance structure and managerial attitudes that act jointly with strategy to affect the design, use and outcome of internal control. While environmental influences set boundaries and frame internal-control work, firm-level contingencies can effectively enable or disable internal-control effectiveness. These firm-level influences provide means and opportunities to internal-control work. My longitudinal research suggests that evolutionary steps have been taken regarding internal-control design and use. In sum these steps correspond to a shift in internal-control orientation and a transformation of practices where Folksam has been <b>moving</b> from a <b>looser</b> towards a tighter form of internal control, with greater transparency in operational risk management. Finally, based on the internal-control principles of the COSO framework I see that particular principles have been enhanced within the Folksam system of internal control.

I mentioned above in particular the enviable consciousness of our little red-headed kinsman Gus Barker, who, as by a sharp prevision, snatched what gaiety he might from a life to be cut short, in a cavalry dash, by one of the Confederate bullets of 1863: he blew out at us, on New York Sundays, as I have said, sharp puffs of the atmosphere of the Institution Charlier--strong to us, that is, the atmosphere of whose institutions was weak; but it was above all during a gregarious visit paid him in a livelier field still that I knew myself merely mother'd and brother'd.
