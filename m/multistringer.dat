40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the substitute-stringer approach for including the effects of sheer lag in the calculation of the transverse modes and fre-quencies of <b>multistringer</b> box beams is investigated. Box beams, the covers of which consist of normal-streps-csrrying stringers on sheets which carry not only shear but also normal stress, are analyzed exactly. Frequencies aâ€™ of besms with various numbers of stringers, obtained by means of this exact analysis, serve to determine the possible {{accuracy of}} the frequencies obtained by the substitute-stringer approach. ...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from {{the application of}} damage tolerance criteria for composite panels to <b>multistringer</b> composite wing cover panels developed under NASA's Composite Transport Wing Technology Development contract. This conceptual wing design integrated aeroelastic stiffness constraints with an enhanced damage tolerance material system, in order to yield optimized producibility and structural performance. Damage tolerance was demonstrated in a test program using full-sized cover panel subcomponents; panel skins were impacted at midbay between stiffeners, directly over a stiffener, and over the stiffener flange edge. None of the impacts produced visible damage. NASTRAN analyses were performed to simulate NDI-detected invisible damage...|$|E
