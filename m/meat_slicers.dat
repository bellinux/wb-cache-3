Following a {{leveraged}} buyout in 1980 to Magic Chef, the brand changed hands several times and finally went public in 1992 as Toastmaster, Inc. The company, headquartered in Boonville, Missouri, United States, was acquired by Salton, Inc., in 1999. After a series of acquisitions, the brand is now owned by Spectrum Brands, Inc. and is licensed to Select Brands, Inc. [...] Commercial Toastmaster products for the food-service industry are manufactured by [...] The Middleby Corporation. Company headquarters were moved from Boonville, Missouri to Columbia, Missouri during the 1970's. Factories were located in Boonville, Missouri, Macon, Missouri, Moberly, Missouri, Kirksville, Missouri, Clarence, Missouri and Laurinburg, North Carolina. Three large warehouse facilities were operated in Columbia, Missouri, too. Product brands included Toastmaster, Manning-Bowman, Edison, Everhot, Bersted, Eskimo fans, Zero fans, Ingram clocks and timers and several others. The Vita-Mix blender was also built under contract with Vita-Mix. Products manufactured during the 1970 and 1980 decades were toasters, griddles, box fans, waffle bakers, sandwich makers, ceiling fans, toaster ovens, convection ovens, bread makers, humidifiers, clocks, timers, etc. Other products marketed by the company in the 1970 and 1980 decades were imported from oversea factories such as mixers, <b>meat</b> <b>slicers,</b> can openers, microwave ovens, oscillating fans, etc. Revenues from a sandwich maker known as the Snackster (originally sold exclusively to Walmart) were significant and lead to the company going public on NYSE in 1992.|$|E

5000|$|The genus Saurocephalus {{is almost}} entirely {{represented}} by fragmentary specimens {{with the exception of}} a single complete and superbly well preserved specimen collected from latest Maastrichtian deposits of Jordan, Saurocephalus longicorpus. [...] The complete material from Jordan offered an extensive amount of valuable information about Saurocephalus. With an elongate, torpedo-like body, saurocephalids were extremely fast open water formidable ambush predators. The morphology of their teeth and jaw structure suggest they were meat eaters. The closely set very sharp and firmly anchored teeth lined up along the upper and lower jaws acted together like sharp serrated scissors. The ventral extension of the upper jaw deep unto the sides of the lower jaw made the jaws perform like <b>meat</b> <b>slicers.</b> Saurocephalids were powerful and ferocious predators with powerful jaws capable of slicing and biting off large chunks of meat from their potential prey items. No doubt, fish was on top of the diet list. The large sizes attained by some saurocephalids which exceed two meters in length, may indicate they were capable of handling larger prey items such as smaller marine reptiles and sharks. To process large prey, they would cut them into smaller more manageable pieces using their powerful large jaws and sharp teeth. A close modern analogue of saurocephalids and to the matter saurodontids, would be barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda) known to ambush, ram, and stun their prey using the strong anterior projection of the dentary. Although not as notably elongate, the overall body outline of barracudas is similar to saurocephalids.|$|E
5000|$|Stimpson {{was born}} in 1870 on a farm west of Mooreville. In 1892 {{he got his first}} patent, a {{mechanism}} to lower the wheels of a grain harvester. At that time he was a graduate of Cleary Business School and he was teaching school. That same year, he noticed a local grocer frustrated by the scales which were so complicated in figuring out the price of the product. Stimpson spent some time with the blacksmith tools at his father's farm, and tinkered on an old scale. He came up with a revolutionary idea for a [...] "computing scale." [...] Stimpson's ideas to improve scales made a tremendous impact on industry in the US and worldwide because business depends on accurately knowing how much is being bought or sold. He developed scales for large items such as farm scales, such as a wagon full of pumpkins, a cow, or a load of coal. He built a Stimpson factory in Milan on Plank Road at Dexter Road, later the Ideal Foundry. He worked on scales to weigh small items such as envelopes, for postage; candy; or diamonds. In about 1903, Stimpson built a fantastic and imposing brick hotel in downtown Milan, the Stimpson Hotel. The Italianate-style building was later known in Milan as the Danube Inn. It is no longer standing, having been destroyed by fire in 2011. Stimpson set up factories early in his career in Tecumseh, MI; Northville, MI; Detroit; and Elkhart, IN. He settled finally in Louisville, KY. One of Stimpson's Detroit companies eventually merged with a company involved with clocks and a company dealing in cash registers, called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. That company later changed its name to International Business Machines or IBM. In later years, customers of Stimpson Scales, if they needed parts for their scales, contacted IBM as the successor corporation. Stimpson was living in Louisville in 1941 when he died. He left behind a widow and a large, modern factory making coffee grinders, <b>meat</b> <b>slicers,</b> and of course scales.|$|E

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{growth is}} of the {{greatest}} concern amongst ready-to-eat foods. The United States Department of Agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s Food Safety and Inspection Services determined that deli luncheon meats pose the greatest risk of contamination from L. monocytogenes Industrial <b>meat</b> <b>slicers</b> have many removable parts that are connected with sealers and gaskets, which can become worn over time. These spaces cannot be cleaned adequately, therefore are susceptible to bacterial growth. Planktonic cells form biofilms {{in order to protect}} the cell from adverse conditions, like during routine cleaning and sanitation. Once a biofilm is formed, the bacteria are much more difficult to eradicate and can be more resistant to the lethal effects of chlorine. This study analyzed the biofilm forming abilities of different L. monocytogenes serotypes and L. innocua by observation through motility tests, microtiter plate biofilm assay and microscopy. Listeria strains were grown on stainless steel coupons cut from a deli meat slicer blade in order the observe biofilm growth. This study also investigated the synergistic effects of steam and chemical sanitizers on disrupting and removing the biofilms formed on the stainless steel coupons. Both flagellated and non-flagellated Listeria strains produced biofilms and there was no correlation observed between the production of biofilms and hydrophobicity if the films. Overall there was a 5 to 7 log reduction between the combined treatments and the initial inoculation. The sanitizer alone gave a 2 to 3 log reduction and the steam treatment resulted in a 3 to 4 log reduction. The results of this study will provide better understanding of and potential methods for the sanitization of deli <b>meat</b> <b>slicers.</b> In turn, the knowledge gained from this study will reduce the risk of contamination and outbreaks of L. monocytogenes and other food-borne pathogens...|$|E
