Majors immediately upgraded the recruiting, most notably bringing in future Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett. Majors' impact was immediate: in Pitt's first game with Majors as coach, the Panthers travelled to the University of Georgia where they tied Vince Dooley's Bulldogs 7–7. The excitement in the city was palpable as the Panthers improved from one win in 1972 to a 6–5–1 record in 1973. Their success earned the Panthers their first bowl bid since 1956 when they were invited to play Arizona State in the 1973 Fiesta Bowl, where they lost 28–7. The next season saw further improvement with wins at Florida State and Georgia Tech to finish 7–4. In 1975, a Sun Bowl victory over Kansas capped an 8–4 record highlighted by wins at Georgia and Notre Dame.

But they were thrashed by the hosts Sri Lanka. still with 2 wins in three matches they qualified for the semi final.

Along the way to posting a +25 plus-minus rating for the team, Määttä paced the team in defensive scoring with 32 points in 58 games, despite missing 6 games in the middle of the season to play for Finland at the 2012 World Junior Championships. Seeking to improve on Finland's sixth-place finish in 2011, Määttä was expected to be a key contributor for his team, but in the tournament opener he was concussed on a hit by Canada's Boone Jenner and missed the remainder of the tournament. Finland ultimately finished fourth without him. In the OHL playoffs, Määttä continued his strong play, only being held pointless in just five of London's 19 post-season games.

All of these trades seemed to have paid dividends as the Colts had a 22-game win-streak, and finished the regular season with an unprecedented record of 57–9–0–2, {{for a total of}} 116 points. Bryan Cameron scored a franchise record 53 goals and the team captured their fourth Emms Trophy for finishing first in the Central Division, and also the franchises first Hamilton Spectator Trophy for finishing first overall in the OHL.

In the Conference Finals the Colts finally met some stiff competition but were still able to defeat the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors 4–1 and win the Bobby Orr Trophy. In the J. Ross Robertson Cup finals the Barrie Colts hosted the defending Memorial Cup Champions Windsor Spitfires who the Colts had defeated both times the two teams met in the regular season. The Colts never looked on top of their game, making uncharacteristic defensive mistakes. The Colts were defeated in four games bringing an end to one of the best OHL seasons in history.|$|E
