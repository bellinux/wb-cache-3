40|$|In his writings, ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān Munīf {{introduces}} the reader {{right into the}} middle of the Arab desert, which he portrays with passion and mastery, and he is lavish in giving us the expressive pictures of everyday toil and few joys of the life in the desert. In his prose, the desert with its inertia which it owes to the primeval nature, opposes-and succumbs-to the town boiling over with joy, which is expanding faster and faster regardless of the obstacles and victims. The two types of space seem to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> a <b>sort</b> of a complementary entity; the desert nature is opposed to the urban culture, thanks to which the world presented in Munīf’s novels makes an impression of being full and complete. This has a definite peculiarity: the characters find it difficult to survive both in the endless desert areas and in the labyrinths of the towns; in both cases they get along better or worse, which gives rise to the stories and plots of the particular novels.

These <b>make</b> <b>up</b> a <b>sort</b> of alphabet, which {{does not depend on}} the national Sign Language and which codes the basic components of any sign. The user is guided through a fully automated procedure making the composition process fast and intuitive. SWift pursues the goal of helping to break down the “electronic ” barriers that keep deaf people away from the web, {{and at the same time}} to support linguistic research about Sign Languages features. For this reason it has been designed with a special attention to deaf user needs, and to general usability issues. The editor has been developed in a modular way, so it can be integrated everywhere the use of the SW as an alternative to written “verbal ” language may be advisable...|$|R

However, she is [...] "stunned" [...] to learn that Brian has told the school board {{that she was the}} one harassing him. Priya is then {{suspended}} from her job. Gooneratne told an Inside Soap journalist [...] "After the story about Priya's affair with Paul gets out, Brian uses {{it as a way to}} manipulate her. But she doesn't bow to his demands, so she <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> all <b>sorts</b> of claims - leading to this debacle." [...] Things get worse for Priya when she discovers her friend, Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne), has been offered her job. Gooneratne called it [...] "a kick in the teeth for Priya", but thought that her character would want Susan to have her job, rather than someone else. Brian later offers to drop the allegations, but only if Priya spends the night with him. Gooneratne thought Brian was [...] "a real creep" [...] and explained that he thinks that because Priya had an affair with Paul, then she would be up for something similar with him. The actress added that Brian's suggestion makes Priya's skin crawl.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{experiment}} in distributing mails in so-called [...] "post offices on wheels" [...] {{was made in}} 1862 by William A. Davis between Hannibal and St. Joseph, Missouri. It was intended to expedite the connection at St. Joseph with the overland stage, which had replaced the Pony Express routes to the West a year earlier. The H&StJ furnished a baggage car, altered to Davis' specifications. Similar to a postal route agent's car, it had a table and a 65-pigeon-hole letter case, but no pouch rack. Davis boarded the westbound train at Palmyra, Missouri, with authority to open the sacks and letter packages which were addressed to the St. Joseph DPO, to remove all California letters, and to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> and <b>sort</b> the mail in a manner identical {{to the way the}} St. Joseph DPO would have dispatched it. Davis was paid at the rate of $100.00 per month. The railroad was harassed by guerrillas and by lack of maintenance, resulting in several suspensions and finally abandonment of the experiment. After the Civil War, Railway Post Office (RPO) service was re-established on this line, and it became known as the Chicago & Kansas City RPO.|$|R
