25|$|Limonene occurs {{commonly}} as the d or (R)-enantiomer, but racemizes to dipentene at 300°C. When warmed with <b>mineral</b> <b>acid,</b> limonene isomerizes to the conjugated diene α-terpinene (which {{can also}} easily {{be converted to}} p-cymene). Evidence for this isomerization includes the formation of Diels-Alder adducts between α-terpinene adducts and maleic anhydride.|$|E
25|$|Sulfuric acid (alternative {{spelling}} sulphuric acid) is {{a highly}} corrosive strong <b>mineral</b> <b>acid</b> with the molecular formula H2SO4 and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol.

40|$|Both <b>mineral</b> <b>acids</b> {{and organic}} acids can produce toxic effects on {{unicellular}} organisms. <b>Mineral</b> <b>acids</b> exert their adverse effects {{in proportion to}} their ability to raise the hydrogen ion concentration (Kronig and Paul, 1897; Cowles, 1941).

500|$|Conant's {{investigations}} {{helped in}} the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of acids and bases. He investigated the properties of certain acids which were many times stronger than <b>mineral</b> <b>acid</b> solutions in water. Conant christened them [...] "superacids" [...] and laid the foundation for the development of the Hammett acidity function. These investigations used acetic acid as the solvent and demonstrated that sodium acetate behaves as a base under these conditions. [...] This observation is consistent with Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory (published in 1923) but cannot be explained under older Arrhenius theory approaches. Later work with George Wheland and extended by William Kirk McEwen looked at the properties of hydrocarbons as very weak acids, including acetophenone, phenylacetylene, fluorene and diphenylmethane. Conant can be considered alongside Brønsted, Lowry, Lewis, and Hammett as a developer of modern understanding of acids and bases.|$|E

2500|$|Final {{treatment}} {{of iron and}} steel products before onward sale into manufacturing includes pickling in strong <b>mineral</b> <b>acid</b> to remove rust and prepare the surface for tin or chromium plating or for other surface treatments such as galvanisation or painting. [...] The two acids commonly used are hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. Wastewaters include acidic rinse waters together with waste acid. Although many plants operate acid recovery plants (particularly those using hydrochloric acid), where the <b>mineral</b> <b>acid</b> is boiled away from the iron salts, there remains a large volume of highly acid ferrous sulfate or ferrous chloride to be disposed of. Many steel industry wastewaters are contaminated by hydraulic oil, also known as soluble oil.|$|E

2500|$|Commercial {{creosote}} {{will contain}} substances from six groups. The two groups {{occur in the}} greatest amounts and are {{the products of the}} distillation process—the [...] "tar acids", which distill below 205°C and consist mainly of phenols, cresols, and xylenols, including carbolic acid—and aromatic hydrocarbons, which divide into naphthalenes, which distill approximately between 205° and 255°C, and constituents of an anthracene nature, which distill above 255°C. The quantity of each varies based on the quality of tar and temperatures used, but generally, the tar acids won't exceed 5%, the naphthalenes will make up 15 to 50%, and the anthracenes will make up 45% to 70%. The hydrocarbons are mainly aromatic; derivatives of benzene and related cyclic compounds such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, acenapthene, and fluorene. Creosotes from vertical-retort and low temperature tars contain, in addition, some paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. The tar-acid content also depends on the source of the tar—it may be less than 3% in creosote from coke-oven tar and as high as 32% in creosote from vertical retort tar. All of these have antiseptic properties. The tar acids are the strongest antiseptics but have the highest degree of solubility in water and are the most volatile; so, like with wood-tar creosote, phenols are not the most valued component, as by themselves they would lend to being poor preservatives. In addition, creosote will contain several products naturally occurring in coal—nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as acridines, carbazoles, and quinolines, referred to as the [...] "tar bases" [...] and generally make up about 3% of the creosote—sulfur-containing heterocycles, generally benzothiophenes—and oxygen-containing heterocycles, dibenzofurans. Lastly, creosote will contain a small number of aromatic amines produced by the other substances during the distillation process and likely resulting from a combination of thermolysis and hydrogenation. The tar bases are often extracted by washing the creosote with aqueous <b>mineral</b> <b>acid,</b> although they're also suggested to have antiseptic ability similar to the tar acids.|$|E
