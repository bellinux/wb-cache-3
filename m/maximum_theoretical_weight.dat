40|$|The {{use of a}} {{mathematical}} model applied to biological science helps to predict the specific data. Based on biological data (weight and age) of silver catfish, Rhamdia quelen, {{a mathematical}} model was elaborated based on a nonlinear difference equation to demonstrate the relationship between age and growth in weight. Silver catfish growth was described following the Beverton-Holt model Pt+ 1 = (r Pt) / (1 + a Pt), where r > 0 is the maximum growth rate and a > 0 is a constant of growth inhibition. The solution of this equation is Pt= 1 /{[1 /P 0 - a / (r- 1) ] 1 /r t + a/ (r- 1) }, were P 0 is the initial weight of the fish. Through this model {{it was observed that}} the female reaches the <b>theoretical</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>weight</b> approximately at the age of 18 years and the male at the age of 12 years in a natural environment...|$|R

40|$|Introduction]: 'Studless' Lego Technic Liftarms {{have been}} in use since the early 2000 s while 'Studded' Lego Technic Bricks {{have been in}} use since the late 1970 s. This report is to further {{investigate}} the strength of these Liftarms and Brick Beams to clarify what the <b>theoretical</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>weight</b> limit is. It is often said {{that you can do}} almost anything with Lego but limits have been reached. The goal is to quantify those limits for the AFOL (Adult Fans Of Lego) community in a similar way to Philo and his work on Lego Motors. My previous report back in July 2011 was quite well received even though there were some criticisms. With the help of David Luders, I am privileged to be able to repeat this experiment. While similar in its goals, this report will hopefully address some of the criticism and further the knowledge in this area. For the purposes of this report Liftarms will refer to the 'Studless' Lego Technic Liftarms; Brick Beams will refer to 'Studded' Lego Technic Bricks; Beams will refer to either Liftarms or Brick Beams; Pins will refer to Lego Technic Pins. ...|$|R

40|$|Dehydration {{secondary}} to gastroenteritis {{is one of}} the most common reasons for office visits and hospital admissions. The indicator most commonly used to estimate dehydration status is acute weight loss. Post-illness weight gain is considered as the gold-standard to determine the true level of dehydration and is widely used to estimate weight loss in research. To determine the value of post-illness weight gain as a gold standard for acute dehydration, we conducted a prospective cohort study in which 293 children, aged 1 month to 2 years, with acute diarrhea were followed for 7 days during a 3 -year period. The main outcome measures were an accurate pre-illness weight (if available within 8 days before the diarrhea), post-illness <b>weight,</b> and <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> (predicted from the child's individual growth chart). Post-illness weight was measured for 231 (79 %) and both <b>theoretical</b> and post-illness <b>weights</b> were obtained for 111 (39 %). Only 62 (21 %) had an accurate pre-illness weight. The correlation between post-illness and <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> was excellent (0. 978), but bootstrapped linear regression analysis showed that post-illness <b>weight</b> underestimated <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> by 0. 48 kg (95 % CI: 0. 06 - 0. 79, p< 0. 02). The mean difference in the fluid deficit calculated was 4. 0 % of body weight (95 % CI: 3. 2 - 4. 7, p< 0. 0001). <b>Theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> overestimated accurate pre-illness weight by 0. 21 kg (95 % CI: 0. 08 - 0. 34, p =  0. 002). Post-illness weight underestimated pre-illness weight by 0. 19 kg (95 % CI: 0. 03 - 0. 36, p =  0. 02). The prevalence of 5 % dehydration according to post-illness weight (21 %) was significantly lower than the prevalence estimated by either <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> (60 %) or clinical assessment (66 %, p< 0. 0001). These data suggest that post-illness weight is of little value as a gold standard to determine the true level of dehydration.
