5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is {{the distinction between the}} Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England came to run {{by the end of the}} period. Some of these regions were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width, and because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional Medieval government. The Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. This provided Scotland with a form of protection, as <b>minor</b> <b>English</b> incursions had to cross the difficult Southern Uplands; two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the Highlands, from where potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands. But it also made those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence centred on attempts to resolve problems of entrenched localism.|$|E

25|$|In Venice (1771–1772), {{where he}} was {{studying}} the works of Palladio, Quarenghi {{came into contact with}} a British lord passing through there on the Grand Tour. It was through him that the architect secured a few <b>minor</b> <b>English</b> commissions, such as garden pavilions, chimneypieces (Loukomsky 1928), an altar for the private Roman Catholic chapel of Henry Arundell at New Wardour Castle. Designs for a country house for Lord Whitworth were exhibited at Venice 1967. His first major commission (1771–7) was the internal reconstruction of the monastery of Santa Scholastica at Subiaco. For the Venetian cardinal Rezzonico, the nephew of Pope Clement XIII, he designed a decor for a Music Room in the Campidoglio, and designs for Clement's tomb (later executed by Antonio Canova).|$|E
25|$|Van Dijk {{was born}} in Rotterdam, and played his club cricket for VOC Rotterdam. He made his {{international}} debut in August 1992, in a friendly match against Denmark in Utrecht. Later in the year, he also played for the Netherlands against Eastern Province, a South African provincial team. After 1992, van Dijk did not again play for the Dutch senior team until June 1996, when he appeared in two matches against Pakistan (on {{its way to a}} tour of England). Later in the month, he also played a single match in the 1996 NatWest Trophy (an English county competition), against Surrey. In that game, he finished with figures of 4/57 from eight overs, and was named man of the match despite his team losing easily. At the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia, van Dijk played in four of his team's seven matches, taking five wickets (including 3/35 against Denmark). He played his last match for the Netherlands later in the year, against Norfolk (a <b>minor</b> <b>English</b> county team).|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, Stern {{declined}} a {{place at}} Elmira College to instead pursue a Communications degree at Boston University, but his average high school grades caused him to spend {{the first two years}} in its College of Basic Studies. In his second year he started work at the campus radio station WTBU, where he played records, read the news, and hosted interview programs. He later co-hosted a weekly comedy show with three fellow students named The King Schmaltz Bagel Hour which was initially cancelled during its first broadcast for a racial sketch named [...] "Godzilla Goes to Harlem". Stern took cannabis, Quaaludes, and LSD during his studies, but quit after he experienced a difficult trip on too much LSD. In 1974, he gained admission to the university's School of Public Communications. He then studied for a diploma at the Radio Engineering Institute of Electronics in Fredericksburg, Virginia in July 1975 which earned him a first class radio-telephone operator license, a required certificate for all radio broadcasters at the time which was issued by the Federal Communications Commission. With the license, Stern landed his first professional radio job at WNTN in Newton, Massachusetts from August to December 1975 doing air shifts, news casting, and production work. For the next five months, he taught students basic electronics in preparation for their own FCC exams. In May 1976, Stern graduated magna cum laude with a 3.8 grade point average. His major was broadcasting and film and his <b>minor</b> <b>English</b> and speech. In the past he has funded a scholarship at the university.|$|E

60|$|He {{has been}} {{attached}} to every conceivable pursuit. He {{has been in}} the army, in the navy, in the church, in the law; connected with the press, the fine arts, public institutions, every description and grade of business. He has been brought up as a gentleman; he has been at every college in Oxford and Cambridge; he can quote Latin in his letters (but generally misspells some <b>minor</b> <b>English</b> word); he can tell you what Shakespeare says about begging, better than you know it. It is to be observed, that {{in the midst of his}} afflictions he always reads the newspapers; and rounds off his appeal with some allusion, that may be supposed to be in my way, to the popular subject of the hour.|$|E
6000|$|In {{speaking}} of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either thorough or profound. While discussing very much at random the essentiality {{of what we call}} Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration some few of those <b>minor</b> <b>English</b> or American poems which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most definite impression. By [...] "minor poems" [...] I mean, of course, poems of little length. And here, in the beginning, permit me {{to say a few words}} in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, [...] "a long poem," [...] is simply a flat contradiction in terms.|$|E
6000|$|But {{these were}} the coarse {{material}} bases of the Phoenix fires of the world. These were but the outward and visible signs of the innumerable claims, rights, adhesions, debts, bills, deeds, and charters that were cast upon the fires; a vast accumulation of insignia and uniforms neither curious enough nor beautiful enough to preserve, went to swell the blaze, and all (saving a few truly glorious trophies and memories) of our symbols, our apparatus and material of war. Then innumerable triumphs of our old, bastard, half-commercial, fine-art were presently condemned, great oil paintings, done to please the half-educated middle-class, glared {{for a moment and}} were gone, Academy marbles crumbled to useful lime, a gross multitude of silly statuettes and decorative crockery, and hangings, and embroideries, and bad music, and musical instruments shared this fate. And books, countless books, too, and bales of newspapers went also to these pyres. From the private houses in Swathinglea alone--which I had deemed, perhaps not unjustly, altogether illiterate--we gathered a whole dust-cart full of cheap ill-printed editions of the <b>minor</b> <b>English</b> classics--for the most part very dull stuff indeed and still clean--and about a truckload of thumbed and dog-eared penny fiction, watery base stuff, the dropsy of our nation's mind. [...] . And {{it seemed to me that}} when we gathered those books and papers together, we gathered together something more than print and paper, we gathered warped and crippled ideas and contagious base suggestions, the formulae of dull tolerances and stupid impatiences, the mean defensive ingenuities of sluggish habits of thinking and timid and indolent evasions. There was more than a touch of malignant satisfaction for me in helping gather it all together.|$|E
