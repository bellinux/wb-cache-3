5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than <b>monotherapy.</b> The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} enalapril/lercanidipine combination effects on markers of cardiovascular risk stratification in hypertensive patients. A total of 359 patients were randomized to enalapril 20 mg, lercanidipine 10 mg, or enalapril/lercanidipine 20 / 10 mg fixed combination. We evaluated blood pressure (BP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), soluble CD 40 ligand (sCD 40 L), serum myeloperoxidase (MPO), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). We recorded a decrease of BP in all groups, with the enalapril/lercanidipine combination being more effective in reducing BP compared with single <b>monotherapies.</b> Lipid profile or FPG were not affected by various treatments. Lercanidipine, but not enalapril, improved Lp(a) levels compared with baseline, with enalapril/lercanidipine having a greater effect on Lp(a) reduction. All treatments increased sRAGE levels, and decreased sCD 40 L and MPO, even if enalapril/lercanidipine combination was more effective than single <b>monotherapies.</b> TNF-α and Hs-CRP were greater reduced by enalapril/lercanidipine combination compared with enalapril (P <. 05 for both).

40|$|What {{is known}} and {{objective}} There is considerable interest in pharmacogenetic and molecular biomarkers. Our {{aim was to}} evaluate the effects of enalapril/lercanidipine combination on some emerging biomarkers for cardiovascular risk stratification of hypertensive patients, such as lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a) ], soluble advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), soluble CD 40 ligand (sCD 40 L) and serum myeloperoxidase (MPO). Research design and methods Three hundred and forty-five patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, clinical trial: 120 hypertensive patients were randomized to enalapril 20 mg, 110 to lercanidipine 10 mg and 115 to enalapril/lercanidipine 20 / 10 mg fixed combination. We measures the following markers at baseline and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months: blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile, Lp(a), sRAGE, sCD 40 L and MPO. Results There was a decrease in blood pressure in all groups compared with baseline, even if, as expected, enalapril/lercanidipine combination was more effective in reducing blood pressure compared with the <b>monotherapies.</b> No variations in lipid profile or FPG were recorded {{in any of the}} groups. Lercanidipine, but not enalapril, improved Lp(a) levels compared with baseline. The combination enalapril/lercanidipine improved it more than the single therapies. All treatments increased sRAGE levels, and decreased sCD 40 L and MPO, with a better effect seen with the enalapril/lercanidipine combination compared with single <b>monotherapies.</b> What is new and conclusion The combination enalapril/lercanidipine seems to be better than the single <b>monotherapies</b> in reducing not only blood pressure, but also the levels of some emerging biomarkers, potentially useful for cardiovascular risk stratification of hypertensive patients.

40|$|Background: Randomized {{efficacy}} {{clinical trials}} conducted in research settings may not accurately reflect {{the benefits of}} tobacco dependence treatments when used in real-world clinical settings. Effectiveness trials (eg, in primary care settings) are needed to estimate the benefits of cessation treatments in real-world use. Methods: A total of 1346 primary care patients attending routine appointments were recruited by medical assistants in 12 primary care clinics. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} 5 active pharmacotherapies: 3 <b>monotherapies</b> (nicotine patch, nicotine lozenge, and bupropion hydrochloride sustained release [SR]) and 2 combination therapies (patch + lozenge and bupropion SR + lozenge). Patients were referred to a telephone quit line for cessation counseling. Primary outcomes included 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at 1 week, 8 weeks, and 6 months after quitting and number of days to relapse. Results: Among 7128 eligible smokers (10 cigarettes per day) attending routine primary care appointments, 1346 (18. 9 %) were enrolled in the study. Six-month abstinence rates for the 5 active pharmacotherapies were the following: bupropion SR, 16. 8 %; lozenge, 19. 9 %; patch, 17. 7 %; patch + lozenge, 26. 9 %; and bupropion SR + lozenge, 29. 9 %. Bupropion SR + lozenge was superior to all of the <b>monotherapies</b> (odds ratio, 0. 46 - 0. 56); patch + lozenge was superior to patch and bupropion <b>monotherapies</b> (odds ratio, 0. 56 and 0. 54, respectively). Conclusions: One in 5 smokers attending a routine primary care appointment was willing to make a serious quit attempt that included evidence-based counseling and medication. In this comparative effectiveness study of 5 tobacco dependence treatments, combination pharmacotherapy significantly increased abstinence compared with <b>monotherapies.</b> Provision of free cessation medications plus quit line counseling arranged in the primary care setting holds promise for assisting large numbers of smokers to quit...|$|R

While molecular studies have established the majority of recurrences are due to the original infecting strain, a significant proportion of recurrences (perhaps up to a quarter) in endemic areas may be due to reinfection, particularly after two years. Risk factors include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline <b>monotherapy</b> and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.|$|E
