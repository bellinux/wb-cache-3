40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} a study and {{an evaluation of the}} planning and implementation of the targeted <b>marketing</b> <b>campaign</b> "Småbarnsföräldern" at a public library. The analysis is based on the following questions:  What goals does the library have with the <b>marketing</b> <b>campaign</b> "Småbarnsföräldern"?  How has the library chosen to plan and implement the <b>marketing</b> <b>campaign</b> "Småbarnsföräldern" and what role have the users had in this process?  What is the internal result of the library’s <b>marketing</b> <b>campaign</b> – how did the staff experience the <b>marketing</b> <b>campaign</b> "Småbarnsföräldern"?  What is the external result – how did the target group, the parents of young children, experience the <b>marketing</b> <b>campaign</b> "Småbarnsföräldern"? The method is based on a case study of a single library with a series of interviews and document analysis. The study reveals that it´s difficult to plan a <b>marketing</b> <b>campaign</b> against a target group. The target group, the parents of young children, didn’t observe the <b>marketing</b> <b>campaign,</b> two informants had noticed the poster but didn’t pay much attention to it. No informant indicated that the campaign had prompted them to change their way of using the library. Lack of time is one reason...|$|R
