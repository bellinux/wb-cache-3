5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the <b>message</b> setting KYG for a <b>message.</b> The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the <b>message</b> setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual <b>message.</b> A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the <b>message</b> setting, then the <b>message</b> itself. The repetition of the <b>message</b> setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the <b>message</b> setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E

5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each <b>message</b> was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This <b>message</b> setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the <b>message</b> by sending the <b>message</b> setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrevention <b>messages</b> {{are short}} {{sentences}} supposed to broadcast preventive intentions. Three types of <b>messages</b> are noticeable: <b>messages</b> correcting erroneous beliefs, <b>messages</b> informing {{about the risks}} and <b>messages</b> promoting responsible gambling. While the results in the literature about <b>messages</b> promoting results are alerting, they are frequently used in European prevention campaigns. The present study relied on language and semantics models to evaluate the communicative and preventive values of 14 messages: 7 were actual European prevention <b>messages</b> and 7 <b>messages</b> were created for the study. Overall, 339 participants answered an online questionnaire in which they evaluated the communicative value {{of one of the}} <b>messages</b> and then ranked all the <b>messages</b> according to their preventive level. Results showed that <b>messages</b> informing about the risks and <b>messages</b> correcting erroneous beliefs have a higher level of communicative value than <b>messages</b> promoting responsible gambling. Indeed, the latter are judged as more ambiguous and as less preventive than the two other types of <b>messages.</b> As models of conversational pragmatics suggest that ambiguous <b>messages</b> convey at least two interpretations, the article discusses the possibility that individuals comprehend these <b>messages</b> as incentives to control their impulses (prevention) and incentives to control the game (promotion) ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{literature}} has consistently shown that affirmative <b>messages</b> are understood {{more quickly and}} accurately than negative <b>messages</b> and that redundancy facilitates comprehension and response selection. However, it was unclear which of these two variables {{is the most important}} in the design of system-status <b>messages</b> that must be understood and acted upon. In our experiment, we compared affirmative and negative system-status <b>messages</b> when negative <b>messages</b> contained a word redundant with the appropriate action. The results indicated that affirmative <b>messages</b> were responded to more quickly and more accurately than negative <b>messages</b> only when the negative <b>messages</b> did not contain a redundant word.
