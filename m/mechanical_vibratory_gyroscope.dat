40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{the analysis of}} coupling between drive and sense systems of <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes.</b> <b>Vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> have attracted {{a lot of interest}} recently with the development of MEMS gyroscopes. These gyroscopes made their way through portable devices and smart phones. Novel gyroscope architectures have been proposed and analyzed in detail. However, in most of these analyses, coupling between the sense and drive systems was ignored. We analytically show that drive and sense systems are coupled together via Coriolis and centrifugal force. As a result, system resonances shift as the rotation rate increase for linear and torsional gyroscope systems. Starting from a simple gyro system, we calculated the sense and drive resonant frequency shifts in various configurations. Then, for more complex systems where analytical solution is difficult to obtain, we used commercially available FEM tools to determine corresponding frequency shift. In general, we found that the shift is small and can be ignored for linear <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> where Q of the sense system is less than 2500 for mode matched gyros. But for higher Q systems, the frequency shift may affect the linearity of these gyroscopes. This sets a fundamental limit for the linearity of <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes.</b> Based on our calculations the non-linearity is above 1 % for linear 2 -DOF mode-matched <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> where Q is above 3000 and for torsional 2 -DOF <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> where Q is above 600.

40|$|Abstract—Electrostatic tuning of the {{resonant}} modes in <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> {{is often}} suggested {{as a means}} for compen-sating manufacturing aberrations that produce detuned reso-nances.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{reports on}} the design of novel {{closed-loop}} control systems for the sense mode of a vibratory-rate gyroscope based on a high-order sigma-delta modulator (SDM). A low-pass and two distinctive bandpass topologies are derived, and their advantages discussed. So far, most closed-loop force-feedback control systems for these sensors were based on low-pass SDM’s. Usually, the sensing element of a <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscope</b> is designed with a high quality factor to increase the sensitivity and, hence, can be treated as a mechanical resonator. Furthermore, the output characteristic of <b>vibratory</b> rate <b>gyroscopes</b> is narrowband amplitude- modulated signal. Therefore, a bandpass M is a more appropriate control strategy for a <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscope</b> than a low-pass SDM. Using a high-order bandpass SDM, the control system can adopt a much lower sampling frequency compared with a low-pass SDM while achieving a similar noise floor for a given oversampling ratio (OSR). In addition, a control system based on a high-order bandpass SDM is superior as it not only greatly shapes the quantization noise, but also alleviates tonal behavior, as is often seen in low-order SDM control systems, and has good immunities to fabrication tolerances and parameter mismatch. These properties are investigated in this study at system level...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} control and {{operation}} of an inertial reference unit (IRU) based on <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> provides for continuously repeated cycles of tuning and calibration. The method is intended especially for application to an IRU containing <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> that are integral parts of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and that have cloverleaf designs, as described in several previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. The method provides for minimization of several measures of spurious gyroscope output, including zero-rate offset (ZRO), angle random walk (ARW), and rate drift. These benefits are afforded both at startup and thereafter during continuing operation, {{in the presence of}} unknown rotation rates and changes in temperature. A <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscope</b> contains a precision mechanically resonant structure containing two normal modes of vibration nominally degenerate in frequency and strongly coupled via a Coriolis term. In the case of the cloverleaf design MEMS gyro, these normal modes of vibration are plate rocking modes. The rocking motion of the plate is described by giving two angles, theta(sub 1) and theta(sub 2). A proof mass consisting of a post orthogonal to the plate ensures a high degree of Coriolis coupling of vibratory energy from one mode into the other under inertial rotation. The plate is driven and sensed capacitively across a few-microns-wide gap, and the normal mode frequencies can be tuned electrostatically by DC voltages applied across this gap. In order to sense rotation, the resonator plate is caused to rock in the theta(sub 1) direction, then any small motions in the theta(sub 2) direction are sensed, rebalanced, and interpreted as inertial rotation. In this scenario, the "drive" has been assigned to the theta(sub 1) direction, and the "sense" has been assigned to the theta(sub 2) direction...|$|R

40|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach to the}} design and fabrication of <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> is founded {{on the use of}} fabrication techniques that yield best results in the mesoscopic size range, which is characterized by overall device dimensions of the order of a centimeter. This approach stands in contradistinction to prior approaches in (1) the macroscopic size range (the size range of conventional design and fabrication, characterized by overall device dimensions of many centimeters) and (2) the microscopic size range [the size range of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), characterized by overall device dimensions of the order of a millimeter or less]. The mesoscale approach offers some of the advantage of the MEMS approach (sizes and power demands smaller than those of the macroscale approach) and some of the advantage of the macroscale approach (the possibility of achieving relative dimensional precision greater than that of the MEMS approach). Relative dimensional precision is a major issue in the operation of a <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscope.</b> The heart of a <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscope</b> is a <b>mechanical</b> resonator that is required to have a specified symmetry in a plane orthogonal to the axis about which rotation is to be measured. If the resonator could be perfectly symmetrical, then in the absence of rotation, a free vibration of the resonator could remain fixed along any orientation relative to its housing; that is, the gyroscope could exhibit zero drift. In practice, manufacturing imprecision gives rise to some asymmetry in mass, flexural stiffness or dissipation, resulting in a slight drift or beating motion of an initial vibration pattern that cannot be distinguished from rotation. In the mesoscale approach, one exploits the following concepts: For a given amount of dimensional error generated in manufacturing, the asymmetry and hence the rate-of-rotation drift of the gyroscope can be reduced by increasing the scale. The decrease in asymmetry also reduces coupling of vibrations to the external environment. Mechanical thermal noise and electronic measurement noise and drift can also be reduced by increasing the size of the resonator and its associated sensors...|$|R

This report presents the modeling and analytical simulation task of a nano cantilever beam gyroscope. Static and dynamic analysis of a nano/micro cantilever gyroscope with a tip mass is studied. Pull-in instability corresponding voltage is estimated from static and frequency response. Pull-in stability regions are identified as a function of beam length, tip mass value, elastic modulus of the beam. Nonlinearities due to geometry and the external forces including electrostatic and van der Waals forces are considered during modelling. Squeeze film and slide film damping are considered to account the damping force between the tip mass and sense and drive direction. The dynamic solution is obtained by using Galerkin’s reduction scheme. The time response and the frequency domain graphs are arrived for different parameters on both sense and drive directions. The interactive program developed in the work are helpful to account any experiments for additional force at nano leve...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} {{a novel approach}} for measuring body joint angles, mainly the knee angles, for surface electrical stimulator system. In this work, we only focus on the sensing mechanism for measuring the knee joint angle using wearable sensors. Our system consists of multiple flex-sensors mounted on a supportive cloth and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscope.</b> In Body Sensor Network (BSN) field for medical purpose, body joint angle measurement system is quite important and useful for continuous monitoring in rehabilitation activities especially for Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) patients. Body joint angle measurement system is sensory type systems that provide information about angle movement of body joint. It is usually used at knee and arm joint to monitor the movement while patients do some exercises. This very important and helpful for the therapists and physicians {{in order to see}} the effectiveness of rehabilitations training. For knee angle movement evaluation, lower limb joint angles and segment angles were estimated by the Kalman filter from the data measured with wireless MEMS <b>vibratory</b> <b>gyroscope</b> and flex-sensors. Electrical stimulation was applied to the common peroneal nerve or the tibialis anterior muscle by detecting stimulus timing automatically from the data of wireless sensor attached at the back of knee which known as popliteal fossa and shank of the paraplegic side. The developed system performed well in monitoring the effectiveness of rehabilitations training with the knee joint angle measurement average error rate of 6. 92 °. The comparison between measured data of the gyroscope and flex-sensors for knee joint angle measurement system were also demonstrated...|$|R
