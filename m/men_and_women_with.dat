500|$|The Indonesian {{island of}} Java, {{run by the}} Srivijaya dynasty of Sumatra from the 7thcentury, partly practised Hinduism. This {{included}} transmission and adoption of the Mahabharata traditions. [...] "The earliest evidence of the penetration of the Sanskrit epics into rural areas {{is found in the}} Sangsang copper plate inscription issued in the name of King Balitung in AD907." [...] A [...] "rendering of the Mahābhārata (IAST original) into Javanese was undertaken under the patronage of King Dharmawangśa Tĕguh (AD 990–1016)", culminating in [...] "a recital of the Wirāṭaparwa for 'one month minus one evening'—commencing on 14 October and ending on 12 November 996." [...] This first translation into Javanese was [...] "abbreviated" [...] and in [...] "prose". However, East Javanese poets later started producing native metered kakawin, expanding on themes from the parvas ("books" [...] or [...] "chapters") of the Mahabharata, and freely importing these into Javanese settings. Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder commented: [...] "These <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> their Indian names are essentially Javanese, acting like Javanese, thinking like Javanese and living in a Javanese environment." ...|$|E
500|$|English and German {{literary}} traditions both {{influenced the}} British Victorian image of elves, {{which appeared in}} illustrations as tiny <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> pointed ears and stocking caps. An example is Andrew Lang's fairy tale Princess Nobody (1884), illustrated by Richard Doyle, where fairies are tiny people with butterfly wings, whereas elves are tiny people with red stocking caps. These conceptions remained prominent in twentieth-century children's literature, for example Enid Blyton's The Faraway Tree series, and were influenced by German Romantic literature. Accordingly, in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Die Wichtelmänner (literally, [...] "the little men"), the title protagonists are two tiny naked men who help a shoemaker in his work. Even though Wichtelmänner are akin to beings such as kobolds, dwarves and brownies, the tale was translated into English by Margaret Hunt in 1884 as The Elves and the Shoemaker. This shows how the meanings of elf had changed, and was in itself influential: the usage is echoed, for example, in the house-elf of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories. In his turn, J.R.R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form Elb in translations of his works, as recorded in his Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings (1967). Elb, Elben was consequently introduced in the 1972 German translation of The Lord of the Rings, repopularising the form in German.|$|E
