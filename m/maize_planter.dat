40|$|This work {{focused on}} the design and {{fabrication}} of a manually operated single row <b>maize</b> <b>planter</b> capable of delivering seeds precisely {{in a straight line}} with uniform depth in the furrow, and with uniform spacing between the seeds. The work demonstrates the application of engineering techniques to reduce human labour specifically in the garden. The results obtained from the trial tests showed that the planter functioned properly as expected with a planting capacity of 0. 0486 hectare/hr. Visual inspection of the seeds released from the planterâ€™s metering mechanism showed no visible signs of damage to the seeds...|$|E
40|$|Aiming at the {{reduction}} of cost of cultivation and maintaining the sustainability of soil crop agro ecosystem, different conservation tillage equipment were tested and some adapted to local conditions {{in the past few}} years by the Nepal Agriculture Research Council (NARC) in Nepal. Minimum tillage by single pass roto tiller, minimum till drill (Chinese seed drill) operated by power tiller, power tiller operated strip till (modified from minimum till drill), four-wheel tractor drawn zero till drill and manually operated <b>maize</b> <b>planter</b> (Jab seeder) were tested in on-station and on-farm conditions of Nepal. Based on on-farm studies conducted at Bhaktapur in 2003 - 2004, it was concluded that single pass of power tiller operated roto-tiller saves cost for land preparation by 40 per cent than tillage by 2 passes of power tiller with roto-tiller (local practice) with about 5 per cent increased average yield of wheat. Similarly, based on on-farm study conducted at Bhaktapur in year 2005 - 2006, it was concluded that minimum till drill (Chinese seed drill) saves cost for land preparation by 61 per cent than tillage by 2 passes of power tiller with roto-tiller (local practice) with about 2...|$|E
