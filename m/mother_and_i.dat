[...] Rockefeller, seeing the poll result as well, publicly maintained his support for Romney but {{said he would be}} available for a draft; the statement made national headlines and embittered Romney (who would later claim it was Rockefeller's entry, and not the [...] "brainwashing" [...] remark, that doomed him). [...] Seeing his cause was hopeless, Romney announced his withdrawal as a presidential candidate on February 28, 1968. [...] Romney wrote his son Mitt, still away on missionary work: [...] "Your <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are not personally distressed. As a matter of fact, we are relieved. ... I aspired, and though I achieved not, I am satisfied." ...|$|E

Her mother, Sarah Frances Bow (née Gordon, 1880–1923), was told by a doctor not to become {{pregnant}} again, for fear the next baby might die, as well. Despite the warning, Sarah became pregnant with Clara in late 1904. In addition to the risky pregnancy, a heat wave besieged New York in July 1905, and temperatures peaked around [...] Years later, Clara said: [...] "I don't suppose two people ever looked death in the face more clearly than my <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> the morning I was born.

[...] Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled [...] "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I remember now that {{it seemed as if}} we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. [...] As we stood there in the sandy street, my <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away.

2500|$|The {{reviewer}} {{stated that}} the jokes might be funnier if the dialogue between them were [...] "compressed".

[...] Although the audience greeted the new piece enthusiastically, neither partner was satisfied. [...] Sullivan wrote in his diary, [...] "Parts of it dragged a little – dialogue too redundant but success great and genuine I think.... Thank God opera is finished & out." [...] Gilbert wrote to his friend, Mrs. Bram Stoker: [...] "I'm not at all a proud <b>Mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never want to see this ugly misshapen little brat again." ...|$|E

Soon after, his father died, leaving an impoverished widow and two orphans.

He went to learn, pray, and sleep on a bench in a small beth midrash in the Bukharim neighborhood of the New City called Shoshanim LeDavid, covering vast amounts of the Talmud with commentaries and poskim (halakhic decisors). As money was scarce in his household, he sustained himself with a nightly meal of dry pita seasoned with salt. In his old age, he told his students, [...] "When I was young, I studied Torah through hardship. If we were truly fortunate, my <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had a whole pita to share.
