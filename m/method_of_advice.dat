40|$|Education for {{children}} {{is very important}} thing. Because, education acquired by {{a child in the}} early years will affect the future. Kids begin to be introduced with good values and norms of Islam, first from their parents or loved ones who are in a family environment. In the current family life the parents hardly notice the effort, training, and implementation of worship in children. Whereas the planting of the value of worship was done from small. To overcome these problems, family efforts are needed in instilling worship. Sidomulyo is a country consisting of RT 01 and RT 02 of RW 03, and a Muslim family environment who are active in religious activities, observed from parents and children who diligently worship in the mosques. In addition, the attention of parents to religious education including their children worship routines is big enough. This is evidenced by the form of referrals and exercises performed on children to get used to worship from childhood. based on this background, the problems in thispaper are what the efforts and methods of instilling children worship in the country Sidomulyo of RT 01 and RT 02 of RW 03. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the efforts and methods to instill worship in children in the country Sidomulyo of RT 01 and RT 02 of RW 03. This research includes field research (field research) with a qualitative approach. Data collection uses interviews, observation and document. While the method of data analysis uses qualitative descriptive analysis in the form of a narrative or paragraph instead of the numbers, through the process of data collection, data reduction, and display data. Furthermore, the conclusions are drawn by using deductive method which is a way of thinking that departs from theory to then matched with data. Based on data analysis of the results, the study concluded that family effort in instilling children worship in country RT 01 and RT 02 of RW 03, namely: 1) Teaching worship early; 2) Practice of worship; 3) Choose a good environment; 4) Training and internalizing worship.

40|$|AbstractThe {{primary goal}} of {{multicultural}} education is towards offering fair opportunity to all children with different cultural background and simultaneously enable them {{to interact with the}} community of various background, hence, producing a quality and unwavering future generation integrating physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual element. Therefore, Islamic Education teachers must be committed to the realization of multi-cultural education and must understand the concept of cultural differences through distinction of ethnicity, language, and cultural practices. To promote cultural diversity, teachers should be using methods that are appropriate to the cultural diversity of the students so that they will not fall behind in their learning process. This study is aimed to explore the practice of Islamic education teachers in implementing multicultural education in the teaching of Islam. This is a qualitative study using case study design. Data were obtained through semi-structure interviews and analysed using Nvivo 8. Five Islamic Education participants have been chosen through a purposive sampling technique. The study found that teachers have been using various <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> strategies in implementing multicultural education.

By making and executing models of dynamic systems {{in a computer}} environment, students are stimulated {{to learn about the}} specific domain that is modeled as well as about the process of modeling in general. However, learning by modeling also leads to characteristic student mistakes, based on a combination of faulty domain knowledge and insufficient modeling skills. In this article, we describe a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> generating <b>advice</b> to students during their modeling process. The on-line advice system was informed by our observations of a teacher who gave advice via a textual communication tool to students building models with a System Dynamics model editor. The first version <b>of</b> the on-line <b>advice</b> system was evaluated in two ways: first, three teachers evaluated the advice the system generated for students’ final solutions; second, we analyzed the advice the system provided as it was used by a sample of students who were building a physics model.

DESIGN: Cluster randomized factorial trial with 12 -week implementation and measurement period. SETTING: Primary health-care units (PHCU) in different locations throughout Catalonia, England, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 120 PHCU, 24 {{in each of}} Catalonia, England, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. INTERVENTIONS: PHCUs were randomized to one of eight groups: care as usual, {{training and}} support (TS), financial reimbursement (FR) and eBI; paired combinations of TS, FR and eBI, and all of FR, TS and eBI. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of eligible adult (age 18 + years) patients screened during a 12 -week implementation period. Secondary outcome measures were proportion of screen-positive patients advised; and proportion of consulting adult patients given an intervention (screening and advice to screen-positives) during the same 12 -week implementation period. FINDINGS: During a 4 -week baseline measurement period, the proportion of consulting adult patients who were screened for their alcohol consumption was 0. 059 per PHCU (95 % CI 0. 034 to 0. 084). Based on the factorial design, {{the ratio of the}} logged proportion screened during the 12 -week implementation period was 1. 48 (95 % CI = 1. 13 - 1. 95) in PHCU that received TS versus PHCU that did not receive TS; for FR, the ratio was 2. 00 (95 % CI = 1. 56 - 2. 56). The option of referral to eBI did not lead to a higher proportion of patients screened. The ratio for TS plus FR was 2. 34 (95 % CI = 1. 77 - 3. 10), and the ratio for TS plus FR plus eBI was 1. 68 (95 % CI = 1. 11 - 2. 53).

40|$|AbstractSeveral testing {{approaches}} {{focus on}} finding faults in software units of implementation. A problem not addressed by unit testing is the interaction among units, {{with respect to}} the correctness of their interfaces. In this paper a structural integration testing approach for Object-Oriented (OO) and Aspect-Oriented (AO) Java programs is presented. To make the activity more feasible, we address the testing of pairs of units (i. e., <b>methods</b> and pieces <b>of</b> <b>advice).</b> A model called PWDU (PairWise Def-Use) graph to represent the flow of control and data between pairs of units is proposed. Based on the PWDU, the following family of testing criteria is defined: all-pairwise-integrated-nodes (control-flow based), all-pairwise-integrated-edges (control-flow based), and all-pairwise-integrated-uses (data-flow based). To evaluate the proposed approach, an implementation of the criteria in a testing tool is presented along with an example of usage and an exploratory study.

This study examined whether twenty elements of interventions deemed essential for such translational application were reported in sufficient detail in smoking cessation trials with pregnant women. Methods: Searches of electronic databases using MeSH terms and keywords identified peer-reviewed English language studies published between 2001 and 2012. Eligible studies reported a smoking cessation intervention targeted at pregnant women and met Cochrane’s Effective Practice and Organization of Care group study design criteria. Each intervention arm of eligible studies was assessed against the developed twenty criteria. Results: Thirty relevant studies reported the findings of 45 intervention arms. The mode of delivery of the intervention was reported in 100 % of intervention arms. Other well reported criteria included reporting of the provider who delivered the intervention (96 %), sample characteristics (80 %) and the intervention setting (80 %).

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM), {{the most}} common of metabolic disorders, is a global public health concern. Numbers are rising with 383 million adults currently diagnosed with DM and another 175 million as yet undiagnosed. The rise in cases includes increasing numbers of women of a reproductive age whose reproductive health and contraception need careful consideration. Unintended pregnancy with poor glycemic control at the time of conception increases the chance of adverse pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth, congenital abnormalities, and perinatal mortality. In order to minimize complications, safe and effective contraception is paramount for all women with DM. This is a challenge as women {{have been found to be}} reticent to ask for advice, appear to lack understanding of risks, and are less likely to be using contraception than women without DM. The World Health Organization has developed Medical Eligibility Criteria to guide contraceptive choice. Women with DM without complications can choose from the full range <b>of</b> contraceptive <b>methods</b> including hormonal contraception as the advantages of use outweigh any risk. Women with diabetic complications may need specialist advice to assess the risk–benefit equation, particularly in respect of hormonal contraception. Women should be aware that there is no restriction to the use of oral and copper intrauterine emergency contraception methods. There is a need for an integrated approach to diabetes and reproductive health with improved communication between women with DM and their health care providers. Women need to be aware <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> and services and should make their own choice of contraception based on their needs and associated risk factors. Practitioners can offer nonjudgmental guidance working in partnership with women. This will enable discussion of risks and benefits <b>of</b> contraceptive <b>methods</b> and provision <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> dedicated to improving overall health and well-being...|$|R
