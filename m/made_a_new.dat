5|$|Knittel {{made many}} errors, {{especially}} in Latin text, {{he also did}} not decipher every word and left several lacunae in the reconstructed text (e.g. Romans 11:35; 12:2; 15:8).

5|$|When borings {{were made}} in the 1870s prior to the {{building}} of chemical works a deep gorge measuring around 100 feet (30 m) was found in the bedrock which was filled with glacial deposits. From this it was concluded that before the Ice Age the Mersey had flowed in a more northerly course, and when it was blocked by glacial deposits it had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> channel through Runcorn Gap.|$|E
5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were <b>made.</b> <b>A</b> <b>new</b> LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel.

5|$|Crane {{starts to}} believe that a {{conspiracy}} links all the deaths together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> will just before he died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} act, {{a group of}} friends (including Sir Danvers Carew's {{daughter}} Agnes, attorney Gabriel Utterson, and Dr. and Mrs. Lanyon) has met up at Sir Danvers' home. Dr. Lanyon brings word that Agnes' fiancé, Dr. Henry Jekyll, will be late to the gathering. He then repeats a second-hand story about a man named Hyde, who injured a child in a collision on the street. The story upsets Utterson because Jekyll recently <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> will that gives his estate to a mysterious friend named Edward Hyde. Jekyll arrives; Utterson confronts him about the will, but Jekyll refuses to consider changing it.|$|E
5|$|Isabella and her {{supporters}} Péter Petrovics and Ferenc Patócsy <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> attempt {{to prevent the}} execution of the Treaty of Nyírbátor in May 1551, but Martinuzzi defeated them.

Two days later, she surrendered the Holy Crown to Ferdinand's representative, Giovanni Battista Castaldo. The Diet acknowledged their abdication and swore fealty to Ferdinand on 26July.|$|E

He broke the record of Australian great Donald Bradman and Indian Rahul Dravid, both of whom had managed to get three. Against England, he got his highest Test score of 235. He followed it up with ODI centuries against West Indies and Sri Lanka in consecutive series, equalling Ricky Ponting's tally of 30 ODI centuries. In October 2017, he was adjourned the ODI player of the series against New Zealand for scoring two ODI centuries, during the course of which he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> record for the most runs (8,888), best average (55.55) and highest number of centuries (31) for any batsman when completing 200 ODIs.|$|E

5|$|San Martín <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{request for}} ships to Bowles, but {{received}} no answer. He moved again to Buenos Aires, {{to make a}} similar request. He arrived to Mendoza {{a few days after}} the execution of the Chileans Luis and Juan José Carrera, brothers of José Miguel Carrera. The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian Vicuña Mackenna indicts San Martín, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodríguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; this death may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Martín could not have taken part in it, as he was already on the way to Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Since the T65 {{project was}} fading away, the Armored Force still needed a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so they <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> project (called T65E1) {{based on the}} new T24 chassis (a prototype of the M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret at rear with the engines {{in the middle of}} the chassis – with a few minor tweaks (including an angular gun shield instead of a straight one).|$|E
5|$|Stephen invaded Székely Land {{multiple}} times in 1461. Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, decided to support Peter Aaron, giving him shelter in his capital at Buda. In 1462, Stephen underscored his wish for {{good relations with}} the Ottoman Empire, expelling from Moldavia the Franciscans, who were agitating for a united church and a crusade. Stephen continued to pay the yearly tribute to the Ottoman Empire initiated by his predecessor. He also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> agreement with Poland in Suceava on 2 March 1462, promising to personally swear fealty to Casimir IV if the king required it. This treaty declared that Casimir was the sole suzerain of Moldavia, prohibiting Stephen from alienating Moldavian territories without his authorization. It also obliged Stephen to recapture the Moldavian territories that had been lost, obviously in reference to Chilia.|$|E

This attack, launched at 02:30 and heavily supported with artillery, penetrated F Company. It was apparent that unless F Company's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse. When all its officers became casualties, First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson, adjutant of the 2nd Battalion, assumed command of the company.|$|E
5|$|The State Advisory Committee <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{recommendation}} in April 1940 for Albany Highway {{instead of}} Great Southern Highway. This new proposal received {{support from the}} Albany Municipal Council and Tambellup Road Board. However, the Perth City Council still preferred Great Southern Highway, and recommended that within its boundaries – from The Causeway to Welshpool – the road be named Albany Road, {{and that one of}} the proposed bypasses in the area would be better suited to the highway name. The entire road was renamed Albany Highway on 2 October 1940, superseding the previously used names Albany Road, Perth–Albany Road, and High Street in Kojonup.|$|E
