40|$|The {{influence}} of the molecular weight {{and the type of}} gelatin (A or B), as well as the molecular weight of poly (gamma-glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA), on the properties of gelatin/gamma-PGA mixed bioadhesives were studied. The gelation of the system was enhanced by a crosslinker, 1 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) - 3 -(ethylcarbodiimide) hydrochloride (EDC). The gelation time of the bioadhesives was analyzed using rheological measurements. The results indicated that the type of gelatin was a critical factor in determining the gelation time of the biological <b>glues.</b> The <b>mixed</b> <b>glues</b> had greater bonding strength and smaller gelation times as the molecular weight of gamma-PGA or gelatin increased. The swelling ratio decreased and the denaturation temperature increased upon raising the EDC concentration, indicating a greater degree of crosslinking at higher EDC concentrations. The <b>mixed</b> <b>glues</b> crosslinked with various concentrations of EDC (1. 7 - 2. 5 %) showed no cytotoxicity to fibroblasts. In addition, no significant inflammatory response was observed in the rat subcutaneous implantation. The bioadhesives based on gelatin/gamma-PGA remained at the site for 7 days while the fibrin glue had almost completely degraded. By choosing the appropriate gelatin type and higher molecular weight gamma-PGA in the mixtures, the gelatin/gamma-PGA biological glues could serve as soft tissue adhesives. Rheological characterization was essential in the evaluation of biological glues...|$|R

5000|$|Kiso {{was born}} in Niitsu, Niigata, into the Katsura family that long had ties to Japan's {{imperial}} family. Her father, {{who had been a}} part of the government there, owned large tracts of land noted for their rice production. Kiso learned all of the traditional feminine arts of the upper class, such as the tea ceremony, flower arranging, and others, but she excelled especially in bonseki. Bonseki is the ancient art of arranging pure white sand and small white rocks on a black lacquer tray, thus forming miniature landscapes and seascapes. The sand and rocks were carefully manipulated with feathers, small brushes, and spoons. Each scene was temporary, only for the moment. The sand and rocks would then be brushed together and returned to their small storage containers to be used again. In addition, Kiso learned a technique for <b>mixing</b> <b>glue</b> with the sand so that the miniature scene would adhere to paper, and thus have a more permanent form. About 1950 in Tokyo, Kiso helped initiate an association for the cultivation and perpetuation of bonseki art.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of porcine cancellous bone as a scaffold in a rat calvarial defect model. Critical-sized defects were created in 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats. The ani-mals were divided into critical defect (CD, n= 10), β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) graft (BT, n= 10) and porcine cancellous bone graft (PCB, n= 10) groups. Each defect was filled with β-TCP <b>mixed</b> with fi-brin <b>glue</b> or porcine cancellous bone powder <b>mixed</b> with fibrin <b>glue.</b> In the CD group, the defect was left empty. All rats were sacrificed at 8 weeks after bone graft surgery, and bone formation was eval-uated by gross observation, plain radiography, micro-computed tomography scanning and histological evaluation. Repair of bone defect was the least in the CD group, and significant new bone formation was observed in the PCB group. Grafting of porcine cancellous bone was more efficient for regenerat-ing new bone than grafting β-TCP...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of bone pate on human osteoblast differentiation by measuring cell viability, alkaline phosphatase activity and expression of the transcription factors and of the major components of the extracellular matrix. Although bone paté has been used in ear surgery for many years and when placed in contact with mastoid and external auditory canal bone become viable, the cellular mechanisms that lead to its osteointegration have never been described. Bone paté taken from four patients subjected to mastoidectomy and affected by middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma was placed in contact with osteoblast-like cell cultures. Four experimental conditions were obtained: cell cultures treated with bone patè, with bone paté <b>mixed</b> with fibrin <b>glue,</b> with fibrin glue and untreated. After 24  h, the viability of the cells was evaluated; after 1  week, alkaline phosphatase activity and the expression of transcription factors and bone matrix proteins were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. After 24  h osteoblasts showed increased viability when treated with bone paté (19  % increase) and bone pate <b>mixed</b> with fibrin <b>glue</b> (34  % increase). After 1  week, the number of alkaline phosphatase positive cells increased by 97 and 94  % in cultures treated with bone paté alone and bone pate <b>mixed</b> with fibrin <b>glue.</b> Treatment with bone patè upregulated transcription factors and components of the extracellular matrix.

5000|$|The Inkstick (Chinese: 墨 pinyin: [...] ) is an {{artificial}} ink {{developed during the}} Han dynasty. These first writing inks were based on naturally occurring minerals like graphite and vermilion; earliest inks were probably liquids and not preserved. Modern inksticks are generally made of soots from one of three different sources, including lacquer soot, pine soot, and oil soot. Soots are collected, then <b>mixed</b> with <b>glue.</b> Higher quality inksticks also use powdered spices and herbs, adding to aroma and providing some protection to the ink itself. The glue, soot, and spice mixture is then pressed into shape and allowed to dry. This process can take 6 weeks, depending on an inkstick's dimensions.|$|R

5000|$|If gilding {{on canvas}} or on wood, the surface was often first coated with gesso. [...] "Gesso" [...] is a {{substance}} made of finely ground gypsum or chalk <b>mixed</b> with <b>glue.</b> Once the coating of gesso had been applied, allowed to dry, and smoothed, it was re-wet with a sizing made of rabbit-skin glue and water ("water gilding", {{which allows the}} surface to be subsequently burnished to a mirror-like finish) or boiled linseed oil mixed with litharge ("oil gilding", which does not) and the gold leaf was layered on and left to dry. Those gilding on canvas and parchment also sometimes employed stiffly-beaten egg whites ("glair"), gum, and/or Armenian bole as sizing, though egg whites and gum both become brittle over time, causing the gold leaf to crack and detach, and so honey was sometimes added {{to make them more}} flexible.|$|R
30|$|Peak {{value of}} 152  pT for the {{measurement}} of model half-cylinder sample and that of 6.6  pT for the theoretical curve suggest that the total magnetic moment for the measurement {{is estimated to be}} 3.0  ×  10 − 8  A m 2. Magnetization of JARE 54 -ASH 3 - 1 after acquisition of IRM at 25  mT is 1.0  ×  10 − 2  A m 2 /kg (Fig.  5 c), so the estimated amount of material in the modeled sample is 3.0  mg. This is much smaller than the total volcanic particle weight of 9  mg extracted from JARE 54 -ASH 3 and <b>mixed</b> with epoxy <b>glue</b> to make the thin half-cylinder model sample. The discrepancy might be caused by the inhomogeneity within JARE 54 -ASH 3 block sample in magnetization, larger distance of sensor to sample than calculated and/or heterogeneous distribution of volcanic particles within half-cylinder sample <b>mixed</b> with epoxy <b>glue.</b> Lanci et al. (2001) pointed out the possibility of rotation of magnetic grains by meting of surrounding ice by the heat caused by electromagnetic induction at the time of IRM acquisition with a pulsed magnetic field. However, {{this may not be the}} case for this study, because we used static DC magnetic field for the acquisition of IRM.|$|R
30|$|Figure  8 c shows {{response}} in X (black curve), Y (red curve) and Z axis (blue curve) gradiometers for thin model sample with volcanic ash particles of JARE 54 -ASH 3 <b>mixed</b> with epoxy <b>glue.</b> The block ice sample was melted, and the extracted particles were <b>mixed</b> with epoxy <b>glue</b> {{to make a}} half-cylinder model sample with 29  mm radius and 1  mm thickness. The sample was magnetized in X axis with a DC magnetic field of 25  mT. Among three axes, Z axis response has a highest peak of 152  pT, whereas X axis response has a negative peak of − 85  pT. Y axis response is nearly zero for the whole length, which is predicted from the theoretical calculation. Z axis response could be well compared with the theoretical response with a thickness of 1  mm. The distances of two zero crossings are 16  mm for both measured and theoretical responses. Negative lobes for theoretical response are 19  % of the peak value on both sides, whereas those for measured response are 22 and 17  % with asymmetry. The asymmetry might be caused by slight tilt of half-cylinder model slice relative to the axes of the gradiometer pickup coil.|$|R
50|$|The easiest {{and most}} {{effective}} way to remove botfly larvae is to apply petroleum jelly over the location, which prevents air from reaching the larva, suffocating it. It can then be removed with tweezers safely after a day. White <b>glue</b> <b>mixed</b> with pyrethrin or other safe insecticides and applied to the spot of swelling on the scalp will kill the larvae within hours, as they must keep an air hole open and so will chew through the dried glue to do this, consuming the insecticide in the process.|$|R
30|$|Calcium {{containing}} pigments are of mineral, biogenic, fossil or artificial origin, mainly {{corresponding to}} groups of carbonates, sulphates, phosphates, or fluorides [1]. A variety of Ca, CaMg carbonates, and sulphates was used as white pigment (chalk, bianco di San Giovanni: CaCO 3; huntite: CaMg 3 (CO 3) 4 and dolomite: CaMg(CO 3) 2; gypsum: CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O), as well as <b>mixed</b> with <b>glue</b> to prepare ground layers in northern and southern Europe, respectively [1, 20, 43 – 45] and to prepare parchment for manuscripts [46]. The calcination of bones gives a white pigment mainly containing apatite Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 [1]. Calcium compounds were as well used as extenders (for example with leadwhite, to achieve transparency effects), and for lakes, as chemical or physical supports [20, 47]. The purple mineral fluorite (CaF) was also used as a pigment, mainly in fifteenth to sixteenth century central European artworks [1, 48, 49].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} added value of micro-chemical and {{microscopic}} approaches to gather {{scientific evidence that}} can technically explain the pictorial quality of an egg-tempera painting, and underpin assessments that otherwise {{would be based on}} naked eye observations only. Demonstration is here provided via the interdisciplinary investigation of the original technique used by Giovanni del Biondo in the polyptych Annunciation and Saints (1385 ca), Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence, Italy. The exquisite surface appearance makes this panel painting remarkable compared to artworks by coeval artists. Imaging techniques (UV, IR and IR false color), non-invasive single spot techniques (XRF and FORS spectrometry) and analytical investigations on eight selected micro-samples (ATR-FTIR, GC/MS and Py/GC–MS, ESEM-EDS) were combined to retrieve the palette and identify organic binding media and a superficial coating layer. Stratigraphic and micro-chemical data confirmed the use of a relatively simple egg-tempera technique applied on a ground made of gypsum <b>mixed</b> with animal <b>glue,</b> without complex stratigraphic superimposition of preparation and pictorial layers. Various pigments were identified, among which is the precious lapis lazuli. While Py/GC–MS highlight that the coating is made of dammar resin and honey <b>mixed</b> with animal <b>glue,</b> the results allow us to state that the painting was not intentionally varnished by Giovanni del Biondo. These outcomes shed a new light on the technical knowledge of this polyptych, and prove how challenging is the attempt to categorize egg-tempera recipes used by ancient painters {{at the turn of the}} 14 th century. ...|$|R

The osteogenic capacity of equine bone marrow and muscle MSCs <b>mixed</b> with fibrin <b>glue</b> or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a scaffold is assessed. Bone production by the following groups was compared: Group 1, bone marrow (BM) MSCs in fibrin glue; Group 2, muscle (M) MSCs in fibrin glue; Group 3, BM MSCs in PBS; Group 4, M MSCs in PBS and as a control; Group 5, fibrin glue without cells. BM and M MSCs underwent osteogenic stimulation for 48 h prior to being injected intramuscularly into nude mice. After 4 weeks, the mice were killed and muscle samples were collected and evaluated for bone formation and mineralization by using radiology, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry.
