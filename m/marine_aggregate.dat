Their significance {{is bound to}} increase further, due to increasing coastal zone development, stricter environmental regulation concerning land-won aggregates and increasing demand for beach replenishment material. <b>Marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> (MA) deposits can be differentiated into relict and modern deposits.

The latter are deposits, which have been formed and controlled by the modern hydro-and sediment dynamic conditions (e. g. the linear sand banks of the southern North Sea).

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. As of 2009, there were 75 {{licensed}} areas within UK waters for <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> extraction. Each year, around 20 million tonnes {{of sand and}} gravel are extracted from these areas {{for use in the}} construction and building industry 1. Extraction of <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> has the potential to generate noise, and if at sufficient levels, this could {{have a negative impact on}} marine species in or around the dredging area.

In the UK, <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> {{dredging}} {{is considered by many}} to be responsible for coastal loss and campaigns based on the ‘precautionary principle’ have been mounted to halt extraction. Two South Wales, UK coastal areas, where critical beach loss has been associated with dredging activities, were monitored to assess morphological change. In five years of beach monitoring along the Penarth coastline (September 1997 to September 2002) and six years monitoring Port Eynon and Horton beaches (January 2001 to October 2007), no qualitative or quantitative causal link was found between <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> dredging and beach erosion. Conversely, many qualitative and quantitative relationships were established between beach erosion and forcing agents such as water level, wind and waves. Results from Port Eynon and Horton showed significant temporal variations in beach level and on-shore/offshore sediment movement was seen as significant in beach formation processes. At Penarth, changing wind direction and increased easterly storms were most significant. Furthermore, there were indications of recognised causes of coastal erosion such as increased water levels, storms and anthropogenic construction. Therefore, morphological changes on a relatively short timescale can be clearly attributed to influences other than <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> dredging. Potential future work includes regular monitoring and analysis of shoreline changes in areas adjacent to dredging sites together with concurrent bathymetric surveys.

For <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> extraction, the type of dredger used is a trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD). This type of dredger lowers a drag head and suction pipe to the sea floor, in water depths of up to 50 m, to extract the sand or gravel, depositing it in a hopper on the vessel. The vessel will often screen the dredged material for granular size and return the unwanted material and water over the side of the vessel.

IMAGIN was structured around a series of work packages, each focusing on the different aspects of the <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> question. Marine aggregates can be defined as sedimentary material - sand or gravel of various grain and class sizes (grades). Extraction of marine aggregates typically involves dredging of the deposit to remove it from the seabed. Aggregates may be screened at sea before being transported to a port or wharf facility for unloading and then further processing, if required, and subsequent transportation. In common with terrestrial aggregates, sands and gravels sourced from the seabed are an important economic resource, which can contribute to the development and maintenance of infrastructure, e. g. buildings, roads and bridges. Marine aggregates are also used for beach nourishment and coastal defence purposes, the demands for which have become more pressing when set against the predicted implications of climate change, sea level rise and associated effects on low lying coastal areas. A number of countries have sought to meet the demand for aggregates by utilising sources from the seabed to replace or complement terrestrial sources.

40|$|Ecological {{epizootiology}} is {{the study}} of environmental influences on the health of animals including disease incidence, persistence and transmission. It is a conceptual approach that unifies molecular biology, environmental sciences, and epidemiology for the purpose of identifying causes, classifying risks, and controlling health problems. Ecological epizootiology has been successfully applied in terrestrial systems, but its adaptation to marine ecosystems is relatively new. My dissertation uses this approach to evaluate the role of <b>marine</b> <b>aggregates</b> (i. e., <b>marine</b> snow, organic <b>aggregates,</b> flocs) in the ecology of Quahog Parasite X (QPX), a disease of northern quahogs (=hard clam), Mercenaria mercenaria. <b>Marine</b> <b>aggregates</b> are a ubiquitous feature of aquatic ecosystems, but have no terrestrial counterpart. They have the potential to serve as a link between aquatic pathogens (e. g., QPX) and benthic hosts (e. g., hard clams) in two ways: (1) as environmental reservoirs for pathogens embedded in aggregates; and (2) as vectors for aggregate-bound pathogens transported between hosts. The results of this research include the descriptive epizootiology of QPX disease in hard clams, along with the first quantitative assay for the QPX organism, and data to support QPX as a facultative pathogen. Evidence that QPX is facultative is critical because it supports that once QPX is established in a location, eradication will be difficult because QPX is capable of surviving on environmental resources other than hard clams. In this research, <b>marine</b> <b>aggregates</b> were characterized using underwater video surveys coupled with direct collection of suspended aggregates in modified settling cones. The results provide a starting point for determining the temporal and spatial scales at which aggregates influence persistence and transmission of aquatic pathogens. Overall, these results have important implications for the way in which aquatic pathogens are collected, quantified, and monitored for water quality assessments in shallow-water ecosystems. ...|$|R

The latter role of nitrate becomes crucial in the absence of oxygen. One major aim of this thesis is to investigate the role of nitrite oxidation in oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) N-cycling. Nitrite oxidation was detected throughout the Namibian OMZ and appears unaffected even by non-detectable oxygen levels. It could recycle up to 100 % of reduced nitrate and thereby potentially reduce N-loss. The high abundance of nitrite oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrococcus can likely be explained by their versatile metabolism. While Nitrococcus grows chemolithoautotrophically in the presence of oxygen, it gains energy via organoheterotrophic nitrate reduction to nitrite and nitrous oxide in the absence of oxygen. In the oxygenated ocean of the Mauritanian upwelling ammonia- and nitrite oxidizers appeared to be associated with <b>marine</b> <b>aggregates.</b> An alternative source of nitrite was provided by nitrate reduction, which is likely facilitated by oxygen reduced microniches within <b>marine</b> <b>aggregates...</b>|$|R

40|$|A basic {{requirement}} for allowing <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> (sand) extraction on the Belgian Continental Shelf (which {{takes place on}} sandbanks) is {{that it should not}} result in major environmental changes. However, a tidal sandbank (Kwinte Bank, Flemish Banks), exploited intensively since the 1970 ’s, has shown evidence of significant morphological changes with the development of a 5 m deep depression in its middle section; thus, since February 2003, sand extraction has ceased in this area in order to study the environmental impacts and the regeneration potential of the seabed. The present contribution synthesises the results of the multidisciplinary research, which has taken place in the area and, {{on the basis of these}} findings, considers the need for an efficient management framework, in both the planning and monitoring stages of the extraction. The investigation has shown that extraction has had significant impacts on the seabed sedimentary character and ecology and the local hydro-and sediment dynamic regime. Under these conditions, regeneration of the seabed is not likely in the short-term and, although modelling exercises have indicated possible recovery in the medium- and long-term, this is likely to be inhibited by the lack of appropriate sediments in the area. The results have provided the basis of the identification of a ‘suite’ of criteria, which can assist in the strategic planning/design of <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> concession zones, the efficient management of <b>marine</b> <b>aggregate</b> extraction and the planning of effective environmental monitoring; these criteria are related to considerations on resource location, the nature/thickness of the targeted deposits, morphodynamics and sediment dynamics, biology and ecology and extraction practices. The Kwinte Bank investigation has demonstrated also the need for intensive monitoring schemes in order to identify the morphological, sedimentary and ecological impacts, related to the dredging activities. A critical part of these schemes should be the evaluation of the dredging-related effects, against the background of the natural dynamics of the seabed; thus, baseline information is crucial, as, in its absence, impact assessments are likely to remain inconclusive...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{exploitation}} of <b>marine</b> <b>aggregates</b> is increasing. In Belgium coastal waters, especially the Kwinte Bank is under severe pressure. During the last decade, a “depression” of 5 m developed, due to extraction of sand. Norro et al. (2003; 2006; 2009) and Norro and Ozer (2006) showed that during the period 1991 - 1998 {{the volume of the}} sand bank decreased significantly. In the present paper, the influence of these bathymetric changes on the sedimentation and deposition patterns are studied by numerical modelling, to obtain a first impression of the ability of the sand bank to recuperate from this sand extraction. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, a wave model and a local total load sediment transport model are presented, which are used to investigate the sedimentation and deposition patterns. The hydrodynamic model results are validated using ADCP current data, showing that the model gives satisfactory results, while the wave model is used for operational forecasts of the waves at the Belgian coast, thus being validated continuously. The sediment transport model results are much more subject to uncertainties but the results are in general agreement with observations. The numerical model results show that apart from the extraction of <b>marine</b> <b>aggregates,</b> the Kwinte Bank also is subject to a natural erosion of the top of the sand bank. The predicted erosion of the sand bank is of the same order of magnitude as the difference between the calculated volumetric decrease of the top of the sand bank and the estimated amount of extracted aggregates. This natural erosion of the Flemish sand banks was also found by De Moor (2002). The study therefore seems to confirm that the sand bank is not recuperating from the extraction of sand, but that by natural processes, the sand bank is further being eroded. This clearly raises the question of the sustainability with regard to the extraction of <b>marine</b> <b>aggregates</b> and suggests that the authority should define maximum exploitable quota preventing any irreversible damage...|$|R

However, characterisation of the hydrodynamics of particles and particle aggregates in water is rather difficult {{because of the small}} scale of the hydraulic field, a wide range of particle sizes and the dynamic situation of moving particles. In this laboratory study, an advanced visualisation technique in particle image velocimetry (PIV) was employed to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of settling particles in water. The experiments were conducted in a settling column filled with a suspension of fluorescent polymeric beads as seed tracers. A laser light sheet was generated by the PIV setup to illuminate a thin vertical planar region in the settling column, while the motions of particles were recorded by a high speed CCD camera. The PIV technique was able to capture the trajectories of the tracers when a large particle settled through the tracer suspension, which gave the direct flow information, e. g., streamlines, surrounding the settling particles. Three types of particles, including large solid spheres, flocs of standard microspheres, and <b>marine</b> diatom <b>aggregates,</b> have been characterised for their hydrodynamic behaviours. The PIV laboratory results indicate directly the curvilinear feature of the streamlines around falling particles. The rectilinear collision model largely overestimates the collision areas of the settling particles. However, the available curvilinear model underestimates the collision potentials by one order of magnitude or two for the solid spheres. The collision areas of the microsphere flocs are more than an order of magnitude greater than the similarly-sized solid spheres. <b>Marine</b> <b>aggregates</b> appear to be highly porous and fractal, which allows streamlines to penetrate into the aggregate interior.
