40|$|Introduction The {{occurrence}} of occupational noise-induced hearing loss has doubled from 120 million to 250 {{million in a}} decade. Countries such as Malaysia, India and the US are adopting 90 dBA as the permissible exposure limit. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effectiveness of applying 85 and 90 dBA in preserving hearing thresholds and preventing the development of temporary threshold shifts. Methodology In this intervention study, 203 participants from two factories in an automobile industry were exposed to noise levels above the action level of 85 dBA in Factory 1 and 80 dBA in Factory 2, where the permissible exposure limits were 90 and 85 dBA, respectively. The exchange rate of 5 -dB was used in both study locations. Noise levels were measured using personal exposure noise dosimeters and a sound level meter. The hearing threshold levels were measured at baseline and then followed up at the first month (post-shift exposure) and again, at the sixth month (pre-shift exposure). Data on hearing threshold levels were measured using a <b>manual</b> <b>audiometer.</b> Hearing protection devices with appropriate noise reduction rate were used to reduce noise exposure among participants. The data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20. 0 for Windows. Data for participants were then imputed as per-protocol analysis and based on the intention-to-treat principle. Independent t-tests, Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests, McNemar’s and repeated measures ANOVA were used in the statistical analysis. iv Results As per-protocol analysis, mean hearing threshold levels on right ear of participants at 3000 and 4000 Hz were statistically significantly lower in Factory 2 with exposure limit at 85 dBA compared to Factory 1 at 90 dBA, (3. 17; 95...|$|E
