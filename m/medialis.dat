25|$|The nucleus geniculatus <b>medialis</b> {{receives}} axons from auditory axons. From the cochlea, peripheral auditory information goes to {{the cochlear}} nucleus. From there, through the cochlear nerve, axons reach the superior olivary complex of both sides. Axons from there constitute the lateral lemniscus which ends in the inferior colliculus. Axons from the inferior colliculus constitute the brachium of the inferior colliculus and end in the medial geniculate. The thalamocortical axons from the medial geniculate nucleus end in the primary auditory cortex located {{in the center of}} the superior temporal plane. See auditory system.|$|E
25|$|In {{the grey}} organic mass {{at the neck}} base, muscle fibres are present that have been {{identified}} as belonging to the Musculus sternohyoideus and the Musculus sternotrachealis. Between the sixth and seventh dorsal vertebra a patch of muscle fibres is visible belonging to either the Musculus transversospinalis or the Musculus longissimus dorsi. In front of the right ischium muscle fibres are present running from the ischial foot {{in the direction of the}} femur. Their identity is uncertain: they could belong to the Musculus puboischiofemoralis pars <b>medialis</b> (the Musculus adductor femoris I of crocodiles) but in that case this muscle with (some) non-avian theropods would not be anchored on the obturator process. The fibres could also represent an unknown muscle. In any case they refute a conjecture by Gregory S. Paul that there would be no muscle connection between the ischium and the femur at all. Above the rectum tract a large area of horizontal unsegmented muscle fibres is present, probably representing the unsegmented Musculus caudofemoralis longus of the tail base, the main retractor muscle operating on the thighbone. These fibres are polygonal in cross-section and show the intercellular spaces also. Below some tail base vertebrae the connective ligaments between the chevrons are present, forming the ligmamentum interhaemale, but also some small muscle fibres and some mysterious hollow tubes arranged in a herringbone pattern; the latter perhaps represent the myosepta of the myotomes, the segments of the Musculus iliocaudalis or the Musculus ischiocaudalis.|$|E

2500|$|The nucleus <b>medialis</b> {{corresponds}} to the part which is located medial to the lamina <b>medialis.</b> In the anterior part of the lamina, the oral intralaminar cellular part makes a clear border. This is no more true posteriorly with the pulvinar. Due to their constitution and connection, the two constitute a common set corresponding to the largest mass of the human thalamus. In non human primates, the medial nucleus (often named dorsomedian) is subdivided into several subnuclei. It is admitted that {{this is no longer}} the case in humans, which makes comparison even with old world monkeys difficult. Some subcortical afferences are documented in macaques (amygdalar, tectal). There are no arguments in favour of their existence in humans. The majority of the afferences comes from the cortex, reciprocated by corticothalamic efferences. In macaques, the spatial distribution of the connection was said to be [...] "circunferential" [...] (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985), medial cortical areas being linked to medial parts of the nucleus and lateral dorsal to lateral dorsal. This is also true in humans. The strong interrelation between the medial nucleus and the frontal cortex is known for long. Lobotomies were intended to cut this connection. There are however other mediocortical connections; with the cingulate cortex, the insular cortex and also with the premotor cortex.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{hazardous}} nature of skydiving, {{the greatest of}} precautions are taken to avoid parachuting injuries and death. For first time solo-parachutists, this includes anywhere from 4 to 8 hours of ground instruction. Since the majority of parachute injuries occur upon landing (approximately 85%), the greatest emphasis within ground training is usually on the proper parachute landing fall (PLF), which seeks to orient the body as to evenly disperse the impact through flexion of several large, insulating muscles (such as the medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, vastus <b>medialis,</b> biceps femoris, and semitendinosus [...] ), as opposed to individual bones, tendons, and ligaments which break and tear more easily.|$|E
2500|$|The surgery {{involves}} {{exposure of}} {{the front of the}} knee, with detachment of part of the quadriceps muscle (vastus <b>medialis)</b> from the patella. [...] The patella is displaced {{to one side of the}} joint, allowing {{exposure of the}} distal end of the femur and the proximal end of the tibia. The ends of these bones are then accurately cut to shape using cutting guides oriented to the long axis of the bones. The cartilages and the anterior cruciate ligament are removed; the posterior cruciate ligament may also be removed [...] but the tibial and fibular collateral ligaments are preserved. Metal components are then impacted onto the bone or fixed using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement. Alternative techniques exist that affix the implant without cement. [...] These cement-less techniques may involve osseointegration, including porous metal prostheses.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{anterior}} thigh muscles the largest are the four {{muscles of the}} quadriceps femoris: the central rectus femoris, which is surrounded by the three vasti, the vastus intermedius, <b>medialis,</b> and lateralis. Rectus femoris {{is attached to the}} pelvis with two tendons, while the vasti are inserted to the femur. All four muscles unite in a common tendon inserted into the patella from where the patellar ligament extends it down to the tibial tuberosity. Fibers from the medial and lateral vasti form two retinacula that stretch past the patella on either sides down to the condyles of the tibia. The quadriceps is the knee extensor, but the rectus femoris additionally flexes the hip joint, and articular muscle of the knee protects the articular capsule of the knee joint from being nipped during extension. The sartorius [...] runs superficially and obliquely down on {{the anterior}} side of the thigh, from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pes anserinus on the medial side of the knee, from where it is further extended into the crural fascia. The sartorius acts as a flexor on both the hip and knee, but, due to its oblique course, also contributes to medial rotation of the leg as one of the pes anserinus muscles (with the knee flexed), and to lateral rotation of the hip joint.|$|E
50|$|A {{division}} of the vastus <b>medialis</b> muscle into two groups of fibers has been hypothesized, a long and relatively inline group of fibres with the quadriceps ligament, the vastus <b>medialis</b> longus; and a shorter and more obliquely oriented with group of fibbres, the vastus <b>medialis</b> obliquus. There is as yet insufficient evidence to conclusively confirm or deny this hypothesis.|$|E
