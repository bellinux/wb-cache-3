She found a quick {{successor}} in the active female protagonist of Tibaut's Roman de la Poire. At least one recent publication states that Liénor <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> justifiable claim to being the romance's true hero.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else he <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> career. He briefly thought of pharmacy {{and then of}} journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what to do, when he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Murder, She Wrote, Lansbury {{returned}} to the theatre. Although cast in the lead role in the 2001 Kander and Ebb musical The Visit, she withdrew before it opened due to her husband's deteriorating health. Peter died in January 2003 {{of congestive heart failure}} at the couple's Brentwood, California home. Lansbury felt that after this event she would not take on any more major acting roles, and that instead <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> few cameo appearances but nothing more. Wanting to spend more time in New York City, in 2006 she purchased a $2 million condominium in Manhattan, and in a 2014 interview noted that she also had homes in Ireland and Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|In 1803 {{the seventh}} baronet, Sir Henry Tichborne, was {{captured}} by the French in Verdun during the Napoleonic Wars and detained as a civil prisoner for some years. With him in captivity were his fourth son, James, and a nobly born Englishman, Henry Seymour of Knoyle. Despite his confinement, Seymour managed to conduct an affair with {{the daughter of the}} Duc de Bourbon, as a result of which a daughter, Henriette Felicité, was born in about 1807. Years later, when Henriette had passed her 20th birthday and remained unmarried, Seymour thought his former companion James Tichborne <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> suitable husband—although James was close to his own age and was physically unprepossessing. The couple were married in August 1827; on 5 January 1829 Henriette gave birth to a son, Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne.|$|E

25|$|Little {{happened}} at the BBC regarding new Doctor Who production until the following year, when producer Mal Young arrived at the Corporation's in-house production arm as Head of Continuing Drama Series. Young was keen on reviving the programme, and this interest was shared by the then controller of BBC One, Peter Salmon. Tony Wood, a producer in Young's department, who previously worked at Granada Television, recalled his former colleague Russell T Davies' enthusiasm for the programme and recommended him to Young as someone who <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good writer of a new version. Davies had recently written for the Granada dramas The Grand and Touching Evil for the ITV network, and earlier in the decade {{had worked for the}} BBC, writing the well-received children's science fiction serials Century Falls and Dark Season, which itself contained many Doctor Who-influenced themes.|$|E

[...] Both the blind bidding process for hosting tournament matches {{and the manner in}} which MLS teams {{qualified}} for the tournament were widely criticized. [...] An example of the concerns raised around hosting came from FC Dallas midfielder Daniel Hernandez on Twitter, where he complained about Seattle's home-field advantage throughout the 2011 tournament. [...] Following the final, MLS and U.S. Soccer officials met to discuss rule changes to the tournament's host bidding system and team qualification processes. [...] Sounders FC owner Adrian Hanauer commented on the changes and the possibility of raising the profile of the tournament, [...] "I don’t think the bidding process is going to change the profile of the tournament, necessarily.

500|$|Game {{planning}} {{began in}} summer 2004.

Over 100 initial concepts were whittled down to 20 to 25 that included making the game the third entry in the [...] series or having the protagonist be a Wookiee [...] "superhero", Darth Maul, a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a mercenary, or the last member of the Skywalker family. The decision to focus on the largely unexplored period between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope helped energize the design team. Consumer feedback helped the developers narrow in on seven concepts, and elements from those seven went into The Force Unleasheds overall concept.|$|E
