50|$|The first multi-company {{standard}} for 9600 bit/s dialup modems was V.32, introduced in 1989. Initially V.32 modems were very expensive, but Rockwell aggressively attacked this market, introducing modules, and eventually entire chipsets, {{that brought the}} prices down. Telebit first offered V.32 support in the T2500, which used the Trailblazer/T2000 hardware {{with the addition of}} the Rockwell V.32 <b>modem</b> <b>module.</b> A version without PEP support was offered as the T1500. The later T1600 had basically the same feature set as the T1500, but used Telebit's own V.32 implementation rather than the Rockwell module, resulting in reduced production cost and better performance. Both the T1500 and T1600 had list prices over $1000; at the time a 1st tier product from Hayes or U.S. Robotics (USR) generally cost about $700.|$|E

It is the idea that physical things that we have today, can be turned into devices by being connected to a network. The purpose of these devices is through more sensors and actuators, allow smarter and more robust infrastructure to be built, as well as improving consumer devices interoperability. This thesis will investigate {{the current state of the}} art application layer communication protocols that have been developed with resource constrained mobile devices in mind. It will look specifically at high latency mid-range wireless cellular communication by investigating how the protocols affect energy consumption for an embedded Internet of Things device. This is done with the constraint that these findings needs to be applicable to the fifth generation of cellular networks, as well as extensions to current generation standards. The application layer communication protocols Constrained Applications Protocol(CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport(MQTT) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) used on multiple <b>modem</b> <b>modules,</b> are investigated in a quantitative approach in deductive survey experiments, testing a variety of what is concluded to be typical sensor and actuator scenarios. The goal with the survey, is to ultimately select the protocol that shows to be the most suitable for a project to build a prototype platform for embedded mobile devices in the shape of publicly shared bikes in a city. This prototype is described and its architecture and design decisions are presented and argued for. The survey discovers that CoAP is the most suitable protocol for the purpose of the thesis, and proceeds to show how it is applied to the described platform...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{implement}} the Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) <b>modem</b> <b>modules</b> for the Software Defined Radio (SDR), using different Linux sound Application Programming Interfaces (API's). The FSK modulation scheme, uses coherent detection with matched filters. The modules are implemented using the Linux operating system and the programming language used is C/C++. Simulation is performed first and then followed by implementation in real-time, using APIs. The APIs used are Open Sound System (OSS), Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK) and PortAudio (PA). In real-time two computers are used, one acting as the modulator and the other as the demodulator. The two sound cards are connected by an audio cable. Results obtained using OSS, ALSA and JACK are satisfactory. Recommendations are subsequently made for the suitable API(s). Both ALSA and JACK are the best APIs for the implementation.

50|$|Because all bloks are {{external}} of {{the main}} board, signals have significantly farther to travel between components. This extra distance could lead to noticeable delays between components. In addition, the quality of connection needed would require expensive pins and sockets, and developing a system to allow the user to arbitrarily place bloks without considerable performance loss would be very difficult. The end product would likely be much thicker than today's smartphones, and bloks would be at risk of dislodging from the main board. RF design of a modular phone is also a major challenge. Antennas integrated into {{the main body of}} the phone would require RF routing to the RF <b>modem(s)</b> in the <b>modules</b> and could limit the frequencies on which the phone could operate, necessitating different phones for different networks. Antennas integrated into modules could be less efficient due to limited space and EM interactions with adjacent modules, limiting range.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design and develop a control system using Short Message Service (SMS) and {{wireless}} networking (WiFi) technology to remotely control outdoor security lights in large organisations. The device comprises four main units, namely: the mobile phone or a computer system, the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) modem, the switching unit and the WiFi module. One feature that makes the developed system better than other related existing works is its ability to use two means of control. It makes use of WiFi when the operator is within the coverage area of the network of about 100 m to the device, at no cost, otherwise it uses SMS containing certain codes to control the lights. A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card is placed in the GSM modem and SMS from the transmitter are sent to that mobile number. The module is also constantly checked by the microcontroller unit, processes the information, extracts the message and command from the GSM <b>modem</b> and WiFi <b>module</b> respectively and then acts accordingly. Owing to its simplicity, C programming is used to programme the microcontroller.

40|$|Travel time {{information}} {{is a vital}} component of manyintelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications. In recentyears, the number of passengers travels in train & number of trainsin India has increased tremendously. Due to the increase innumber of trains the train times may be delayed and the passengershave to wait at railway stations. A desirable strategy to deal withsuch issues is to provide better service (comfort, convenience and soon) the notification of location of time through GSM. One suchapplication provides accurate information about train arrivals topassengers, leading to reduced waiting times at railway stations. This needs a real-time data collection technique, a quick andreliable data and informing the passengers regarding the same. Thescope of this proposed system is to use global positioning systemdata collected from trains in the city in India, to show the location. The system consists of three modules: Vehicle section Module,BASE Station section Module, User mobile section Module. Equipped with PC and GSM <b>modem,</b> BASE Station <b>Module</b> sendsthe initialization information containing the train number toVehicle section Module using SMS. The microcontroller basedvehicle section Module consisting mainly of a GPS receiver andGSM modem then starts transmitting its location to BASE StationModule. BASE Station Module equipped with a microcontrollerunit and GSM modems interfaced to PCs is designed to keep trackrecord of every train, processes user request about a particulartrain location out of BASE Station and updates trains location atstations.

40|$|The Autonomous Surface Craft (ASC) {{features}} fast {{development in}} the past few years; however, among publications about ASCs, few discussions are about ASC robustness and especially the reliable operation of the ASC in the harsh ocean environment. Therefore, in this thesis project, a robust ASC that is mainly used for reliable operation in the harsh ocean environment offshore Newfoundland is designed. As the first ASC prototype developed in the Autonomous Ocean Systems Laboratory (AOSL), the main concentration is on reliable ASC electrical and communication system design and the ASC system testing and modelling. [...] The ASC on-board communication and control system implements the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol. External communication with the dock-side computer is built on 900 MHz wireless <b>modems.</b> Four CAN <b>modules</b> are developed to work on the on-board communication network, and many off-the-shelf electrical components were chosen to build the electrical system, which include the Global Positioning System (GPS), Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), Weather Station (WS) and the mbed™ microcontroller. Time synchronization of separate CAN modules inside this CA network is addressed using the presented time reference message (TRM) based synchronization mechanism, and the achieved characteristics are validated using a DPO 4034 oscilloscope. The wireless communication link {{plays an important role in}} ASC testing, and it can be used to transmit the supervisory command and ASC sensor data between the ASC and the dock-side computer. To support this feature, a Matlab based Graphic User Interface (GUI) is designed to work on the dock computer as the control terminal and the display monitor of the ASC status data. A hand controller is integrated into this GUI for intuitive control of the vehicle, and the ASC position can be shown in quasi-real-time in Google Earth software. [...] A hydrodynamic 3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) nonlinear model for describing the motion of the ASC is generated. Two methods, including the Taylor series expansion method and the system identification (SI) method, are used for model linearization. The designed ASC system was validated by some initial tests, and following t hat, the tow tank tests were performed to determine the vehicle hull resistance and self-propulsion points. Based on the tow tank test data, a propulsion system model was built, and these results were validated by sea trials performed in Holyrood, Conception Bay South, NL. Using the sea trials' data, a state-space steering model for the ASC was identified based on the SI method...|$|R
