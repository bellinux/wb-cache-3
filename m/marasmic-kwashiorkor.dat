40|$|RESULTS FROM FEASIBILITY STUDY ON THE SEVERE MALNOURISHED CASES AS AN INDICATOR OF OUTBREAK OF FOOD SHORTAGES IN THE COMMUNITY. Background: Outbreak of marasmus, kwashiorkor, and <b>Marasmic-kwashiorkor</b> on {{children}} underfive {{years old in}} Indonesia have been reported on the late of 1998. Those cases assumed as the impact of economic crises {{since the middle of}} 1997 's. It was stated by the Ministry of Health {{that if there is a}} malnourish child found in one area, the people on the surrounded have been suffer from a lack of food. Objective: The Feasiblity study on cases of marasmus and/or kwashiorkor as an indcator of outbreak of a lack of food consumption in the area surrounding was carried out in the District of Bandung, Cirebon, Karawang, and Cianjur, West Java, 1999. Method: 66 villages were chosen purposively based on a present of marasmus and/or kwashiorkor in that areas according to the result of sweeping to the all areas and month-weighing program (Mei-June 1999). There were 81 children identified suffer from Marasmus/Kwashiorkor/Marasmic-Kwashiorkor. Of the 81 cases in 66 villages confirmed were found 56 marasmus, 4 kwashiorkor, 9 <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor,</b> 12 severe degree of malnutrition, and 4 children was passed out without clinical symptom/signs. The main data collected were M, K, and MK, nutritional status data in Posyandu, and social economic status of the Â household sample of the poor surrounding the cases, and food consumption of the household samples. Results: The results were 16 villages (30, 7 %) as the malnourished villages, although no consumption pattern changes. Marasmus, Kwashiorkor, or <b>Marasmic-Kwashiorkor</b> no longer used as an indicator of a lack of food consumption in the areas. These because (a) Marasmus and kwashiorkor already happened long-time before the outbreak cases reported, (b) Some of marasmic or kwashiorkor children not belong to the poor community. 72, 5 % cases were belong to the children below two years old, and the largest belongs to children below 18 months old.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the auditory evoked potential (AEP) is altered by malnutrition both in laboratory animals and in humans. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether changes in the AEP caused by malnutrition could be reversed by nutritional rehabilitation and sensorymotor and environmental stimulation during hospitalization. Six children aged 5 - 33 months with severe malnutrition (kwashiorkor, marasmus and <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor)</b> were admitted to the Pediatric Ward of a University Hospital. Normal age and sex-matched children from the hospital day-care center were enrolled as a control group. The AEP was tested in an electrically and acoustically isolated room using a Nicolet CA 2000 microcomputer. Clicks of 90; 80; 70 and 60 dBn HL were presented through earphones. The results suggest that malnutrition leads to an increase in wave I latencies in patients with marasmus, and in waves I, III and V in those with kwashiorkor or <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor</b> type at 90 dB HL. At discharge, all but one patient with kwashiorkor showed reduced latencies of waves I, III and V compared to the values on admission. Despite the small sample, these preliminary results pointed out that the process of sensory stimulation used in our study in a properly directed, systematic and individualized manner showed encouraging results in terms of AEP recovery in these children...|$|E

40|$|Tne {{classification}} of protein-calorie malnutrition {{suggested by the}} Well-come Trust Working party was employed in 119 {{children under the age}} of 4 years admitted to Khartoum Hospital with severe malnutrition between May and December 1973. Our findings compare closely with findings from other centres using the same classification. All children were below 80 % of the Boston standard for weight. 58 % were under-weight or marasmic, kwash-iorkor and <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor</b> being 16 % and 26 % respectively. Marasmus the most frequently seen type was common in the second year of life. Males were double the number of females. Hair and skin chnages were seen in over 50 % of cases of kwashiorkor and marasmic-kwashior kor, being much less common in marasmic and under-weight children. Psychomotor changes were found in all three classes. Half the children with kwashiorkor and marasmic kwashiorkor had hepatomegaly. It was found in a fifth of children with marasmus.

40|$|In vitro sheep {{erythrocyte}} (E) rosette inhibitory {{activity was}} observed in the sera of nine out of 22 (41 %) children with kwashiorkor, three of 15 (20 %) marasmic children, neither of the two children with <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor</b> {{and in one of}} 42 (2 %) well nourished control children. Sera of children with kwashiorkor containing the E rosette inhibitory substance did not inhibit in vitro rosette formations by autologous lymphocytes whereas rosette formations by homologous lymphocytes were inhibited. Inhibition of E rosette formation occurred when lymphocytes were pretreated with serum having the inhibitory substance before incubation with sheep red cells, but there was no such inhibition when sheep red cells were pretreated with the same serum before incubation with lymphocytes. The inhibitory substance was observed to be stable at 4 degrees C up to about 1 week and migrated electrophoretically with the alpha- 2 globulins. It was digested by papain. It is probable that the E rosette inhibitory substance demonstrated in the present study is attached to markers on T lymphocyte surfaces in some malnourished children thereby making the lymphocytes unreactive in vitro and presumably in vivo as well...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The protein-energy {{malnutrition}} {{is the most}} prevalent cause of malnutrition and always occures in infants and children under 5 years old. According to {{the harmful effects of}} malnutrition, such as high mortality, inability of learning and decrease of mental and physical ability, reconnoite and study of malnutrition qualification is very important. Material and Methods: This analytic cross-sectional study was carried out on 811 children under 5 years old who were living in rural zone of Arak. Based on health files; clinical inspections and interview with mothers a checklist was fulfilled for every child. Data were analysed by EPI 6 software. Results: In this study, none of the children had stricken with Kwashiorkor or <b>Marasmic-Kwashiorkor.</b> Undernourished were seen in 7. 39 % and Marasmus were also seen in 1. 1 % of subjects. The prevalence of malnutrition was 7. 5 % in Wellcome, 33. 55 % in Waterlow-Stunting, 23. 05 % in Waterlow-Wasting and 30. 94 % in Gomez classification. There was statistically correlation between malnutririon and respiratory infection rate, milstones, birthweight, maturity and begning of helpfood (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Considering the results, the most rate of malnutrition in each classification was mild. It is suggested that increasing of familial awareness is an important factor for preventing from next damages and additional treatment costs. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Severe acute {{malnutrition}} {{in childhood}} manifests as oedematous (kwashiorkor, marasmic kwashiorkor) and non-oedematous (marasmus) syndromes {{with very different}} prognoses. Kwashiorkor differs from marasmus in the patterns of protein, amino acid and lipid metabolism when patients are acutely ill as well as after rehabilitation to ideal weight for height. Metabolic patterns among marasmic patients define them as metabolically thrifty, while kwashiorkor patients function as metabolically profligate. Such differences might underlie syndromic presentation and prognosis. However, no fundamental explanation exists for these differences in metabolism, nor clinical pictures, given similar exposures to undernutrition. We hypothesized that different developmental trajectories underlie these clinical-metabolic phenotypes: if so this would be strong {{evidence in support of}} predictive adaptation model of developmental plasticity. We reviewed the records of all children admitted with severe acute malnutrition to the Tropical Metabolism Research Unit Ward of the University Hospital of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica during 1962 - 1992. We used Wellcome criteria to establish the diagnoses of kwashiorkor (n = 391), marasmus (n = 383), and <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor</b> (n = 375). We recorded participants' birth weights, as determined from maternal recall at the time of admission. Those who developed kwashiorkor had 333 g (95 % confidence interval 217 to 449, p< 0. 001) higher mean birthweight than those who developed marasmus. These data are consistent with a model suggesting that plastic mechanisms operative in utero induce potential marasmics to develop with a metabolic physiology more able to adapt to postnatal undernutrition than those of higher birthweight. Given the different mortality risks of these different syndromes, this observation is supportive of the predictive adaptive response hypothesis and is the first empirical demonstration of the advantageous effects of such a response in humans. The study has implications for understanding pathways to obesity and its cardio-metabolic co-morbidities in poor countries and for famine intervention programs...|$|E
40|$|The Outpatient Nutrition Clinic of the Center for Research and Development of Nutrition (CRDN) has {{developed}} a six-month package with the main objective to improve nutrition status of severely malnourished children in its surrounding areas since 1981. However, {{there has never been}} a study to analyze its effectiveness. Therefore, there is a need to analyze its effectiveness and factors associated with the outcome. A six-month longitudinal study involving of 384 patients with severe malnutrition was conducted from 1982 - 1997. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to analyse the probability of nutritional improvement from severe to moderate or mild malnutrition, while Cox regression model was used to analyse the relative improvement associated with several associated factors. The study revealed that overall probability to remain severe malnutrition (PRSM) for 6 months was 35 % with the median of 12 weeks, which mean that there was an improvement of nutritional status for 65 % cases with the median time of 12 weeks. Analysis of Cox regression model showed that only upper respiratory infection (URI), age of the child, and type of malnutrition were significantly associated with relative improvement (RI) of severe malnutrition. RI of mild URI was 1. 88 times, moderate URI was 1. 61 times compared to cases without URI after controlled by other factors in the model. RI of kwashiorkor, <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor,</b> and marasmus was 584. 06 (the extrem value of RI was probably due to only 5 cases of kwashiorkor), 10. 18, and 1. 46 times than no-marasmus-kwashiorkor after being controlled by other factors in the model. RI of children aged 12 - 35 months was 1. 43 times and 36 - 59 months was 0. 68 times after being controlled by other factors in the model. </p...|$|E
40|$|Malnutrition is {{a global}} health problem that affects infants and young children. It is {{frequently}} associated with infections and commonly affects children in developing countries. Malnutrition is the cellular imbalance between the supply of energy from macronutrients and micronutrients and the demand of the body for {{them in order to}} achieve normal growth, maintenance, and specific functions. Underweight (mild to moderate) and marasmus, <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor,</b> and kwashiorkor (severe) are the spectrum of malnutrition. Various pathophysiological changes, including fatty changes, abnormal rough endoplasmic reticula and mitochondria, decreased peroxisomes, and decreased quantity and quality of metabolising enzymes, are associated with malnutrition which may significantly influence hepatic drug metabolism. However, the effect of different categories of malnutrition on drug metabolism has not been extensively investigated. This research, therefore, aimed to determine the effect of malnutrition on drug metabolism. The specific objectives are (i) to perform a systematic review of the studies of drug pharmacokinetics in malnourished children, and (ii) to use the caffeine breath test {{to determine the effects of}} different types of malnutrition on the metabolising activity of hepatic CYP 1 A 2 enzymes. The systematic review involved literature searches in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases covering publications between January 1960 and December 2009. Articles describing drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic parameters in the four categories of malnutrition, limited to children from 0 to 17 years, were sought using both databases and by reference tracking. Altogether, 42 publications evaluated the disposition of 34 drugs in malnourished children. The drug absorption rate (Ka) was reported for eight drugs, of which gentamicin, metronidazole, phenytoin, chloramphenicol, paracetamol, and sulphamethoxazole showed no difference in the values of Ka for malnourished children and the control groups. The AUC of seven drugs did not differ for malnourished children when compared to their control groups but significantly decreased for carbamazepine (p < 0. 05) and chloroquine (p < 0. 001). By contrast, there was a statistically significant increase in the AUC of six drugs: metronidazole (p < 0. 05), caffeine (p < 0. 05), paracetamol (p < 0. 05), phenobarbitone (p < 0. 05), sulphadiazine (p < 0. 01), and sulphamethoxazole (p < 0. 001). The plasma protein binding of 19 drugs was evaluated in seven in vitro and two in vivo studies. There was a statistically significant decrease in the protein binding of 17 drugs in kwashiorkor when compared to healthy adults (p-values ranged from < 0. 0005 to < 0. 05). Nineteen studies evaluated the effects of malnutrition on the volume of distribution (VD) for 14 drugs. For most drugs, malnutrition had no statistically significant effect on VD. However, four drugs: gentamicin, quinine, streptomycin, and theophylline demonstrated contrasting results. The effect of malnutrition on the total clearance (CL) and elimination half-life (tÂ½) of nine drugs that are primarily metabolised in the liver was evaluated in 15 studies. There was a statistically significant decrease in the CL of six drugs: acetanilide (p < 0. 025), antipyrine (p < 0. 05, p < 0. 0025, p < 0. 05), caffeine (p < 0. 01), sulphamethoxazole, isoniazid (p < 0. 01), and metronidazole (p < 0. 01). There was a corresponding statistically significant increase in their plasma half-lives. For six drugs that are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, malnutrition has a varying effect on their total CLs. The total CL was significantly increased for penicillin in children with marasmus (p < 0. 001), <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor</b> (p < 0. 01), and kwashiorkor (p < 0. 01), as well as increased for streptomycin in children with kwashiorkor (p < 0. 01). By contrast, the total CL was significantly decreased for penicillin in underweight children (p < 0. 01). It was also significantly decreased for cefoxitin in children with kwashiorkor (p < 0. 025). The significantly decreased total CL of most of the drugs primarily metabolised by the liver may reflect decreased activity of the intrinsic hepatic metabolising enzymes. This would suggest a need to reduce drug dosage in malnourished children. More studies are therefore required to assess the activities of the hepatic metabolising enzymes in malnourished children. Following the systematic review, the caffeine breath test (CBT) identified as a non-invasive approach to study the effects of the four categories of malnutrition on caffeine metabolism. Caffeine is a 1, 3, 7 trimethylxanthine compound that is metabolised in the liver by 1 -N, 2 -N and 7 -N demethylation, and C- 8 hydroxylation to 1, 3, 7 trimethyluric acid. CYP 1 A 2 is responsible for the 3 -N demethylation of caffeine. The CBT involves oral administration of a non-radioactive stable isotope of caffeine (13 C on the 3 -methyl group). The caffeine undergoes 3 -N demethylation in the liver which is a CYP 1 A 2 dependent reaction. After N-demethylation, the 13 C methyl group enters the carbon pool as it is converted to formaldehyde, formate and bicarbonate. The bicarbonate is exhaled as carbon-dioxide. The exhaled labelled 13 CO 2 is known to correlate with CY 1 A 2 activity. Fifteen children each who were underweight or experiencing marasmus, <b>marasmic-kwashiorkor</b> or kwashiorkor were recruited from Lagos and Kano States in Nigeria. They were studied before and after nutritional rehabilitation. After ingesting labelled caffeine (3 mg/kg) at 0900 hours, breath samples were collected in duplicate at - 20, - 10, - 1 minute and every 15 minutes over 2 hours. The cumulative mean percent 13 C-caffeine dose exhaled as 13 CO 2 was measured over 2 hours. Studentâs t-test was used to compare the results for each category of malnutrition, before and after nutritional rehabilitation, at 5...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} bacterial isolates {{and determine}} antibiotic sensitivity pattern {{in children with}} severe Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) presenting at the Paediatric Filter Clinic (PFC) of Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH). Design: Hospital based cross-sectional survey. Setting: Paediatric Filter Clinic of Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), a tertiary level teaching institution for the University of Nairobi, Kenya. Subjects: Children between two and sixty months presenting at the hospital outpatient filter clinic with severe malnutrition. Results: Ninety-one children, forty six female and forty five males, were recruited for the study. Of these, sixty had Marasmus, twenty Kwashiorkor and eleven <b>Marasmic-kwashiorkor.</b> HIV serology was positive in 43 % of study subjects. There were 30 bacterial isolates from 26 subjects. Ten bacterial isolates were gram positive and twenty gram negative. Isolation rates did not vary by HIV serological status. Twenty {{one out of the}} 30 isolates were from blood culture. About 1 / 3 of the gram positive isolates were coagulase negative staphylococci, largely resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as Erythromycin, Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Chloramphenicol and even Oxacillin. More than half demonstrated resistance to commonly used oral antibiotics while 80 % of all gram positive and negative isolates were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Aminoglycosides, Gentamicin and Amikacin, and third generation Cephalosporins, Ceftriaxone and Ceftazidime, were found to be effective against most gram-negative isolates. Conclusion: Nearly a third (28. 9 %) of children admitted with severe malnutrition at KNH have concomitant severe bacterial infections; primarily manifesting as bacteraemia. Gram-negative agents are responsible for most severe bacterial infections in children admitted at the KNH, regardless of their HIV serological status. Whenever possible, blood culture {{should be included in the}} initial septic screening of severely malnourished children at KNH. In the absence of culture and sensitivity information, ciprofloxacin should be considered among the first line options in the empirical treatment of severe bacterial infections among these children. Clinical trials to further evaluate in-vivo effectiveness of various single or combination antibiotics are recommended...|$|E
