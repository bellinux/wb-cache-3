[...] In effect, if the mechanism is based on piezoelectricity or electrical charging of crystal deformations with the signal traveling along faults, then none of the earthquakes which VAN claimed were preceded by SES generated an SES themselves. VAN answered that such an {{analysis of the}} SES propagation properties is based on a simplified model of horizontally layered Earth and that this differs greatly from the real situation since Earth's crust contains inhomogeneities. When the latter are taken into account, for example by considering that the faults are electrically appreciably more conductive than the surrounding <b>medium,</b> <b>VAN</b> believes that electric signals transmitted at distances of the order of one hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station have amplitudes comparable to those reported by VAN. Susan Hough noted that this amounted to special pleading, making VAN's hypothesis un-falsifiable because it relies on unrepeatable circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|The story {{launches}} in medias res, as Van Helsing {{jumps into}} action through a window. We {{see a woman}} floating in the air, reminding {{him that he had}} not slept in 52 hours. The story then begins in full, and we find Van Helsing inside Notre Dame de Paris, just after the murder of Mr. Hyde. He is found guilty by the authorities but is given the opportunity of escape by the priests. Van Helsing then proceeds to escape through the sewers to stay at a secluded room. During the night he hears a scream and ventures to track it down. We are taken to where the comic began, revealing the floating woman as a medium. She is dragged towards a chimney as Van Helsing gives chase. He tries to help the woman by attacking with his tojo blades and releases her, only to see woman grabbed once more by the invisible force. It throws both her and Van Helsing through a window. The woman is killed in the fall, and Van Helsing is once again hunted by the authorities. Undaunted, he proceeds to chase the invisible force, guided by screams and destruction left in its wake. Van Helsing wonders aloud [...] "Why is it monsters never run into bodice shops?", as the invisible monster enters the morgue. The people and the police surround the building, and Van Helsing escapes through the sewers once again, only to find himself faced with the invisible murderer. The monster drags him into the water, and they travel through the canal until they fall into a cage trap. Van Helsing easily escapes, but finds himself between cages and bars, corpses and monsters, and half-beasts and half-humans. He states that he has [...] "finally and fully sensed evil". Documents on a nearby desk reveal that the creature is named Beathán. It says that he was injected with a serum of invisibility (Van Helsing even remembers having heard a Vatican report about an incident of an [...] "Englishman" [...] becoming invisible in west Sussex). Van Helsing learns that he is in the secret laboratory of the Dr. Moreau. He suddenly finds himself with the same, about to feed the invisible monster. They discourse about the creation of the chimeras in his laboratory. Van Helsing states that it isn't his job to kill him and his creations, but he will arrest him for the matter. Moreau, however, is not fazed, and releases Beathán. Van Helsing fights him, first turning him visible with the antidote of the invisibility serum Moreau invented and later with his own weapons. The fight becomes violent as time passes, and the monster, now visible, releases the rest of the Moreau's creations. Van Helsing then proceeds to fight all of them. Through spiritual talk, however, the <b>medium</b> <b>Van</b> Helsing encountered before tells him that the monster is her husband, transformed into a frog-like beast by the Doctor, and that he must relieve the beast from his torment. Moreau takes the confusion to his advantage, and he escapes without being seen leaving his laboratory to be destroyed. Van Helsing and Beathán managed to escape, and Van Helsing briefly ponders taking the beast with him to the Vatican. Finally, he reports that he [...] "put forth all effort in trying to capture it [...] [...] [...] and failed", while in reality he just let the monster free. Van Helsing ends his report stating that he hadn't sleep in 53 hours. We see a final image of Dr. Moreau escaping with one of his creations, stating that [...] "the world lacks vision", and that he should [...] "move to an island perhaps. Somewhere drastic, like [...] [...] [...] the South Seas [...] [...] [...]".|$|E

Resting and budding cells were seen. The overall pattern of indentation of the plasma membrane towards the cytoplasm was well revealed s a spiral arrangement of major indentations with minor ones disposed more or less at right angles. Hexagonally-arranged particles were not observed. Mitochondria were elongated with constrictions at intervals, and the fracture face of the limiting membrane directed towards the exterior exhibited linear arrays of particles. An unusual type of organelle was also present, viz: a membi'ane-limited vesicle with regularly-spaced depressions r "dimples". Pityrosporum orbiculare is a lipophylic fungus responsible for Pityriasis versicolor; it can be grown in culture from skin scrapings (Caprilli, Mercantini, Nazarro Porro, Passi & Tonolo, 1971). Previous thin-section studies o f the fungus in skin (Pi 6 rard & Dockx, 1972) and in culture (Keddie & Barajas, t 969), have established its main ultrastructural features.

40|$|Thesis (MTh (Practical Theology and Missiology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{thesis is}} a {{practical}} theological endeavour that evaluates church preaching {{as a means of}} changing the paradigms relating to communal and ethnic violence in Nigeria. The study critically examines the phenomenon of ethnic conflict and violence to show the magnitude of its impact on Nigerians. The impact is evident in the number of violent conflicts recorded in the Calabar area in the last few years. The interdisciplinary approach employed in the study helps to locate the causes of violent conflict {{and its impact on the}} people of Calabar, on the one hand, and investigating the perception of church preaching and its impact on congregants, on the other hand. In particular, the historical method is employed in the process of investigating, analysing and recovering materials on the causes of violent conflict in the area. Practical theological methods are employed to evaluate the purpose of preaching. However, a sociological approach is adopted in structuring questionnaires and interviews while using critical analysis to evaluate and interpret both the qualitative and the quantitative data. In the first place, the data has proved that economic factors are the main causes of violence; other contributing factors are described as ethnic, political, demographic and social factors. It is noted that victims of violence have suffered physically, psychologically, economically and socially. Secondly, data has also shown that, if re-evaluated, preaching can be used to change paradigms relating to ethnic violence and to inspire concrete congregational change and societal action against ethnic violence. Since this thesis presents views of people at the grassroots, people who are victims of ethnic violence, it has contributed, therefore, to a deeper understanding of the impact of violent conflicts on Africans, and especially on Nigerians. The most important contribution of this research to knowledge seems to be the provision of a model of transformative preaching, which can be explored further by the church. This research effort consists of five chapters. The first chapter is the introduction while the second chapter provides a brief historical survey of the Presbyterian Church in Calabar and the history of violent conflicts in Nigeria. Chapter Three focuses on biblical perspectives on violence, theories on violence, and data analysis of violence in the Calabar area. Chapter Four is concerned with data analysis and the evaluation of contemporary preaching in the context of violence in the Calabar Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria. A transformative model is proposed as a way forward. Chapter Five, which is the final chapter, presents the summary and conclusion, as well as the contribution of the research to knowledge, recommendations and suggestions on areas for future research. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Hierdie tesis is ŉ prakties-teologiese studie oor die rol van Christelike prediking as ŉ medium om samelewings- en etniese paradigmas aangaande geweld in Nigerië te verander. Die studie kyk krities na die fenomeen van etniese konflik en geweld in ŉ poging om die omvang van die effek daarvan op Nigeriërs aan te dui. Dit blyk onder andere uit die aantal gewelddadige konflikte binne die Calabar-area gedurende die afgelope aantal jare. Die studie volg ŉ interdissiplinêre benadering ten einde die redes vir geweld en die uitwerking daarvan op die mense van Calabar aan die een kant te ondersoek, maar aan die ander kant ook die persepsies oor prediking en die impak daarvan op gemeentes. Die historiese metode is gebruik om materiaal in verband met die oorsake van geweld in die area op te spoor en te analiseer. Die betekenis van prediking is prakties-teologies ontleed, terwyl die sosiologiese metode asook kritiese analise ingespan is om beide kwalitatiewe en kwantitatiewe data te evalueer en te interpreteer. Bogenoemde data het eerstens getoon dat ekonomiese redes die hoof-oorsaak is van geweld. Ander bydraende faktore is etnies, polities, demografies en sosiaal van aard. As gevolg van geweld het slagoffers fisies, psigologies, ekonomies en sosiaal gely. Die data toon egter ook tweedens aan dat prediking, indien dit herinterpreteer word, ŉ <b>medium</b> <b>van</b> verandering van paradigmas insake geweld kan wees, en dat dit daadwerklike gemeentelike verandering en sosiale aksie teen etniese geweld kan bewerkstellig. Hierdie tesis verteenwoordig die stemme van mense op grondvlak, veral diegene wat slagoffers van geweld was of is, en dit bied ŉ model vir transformatiewe prediking wat verder deur die kerk in Nigerië ontwikkel kan word. Die vyf hoofstukke verloop breedweg as volg: Hoofstuk een is die Inleiding; Hoofstuk twee handel oor historiese agtergronde van die Presbiteriaanse Kerk en geweld in Nigerië; Hoofstuk drie gee ŉ oorsig oor Bybelse perspektiewe op geweld, teorieë oor geweld asook ŉ analise van die data aangaande geweld in die Calabar-streek; Hoofstuk vier gee ŉ blik op die moontlike rol van kontemporêre prediking in ŉ konteks van geweld in die Presbiteriaanse Kerk in Nigerië, en bied ook ŉ model vir transformatiewe prediking vir die toekoms aan; Hoofstuk vyf bevat opsommende konklusies, asook suggesties vir verdere studie en die implementering van sommige van die bevindinge van die tesis...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This thesis {{takes as}} its subject matter a small field of {{activity}} in South African fiction in English, a field which I provisionally title the post-transitional moment. It brings together several works of literature that were published between 2004 and 2011. In so doing, it recognises {{that there can be}} no delineation of the field except in the most tenuous of senses: as Michael Chapman asserts, such “phases of chronology are ordering conveniences rather than neatly separable entities” (South African Literature 2). In attempting to take a reading of this field, I draw on discussions of the innumerable post-transitional flows and trajectories of meaning advanced by critical scholars such as Ashraf Jamal, Sarah Nuttall, Louise Bethlehem and others. In this thesis, I trace the “enigmatic and acategorical” (Jamal, “Bullet Through the Church” 11) dimension of this field through several works by South African authors. These works are at once singular and communal in their expression: they are singular in the sense that they are unique literary events 1; they are communal because they share a particular force in their writing, a force that resists thematic bestowing. The schism between these conflicting/contiguous poles forms the basis of this thesis. I examine the works of a diverse selection of South African authors, finding in them a common, if discontinuous, seam in their treatment of excess, by which I mean the irreducible surplus that always demarcates the limits of representation. I find that these works each engage a movement towards the aporetic moment opened up by their characters’ experience of the traumatic. To be sure, these particular works of literature are notable for their exploration of ideas of alterity, loss and the capacity for survival in the routines of ‘South African’ lives. I use literature as the primary site of navigation for this enquiry because, as the scholars cited above have observed, literature is often a generator of meanings and a space where complex ideas about identity are explored and played out through the medium of the everyday. I recognise here that in the post-transitional moment, literature’s affective capacity in the world of action is limited – in Simon Critchley’s terms, it is ‘almost nothing. ’ My thesis seizes this almost as the site of exploration. Taking as its starting point the existential question ‘have we learnt to imagine ourselves in other ways?’ I propose a number of positions from which these post-transitional works of literature might be read. The first chapter attempts to give account of the theoretical problem that attends to the reading of that which exceeds language’s capacity to invest with meaning. I use works by Diane Awerbuck, Annelie Botes, Shaun Johnson and Kgebetli Moele to inform my argument. In the next chapter, I explicate the problem of excess via a reading of Mark Behr’s Kings of the Water (2009). I then trace the aporetic nature of Otherness as it occurs in J. M. Coetzee’s Summertime (2009), paying particular attention to the ways in which that novel performs a refusal of meaning. Finally, I read Ishtiyaq Shukri’s The Silent Minaret (2005) as a work that posits the failure of alterity as a launching point for future ethical action. The burden of this thesis, as I see it, lies in the apophastic nature of its subject matter. In embarking upon an exploration of the incommensurable, my argument is for an ethics of reading that seeks to explicate the ways in which literature works by thinking through its affective capacity the better to affirm its performative dimensions. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die onderwerp van hierdie proefskrif behels ‘n klein veld in Engelse Suid-Afrikaanse fiksie wat ek voorlopig met die term “post-oorgangsmoment” sal aandui. Dit bring verskeie letterkundige werke byeen wat tussen 2004 en 2011 gepubliseer is. Hierdie kunsmatige afbakening hou rekening met Michael Chapman se stelling dat “phrases of chronology are ordering conveniences rather than neatly separable entities” (South African Writing 2). In ‘n poging om hierdie aangeduide veld te lees, put ek heelwat uit besprekings wat tans gevoer word oor die ontelbare betekenistrajekte van die post-oorgangsmoment deur kritici soos Meg Samuelson, Leon de Kock, Ashraf Jamal, Sarah Nuttall, Louise Bethlehem en andere. In hierdie proefskrif skets ek die “enigmatic and acategorical” (Jamall, “Bullet” 11) aspekte van die aangeduide veld soos dit uiting vind in verskeie werke van Suid-Afrkaanse outeurs. Hierdie werke is terselfdertyd alleenstaande en gemeenskaplik in hul uitdrukking: hulle is alleenstaande omdat hulle unieke literêre gebeurtenisse verteenwoordig en gemeenskaplik omdat hulle ‘n spesifieke impuls deel, ‘n impuls wat tematiese kategorisering teenstaan. Die kloof tussen hierdie opponderende/naburige pole vorm die grondslag van hierdie proefskrif. Ek ondersoek die werk van ‘n diverse seleksie Suid-Afrikaanse outeurs en vind ‘n gemene, dog diskontinue, soom in die manier waarop hulle oorskot hanteer, dit wil sê, die onreduseerbare surplus wat alle representasie begrens. Ek vind dat hierdie werke elkeen ‘n weg na die aporetiese moment oopskryf deur die karakters se ervarings van trauma. Hierdie letterkundige werke word ook gekenmerk deur hulle verkenning van idees soos alteriteit, verlies en die oorlewingskapasiteit in die roetines van ‘Suid-Afrikaanse’ lewens. Ek gebruik literêre werke as die primêre navorsingsveld vir hierdie ondersoek aangesien die letterkunde dikwels as ‘n genereerder van betekenis dien en as ‘n ruimte funksioneer waar komplekse idees rondom identiteit deur die <b>medium</b> <b>van</b> die alledaagse verken kan word. Ek is bewus dat die letterkunde ‘n beperkte affektiewe kapasiteit in die wêreld van handeling in die post-oorgangsmoment besit – dit is bykans niks, soos Simon Critchley dit stel. My proefskrif betrek hierdie bykans as brandpunt vir die ondersoek. Ek stel verskeie posisies voor vanwaar hierdie post-oorgang literêre werke gelees kan word deur die beantwoording van die eksistensiële vraag of ons geleer het om onsself op ander maniere te verbeel as uitgangspunt te gebruik. Die eerste hoofstuk poog om die teoretiese probleem te omskryf wat ontstaan as ‘n mens probeer om die oorskot van taal se betekenisgewende vermoë te lees. In die daaropvolgende hoofstuk belig ek die probleem van oorskot deur Mark Behr se Kings of the Water (2009) te lees. Daarna skets ek die aporetiese aard van Andersheid soos dit in JM Coetzee se Summertime (2009) voorkom, deur spesifiek ook aandag te skenk aan die maniere waarop die roman ‘n weiering van betekenis aanbied. Laastens lees ek Ishtiyaq Shukri se The Silent Minaret (2005) as ‘n werk wat die mislukking van alteriteit as ‘n beginpunt gebruik om toekomstige etiese handelings te rig. Die hooftema van hierdie proefskrif lê myns insiens in die apofastiese aard van die onderwerpsmateriaal. Deur ‘n ondersoek na die onmeetbare te onderneem, staan ek ook ‘n bevrydings-etiek van lees voor wat poog om die manier waarop literêre tekste werk te verhelder deur die affektiewe vermoë van literêre tekste te bedink...|$|E

Critical buckling load with the corresponding mode is obtained for multi-walled carbon nanotubes under combined torsion and axial loading, with various values of the radius to thickness ratio and surrounded with different elastic media. The study indicates that the buckling mode (m,n) of an embedded multi-walled carbon nanotube under combined torsion and axial loading is unique and it {{is different from that}} with axial compression only. New features for the buckling of an embedded multi-walled carbon nanotube under combined torsion and axial loading and the meaningful numerical results are useful in the design of nanodrive device, nanotorsional oscillator and rotational actuators, where multi-walled carbon nanotubes act as basic elements...|$|R

This method consists of using an {{equation of state}} of the gas, the cumulative volume distribution (CVD) of the porous <b>medium,</b> and a <b>van</b> der Waals-Platteeuw-type thermodynamic model that includes a capillary term. The proposed method was tested to predict the heating curves for methane hydrate dissociation in a mesoporous silica glass for saturated conditions (liquid volume = pore volume) and for a fractional conversion of water to hydrate of 1 (100 % of the available water was converted to hydrate). The shape factor (F) of the hydrate-water interface was found equal to 1, supporting a cylindrical shape for the hydrate particles during hydrate dissociation. Using F = 1, it has been possible to predict the heating curve for different ranges of pressure and temperature. The excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental heating curves supports the validity of our approach...|$|R
30|$|It {{is logical}} that {{particles}} {{larger than the}} pore size would be easily removed by mechanical filtration that is termed as sieving, straining, or size exclusion. In addition, adsorption and attraction mechanisms are also observed in depth filtration, where particles are adsorbed by the electrokinetic force or surface affinity. Relatively large particles impact the filter medium through inertia, and relatively small particles impact through random Brownian motion. In these processes, particles are finally adsorbed on the filter <b>medium</b> by the <b>van</b> der Waals force or the interaction in the electric double layers (EDLs) of the surfaces (Mahmoud et al. 2010). However, the removal of particles smaller than the pore size and microorganisms like total coliform (TC) and general bacteria (GB) is less intuitive. In this case, an electrokinetic effect in charge-modified depth filter media {{would be able to}} remove these submicron particles, colloidal materials, and insoluble contaminants (Loo et al. 2012). Natural particles and colloids in water usually have a negative surface charge. Therefore, if filter media have an opposite surface charge against particles in water, the particle removal performances of the system will be enhanced (Keller et al. 2010; Ghernaout and Ghernaout 2012).|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Seeking to {{navigate}} and explore diasporic identity, {{as reflected in}} and by transatlantic narrative spaces, this thesis looks to three very different novels birthed out of the Atlantic context (at different points of the Atlantic triangle and at different moments in history) : Our Sister Killjoy or Reflections from a Black-eyed Squint (1977) by Ama Ata Aidoo, The Chosen Place, The Timeless People (1969) by Paule Marshall and Crossing the River (1993) by Caryl Phillips. Recognising the weight of location – cultural, geographic, temporal – on the literary construction of transatlantic identity, this thesis traces {{the way in which}} Aidoo, Marshall and Phillips use fictional texts as tools for grappling with ideas of home and belonging in a world of displacement, fracture and (ex) change. Uncovering the impact of roots, as well as routes (rupta via) on the realisation of identity for the diasporic subject, this study reveals and wrestles with various narrative portrayals of the diasporic condition (a profoundly human condition). Our Sister Killjoy presents identity as inherently imbricated with nationalism and pan-Africanism, whereas The Chosen Place presents identity as tidalectic, caught in the interstices between western and African subjectivities. In Crossing the River on the other hand, diasporic identification is constructed as transnational, fractal and perpetually in-process. This study argues that {{in the absence of an}} established sense of terra firma the respective authors actively construct home through narrative, resulting in what Erica L. Johnson has described as terragraphica. In this way, each novel is perceived and explored as a particular terragraphica as well as a fictional lieux de mémoire (to borrow Pierre Nora’s conception of “sites of memory”). Using the memories of transatlantic characters as (broken) windows through which to view history, as well as filters through which the present can be understood (or refracted), are techniques that Aidoo, Marshall and Phillips employ (although, Aidoo’s use of memory is less obvious). Tapping into various sites of memory in the lives of the fictional characters, the novels themselves become mediums of remembering, not as a means of storing facts about the past, but for the ambivalent purpose of understanding the impact of the past on the present. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: In ’n poging om diasporiese identiteit te karteer en te ondersoek, betrek hierdie verhandeling drie uiteenlopende romans wat in die Atlantiese konteks, naamlik vanuit die verskillende hoeke van die Atlantiese driehoek en verskillende geskiedkundige Atlantiese momente, ontstaan het. Die drie romans sluit in: Our Sister Killjoy or Reflections from a Black-eyed Squint (1977) deur Ama Ata Aidoo, The Chosen Place, The Timeless People (1969) deur Paule Marshall en Crossing the River (1993) deur Caryl Phillips. Deur die belangrikheid van plek – kultureel, geografies en temporeel – in die literêre konstruksie van transatlantiese identiteit, te beklemtoon, spoor hierdie verhandeling die manier waarop Aidoo, Marshall en Phillips fiktiewe tekste aanwend na om sin te maak van idees oor tuiste en geborgenheid in ’n wêreld van verdringing, skeuring en (ver) wisseling. Deur die impak van die oorsprong op, asook die weg (rupta via) na, die verwesenliking van identiteit vir die diasporiese subjek te toon, onthul en worstel hierdie tesis met verskeie narratiewe uitbeeldings van die diasporiese toestand (’n toestand eie aan die mens). Our Sister Killjoy stel identiteit as inherent vermeng met nasionalisme en pan-Afrikanisme voor, terwyl The Chosen Place identiteit as tidalekties uitbeeld – vasgevang tussen westerse en Afrika-subjektiwiteite. In Crossing the River word diasporiese identifisering egter gekonstrueer as transnasionaal, fraktaal en ewigdurend in ’n proses van ontwikkeling. Hierdie studie voer verder aan dat die onderskeie skrywers tuiste aktief deur narratief konstrueer in die afwesigheid van ’n gevestigde bewustheid van terra firma, of onbekende land of plek. Die gevolg is ’n voortvloeiing van wat deur Erica L. Johnson beskryf word as terragraphica. Vervolgens word elk van die romans gesien en verken as ’n spesifieke terragraphica asook ’n fiktiewe lieux de mémoire, gegrond in Pierre Nora se konsep “sites of memory”. Die benutting van transatlantiese karakters se herhinneringe as (gebreekte) vensters waardeur die geskiedenis bespeur kan word en filters waardeur die hede verstaan (of gerefrakteer) kan word, is die tegnieke wat Aidoo, Marshall en Phillips aanwend – alhoewel Aidoo se gebruik van geheue minder ooglopend is. Deur verskeie terreine van geheue in die lewens van die fiktiewe karakters te betrek, ontwikkel die romans tot <b>mediums</b> <b>van</b> onthou, nie in die sin van feite van die verlede wat gestoor word nie, maar met die dubbelsinnige doel om die impak van die verlede op die hede te verstaan...|$|R

Alcoholic fermentation is mainly conducted by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which metabolises grape sugars to mainly ethanol, CO 2 and glycerol. Aside from these primary fermentation compounds, the yeast also produces many secondary metabolic by-products that are important to wine quality and style. Malolactic fermentation (MLF) is a secondary fermentation that normally occurs after alcoholic fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are responsible for the conversion of malic acid to lactic acid and CO 2 during MLF, which is important for wine deacidification and also contributes to microbial stability. Malolactic fermentation and LAB strains can also influence the aroma profile of wines. The main genera associated with this process are Oenococcus, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Leuconostoc. Oenococcus oeni is the main species associated with MLF because it is able to survive the harsh physiochemical environment of winemaking. Recently L. plantarum has also been introduced as a commercial MLF starter culture. Research has started to focus on the potential of wine yeast and LAB interactions or combinations to alter the wine aroma profile via the production and/or degradation of aroma compounds. The overriding goal of this study is to unravel the interactions between wine yeast and different LAB strains and their impact on wine aroma and flavour. The first aim was to assess LAB growth during co- and sequential inoculation strategies, the ability to complete MLF and the impact on the production of aroma compounds in combination with two different yeast strains in a medium containing full complement of nitrogen supplementation. Malolactic fermentation was successful in the different inoculation strategies and the bacterial combination (L. plantarum and O. oeni) completed MLF in the shortest time. The impact of the bacterial strains on the modification of aroma compounds was bigger in co- than sequential inoculation. A general increase in total esters (contributing to the fruity character of wines) especially ethyl lactate and ethyl acetate was observed. The production of esters, volatile fatty acids and higher alcohols proved to be dependent on either the yeast strain used and/or the LAB strains used. The second aim of the research was to assess the effect of NH 4 Cl (ammonium) and amino acids supplementation on yeast and LAB strains (both in co- and sequential inoculation strategies) and the impact on the aroma profile of the fermented must. Fermentations supplemented with ammonia as sole nitrogen source showed the highest total bacterial growth in terms of cell numbers. Malolactic fermentation was completed in the shortest time with O. oeni and the bacterial combination inoculums. The co-inoculated strategies in combination with amino acids supplementation showed the biggest impact on the aroma compound profiles of the different fermentation strategies and bacterial treatments. A general increase in total esters was observed for NH 4 Cl additions with ethyl lactate and ethyl acetate showing the highest concentrations. The concentration of esters, volatile fatty acids and higher alcohols were strongly influenced by the yeast and the single LAB strains used. The results generated from this study showed that the chemical composition of the fermentation medium and the selection of yeast and LAB strains are important because these factors have an influence on the aroma and flavour profiles of wines. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Wyn is die produk van gefermenteerde druiwe. Die gis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is verantwoordelik vir alkoholiese fermentasies waar druiwe suikers na hoofsaaklik etanol, CO 2 en gliserol gemetaboliseer word. Die gis produseer ook sekondêre metaboliete wat ‘n belangrike bydrae lewer tot wynstyl en kwaliteit. Appelmelksuurgisting (AMG) is ‘n sekondêre fermentasie wat gewoonlik na alkoholiese fermentasie plaasvind. Melksuurbakterieë (MSB) speel ‘n sleutel rol in die omskakeling van appelsuur na melksuur en CO 2 gedurende AMG. Hierdie fermentasie lei tot ‘n afname in die suurheidsgraad en verbeter die mikrobiese stabiliteit van die wyn. Appelmelksuurgisting en MSB rasse kan die aroma- en geurprofiel van wyne beïnvloed. Die belangrikste genera wat met AMG geassosieer word is Oenococcus, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus en Leuconostoc. Oenococcus oeni is die mees algemene ras wat vir AMG gebruik word omdat dit in uiterste wyn toestande kan oorleef. Mees onlangs is Lactobacillus plantarum as kommersiële aanvangskultuur vir AMG geïdentifiseer. Navorsing het onlangs meer begin fokus op gis en MSB interaksie of kombinasies as ‘n strategie om die aroma profiele van wyne te verander. Die hoofdoel van die studie is om die interaksie tussen wyngiste en verskillende MSB rasse en die effek op die aroma profile van wyne te bestudeer. Die eerste doelwit was om die impak van die twee giste op die groei en AMG vermoeë van MSB gedurende ko- en sekwensiële inokulasie praktyke en die impak op die produksie van aroma komponente, in ‘n medium wat die volledige stikstof aanvullings bevat, te bestudeer. Appelmelksuurgisting was suksesvol in die verskillende inokulasie praktyke en die bakteriese kombinasie (L. plantarum en O. oeni) het AMG in die kortste tyd voltooi. Die impak van die bakteriese rasse op die modifikasie van die aroma komponente was groter met ko- as sekwensiële inokulasies. Daar was ‘n toename in die totale esterkonsentrasies veral in etiellaktaat en etielasetaat. Die produksie van esters, vlugtige vetsure en hoër alkohole word beïnvloed deur die gisras en MSB rasse wat gebruik word. Die tweede doelwit was om die impak van NH 4 Cl (ammonium) en aminosure aanvullings op die gis- en MSB rasse gedurende ko- en sekwensiële inokulasie strategieë te bepaal. Melksuurbakterieë se groei was beter met die ammonium aanvulling. Appelmelksuurgisting was in die kortste tyd voltooi met O. oeni en die bakteriese kombinasie. Die ko-inokulasie praktyke in kombinasie met die kompleks aminosure aanvulling het die grootste impak op die produksie van aroma komponente gehad. Daar was weereens ‘n toename in die totale esterkonsentrasies vir die NH 4 Cl aanvulling, veral in etiellaktaat en etielasetaat. Die gis en MSB rasse speel ‘n rol by die produksie en konsentrasies van esters, vlugtige vetsure en hoër alkohole. Die resultate van hierdie studie bewys dat die chemiese samestelling <b>van</b> die fermentasie <b>medium,</b> die seleksie <b>van</b> gis- en MSB rasse is belangrik omdat hierdie faktore die aroma en geur profiele van wyne beïnvloed...|$|R

Thesis (PhD Food Sc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: One of the curious facts about the food industry {{is that many of}} the processes in use today were being practised, in some form or other, by the Roman legions as they marched across Europe and beyond. Certainly they were familiar with the basic techniques of fermentation, and much current research into fermented foods is concerned with understanding the fundamental nature of these traditional processes, and how the individual stages in a particular fermentation can be better controlled. Recent developments in the dairy industry have tended to reflect this pattern and, over the years, my research group has done much to support the expanding markets for yoghurt and similar fermented milks. Our evaluation of the polysaccharide-producing characteristics of starter cultures, for example, encouraged yoghurt manufacturers to match physical properties to the perceived demands of consumers, and most culture suppliers followed this lead by labelling their products with precise designations as to their potential for imparting viscosity to a retail item. Similarly, my group was the first to record the unique physical properties of the concentrated yoghurt, labneh, C 230 g 1 - 1 total solids) that had been made for hundreds of years by draining whey from natural yoghurt hanging in a cloth or animal-skin bag. This detailed analysis of the product facilitated the application of ultra-filtration to natural yoghurt to generate a product with a quality that matched traditionallabneh and, today, factories in the Middle East, Greece and elsewhere are using modern membrane-filtration plants to satisfy a growing market demand. Our success in publicising the attractive properties of concentrated yoghurt encouraged me to devote time to yet another 'historical' concept, namely the apparent 'health benefits' derived by small communities in Eastern Europe from consuming kefir and koumiss. In the West, the flavour and texture of these latter products have never been accepted, but employing similar cultures to produce 'health-promoting' bio-yoghurts opened an entirely new avenue for research. As clinical evidence in support of the prophylactic and therapeutic properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a species of Bifidobacterium became available, so it became apparent that the therapeutic advantage that accompanies the regular ingestion of 'bio-yoghurts' depended on the survival of these microfloras over the stipulated shelf-lives of the retail vehicles. However, no laboratory medium was immediately available for the simultaneous enumeration of Lb. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium along with the yoghurt cultures, i. e. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii sub-sp. bulgaricus. Designing such a medium became a priority for one of my students, and, even today, the procedures that he derived are being used by consumer groups that monitor the performance of the major dairy companies in England. If the improved quality of yoghurts and 'bio-yoghurts' had a major impact on consumer perceptions of fermented milks, the food sector in England gradually became aware of an even more dramatic change in consumer attitudes. Thus twenty years ago, cheese meant 'Cheddar' but, following a 'deluge' of television publicity about the attractions of 'exotic' catering, housewives began demanding mozzarella and mascarpone for lavish desserts, Feta to sprinkle over salads and Halloumi to grill or fry. In turn, exporting countries like Italy, Greece and Cyprus came under intense pressure to increase supplies of top quality products. Local manufacturers soon realised, however, that there was little information available concerning the scientific basis to the procedures employed to make some of these traditional cheeses, and my research group was selected by Funding Agencies in Greece and Cyprus to act as a focus for a series of studies of Feta and Halloumi cheese. The need to eliminate pathogens from the storage brines of Feta cheese without killing the yeasts and bacteria associated with maturation became an important consideration for exporters, and one of my students exploited a novel procedure employing furocoumarins and long-wave ultra-violet light to achieve the desired selective inactivation. At present, the economics of commercial application are somewhat dubious but, as soon as cheap, synthetic, non-toxic furocoumarins become more readily available, the system may well merit re-evaluation. We did confirm, however, that the metabolic activities of the yeasts and bacteria typically isolated from storage brines are essential for flavour development in Feta cheese, and that similar microfloras are instrumental in the development of the important charactistics of traditional Halloumi cheese. In particular, a new species of lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus cypricasei, was isolated from samples of the traditional ovine cheese, but whether or not the species has a unique role(s) in the maturation process remains an open question. Clearly there is still much to learn but, if the activities of my reseach group have added just a little to the scientific background essential for future studies of cheese and fermented milks, then their completion will have been worthwhile. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Een van die merkwaardigste feite omtrent die voedselindustrie is dat baie van die prosesse wat vandag gebruik word, in een of ander vorm deur die Romeinse magte gebruik is toe hulle deur Europa marsjeer het. Basiese fermentasie tegnieke was aan hulle bekend, en heelwat huidige navorsing oor gefermenteerde voedsel is gemik daarop om die fundamentele natuur van hierdie tradisionele prosesse te verstaan en hoe die individuele stappe in 'n spesifieke fermentasie beter beheer kan word. Onlangse ontwikkelinge in die suiwelindustrie reflekteer hierdie patroon, en my navorsingsgroep het oor die jare heelwat gedoen om die groeiende markte vir joghurt en soortgelyke gefermenteerde melk te ondersteun. Ons evaluasie van die polisakkariedproduserende eienskappe van suursels het byvoorbeeld joghurtvervaardigers gehelp om fisieke eienskappe daar te stel wat verbruikers tevrede sal stel. Meeste verskaffers van kulture het hierdie voorbeeld gevolg deur hul produkte so te etiketteer dat duidelik gewys word watter potensiaal dit het om viskositeit aan die finale produk te verleen. Verder was my groep die eerste om die unieke fisiese eienskappe van die gekonsentreerde joghurt, labneh (230 g 1 - 1 totale vastestowwe) te bepaal, wat vir honderde jare gemaak is deur die wei van natuurlike joghurt te dreineer deur dit in "n materiaal- of diervelsak te hang. "n Gedetailleerde analise van hierdie tradisionele produk het bygedra tot die gebruik van ultrafiltrasie op natuurlike joghurt om "n produk te gee met dieselfde kwaliteit as tradisionele labneh. Vandag gebruik fabrieke in die Midde Ooste, Griekeland en elders moderne membraan-filtrasie aanlegte om in die groeiende vraag na die produk te voorsien. Ons sukses met die bekendmaking van die aantreklike eienskappe van gekonsentreerde joghurt het my aangespoor om tyd te spandeer aan nog 'n sogenaamde "historiese" konsep, naamlik die skynbare gesondheidsvoordele van klein gemeenskappe in Oos-Europa wat kefir en koumiss verbruik. In die Weste is die smaak en tekstuur van hierdie produkte nooit werklik aanvaar nie, maar om soortgelyke kulture te gebruik om "gesondheidsbevorderende" bio-joghurt te produseer, het 'n hele nuwe navorsingsveld daargestel. Soos kliniese bewyse van die terapeutiese en voorkomende voordele van Lactobacillus acidophilus en 'n spesie van Bifidobacterium bekend gemaak is, het dit duidelik geword dat die terapeutiese voordele wat saamgaan met die gereelde inname van "bio-joghurts", afhang van die oorlewing van hierdie mikroflora oor die gestipuleerde rakleeftyd van die kommersiële produkte. Geen laboratorium medium was egter onmiddellik beskikbaar vir die gelyktydige telling van Lb. actdophilus en Bifldobacterium tesame met die joghurt kulture Streptococcus thermophilus en Lb. delbrueckii sub-sp. bulgaricus. Die ontwikkeling <b>van</b> so 'n <b>medium</b> het een <b>van</b> my studente se prioriteit geword, en selfs vandag word die prosedures wat deur hom ontwikkel is, gebruik deur verbruikersgroepe wat die optrede van groot suiwelmaatskappye in Engeland monitor. lndien die verbeterde kwaliteit van joghurts en bio-joghurts 'n groot impak gehad het op verbruikers se persepsie van gefermenteerde melk oor Wes-Europa heen, het die voedselsektor in Engeland bewus geraak van selfs 'n meer dramatiese verandering in verbruikers se houding. Twintig jaar terug het kaas "Cheddar" beteken, maar na 'n stortvloed televisie advertensies oor die aanloklikheid van eksotiese geregte, het daar by huisvroue 'n vraag ontstaan na Mozzarella en Mascarpone vir nageregte, Feta oor slaai en Halloumi om te bak of te braai. Italië, Griekeland en Siprus wat hierdie produkte uitgevoer het, het onder kwaai druk gekom om groter hoeveelhede, top-kwaliteit produkte te lewer. Plaaslike vervaardigers het gou agtergekom dat min inligting beskikbaar was oor die wetenskaplike basis van die prosedures wat gebruik word om hierdie tradisionele kase te maak en my navorsingsgroep is deur befondsingsagentskappe in Griekeland en Siprus genader om studies te doen oor sekere aspekte van die vervaardiging van Feta en Halloumi kaas. Dit het vir beide in- en uitvoerders belangrik geword om die patogene te elimineer uit die soutoplossing waarin Fetakaas gestoor word, sonder om die giste en bakterieë wat rypwording aanhelp, te dood. Een van my studente het 'n innoverende prosedure ontwikkel wat furocoumarins en lang-golf-ultra-violet lig gebruik om selektiewe inaktivering te kry. Op die oomblik is daar effense onsekerheid oor die ekonomiese implikasies van die kommersiële toepassing, maar sodra goedkoop, sintetiese, nie-toksiese furocoumarins geredelik beskikbaar word, moet die sisteem weer geëvalueer word. Ons het egter bevestig dat die metaboliese aktiwiteite van die giste en bakterieë in die stooroplossing noodsaaklik is vir geurontwikkeling in Feta kaas en dat soortgelyke mikrofloras instrumenteel is in die ontwikkeling van die belangrike karaktereienskappe van tradisionele Halloumi kaas. 'n Unieke melksuurbakterium, Lactobacillus cypricasei, is uit monsters tradisionele skaap Halloumi geïsoleer, maar of hierdie spesie 'n unieke rol speel in die verouderingsproses is nog 'n ope vraag. Duidelik is daar nog baie om te leer, maar indien my navorsingsgroep se aktiwiteite slegs 'n klein bydrae gemaak het tot die wetenskaplike agtergrond wat essensieel is vir toekomstige navorsing, was die voltooiing daarvan die moeite werd...|$|R
