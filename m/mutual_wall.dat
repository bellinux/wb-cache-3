50|$|As the {{cemetery}} plots were quickly bought up {{the cemetery}} was extended on its north side in 1871. A {{second set of}} entrance gates were built on Dean Path, matching the original entrance. Although this section was originally only accessed through this gate the extension was quickly linked to the original section by creating gaps in the <b>mutual</b> <b>wall</b> where no graves existed. This extension is {{laid out in a}} more rectilinear pattern than the original curvelinear layout.|$|E
5000|$|The Turn (Hane) is {{a move to}} {{be played}} when black and white stones are {{standing}} side by side and the player who plays diagonally {{at the end of}} the opponent's group gains an advantage. This play turns the <b>mutual</b> <b>walls,</b> whereby a player can both expand one's influence and press the opponent down. The Turn at the head of two (or three) stones is used to seize the initiative and to create a thick position.|$|R

5000|$|Here, in 1940 {{he became}} the artistic {{director}} for [...] "Interiors" [...] and [...] "Progressive Architecture". In time he became {{a close friend of}} Le Corbusier and not without his influences and reflections, Nivola defined his quite surprising technique called [...] "sand-casting". Nivola then provided works for Olivetti showroom in New York (a famous sand-cast relief <b>wall),</b> <b>Mutual</b> Hartford Insurance Company (Connecticut), Harvard University, McCormick Plaza Exposition Center (Chicago) and Yale University.|$|R
5000|$|Wall Street Versus America (2006) is an [...] "attack, using {{humor and}} ridicule" [...] on the {{morality}} of Wall Street, its regulators and the financial press. The book is critical of hedge funds, <b>mutual</b> funds, the <b>Wall</b> Street securities arbitration process, the New York Stock Exchange, and former Securities and Exchange Commission chairmen Arthur Levitt and William H. Donaldson. The book is also critical of campaigns against naked short selling, and takes {{a dim view of}} much financial journalism. [...] Weiss singled out Bear Stearns in his criticism, and his comments on anti-naked-shorting activists provoked threats.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A fault array in South Australia, {{interpreted}} from a 3 D onshore seismic survey, shows fault traces on the lowermost mapped {{horizon of}} a shale-dominated sequence which outline polygonal cells averaging 1. 4 km in diameter. The cell boundaries coincide approximately with the downward terminations and near convergence of conjugate pairs of normal faults. The pattern becomes less spatially ordered on higher horizons where faults still show a near-isotropic strike distribution. Maximum throws, c. 80 m, occur c. 400 m above the downward terminations of the faults. The faults have a systematic geometric relationship with folds, with anticlines in the <b>mutual</b> hanging <b>walls</b> of fault pairs and broader footwall synclines {{that define the}} shallow dish forms of the polygons. Polygon boundaries coincide with anticlinal ridges on the interface between the faulted sequence and an underlying 35 m thick low velocity, low density, overpressured layer. Although the pattern of ridges defining the polygon boundaries is strikingly similar to experimental spoke and hub patterns formed at the boundaries between viscous materials with density inversion, the data do not exclude the possibility of lateral extension...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the large}} seller's trades were {{executed}} in the futures market, buyers included high-frequency trading firms—trading firms {{that specialize in}} high-speed trading and rarely hold on to any given position for very long—and within minutes these high-frequency trading firms also started aggressively selling the long futures positions they first accumulated mainly from the <b>mutual</b> fund. The <b>Wall</b> Street Journal quoted the joint report, [...] "'HFTs then began to quickly buy and then resell contracts to each other—generating a 'hot-potato' volume effect as the same positions were passed rapidly back and forth.'" [...] The combined sales by the large seller and high-frequency firms quickly drove [...] "the E-Mini price down 3% in just four minutes".|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{how much of}} the top end of the income distribution can be attributed to four sectors [...] top executives of non-financial firms (Main Street); financial service sector employees from investment banks, hedge funds, private equity funds, and <b>mutual</b> funds (<b>Wall</b> Street); corporate lawyers; and professional athletes and celebrities. Non-financial public company CEOs and top executives do not represent more than 6. 5 % of any of the top AGI brackets (the top 0. 1 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 001 %, and 0. 0001 %). Individuals in the Wall Street category comprise at least as high a percentage of the top AGI brackets as non-financial executives of public companies. While the representation of top executives in the top AGI brackets has increased from 1994 to 2004, the representation of Wall Street has likely increased even more. While the groups we study represent {{a substantial portion of the}} top income groups, they miss a large number of high-earning individuals. We conclude by considering how our results inform different explanations for the increased skewness at the top end of the distribution. We argue the evidence is most consistent with theories of superstars, skill biased technological change, greater scale and their interaction. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present in}} this letter the study of a multibeam antenna for {{telecommunication}} networks by using cylindrical electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures. The EBG structure behaves as a partially reflecting surface (PRS) and enhances the directivity of a simple radiating source. We begin by presenting {{the principle of the}} multibeam antenna, and then we present a first version, conceived to operate in WiMAX band [5. 45. 7] GHz. Simulation results of this antenna will show us that the strong mutual coupling between the different excitation sources of the EBG structure badly influences its performance. In order to reduce the <b>mutual</b> coupling, metallic <b>walls</b> are inserted between the excitation sources. Moreover, excitation sources have been changed to improve the radiation performance of the antenna. A prototype of the final antenna is fabricated to validate our simulation results, and the measurements results are compared to the simulated ones...|$|R
