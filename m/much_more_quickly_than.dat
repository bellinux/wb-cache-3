5|$|Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse, {{which were}} {{laid down in}} 1870 and 1869, respectively, were {{completed}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> Grosser Kurfürst. Preussen was launched on 22 November 1873, while Friedrich der Grosse was launched on 20 September 1874. The former was completed by July 1876 and commissioned into the fleet on 4 July, and the latter joined the fleet 22 November 1877. Preussens construction process, six years long, was much shorter than either of her sisters; Friedrich der Grosse required eight years to complete, while work Grosser Kurfürst lasted for a decade. The delays associated with redesigning Grosser Kurfürst contributed to the significantly longer construction process, though this was compounded by the shipbuilders assigned to each ship. Grosser Kurfürst and Friedrich der Grosse were built by recently created Imperial shipyards, while Preussen was built by an established dockyard.|$|E

5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E

25|$|Although {{statistics}} of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s.

50|$|Another example {{occurs during}} {{landslides}}.

25|$|The annual {{global warming}} {{potential}} of tropospheric ozone is between 918–1022 tons carbon dioxide equivalent/tons tropospheric ozone.

25|$|The pear-shaped Takifugu, {{like all}} pufferfish, are not fast {{swimmers}} as they mainly use their pectoral fins for propulsion, {{but they are}} very manoeuvrable and able to hover, swim backwards, and change direction <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> most other types of fish. As a result, they are rarely found in open water and prefer to stay relatively close to the sea bed where they can explore complex environments such as oyster beds, seagrass meadows, and rocky reefs. Nevertheless, these fish are very curious and active, and in some cases even aggressive against other fugu or other fish. In the event of danger, the fish inflates itself by filling its extremely elastic stomach with water (or air when outside of the water) until the fish is almost spherical (hence the name blowfish or pufferfish).|$|E
25|$|Overall, the Northern {{population}} was growing <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> the Southern population, {{which made it}} increasingly difficult for the South to continue to influence the national government. By the time the 1860 election occurred, the heavily agricultural southern states as a group had fewer Electoral College votes than the rapidly industrializing northern states. Abraham Lincoln was able to win the 1860 Presidential election without even being {{on the ballot in}} ten Southern states. Southerners felt a loss of federal concern for Southern pro-slavery political demands, and their continued domination of the Federal government was threatened. This political calculus provided a very real basis for Southerners' worry about the relative political decline of their region due to the North growing much faster in terms of population and industrial output.|$|E
5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water.

25|$|Upon {{standing}} for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk {{has a tendency}} to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise {{to the top of a}} container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow's milk <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.|$|E
25|$|The city {{recovered}} from the Great Depression <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> almost any other city in North America due to increased demand for nickel in the 1930s. Sudbury was the fastest-growing city {{and one of the}} wealthiest cities in Canada for most of the decade. Many of the city's social problems in the Great Depression era were not caused by unemployment or poverty, but due to the difficulty in keeping up with all of the new infrastructure demands created by rapid growth — for example, employed mineworkers sometimes ended up living in boarding houses or makeshift shanty towns, because demand for new housing was rising faster than supply. Between 1936 and 1941, the city was ordered into receivership by the Ontario Municipal Board. Another economic slowdown affected the city in 1937, but the city's fortunes rose again with wartime demands during the Second World War. The Frood Mine alone accounted for 40 percent of all the nickel used in Allied artillery production during the war. After the end of the war, Sudbury was in a good position to supply nickel to the United States government when it decided to stockpile non-Soviet supplies during the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|Although {{in theory}} all 18F-FDG is metabolized as above with a {{radioactivity}} elimination half-life of 110 minutes (the {{same as that}} of fluorine-18), clinical {{studies have shown that the}} radioactivity of 18F-FDG partitions into two major fractions. About 75% of the fluorine-18 activity remains in tissues and is eliminated with a half-life of 110 minutes, presumably by decaying in place to O-18 to form 18O-glucose-6-phosphate, which is non-radioactive (this molecule can soon be metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, after nuclear transmutation of the fluorine to oxygen ceases to prevent metabolism). Another fraction of 18F-FDG, representing about 20% of the total fluorine-18 activity of an injection, is eliminated renally by two hours after a dose of 18F-FDG, with a rapid half-life of about 16 minutes (this portion makes the renal-collecting system and bladder prominent in a normal PET scan). This short biological half-life indicates that this 20% portion of the total fluorine-18 tracer activity is eliminated pharmacokinetically (through the renal system) <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> the isotope itself can decay. The rapidity also suggests that some of this 18F is no longer attached to glucose, since low concentrations of glucose in the blood are retained by the normal kidney and not passed into the urine. Because of this rapidly excreted urine 18F, the urine of a patient undergoing a PET scan may therefore be especially radioactive for several hours after administration of the isotope.|$|E

The rising temperatures of the equator then created a second split, into northern and southern groups, preventing them from interbreeding.
