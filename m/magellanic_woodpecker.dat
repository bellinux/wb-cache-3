5|$|Group-living species {{tend to be}} {{communal}} group breeders. In {{addition to}} these species, a number of species may join mixed-species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds, although they tend {{to stay at the}} edges of these groups. Joining these flocks allows woodpeckers to decrease their anti-predator vigilance and increase their feeding rate. Woodpeckers are diurnal, roosting at night inside holes and crevices. In many species the roost will become the nest-site during the breeding season, but in some species they have separate functions; the grey-and-buff woodpecker makes several shallow holes for roosting which are quite distinct from its nesting site. Most birds roost alone and will oust intruders from their chosen site, but the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and acorn woodpecker are cooperative roosters.|$|E

50|$|Native {{bird species}} include the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Campephilus magellanicus), Patagonian sierra-finch (Phrygilus patagonicus), Patagonian mockingbird (Mimus patagonicus), and Andean condor (Vultur gryphus).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> inhabit mature Nothofagus and Nothofagus-Austrocedrus forests, {{where they}} feed mainly on wood-boring grubs and adult beetles (Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) {{as well as}} spiders. Occasionally, other foods may {{supplement}} the diet, including sap and fruits as well as small reptiles, bats and the eggs and nestlings of passerines.|$|R
50|$|The species {{commonly}} co-occurs {{with the}} Chilean flicker (Colaptes pitius) and the striped woodpecker (Veniliornis lignarius) {{but do not}} directly compete with them due to differing body sizes and habitat and prey preferences. These woodpeckers commonly feed in pairs or small family groups and are very active in their food searching; they {{spend most of the}} daytime looking for prey. They generally use live trees, but also feed on dead substrates such as fallen or broken trees lying on the ground, although generally spend little time doing so. Once the snow disappears from the ground in spring, <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> look for prey on humid lower tree trunks. In Tierra del Fuego, <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> forage on decaying and dead trees around ponds hosting the introduced American beaver (Castor canadensis).|$|R
40|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} animals should make {{foraging}} decisions after assessing {{the quality of}} available habitat, but most models fail to consider the spatio-temporal scales at which animals perceive habitat availability. We tested three foraging strategies that explain how <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Campephilus magellanicus) assess the relative quality of trees: 1) Woodpeckers with local knowledge select trees based on the available trees in the immediate vicinity. 2) Woodpeckers lacking local knowledge select trees based on their availability at previously visited locations. 3) Woodpeckers using information from long-term memory select trees based on knowledge about trees available within the entire landscape. We observed foraging woodpeckers and used a Brownian Bridge Movement Model to identify trees available to woodpeckers along foraging routes. Woodpeckers selected trees with a later decay stage than available trees. Selection models indicated that preferences of <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> were based on clusters of trees near the most recently visited trees, thus suggesting that woodpeckers use visual cues from neighboring trees. In a second analysis, Cox's proportional hazards models showed that woodpeckers used information consolidated across broader spatial scales to adjust tree residence times. Specifically, woodpeckers spent more time at trees with larger diameters and in a more advanced stage of decay than trees available along their routes. These results suggest that <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> make foraging decisions based on the relative quality of trees that they perceive and memorize information at different spatio-temporal scales...|$|R
50|$|The park {{provides}} {{habitat for}} the mountain lion, the pudú, a small Chilean deer, and Darwin's fox. Among {{the birds are}} the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> the Andean tapaculo and the chucao tapaculo.|$|E
50|$|Sea birds {{include the}} {{southern}} royal albatross (diomedea epomophora), the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (campephilus magellanicus), the white-crested elaenia (elaenia albiceps), the cormorant, the austral thrush (turdus falcklandii) or Magellan thrush, among many others.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{endangered}} fauna {{that can be seen}} in the Las Vertientes nature reserve includes: Monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), Southern pudú, Puma (Puma concolor), Kodkod (Leopardus guigna), and the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Woodpecker.</b>|$|E
50|$|Popular Conguillío National Park {{is located}} {{approximately}} 70 km {{east of the}} city of Temuco and this trail runs 54 km round Llaima Volcano north from the Salto de Truful Truful waterfall to the Laguna Captren lake. It is possible to see a wide variety of wildlife in the park, including pumas, South American grey foxes, culpeos, lesser grisons, kodkods, pudús, viscachas and coypos. Birds living in the area include eagles, condors and <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} mainly pure black, {{with a white}} wing patch and a grey, chisel-like beak. Males have a crimson head and crest. Females have a mainly black head, {{but there is an}} area of red {{coloration}} near the base of the bill. Juvenile <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> resemble females of the species, but have a smaller crest and have a browner tinge to their plumage. In its range, this bird is unmistakable in appearance.|$|R
50|$|Animals include river otters (Lontra longicaudis), {{southern}} Andean huemuls (Hippocamelus bisulcus), pudus (small deer), foxes, cougars, guanacos and maras. Huillin (Lontra provocax), {{an endangered}} native otter, {{has been reported}} in the park. Birds reported include <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> green austral parakeets, geese, ducks, swans, blue-eyed cormorants, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) and green-backed firecrowns (Saphonoides sephaniodes). Amphibian fauna reported are Hylorina sylvatica and Bufo spinolosus. Five genera and 32 species of Simuliidae (black fly) have been recorded. These genera are Cnesia, Cnesiamima, Gigantodax, Paraustrasimulium, and Simulium (Pternaspatha), a subgenus of Simulium with 19 species; these account for 57% of the Simuliidae fauna found in Argentina.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Magellanic</b> <b>{{woodpecker}}</b> (Campephilus magellanicus) is a {{very large}} woodpecker found along the Andes of Chile and southwestern Argentina; it is resident within its range. This species is the southern-most example of the genus Campephilus, which includes the famous ivory-billed woodpecker (C. principalis).|$|E
50|$|The park {{is also a}} birdwatching {{destination}} with sitings of {{the torrent}} duck (pato correntino), the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (carpintero negro), the Chilean pigeon (torcaza), the hued-hued (huet-huet), the Andean condor, the great grebe (huala), the house wren (chercán) and the buff-necked ibis (bandurria).|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the species}} is listed as of Least Concern but {{population}} reductions have been reported. Forest loss and fragmentation are affecting the temperate forests of southern South America at an increasing rate, so these practices also represent a threat for the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The distribution of the species has contracted and was fragmented {{as a consequence of}} native forest clearance, especially in south-central Chile, where the species now is restricted to protected and relict areas. Changes in structural forest components after timber extraction, forest conversion to exotic plantations, and fragmentation due to forest clearance are the main threats to <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> populations. The species is protected from hunting in both Chile and Argentina where is not or very rarely illegally hunted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is 36 to 45 cm in length. Males of {{this species}} weigh 312-363 g (11-13 oz), and females weigh 276-312 g (9.7-11 oz). Among {{standard}} measurements, the wing chord is 20.5 to 23 cm, the tail is 13.9 to 16.8 cm, the bill is 4.3 to 6 cm and the tarsus is 3.3 to 3.9 cm. They are the largest South American woodpeckers {{and one of the}} largest woodpeckers in the world. Among the species known to be extant, only the non-neotropical members of the Dryocopus genus and the great slaty woodpeckers (Mulleripicus pulverulentus) are larger-bodied. With the likely extinction of the Ivory-billed and imperial woodpeckers (Campephilus imperialis), the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is the largest remaining member of the Campephilus genus.|$|E
50|$|The park {{contains}} breeding {{populations of}} 15 {{bird of prey}} species and two others are likely reproducing here. Among them are Andean condor, black-chested buzzard-eagle, rufous-tailed hawk, cinereous harrier, chimango caracara, magellanic horned owl, austral pygmy-owl, to name but a few. Other birds occurring in the park include the Chilean flamingo, Darwin's rhea, coscoroba swan, black-necked swan, <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> Magellan goose, and black-faced ibis.|$|E
50|$|Several {{potential}} predators are known, being {{almost exclusively}} avian raptors. These include white-throated hawks (Buteo albigula), variable hawks (Buteo polyosoma), bicolored hawks (Accipiter bicolor), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) and southern crested caracaras (Caracara plancus) (the latter {{most likely a}} predator only of young). When they encounter these potential predators while not nesting, <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> usually respond by being quiet and staying still. However, raptorial birds are often aggressively attacked during the nesting season.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna {{includes}} {{three types of}} cauquenes (sheldgeese) namely, cauquen comun (upland goose or Magellan goose), cauquen real (ashy-headed goose) and caranca (kelp goose), found in open places and beaches. Other birds include Patagonian woodpeckers, notably the spectacular <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> maca común, common maca, heron, pato creston (crested duck), duck overo, corn duck, eagle, southern carancho, chimango. Condors are seen flying on the peaks and valleys of Tierra del Fuego. It is also home the austral parakeet, Enicognathus ferrugineus, a species of parrot.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{wide range}} of bird life, ranging from the black-chested buzzard-eagle (Geranoaetus melanoleucus) and <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Campephilus magellanicus) to the Chilean swallow (Tachycineta meyeni) and the torrent duck (Merganetta armata). Amphibians are {{represented}} by the toad (Rhinella spinulosa), the large four-eyed frog (Pleurodema bufoninum), Pleurodema bibroni and the marsupial Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii), and there are also numerous lizards and the Peru slender snake (Tachymenis peruviana). There are many species of native fish in the lakes and rivers.|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} park (Queulat mountain pass), wildlife includes mammals such as pudú, kodkod, {{and a variety of}} birds species including chucao tapaculo, Chilean pigeon, <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> black-throated huet-huet and thorn-tailed rayadito. The northern sections of the park are home to nearshore wildlife including semi-aquatic mammals as are southern river otter and coypu.

5000|$|The <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> breeds in the Southern Hemisphere's springtime, from October to January. Both sexes {{cooperate}} in excavating the nest {{in a tree}} trunk. The nesting holes are located at differing heights depending on the tree species and local habitat characteristics. The nest cavity will typically be from 5 - 15 m above the ground. Females lay from 1 to 4 eggs, with a great majority of nest containing two eggs. The monogamous-breeding parents share all duties in nest excavation, incubation, territorial- and predator-defense and young rearing. Adults normally breed every second year, a feature not documented in any other woodpecker species. Incubation lasts for 15 to 17 days, with the male reportedly doing almost all nocturnal incubation. It {{is not uncommon for}} the younger of the two nestlings to die from starvation. The young will fledge at 45 to 50 days. After two to three years being raised by and then assisting their parents, the young Magellanic woodpeckers become sexually mature. Successful breeding and pair bonds, however, doesn't usually occur until 4 to 5 years of age.|$|E
50|$|Broadcast 25 November 1998, this {{installment}} describes ways of communicating. A {{colony of}} fieldfares in Sweden deters a raven from raiding a nest by collectively raising an audible alarm. However, in an English wood, all species co-operate to warn each other surreptitiously of approaching danger. By contrast, a sunbittern is shown expanding its plumage to discourage {{a group of}} marauding hawks. The members of the finch family exemplify how colour aids recognition. Birds have excellent colour vision, and the feathers of many species react to ultraviolet light. Flocking birds, such as sparrows, also have a 'ranking system' that determines seniority. In Patagonia, Attenborough demonstrates the effectiveness of sound: he summons a <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> by knocking on a tree. The nature of tropical rainforests means that their occupants tend to make much louder calls than those in other habitats, and several such species are shown. Saddlebacks vary their calls so that even individuals from different areas can be identified. The dawn chorus provides a mystery, as {{there is still much}} to learn about why so many different birds sing together at the same time of day. (Proclaiming territory or attracting mates are two likely reasons.) Finally, Attenborough introduces the superb lyrebird {{as one of the most}} versatile performers: it is a skilled mimic, and this particular one imitates not only other species, but also cameras, a car alarm and a chain saw.|$|E
5000|$|The black {{woodpecker}} measures 45 to 55 cm long with a 64 to 84 cm wingspan. Body weight is approximately 250 to 400 g on average. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 22.7 to 26 cm, the tail is 15.9 to 17.3 cm, the very long bill is 5 to 6.7 cm and the tarsus is 3.6 to 4 cm. It is easily the largest woodpecker in its range and {{is second in}} size only to the great slaty woodpecker amongst the woodpecker species certain to exist, although its average mass {{is similar to that}} of the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> of South America. The closely related pileated and white-bellied woodpeckers also broadly overlap in size with the {{black woodpecker}}, but both are somewhat smaller in average and maximal size and mass. The plumage of this crow-sized woodpecker is entirely black apart from a red crown. In males, the entire crown is red, but in females only the top hindcrown is red with the rest of the body all black. The juvenile black woodpecker is similar but is less glossy, with a duller red crown and a paler grey throat and bill [...] The piercing yellow eyes and manic, high-pitched calls of the black woodpecker have made it the villain of fairy tales throughout its range. Their voice is remarkable in that it has two different calls. One is a short single high-pitched note, a loud, whistling kree-kree-kree, done only twice in a row. The other is a screech-like shrill while in flight. Unlike other woodpecker species, the black woodpecker does not have a dipping, bounding flight but instead flies with slow, unsteady-seeming wing beats with its head raised.|$|E

Esta zona, considerada una de las más prístinas del mundo, está sometida a presiones crecientes de conectividad, crecimiento urbano y desarrollo turístico, sin embargo, todavía alberga bosques no fragmentados de Nothofagus. Con una aproximación biocultural a la conservación determinamos que el pájaro carpintero gigante (Campephilus magellanicus) es la especie de ave preferida por la comunidad de Puerto Williams, capital de la Provincia Antartica: Chilena, ciudad más austral del mundo y mayor asentamiento humano de la reserva.

This zone {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} world's most pristine regions and this area is currently subject to increasing development pressures from new connectivity, urban expansion and tourism development. Using a biocultural approach we found that the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> (Campephilus magellanicus) is the favorite bird for the community of Puerto Williams, the world's southernmost town and the biggest human centre in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Although, significant differences (P< 0, 05) exists between the preferences of the sociocultural groups toward birds, all groups agreed in their preferences toward the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> This species of bird was the preferred for {{the people who have been}} longer in Cape Horn: the members of the Yahgan Indigenous Community and long time residents. The analysis of these results as well as the discovery of ten attributes that this species of picid presents which in addition is the largest of South America, have taken us to consider it like a charismatic or emblematic species with a high potential for the conservation of the austral forests of Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. For this previous reasons the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> could be transformed into a symbol or a charismatic species for the conservation of the pristine austral forest.

40|$|Agonistic {{behavior}} in woodpeckers {{has been described}} {{for a wide range}} of species, although previous studies have not reported aggressive encounters resulting in the death of adults. In this study, we provide the first evidence of lethal agonistic behavior between two male Magellanic Woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) inhabiting Patagonia. This species is commonly regarded as the largest extant Campephilus woodpecker. The agonistic encounter was video recorded within the core territory of the dead individual and his mate, a previously banded and monitored pair, as part of a monitoring research on this species carried out during the last 2 years. A week after the fight, we recorded a non-banded young male <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> accompanying the dead individual's mate. This young male <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> is potentially the offspring of the former pair or perhaps a new mate replacing the dead individual. From this observation, we deduced that the previously occupied territory of the dead individual, as well as its breeding role, was subjected to reallocation by competing adjacent woodpecker families. This mortality event offers novel insight into the behavior of Magellanic Woodpeckers and suggests that lethal agonistic behavior likely could contribute to territory plasticity and family structure in this species.

The reserve is located at the southern tip of Chile and includes the marine areas and islands that make up the Cape Horn Archipelago. This is the first biosphere reserve declared in Chile since 1984 and the first ever that includes marine and human-populated areas. It joins a world-wide network of sites in which local communities are actively involved in environmental conservation. “Classifying an area as a biosphere reserve is an excellent method of land-use planning that promotes sustainable development and conveys international prestige upon the area, {{while at the same time}} seeking out and integrating collaboration with the local population,” said Anderson. “The UNESCO recognition highlights the area’s importance for world biological and cultural heritage,” he added, “and provides a framework for administration that helps to ensure both sustainable and equitable development for the area’s residents as well as natural resource conservation. ” Anderson is a student in UGA’s Institute of Ecology, currently completing his doctoral dissertation about the effects of introduced beavers on stream ecosystems in Cape Horn. He has worked in Chile since 1999 and was a Fulbright Scholar and National Security Education Program Boren Fellow to Chile in 2003. Harcha is a Chilean Fulbright Scholar currently studying international law with emphasis on the Antarctic Treaty at the Dean Rusk Center - International, Comparative and Graduate Legal Studies. In the fall, he will begin the certificate program in conservation ecology at the university’s Institute of Ecology. Formerly, he was the attorney for the Chilean Antarctic Province. The new Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve is the homeland of the native Yahgan people, the world’s southernmost ethnic group for 7, 000 years, but which now is threatened with cultural extinction. In addition, these are the world’s southernmost forest ecosystems with such imperiled species as the giant <b>Magellanic</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Campephilus magellanicus) and the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), the world’s largest flying bird. The awe-inspiring landscape, known best as a graveyard for sailing ships, was also a proving ground for Charles Darwin as a young naturalist aboard the Beagle and was pivotal to the formulation of his concept of evolution by natural selection. Today, Eduardo Barros, the provincial governor, describes the area as “luminous” because of the unique qualities of light that mix and reflect off the beryl blue glaciers, the slate gray sea, the gleaming white summits and the verdant green forests and mosses. It is precisely this mixture of the region’s geographical, historical, cultural, scientific and ecological singularities that has merited recognition by UNESCO, but which was made possible only through the efforts of dedicated scientists and public officials who have agreed through the application process to fulfill the goals of a biosphere reserve, which include: * Conservation – to contribute to the conservation of landscapes, ecosystems, species and genetic variation; * Development – to foster economic and human development, which is socioculturally and ecologically sustainable; * Logistics – to provide support for research, monitoring, education and information exchange related to local, national and global issues of conservation and development. Both Anderson and Harcha have served as leading members of the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve Initiative Steering Committee since 2002 in conjunction with the Omora Ethnobotanical Park (www. omora. org), which spearheaded the designation process. Other UGA activities in the Cape Horn area have also included the projects of three undergraduate interns and two CURO Fellows’ honors theses at the Omora Park. The newly approved UGA Antarctic study abroad program also will pass through the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve on its maiden voyage to the white continent this December. Each year the Fulbright Program awards more than 1, 100 grants to U. S. and international students with the goal of promoting greater understanding between the United States and the people of other countries. The work of UGA’s Fulbright scholars in the Chilean Cape Horn Archipelago demonstrates that these activities can have concrete and lasting results.
