500|$|UNCRO was criticised {{for several}} reasons. The Secretary-General's Report to the Council {{described}} {{the failures of}} UNPROFOR, but the new mission did not address them. There were insufficient troops, having been reduced from UNPROFOR levels by the new mission mandate, and inadequate human and material resources {{to carry out the}} <b>mission</b> <b>tasks.</b> As a result, fulfilment of the mission mandate was nearly impossible. While Croatian sources said that the [...] mission name was the only real difference from UNPROFOR, the RSK authorities were not satisfied with the UNCRO mission. Specifically, the RSK objected to the deployment of UNCRO troops along the international borders and to the mission name. Conversely, Croats were pleased that the mission acronym appeared to be an abbreviation of Croatia. In response, Czech UNCRO troops used vehicle licence plates bearing the new mission's acronym when operating in HV-controlled territory and UNPROFOR plates in areas held by the ARSK due to safety concerns.|$|E

5|$|Just Cause 2 is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} players control Rico Rodriguez, a major {{operative}} of the Agency, {{in an effort to}} overthrow the island dictatorship of Panau: an open world for players to explore. The game has three types of missions. Agency missions advance the story and are the game's main campaign; faction <b>missions</b> <b>task</b> players to assist the game's three factions, and stronghold <b>missions</b> <b>task</b> players to infiltrate government bases and liberate them for the factions. To advance through the campaign missions a player must earn chaos points, a progression system introduced in the game. Players earn chaos points for completing missions and destroying designated government property. As the number of chaos points increases, the factions gain influence and the government begins to collapse. In addition to typical missions, Just Cause 2 has race challenges which give players cash.|$|R

50|$|Additionally, the {{aircraft}} has other mission capabilities like {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF), electronic and communication support measures, C-band line-of-sight and Ku-band SATCOM datalinks, etc., {{similar to those}} on the AWACS and CAEW systems. The important modes of operation of the primary radar system are the surface surveillance and the air surveillance. The sensor has the abilities to search, track-while-scan, priority tracking, high performance tracking, etc. In priority tracking, the targets will be placed in full track mode even if these cross the primary surveillance area. In high performance tracking, additional measurements will be made to improve the tracking accuracy. Utilising active aperture technology, the radar provides a fast-beam agile system that can operate in several modes concurrently. Inter-operability with AWACS, other AEW&C aircraft, fighters and ground-exploitation stations is ensured using the data-links with voice and data channels. The aircraft cabin houses five operator work stations to adequately meet requirements of the operational <b>mission</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|E

The ATV-CC has a direct communication line with the Columbus Control Center (Col-CC) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. Col-CC provides ATV-CC with access to both the NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System and the European Artemis communication networks in order to communicate with both the ATV and the ISS. The ATV-CC coordinated its actions with NASA's Christopher C.

WBIL participants are not required to have security clearances to perform their collection activities. The IC and the DoD benefit from this because WBIL participants support low-level IC and DoD <b>mission</b> <b>tasking,</b> thus allowing fully cleared personnel to concentrate on high-level, <b>mission</b> critical <b>tasking.</b>|$|R
