5|$|This {{proved a}} very {{suitable}} and happy connexion, my wife {{being a woman}} of an excellent understanding, much improved by reading, of great fortitude and strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affectionate and generous; feeling strongly for others, and little for herself. Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern of that kind, which allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> all my time to the prosecution of my studies, and the other duties of my station.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> {{you an idea of}} the surprise and consternation experienced by all on the receipt of the order to sail. Indeed, that surprise is well justified, for nothing can be expected of this expedition except the total destruction of the fleet or its hasty and demoralized return.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} a {{research}} study on synthetic lethality in cancer. Synthetic lethality appears when a mutation in a single gene {{has no effect on}} the function of a cell but a mutation in an additional gene leads to cell death. This study aimed to find novel methods of treating cancer through blocking the lethality of drugs. GeneCards was used when comparing data of a given target gene with all possible genes. In this process, the annotation sharing score was calculated using GeneDecks Partner Hunter (now called Genes Like <b>Me)</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> paralogy. Inactivation targets were be extracted after the microarray experiments of resistant and non-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines.|$|E

5000|$|According to the 9/11 Commission Report, {{after the}} plane's voice data {{recorder}} was recovered, it revealed pounding and crashing sounds against the cockpit door and shouts and screams in English. [...] "Let's get them!" [...] a passenger cries. A hijacker shouts, [...] "Allahu akbar". Jarrah repeatedly pitched {{the plane to}} knock passengers off their feet, but the passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey! <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> me." [...] The plane crashed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 580 miles an hour, killing everyone on board. The plane was twenty minutes of flying time away from its suspected target, the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.

500|$|Selma Mayer {{was born}} on February 3, 1884 in Hanover, Germany, to a poor Jewish family. Her mother died in {{childbirth}} when Selma was five years old, leaving five young orphans. Selma later wrote, [...] "Because I lost my mother very early and therefore had a rather difficult youth, a strong need grew in <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> people that which I had missed so much: mother-love and love of human beings. Therefore I chose the profession of nursing".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition's physician, Alexander Macklin, to his cabin, {{complaining}} of back pains and other discomfort. According to Macklin's own account, Macklin told him he had been overdoing things and should try to [...] "lead a more regular life", to which Shackleton answered: [...] "You are always wanting <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up things, what is it I ought to give up?" [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss," [...] replied Macklin. A few moments later, at 2:50a.m. on 5 January 1922, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack.|$|E
500|$|Jay Black from AOL TV {{disliked the}} episode's awkward moments and thought Michael's {{unhappiness}} with Jan {{came out of}} nowhere. Black did however praise Pam's prank as well as Dwight himself, but concluded his review: [...] "A surprisingly weak handling of character combined with fewer laugh-out-loud moments than I'm used to forces <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> this episode 4 Creed number-twos out of 7." [...] Entertainment Weekly staff writer Abby West also critiqued [...] "Women's Appreciation", explaining that it [...] "felt exactly like a 30-minute episode stretched to fill 43 minutes." [...] She thought the episode [...] "only came together" [...] once the Office women performed an intervention for Michael.|$|E

500|$|In October 2000, Mitchell {{told the}} Eugene Register-Guard {{that he was}} [...] "definitely returning" [...] for his senior season. By mid-November, however, he told the Associated Press that he was [...] "leaning to staying, but nothing's firm." [...] Mitchell instead chose to forgo his senior year and entered the NFL Draft in early January 2001. He stated, [...] "I have had a great time, but it's time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> {{something}} back to my family." [...] Mitchell {{said he would be}} quieter in the NFL: [...] "You won't hear no more trash talking from Freddie Mitchell, those are the big boys, I'm just a little kid again. I'm humble." [...] He had 119 catches for 2,135yards and 10 touchdowns in his career as a Bruin.|$|E
500|$|Once again, Patton {{found other}} {{commands}} given priority on gasoline and supplies. To obtain these, Third Army ordnance units passed themselves off as First Army personnel {{and in one}} incident they secured thousands of gallons of gasoline from a First Army dump. Between January 29 and March 22, the Third Army took Trier, Coblenz, Bingen, Worms, Mainz, Kaiserslautern, and Ludwigshafen, killing or wounding 99,000 and capturing 140,112 German soldiers, which represented {{virtually all of the}} remnants of the German First and Seventh Armies. An example of Patton's sarcastic wit was broadcast when he received orders to by-pass Trier, as it had been decided that four divisions would be needed to capture it. When the message arrived, Trier had already fallen. Patton rather caustically replied: [...] "Have taken Trier with two divisions. Do you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it back?" ...|$|E
500|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from the novel. He titled his script Angel Heart {{as he wanted}} to {{distance}} his film adaptation from the source material. While Falling Angel is set entirely in New York City, Parker had {{the second half of}} his script take place in New Orleans, based on the novel's perpetual allusions to voodoo and the occult. He discussed the story setting change to Hjortsberg, who approved of the decision and said that he had considered setting his novel in New Orleans. Angel Heart is set in the year 1955, whereas in the book, the events take place in 1959. Parker explained, [...] "1955 for me still belonged to the 1940s—and, because of the historical pause button of World War II, conceivably the 1930s—so quite simply, setting it in this year allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> an older look to the film." ...|$|E

500|$|A viral {{marketing}} campaign began on February 28, 2012, {{with the release}} of a video featuring a speech by Pearce, in character as Peter Weyland, about his vision for the future. Set in 2023, the TED 2023 video presents a futuristic vision of a TED conference, an annual technology and design event held in Long Beach, California. The segment was conceived and designed by Scott and Lindelof, and directed by Scott's son, Luke. The production was made in collaboration with, and made available through TED because Lindelof wanted to introduce new audiences to the conference itself. Lindelof said that the scene takes place in a futuristic stadium because [...] "a guy like Peter Weyland—whose ego is just massive, and the ideas that he's advancing are nothing short of hubris—that he'd basically say to TED, 'If you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a talk, I'm giving it in Wembley Stadium.|$|E
500|$|The {{story as}} it had {{appeared}} in the London Daily Advertiser had already aroused the public's interest. [...] Fielding had left London believing that he had [...] "ended all the trouble which I thought it necessary for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> myself in this affair", but on his return he learnt that during his brief absence, amongst others, several [...] "Noble Lords" [...] had attempted to contact him. [...] On 15February a reward was offered for the capture and conviction of John Squires and his unnamed associate. [...] Also listed were the locations at which donations could be left, [...] "either applied to the carrying on of the Prosecution, or given to the poor Girl as a Recompence [...] for her Virtue, and Miseries she has gone through". [...] A rather embellished account of the story was later sent to the press. [...] George Squires could not be found.|$|E
500|$|On 4 January 1922, South Georgia was sighted, {{and late}} that morning Quest {{anchored}} at Grytviken. After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton {{returned to the}} ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary. [...] "The old smell of dead whale permeates everything", he wrote. [...] "It is a strange and curious place....A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay." [...] Later he slept, and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty. Shortly after 2a.m. {{on the morning of}} 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. He found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial neuralgia, and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: [...] "You're always wanting <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up things, what is it I ought to give up?" [...] Macklin replied [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you." [...] Immediately afterwards Shackleton [...] "had a very severe paroxysm, during which he died".|$|E

500|$|Nirvana {{ultimately}} chose Albini {{to record}} its third album. [...] Albini {{had a reputation}} as a principled and opinionated individual in the American independent music scene. [...] While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told Request magazine in 1993, [...] "For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce two of my favorite records, which were Surfer Rosa [...] and Pod [...]" [...] Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying. [...] Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album. [...] Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to get a call from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project. [...] Although he considered the group to be [...] "R.E.M. with a fuzzbox" [...] and [...] "an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound", Albini told Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be [...] "the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands I deal with", at the mercy of their record company. [...] Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil. [...] In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the PJ Harvey album Rid of <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.|$|E

2500|$|... 2009 [...] (29 December) – Ebadi’s sister Noushin Ebadi was {{detained}} apparently {{in an effort}} to silence Ebadi who is abroad.

5000|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down. A passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, and pull it down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey!

Harrison said the BBC {{offered him a}} new contract with which he would be financially [...] "made for life" [...] but {{he would no longer}} be a promoter. Harrison insisted this {{had nothing to do with}} his boxing ability and the decision was racist because [...] "I don’t think if I was blond-haired and blue-eyed they’d have told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up my [...] company". A-Force Promotions was re-launched in the USA and Harrison formed a partnership with Al Haymon.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1995, Boehner {{distributed}} {{campaign contributions}} from tobacco industry lobbyists on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.

On January 11, 1890, Short decided to make the match more attractive by writing Richard K.
