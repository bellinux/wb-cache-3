5000|$|The Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is {{modelled}} {{after two}} of Palladino's Fender Precision Basses. The body features faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint, based on Palladino's 1961 Precision Bass while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fretboard {{are based on}} his 1963 sunburst Precision Bass. He has also been known to prefer Thomastik-Infeld flat-wound bass strings.Palladino changes instruments depending on the desired result. String brand and type (round/flat/semi) may change too.As of The Who Hits 50 Tour, Palladino's primary bass is a Fender Custom Shop Pino Palladino model modified with 60s Gibson Thunderbird pickups strung with rnie Ball Cobalt flatwound strings (.043, [...]056, [...]070., [...]100) in standard tuning. The cobalt strings have a great punch and edge not always available with flatwound strings. Experiments in sound saw the brief addition of a Gibson EBO pickup. He also used a Fender Super Bassman <b>Main</b> <b>pedals</b> include Analog Alien Alien Bass Station, compressor, distortion, amp emulator and MXR Bass Octave effect.|$|R

In the summer the <b>main</b> method is <b>pedal</b> laceration; the sea anemone crawls along the substrate and {{fragments of the}} base become detached, each fragment growing into a new individual, a clone of the parent. Under laboratory conditions, an adult female can produce males, females and hermaphrodite individuals in this way.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether sprint cycling performance could be improved using a non-circular chainring (Osymetric: ellipticity 1. 25 and crank lever mounted nearly perpendicular to the major axis), in comparison with a circular chainring. Twenty sprint cyclists performed an 8 s sprint on a cycle ergometer against a 0. 5 N/kg- 1 friction force in four crossing conditions (non-circular or circular chainring with or without clipless pedal). Instantaneous force, velocity and power were continuously measured during each sprint. Three <b>main</b> characteristic <b>pedal</b> downstrokes were selected: maximal force (in the beginning of the sprint), maximal power (towards the middle), and maximal velocity (at the end of the sprint). Both average and instantaneous force, velocity and power were calculated during the three selected pedal downstrokes. The important finding of this study was that the maximal power output was significantly higher (+ 4. 3 %, p < 0. 05) when using the non-circular chainring independent from the shoe-pedal linkage condition. This improvement is mainly explained by a significantly higher instantaneous external force that occurs during the downstroke. Non-circular chainring can have potential benefits on sprint cycling performance...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{helicopters}} {{carry out}} missions in inaccessible hazardous environments. Their performance capability in speed, maneuverability and trajectory tracking must be comparable, if not superior, to manned vehicles. Control laws that meet desired performance specifications {{are difficult to}} design because of the uncertain, fully-coupled nonlinear dynamics of autonomous helicopters. Uncertainties in helicopter parameters not only change {{the dynamics of the}} system but the trim inputs themselves. Many of the current control designs assume low speeds and neglect aerodynamics as well as uncertainties in system parameters. As a result, these linear and nonlinear controllers are adequate at best at hover, and therefore not viable in real plants, as the unknown trim conditions and dynamics result in severe performance degradation even at moderate speeds. For an autonomous vehicle control system to be viable, it must accommodate uncertainties in the trim conditions on-line, the effect of the aerodynamics, and parametric uncertainties, for various realistic maneuvers beyond hover. This thesis presents a viable multivariable adaptive control design methodology that is applicable to the needs of uncertain plants and high bandwidth requirements. Control in the cases where the full and partial state variables are available for measurement are considered. A systematic control design procedure that fully accommodates the aerodynamics of the autonomous vehicle is developed. The principal features of the proposed controller are the following: The multivariable adaptive controller accommodates both parametric uncertainties and unknown trim conditions through on-line adjustment of appropriate control parameters. (cont.) parameters. Closed-loop stability and robustness are demonstrated through the use of suitable Lyapunov functions. Judicious integration between linear robust control methods and online adaptive strategies is incorporated in the control design to maximize off-line information about the nominal conditions and on-line measurements. A two-step nonlinear optimization procedure is carried out to determine nominal trim states that allows the arbitrarily close convergence to the global minima by making use of prior information available about sub-components of the trim states during a given maneuver. The control design methodology is tested on a high fidelity simulation of a Draper Laboratory autonomous helicopter. Extensive simulation studies were carried out, beginning from a vehicle model that includes complete vehicle aerodynamics, gravitational and inertial effects, rotor dynamics, and rotor-vehicle interactions. Five different inputs including the roll-cyclic and pitch cyclic angles of the <b>main</b> rotor, the <b>pedal</b> command for the tail rotor, collective pitch angle for the main rotor, and the throttle are assumed to be present. The controller is evaluated at various operating conditions and maneuvers where aerodynamic nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties become dominant. Simulations are performed on a nonlinear longitudinal dynamics model to track step and sinusoidal changes in forward flight velocity, and a maneuver involving jumps over hurdles. Simulations on the full three dimensional nonlinear helicopter model are performed for vertical flight and coordinated turn maneuvers [...] . by Ashish Samuel Krupadanam. Thesis (Ph. D.)
