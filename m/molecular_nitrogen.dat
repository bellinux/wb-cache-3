5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and <b>molecular</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E

Pa- 1 which was obtained by the treatment of LSA with nitric acid, and Qb which was a product of nitrating acid-treatment were both effective antitumor substances.

Pa- 1 and Pb which came into the same fraction by ethanol precipitation and gel fiitration or Qa and Qb precipitated by the same pH adjustment, were different from each other in their <b>molecular</b> weights, <b>nitrogen</b> contents, absorption coefficients and spectra. 3.

25|$|The {{extremely}} water-ice-rich {{composition of}} Tethys remains unexplained.

This can partially explain why Saturnian moons including Tethys contain more water ice than outer Solar System bodies like Pluto or Triton as the oxygen freed from carbon monoxide would react with the hydrogen forming water.

25|$|Based {{on these}} data sources, {{scientists}} {{think that the}} most abundant chemical elements in the martian crust, besides silicon and oxygen, are iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. These elements are major components of the minerals comprising igneous rocks. The elements titanium, chromium, manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine are less abundant but are still important components of many accessory minerals in rocks and of secondary minerals (weathering products) in the dust and soils (the regolith). Hydrogen is present as water (H2O) ice and in hydrated minerals. Carbon occurs as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and sometimes as dry ice at the poles.

40|$|The {{self-induced}} {{growth of}} GaN nanocolumns (NCs) on SixN 1 −x/Si (111) is investigated {{as a function}} of the ratio of <b>molecular</b> to atomic <b>nitrogen</b> species generated via plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Relative concentrations of the molecular and atomic species are calculated using optical emission spectroscopy. The growth rate (GR), diameter, and density of NCs are found to vary with the <b>molecular</b> to atomic <b>nitrogen</b> species relative abundance ratio within the plasma cavity. With increasing ratio, the GR and diameter of NCs increase while the density of NCs seems to be decreasing. The morphologies and the coalescence of GaN NCs exhibit a trend for molecular/atomic ratios up to 11, beyond which they still change but at a lower rate. The detrimental effect of taperedness of the NCs decreases with increasing molecular/atomic ratios. This is possibly because of reduction in radial growth in NCs due to increase in diffusivity of nitrogen species with increasing ratios...|$|R

The excited <b>molecular</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the N2 molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength.
