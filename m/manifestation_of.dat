5|$|Buddhist teachings {{describe}} {{that the mind}} manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing. The moment-by-moment <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> the mind-stream {{has been described as}} happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain. The <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.|$|E
5|$|Mythologies of both traditions include legends {{about who}} is superior, about Shiva paying homage to Vishnu, and Vishnu paying homage to Shiva. However, in texts and artwork of either tradition, the mutual salutes are {{symbolism}} for complementarity. The Mahabharata declares the unchanging Ultimate Reality (Brahman) to be identical to Shiva and to Vishnu, that Vishnu is the highest <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> Shiva, and Shiva is the highest <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> Vishnu.|$|E

40|$|Infection {{of humans}} with embryonated eggs of Toxocara canis (larva migrans) remains asymptomatic, or results in covert or common toxocarosis, visceral larva migrans syndrome, or {{ophthalmologic}} and neurologic impairment. Though neurological <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> Toxocara canis larvae are rare, toxocarosis remains an important differential diagnosis of various neurological disorders. <b>Manifestations</b> <b>of</b> {{the central nervous}} system are dementia, meningo-encephalitis, myelitis, cerebral vasculitis, epilepsy, or optic neuritis. <b>Manifestations</b> <b>of</b> the peripheral nervous system comprise radiculitis, affection of cranial nerves, or musculo-skeletal involvement. If toxocarosis is neglected, ignored, or refused as a differential of these abnormalities, it may be easily overlooked for years. Early recognition and treatment of the infection is, however, of paramount importance since it reduces morbidity and mortality and the risk of secondary superinfection. Like the visceral <b>manifestations,</b> neurological <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> toxocarosis are treated by benzimidazole components, most frequently albendazole, corticosteroids, or diethylcarbamazine. If detected and treated early, the prognosis <b>of</b> neurological <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> toxocarosis is favourable...|$|R

Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> this system (parole).|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is a <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> the anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women {{and is an}} antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar light is obscured by the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules and the soul loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E

Dhumavati's insatiable hunger and thirst is highlighted in many texts, and has been interpreted as the <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> her unsatisfied desires.|$|E
5|$|During Hygeberht's archbishopric, joint synods for {{the provinces}} of Lichfield and Canterbury were held, presided over by both archbishops. These gatherings were canonically irregular, as the usual {{procedure}} was for each province to hold its own synod. The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear; {{they may have been}} a <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> Offa's desire to supervise the entire southern church, or an attempt by the archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield.|$|E
