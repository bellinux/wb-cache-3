We assume {{the existence of a}} general stochastic (market) discount factor process, which involves market price of risk factors. This way of building the model is motivated by statistical problems, which is the aim of our further studies. Since we are interested only in arbitrage free markets, we derive several sufficient conditions to exclude arbitrage opportunities in the models and we also present examples for the structure of the driving field, in particular, we use Gaussian autoregression fields...|$|R
50|$|Series EE bonds reach {{maturity}} (double in value) 20 {{years from}} issuance though {{they continue to}} earn interest {{for a total of}} 30 years. Interest accrues monthly and is paid when the holder cashes the bond. For bonds issued before May 2005 the rate of interest is recomputed every six months at 90% of the average five-year Treasury yield for the preceding six months. Bonds issued in May 2005 or later pay a fixed interest rate {{for the life of the}} bond (0.10% in November 2016). At 0.10%, a $100 bond would be worth about $102 just before 20 years, but will be adjusted to the <b>maturity</b> <b>value</b> of $200 at 20 years (giving it an effective rate of 3.5%) then continue to earn the fixed rate for 10 more years. In the space of a decade, interest dropped from well over 5% to 0.7% for new bonds in 2009. Paper EE bonds, last sold in 2011, were issued with a face value of twice their purchase price, so a $100 bond could be bought for $50, but would not be worth $100 until maturity.|$|E

Using this tree (1) the bond is valued at each node by [...] "stepping backwards" [...] through the tree: at the final nodes, bond value is simply face value (or $1), plus coupon (in cents) if relevant; at each earlier node, it is the discounted expected value of the up- and down-nodes in the later time step, plus coupon payments during the current time step. Then (2), the option is valued similar to the approach for equity options: at nodes in the time-step corresponding to option <b>maturity,</b> <b>value</b> is based on moneyness; at earlier nodes, it is the discounted expected value of the option at the up- and down-nodes in the later time step, and, depending on option style (and other specifications - see below), of the bond value at the node. https://books.google.com/books?id=wF8yVzLI6EYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Valuation+of+fixed+income+securities+and+derivatives https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232352/http://janroman.dhis.org/stud/BDT%20Thesis.pdf For both steps, the discounting is at the short rate for the tree-node in question.

50|$|Traded {{endowment}} policies (TEPs) {{or second}} hand endowment policies (SHEPs) are traditional with-profits endowments {{that have been}} sold to a new owner part way through their term. The TEP market enables buyers (investors) to buy unwanted endowment policies for more than the surrender value offered by the insurance company. Investors will pay more than the surrender value because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early. When a policy is sold, all beneficial rights on the policy are transferred to the new owner. The new owner takes on responsibility for future premium payments and collects the <b>maturity</b> <b>value</b> when the policy matures or the death benefit when the original life assured dies. Policyholders who sell their policies, no longer benefit from the life cover and should consider whether to take out alternative cover.The TEP market deals exclusively with Traditional With Profits policies. The easiest way of determining whether an endowment policy is in this category is to check to see whether it mentions units, indicating it is a Unitised With Profits or Unit Linked policy, if bonuses are in sterling {{and there is no}} mention of units then it is probably a traditional With Profits. The other types of policies - “Unit Linked” and “Unitised With Profits” have a performance factor which is dependent directly on current investment market conditions. These are not tradable as the guarantees on the policy are much lower and there is no gap between the surrender value and the market value.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} model of burial/thermal history and hydrocarbon generation is presented for a regional-scale (354 km) geologic cross section oriented approximately {{perpendicular to the}} Appalachian basin axis. The section extends through relatively undeformed strata, from the Rome trough in central West Virginia, northwestward to the Findlay arch in northwestern Ohio. The model incorporates sedimentation, compaction, uplift, and erosion, and assumes a constant basement heat flow of 60 mW/m 2. Relatively low thermal conductivities are assigned to coals (0. 2 W/mºC) and to kerogen-rich black shales (0. 9 W/mºC). Thermal maturity measurements of conodont color alteration index (CAI) and vitrinite reflectance (Ro%) from Ordovician, Devonian, and Pennsylvanian rocks constrain the model.
