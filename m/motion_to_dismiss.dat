According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed a <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> the Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell would amount to double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E

Diefenbaker alleged that {{the rules of the}} CNR did not require that the telegraph operator listen to the repeat of his message, but merely recommended that he should. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial-level court). Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused did not have the option of a speedy trial before a county court judge, and Atherton's case was set for the Spring Assizes in Prince George.|$|E
5|$|When the {{prosecution}} rested, the defence opened its {{case with a}} <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> based on the trial itself being illegal. Servatius challenged Eichmann's kidnapping and {{the basis for the}} Israeli law under which he had been indicted. He argued that if the trial were to continue, it should transfer its jurisdiction to West Germany. The prosecution countered by stating that the United Nations had endorsed Israel's actions, and that both West Germany and Argentina had agreed that the charges against him were legitimate. The defence motion was subsequently dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Circuit Judge Jon I. Gordon {{dismissed}} the lawsuit without prejudice in November requesting the plaintiffs refile with a clarified complaint.

In his decision, Judge Gordon stated that the franchise contract clearly does provide Burger King the right to establish minimum hours standards for its franchises. After purchase of the company by 3G, Burger King conceded to the franchises request the mandate be changed to a recommendation and relaxed its position on the extended hours.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{dozens of}} states have enacted anti-Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP) laws to counter SLAPP suits, or {{lawsuits}} filed to silence a defendant who has spoken out against a plaintiff. The {{goal of a}} SLAPP suit is not to win on the merits, but rather to discourage the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s {{right to free speech}} through the prospect of ruinously expensive litigation. State anti-SLAPP laws provide for special <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss,</b> which allow a defendant to file an expedited <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> dispose of the SLAPP suit before engaging in costly discovery. It is well established that a federal court sitting in diversity applies state substantive law and federal procedural rules. Following the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Insurance Co., however, it is unclear whether the state-level anti-SLAPP special <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> should apply in federal courts. This Note discusses Shady Grove and examines how two lower courts have struggled to make sense of Shady Grove in the context of state anti-SLAPP special <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss.</b> This Note then proposes a more nuanced, two-pronged interpretation for determining the applicability of state laws in federal courts. Applying this interpretation, this Note argues that state anti-SLAPP special <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> should apply in federal courts...|$|R
40|$|In {{federal civil}} litigation, unless a {{discretionary}} stay is granted, discovery often proceeds while <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> are pending. Plaintiffs with non-meritorious cases can compel defendants to spend massively on electronic discovery before courts ever rule on such motions. Defendants {{who are unable}} or unwilling to incur the huge up-front expense of electronic discovery may be forced to settle non-meritorious claims. To address multiple electronic discovery issues, Congress amended the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 2006 and the Federal Rules of Evidence in 2008. However, the amendments failed to significantly reduce costs and failed to address the critical issue of discovery timing. This Article contends that a mandatory stay is the most effective {{solution to the problem of}} electronic discovery during the pendency of <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss.</b> In 1995, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act imposed a mandatory stay of all discovery while <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> are pending in actions alleging violations of securities laws, absent application of two limited statutory exceptions. This Article examines the operation of the mandatory stay in securities actions and concludes that it should be extended to electronic discovery in all federal civil litigation, unless an exception applies. Imposition of a mandatory stay of electronic discovery before the disposition of <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> is the most equitable and effective solution to the unresolved problem of coercive settlements...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dartmouth College case (supra), there are other reports of certificates of division that were issued but never decided by the Supreme Court. After the indictment of Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, for treason, William Wirt Henry reports that a certificate of division was issued on Davis's <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> the indictment {{on the grounds that}} he owed no allegiance to the United States after the secession of his state. Reportedly, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase sided with Davis, while District Judge John Curtiss Underwood sided with the government. No response from the Supreme Court to that certificate is reported, but Davis's bail was eventually absolved, and he was released.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> {{for lack}} of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E
5|$|Judge José A. Cabranes {{presided over}} {{the case in the}} United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. In order to defeat a defense <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> the case in 1987, the plaintff called a number of expert {{witnesses}} including psychologist Margaret Singer, author of Cults in Our Midst, and psychiatrist and neurologist James Merikangas. Both Singer and Merikangas submitted affidavits asserting that Slee's death was related to the est training. After the defendants refused to respond to discovery requests, on January 18, 1990, the plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment, for failure of the defendants to comply with discovery, which was denied. In 1991, before the case came to trial, defendant Erhard left the country. In 1992, a jury heard the wrongful death lawsuit. During the trial, the defendants called a number of expert witnesses, including medical experts.|$|E

5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E
