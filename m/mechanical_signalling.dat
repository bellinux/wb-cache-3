For transverse motion, <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> transmission is dominated by prestress while fiber elasticity has a negligible effect.

40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{importance}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> in normal and inflamed cartilage is well established. Chondrocytes respond {{to changes in}} the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> during inflammation. Cytokines like interleukin (IL) - 1 β suppress homeostatic mechanisms and inhibit cartilage repair and cell proliferation. However, matrix synthesis and chondrocyte (AC) proliferation are upregulated by the physiological levels of mechanical forces. In this study, we investigated intracellular mechanisms underlying reparative actions of <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> during inflammation. Methods ACs isolated from articular cartilage were exposed to low/physiologic levels of dynamic strain in the presence of IL- 1 β. The cell extracts were probed for differential activation/inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) signaling cascade. The regulation of gene transcription was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results Mechanoactivation, but not IL- 1 β treatment, of ACs initiated integrin-linked kinase activation. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> induced activation and subsequent C-Raf-mediated activation of MAP kinases (MEK 1 / 2). However, IL- 1 β activated B-Raf kinase activity. Dynamic strain did not induce B-Raf activation but instead inhibited IL- 1 β-induced B-Raf activation. Both <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> and IL- 1 β induced ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation but discrete gene expression. ERK 1 / 2 activation by mechanical forces induced SRY-related protein- 9 (SOX- 9), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), and c-Myc mRNA expression and AC proliferation. However, IL- 1 β did not induce SOX- 9, VEGF, and c-Myc gene expression and inhibited AC cell proliferation. More importantly, SOX- 9, VEGF, and Myc gene transcription and AC proliferation induced by <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> were sustained in the presence of IL- 1 β. Conclusions The findings suggest that <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> may sustain their effects in proinflammatory environments by regulating key molecules in the MAP kinase signaling cascade.

40|$|International audienceBackgroundTendon is a {{mechanical}} tissue that transmits forces generated by muscle to bone {{in order to}} allow body motion. The molecular pathways that sense mechanical forces during tendon formation, homeostasis and repair are not known. EGR 1 is a mechanosensitive transcription factor involved in tendon formation, homeostasis and repair. We hypothesized that EGR 1 senses <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> to promote tendon gene expression. Methodology/Principal findingsUsing in vitro and in vivo models, we show that the expression of Egr 1 and tendon genes is downregulated in 3 D-engineered tendons made of mesenchymal stem cells when tension is released as well as in tendon homeostasis and healing when <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> are reduced. We further demonstrate that EGR 1 overexpression prevents tendon gene downregulation in 3 D-engineered tendons when tension is released. Lastly, ultrasound and microbubbles mediated EGR 1 overexpression prevents the downregulation of tendon gene expression during tendon healing in reduced load conditions. Conclusion/SignificanceThese results show that Egr 1 expression is sensitive to <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> in tendon cells. Moreover, EGR 1 overexpression prevents the downregulation of tendon gene expression in the absence of <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> in 3 D-engineered tendons and tendon healing. These results show that EGR 1 induces a transcriptional response downstream of <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> in tendon cells and open new avenues to use EGR 1 to promote tendon healing in reduced load conditions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> are {{important}} regulators of cell behavior. Key to understanding their role {{is the fact}} that cells are able to sense and respond to <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals.</b> In order to unravel the interplay between mechanics and biology one needs to embrace experimental and computational methods, stemming from engineering as well as biological disciplines, and integrate them into an interdisciplinary research field called mechanobiology. In this chapter we will first describe the structural and mechanical properties of a cell and its components, as these properties will have important consequences for the way <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> are converted into a biochemical response. Experimental techniques to measure and computational models to capture these properties will be highlighted. Once we have addressed some key aspects of cell mechanics, we will continue by describing some key mechanisms of how <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> can modulate cell behavior. Again, insights from experimental as well as computational studies will be reviewed. Given the broadness of the field, we will either focus on generic mechanisms, or limit ourselves to a few examples and case studies. status: publishe...|$|R
