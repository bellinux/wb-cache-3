25|$|Radio mast {{radiators}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> {{from the}} ground by a gap at the base. When lightning hits the mast, it jumps this gap. A small inductivity in the feed line between the mast and the tuning unit (usually one winding) limits the voltage increase, protecting the transmitter from dangerously high voltages.|$|E

Larger power cables may use compressed inorganic powder, {{depending on the}} application.|$|E
50|$|Insulators {{are often}} {{porcelain}} because polymers {{are prone to}} ultraviolet damage. Some utilities install higher-voltage insulators so the line can be easily upgraded to carry more power. For example, 12 kV lines <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> to 22 kV, or 19 kV lines to 33 kV.|$|E
50|$|A {{pipe clamp}} {{can also be}} used to connect a pipe to the {{remainder}} of a pipe hanger assembly. Pipe clamps are recommended for suspension for cold pipe lines that may or <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>insulated.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the one-dimensional strongly correlated electron models {{which have the}} resonating-valence-bond state as the exact ground state. The correlation functions are evaluated exactly using the transfer matrix method for the geometric representations of the valence-bond states. In this method, we only treat matrices with small dimensions. This enables us to give analytical results. It is shown that the correlation functions decay exponentially with distance. The result {{suggests that there is}} a finite excitation gap, and that the ground state <b>is</b> <b>insulating.</b> Since the corresponding non-interacting systems <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulating</b> or metallic, we can say that the gap originates from strong correlation. The persistent currents of the present models are also investigated and found to be exactly vanishing. Comment: 59 pages, REVTeX 3. 0, Figures are available on reques...|$|R
5000|$|Budget - The current {{economic}} situation has put great pressure on all expenses across the organization, executive development is no exception. Centralized development budgets are all targets, while certain {{activities such as}} executive coaching that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> paid out of a business unit budget <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>insulated</b> from cutbacks.|$|R
50|$|A {{switchgear}} may be {{a simple}} open-air isolator switch or it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> by some other substance. An effective although more costly form of switchgear is the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS), where the conductors and contacts are insulated by pressurized sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF6). Other common types are oil or vacuum insulated switchgear.|$|E
50|$|Cables {{for power}} {{distribution}} of 10 kV or higher <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> {{with oil and}} paper, and are run in a rigid steel pipe, semi-rigid aluminum or lead sheath. For higher voltages the oil may be kept under pressure to prevent formation of voids that would allow partial discharges within the cable insulation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{location}} of pipework also influences {{the selection of}} insulation thickness. For instance, in some circumstances, heating pipework within a well-insulated building might not require insulation, as the heat that's [...] "lost" [...] (i.e., the heat that flows from the pipe to the surrounding air) may be considered “useful” for heating the building, as such [...] "lost" [...] heat would be effectively trapped by the structural insulation anyway. [...] Conversely, such pipework <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> to prevent overheating or unnecessary cooling in the rooms through which it passes.|$|E
5000|$|For sheep, poultry, {{and other}} smaller animals, plastic {{electric}} netting <b>may</b> <b>be</b> mounted on <b>insulating</b> stakes [...] - [...] {{this is also}} effective at keeping out some predators such as foxes.|$|R
6000|$|... 1563. The {{particles}} which being charged, then travel, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{either of}} <b>insulating</b> or conducting matter, large or small. The {{consideration in the}} first place of a large particle of conducting matter may perhaps help our conceptions.|$|R
5000|$|A busbar <b>may</b> either <b>be</b> {{supported}} on insulators, or else insulation may completely surround it. Busbars are protected from accidental contact either by a metal earthed enclosure or by elevation out of normal reach. [...] Power neutral busbars <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> because it <b>is</b> not guaranteed {{that the potential}} between power neutral and safety grounding is always zero. Earthing (safety grounding) busbars are typically bare and bolted directly onto any metal chassis of their enclosure. Busbars <b>may</b> <b>be</b> enclosed in a metal housing, {{in the form of}} bus duct or busway, segregated-phase bus, or isolated-phase bus.|$|R
5000|$|Building codes {{sometimes}} take {{frost depth}} into account because of frost heaving which can damage buildings by moving their foundations. Foundations are normally built below the frost depth for this reason. Water and sewage pipes are normally buried below the frost line {{to prevent them}} from freezing. Alternatively, pipes <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> or actively heated using heat-tape or similar products to allow for shallower depths. Due to additional cost, this method is typically only used where deeper trenching is not an option due to utility conflicts, shallow bedrock, or other conditions that make deeper excavation infeasible.|$|E
50|$|A {{tank truck}} or tanker truck (United States usage) or tanker (United Kingdom usage), is {{a motor vehicle}} {{designed}} to carry liquefied loads, dry bulk cargo or gases on roads. The largest such vehicles are similar to railroad tank cars which {{are also designed to}} carry liquefied loads. Many variants exist due to the wide variety of liquids that can be transported. Tank trucks tend to be large; they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> or non-insulated; pressurized or non-pressurized; and designed for single or multiple loads (often by means of internal divisions in their tank). Some are semi-trailer trucks. They are difficult to drive due to their high center of gravity.|$|E
50|$|A {{garage door}} {{is a large}} door on a garage that opens either {{manually}} or by an electric motor (a garage door opener). Garage doors are frequently {{large enough to accommodate}} automobiles and other vehicles. Small garage doors may be made in a single panel that tilts up and back across the garage ceiling. Larger doors are usually made in several jointed panels that roll up on tracks across the garage ceiling, or into a roll above the doorway. The operating mechanism is spring-loaded or counterbalanced to offset the weight of the door and reduce human or motor effort required to operate the door. Less commonly, some garage doors slide or swing horizontally. Doors are made of wood, metal, or fiberglass, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> to prevent heat loss. Warehouses, bus garages and locomotive sheds have larger versions.|$|E
40|$|A unique nanoelectronic platform, {{based on}} single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs), has been fabricated for measuring electrical transport in single-molecule DNA. We have tested 80 base pairs of single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA, respectively) of complex base sequences. About a 25 − 40 pA current (at 1 V) was measured for the dsDNA molecule covalently {{attached to the}} SWNT electrode at its termini. In the absence of base pair stacking, a ssDNA carries a feeble current of 1 pA or less. Gate-voltage-dependent I−V characteristics revealed that the bridging dsDNA molecule acts as a p-type channel between SWNT source and drain electrodes. Molecular recognition and self-assembly are two most appealing attributes that provoke the scientific world in redeeming the potential use of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) {{as a component of}} future molecular electronic devices. Despite many expectations that DNA can be a potential ingredient of molecular electronic circuits, transport experi-ments on this versatile biopolymer have revealed a very intriguing and partly contradictory behavior. Various reports in the literature suggest that DNA <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulating,...</b>|$|R
50|$|The GAS {{container}} provided internal pressure, {{which could}} be varied from near vacuum to about one atmosphere. The {{bottom and sides of}} the container <b>were</b> always thermally <b>insulated,</b> and the top <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>insulated</b> or not, depending on the specific experiment. A lid that could be opened, or one with a window, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> required, and were offered as options at additional cost. The GAS containers were made of aluminum, and the circular end plates are 5⁄8 inch (16 mm) thick aluminum. The bottom 3 in of the container were reserved for NASA interface equipment, such as command decoders and pressure regulating systems. The container was a pressure vessel that could be evacuated before or during launch, or on orbit, and could be re-pressurized during re-entry, or on orbit, as required by the experimenter.|$|R

Knopf {{surviving}} {{threats to}} the publishing business and the tumult of acquisitions and mergers, Mehta said, [...] "We're part of {{something that is very}} large but we concentrate on our way of doing things.

50|$|Radio mast {{radiators}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> {{from the}} ground by a gap at the base. When lightning hits the mast, it jumps this gap. A small inductivity in the feed line between the mast and the tuning unit (usually one winding) limits the voltage increase, protecting the transmitter from dangerously high voltages.The transmitter must be equipped with a device to monitor the antenna's electrical properties. This is very important, as a charge could remain after a lightning strike, damaging the gap or the insulators.The monitoring device switches off the transmitter when the antenna shows incorrect behavior, e.g. {{as a result of}} undesired electrical charge. When the transmitter is switched off, these charges dissipate. The monitoring device makes several attempts to switch back on. If after several attempts the antenna continues to show improper behavior, possibly as result of structural damage, the transmitter remains switched off.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} insulation material is air. A variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous insulators {{are also used}} in electrical apparatus. In smaller transformers, generators, and electric motors, insulation on the wire coils consists of up to four thin layers of polymer varnish film. Film insulated magnet wire permits a manufacturer to obtain {{the maximum number of}} turns within the available space. Windings that use thicker conductors are often wrapped with supplemental fiberglass insulating tape. Windings may also be impregnated with insulating varnishes to prevent electrical corona and reduce magnetically induced wire vibration. Large power transformer windings are still mostly insulated with paper, wood, varnish, and mineral oil; although these materials have been used for more than 100 years, they still provide a good balance of economy and adequate performance. Busbars and circuit breakers in switchgear <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> with glass-reinforced plastic insulation, treated to have low flame spread and to prevent tracking of current across the material.|$|E
50|$|A livewell is a box used to {{transport}} live aquatic animals; shrimp, baitfish and mature fish, saltwater or freshwater species. A livewell {{should be made}} of materials that are non- toxic to aquatic animals. The shape may be square, rectangular, oval or round. The box <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated,</b> portable, have a drain and lid.Maintaining minimal safe water quality standards in livewell water is essential and necessary to insure a safe habitat for all the captive animals during transport.When transporting baitfish, shrimp or mature fish, maintaining dissolved oxygen saturation (DO Sat) {{is the single most}} important water quality parameter that must be controlled.Livewell oxygen-injection systems and LOX systems insure O2 enriched livewell water. Pure 100% compressed welding oxygen is injected into the water with a precision dose adjustable high-pressure oxygen regulator, oxygen tube and diffuser. Commercial and sport fishing oxygen-injection systems are designed to insure 100% DO Saturation or greater whether the bait or fish load is 1 lb or >1000 lbs.Minimal safe EPA water quality standards for steady state environments (rivers, lakes, ponds, etc.) is 5 ppm DO.|$|E
50|$|Apparatus {{providing}} a controlled environment for intensive cultivation of vegetable matter, e.g. bean sprouts is disclosed. A valve regulates {{the supply of}} water from a reservoir to a water-spray inlet in {{the roof of a}} cultivation chamber having an air vent and a water drainage outlet. A timing device, operatively connected to a valve actuating mechanism, opens the valve for a predetermined length of time at predetermined intervals. The water supplied to the spray inlet is heated by a thermostatically controlled heater. The chamber <b>may</b> <b>be</b> thermally <b>insulated</b> and its interior <b>may</b> <b>be</b> heated by a thermostatically controlled heater.|$|R
40|$|A Schottky diode for {{millimeter}} and submillimeter wave applications {{is comprised}} of a multi-layered structure including active layers of gallium arsenide on a semi-insulating gallium arsenide substrate with first and second insulating layers of silicon dioxide on the active layers of gallium arsenide. An ohmic contact pad lays on the silicon dioxide layers. An anode is formed in a window which is in and through the silicon dioxide layers. An elongated contact finger extends from the pad to the anode and a trench, preferably a transverse channel or trench of predetermined width, is formed in the active layers of the diode structure under the contact finger. The channel extends through the active layers to or substantially to the interface of the semi-insulating gallium arsenide substrate and the adjacent gallium arsenide layer which constitutes a buffer layer. Such a structure minimizes {{the effect of the}} major source of shunt capacitance by interrupting the current path between the conductive layers beneath the anode contact pad and the ohmic contact. Other embodiments of the diode may substitute various insulating or semi-insulating materials for the silicon dioxide, various semi-conductors for the active layers of gallium arsenide, and other materials for the substrate, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulating</b> or semi-insulating...|$|R
50|$|The liquid used {{must have}} {{sufficiently}} low electrical conductivity {{not to interfere}} with the normal operation of the computer. If the liquid is somewhat electrically conductive, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> necessary to <b>insulate</b> certain parts of components susceptible to electromagnetic interference, such as the CPU. For these reasons, it is preferred that the liquid be as dielectric as possible.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more complex}} {{anti-fading}} antenna is a vertical radiator which is sectionalized {{and is one}} wavelength (360 degrees, generally 180 over 180 degrees, and historically and correctly termed a [...] "Franklin" [...] radiator; two in an array at KFBK), or 300 degrees (180 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WHO radiator), or 240 degrees (120 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WOAI radiator, but WOAI has since replaced this with a 195 degree radiator for lower maintenance cost {{at the expense of}} somewhat poorer [...] "fringe" [...] reception). Several have been incorporated into phased arrays (directional antennas). When so sectionalized the sections are themselves phased so as to provide the optimum vertical radiation pattern (suppressing high-angle radiation). An advantage of the 180 over 180 degree configuration is no ground radial system is required, and the bottom of the lower section <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> from the ground; for the others, the bottom of the lower section is usually connected to a ground radial system through a capacitor.|$|E
5000|$|Gas fired {{forced air}} {{furnaces}} have a burner in the furnace fuelled by natural gas. A blower forces cold air through a heat exchanger {{and then through}} duct-work that distributes the hot air through the building. [...] Each room will have an outlet from the duct system, often mounted in the floor or low on the wall - some rooms will also have an opening into the cold air return duct. Depending on {{the age of the}} system, forced air gas furnaces use either a pilot light or a solid state ignition system (spark or hot surface ignition) to light the natural gas burner. The natural gas is fed to buildings from a main gas line. The duct work supplying the hot air (and sometimes cool air if an AC unit is tied into the system) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated.</b> A thermostat starts and stops the furnace to regulate temperature. Large homes or commercial buildings may have multiple thermostats and heating zones, controlled by powered dampers. A digital thermostat can be programmed to activate the gas furnace at certain times. For example, a resident may want the temperature in their dwelling to rise 15 minutes before returning from work.|$|E
40|$|Sprouty {{proteins}} act as intracellular inhibitors of receptor {{tyrosine kinase}} signaling. Here we show that the mammalian Sprouty 2 protein contains an iron-sulfur complex that can exist in an oxidized, reduced, or nitrosylated state. Purified Sprouty 2 assembles into large monodisperse spheres containing ≈ 24 polypeptides per particle. Biochemical experiments indicate that the charge state of the iron within Sprouty 2 particles <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> from ambient intracellular redox.

40|$|This {{month the}} Supreme Court {{is due to}} {{announce}} its decision in the King v.

Many Republicans hope the Court rules that such subsidies may not be provided under {{the text of the}} statute, while some Democrats, including President Obama, argue that the case should never have been heard. But is the public’s opinion of the Supreme Court shaped by such partisan messages? In new research, Tom Clark and John Kastellec find that the public’s opinion of the court is shaped by messages from their co-partisans: among members of the public, Democrats and Republicans {{are much more likely to}} support limitations to the independence of the Supreme Court when they are told that such limitations have been proposed by members of their own party.

40|$|Most {{organisms are}} limited in the amount and type of {{resources}} {{they are able to}} extract from the environment. The juvenile environment is particularly important in this regard, as conditions over ontogeny can influence the adult phenotype. Whole-organism performance traits, such as locomotion, are susceptible to such environmental effects, yet the specific biotic and abiotic factors driving performance plasticity have received little attention. We tested whether speckled wood Pararge aegeria L. butterflies reared under conditions of water stress exhibited poorer flight morphology and performance than control individuals. Despite large differences in mortality between treatments, we found no effects of water stress treatment on takeoff performance and only minor treatment effects on flight morphology. However, butterflies reared on water-stressed diets exhibited both significantly greater mortality and longer development times than did control individuals. Pararge aegeria larvae may compensate for this stress by prolonging development, resulting in similar realized performance capacities at least in takeoff performance in surviving adult butterflies; other measures of flight performance remain to be considered. Alternatively, the adult phenotype <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>insulated</b> from environmental effects at the larval stage in these insects...|$|E

40|$|The {{ground-state}} {{properties of}} the t-J model on a d-dimensional hypercubic lattice are examined {{in the limit of}} large d. It is found that the undoped system is an ordered antiferromagnet, and that the doped system phase separates into a hole-free antiferromagnetic phase and a hole-rich phase. The latter is electron free if J > 4 t and is weakly metallic (and typically superconducting) if J < 4 t. The resulting phase diagram is qualitatively similar to the one previously derived for d= 2 by a combination of analytic and numerical methods. Domain wall (or stripe) phases form in the presence of weak Coulomb interactions, with periodicity determined by the hole concentration and the relative strength of the exchange and Coulomb interactions. These phases reflect the {{properties of the}} hole-rich phase in the absence of Coulomb interactions, and, depending on the value of J/t, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> either <b>insulating</b> or metallic (i. e. an ``electron smectic'').
