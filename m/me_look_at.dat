500|$|Of Rambles, Mary Shelley {{wrote to}} her friend Leigh Hunt: [...] "It seems to me such a wretched piece of work, written {{much of it in}} a state of pain that makes <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> its pages now as if written in a dream." [...] She disliked the work, {{describing}} it variously as [...] "a poor affair" [...] and [...] "my poor book", and claimed that Gatteschi had written the best parts. There are no statistics on the sales of the book, but it received at least seventeen reviews. In general, the reviews were favourable; as Moskal explains, [...] "with nationalist movements simmering in Europe, to culminate in the revolutions of 1848, reviewers took Rambles seriously as a political as well as a literary endeavour." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{advanced}} to the table on which the book was lying open. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the blank space on {{the lower part of}} the page, under the foreground lines of my unfinished drawing. My mother, following <b>me,</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the page too.|$|R

6000|$|As she rose, I saw her book, {{which she}} had laid face {{downwards}} on the grass beside her. It was the same much-enduring copy of the [...] "Manoeuvres of Arthur." [...] I was thrilled.
