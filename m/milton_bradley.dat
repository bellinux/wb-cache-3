5|$|Universal sued Nintendo on June 29, 1982 and {{announced}} its license with Coleco.

5|$|Starting in 1974, Parker Brothers and its then {{corporate}} parent, General Mills, {{attempted to}} suppress {{publication of a}} game called Anti-Monopoly, designed by San Francisco State University economics professor Ralph Anspach and first published the previous year. Anspach began to research the game's history, and argued that the copyrights and trademarks held by Parker Brothers should be nullified, as the game {{came out of the}} public domain. Among other things, Anspach discovered the empty 1933 Charles B. Darrow file at the United States Copyright Office, testimony from the Inflation game case that was settled out of court, and letters from Knapp Electric challenging Parker Brothers over Monopoly. As the case went to trial in November 1976, Anspach produced testimony by many involved with the early development of the game, including Catherine and Willard Allphin, Dorothea Raiford and Charles Todd. Willard Allphin attempted to sell a version of the game to <b>Milton</b> <b>Bradley</b> in 1931, and published an article about the game's early history in the UK in 1975. Raiford had helped Ruth Hoskins produce the early Atlantic City games. Even Daniel Layman was interviewed, and Darrow's widow was deposed. The presiding judge, Spencer Williams, originally ruled for Parker Brothers/General Mills in 1977, allowing the Monopoly trademark to stand, and allowing the companies to destroy copies of Anspach's Anti-Monopoly. Anspach appealed.|$|E

25|$|William Ensign Lincoln {{invented the}} {{definitive}} zoetrope in 1865 {{when he was}} circa 18 years old and a sophomore at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Lincoln's patented version had the viewing slits on a level above the pictures, which allowed the use of easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions. On advice of a local bookstore owner, Lincoln sent a model to color lithographers and board game manufacturers <b>Milton</b> <b>Bradley</b> and Co. Some shop owners advertised the zoetrope in American newspapers in December 1866. The instrument was first patented in the U.K. on 6 March 1867 under no. 629 by Henry Watson Hallett (as a communication to him by <b>Milton</b> <b>Bradley).</b> In the United States it was patented as the Zo√´trope on April 23, 1867 by William E. Lincoln ‚Äì as an assignor to <b>Milton</b> <b>Bradley.</b> Over the years <b>Milton</b> <b>Bradley</b> released at least seven numbered series with twelve zoetrope strips each, {{as well as a}} set of twelve strips by Professor Robert Hallowell Richards showing the gradual transformations from one isometric form to another, and one separately available strip showing the progress of the Grecian bend (a woman morphing into a camel). The London Stereoscopic & Photographic Company was licensed as the British publisher and repeated most of the <b>Milton</b> <b>Bradley</b> animations, while adding a set of twelve animations by famous British illustrator George Cruikshank in 1870.|$|E
50|$|The Select-a-Game used a 7 x 16 vacuum {{fluorescent}} display (VFD) {{array of}} large dots {{as the main}} display. It could display two colors, red and blue. These were combined with static overlays for each game. Together they made the display. The system was basically a display and controller for the games with no built-in processor power. Each game cartridge contained a microprocessor programmed with the appropriate game code in it. In this respect, it was {{very similar to the}} concept of <b>Milton</b> <b>Bradley's</b> Microvision system released a few years earlier.|$|R
50|$|Shogun {{was renamed}} twice to avoid {{confusion}} with other board {{games of the}} same name, first becoming Samurai Swords in 1995 while still carrying the branding of <b>Milton</b> <b>Bradley's</b> Gamemaster Series and then becoming Ikusa in 2011 when reissued by Avalon Hill. Conquest of the Empire was re-released by Eagle Games in 2005 with updated rules.

5000|$|The Fimir {{were created}} {{at the behest}} of Games Workshop's then-owner, Bryan Ansell who wanted a race [...] "to be as {{distinctive}} of Warhammer as the Broo are of Runequest". However, the Fimir did not prove popular, and disappeared with the 4th edition of WFB, although this did give them time to make a guest-starring appearance in <b>Milton</b> <b>Bradley's</b> HeroQuest. Very few (official) sources on Fimir exist and include the WFRP Bestiary, an article in White Dwarf No. 102, the third edition of WFB (Bestiary and Warhammer Armies) and some references in supplements.|$|R
