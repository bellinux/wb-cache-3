The estimated methane yield was 0. 43 ± 0. 02 L CH 4 /g CODremoved which is close to the theoretical methane potential. Transitions of bacterial and archaeal community structures, associated with process performance data, were investigated using a combination of molecular fingerprinting and biostatistical tools. During the operation, archaeal community structure had no significant changes while bacterial community structure shifted continuously and dynamically. The reactor completely stabilized volatile fatty acids (primarily acetate and propionate) accumulated from the acidogenesis phase, with Methanosaeta- and Methanolinea-related microbes respectively being the main aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

40|$|Methane {{which can}} {{sometimes}} be found in exhaled breath of humans is known to reflect in situ intestinal methanogenic activity. In recent years, several factors have been studied {{in order to understand}} their relevance to methane production in the intestinal tract. However, the relationship between age and methane producing status has hitherto not been sufficiently investigated. In the present study we evaluated the relationship between age and percentage of breath <b>methane</b> <b>producers</b> in the German population in 428 subjects with ages ranging from 4 to 95 years. When subjects were divided into age groups of 15 years, an increase in the percentage of breath <b>methane</b> <b>producers</b> with age was observed. The near linear increase (R- 2 = 0. 977) from 5 % for children (1 - 15 years) to 57 % for the elderly (> 75 years) may indicate a continuous development in the human gut methanogenic flora throughout lifetime. However, when subjects were compared on 5 year age intervals, an interruption in the percentage of <b>methane</b> <b>producers</b> in the sixth and seventh decade was noted. We further revealed an age dependence on the ratio of female to male producers. This is shown by a dominance in female breath <b>methane</b> <b>producers</b> {{during the first half of}} life which afterwards is replaced by a dominance in male breath <b>methane</b> <b>producers</b> with an approximately linear decrease in the ratio between 20 and 65 years (R- 2 = 0. 926). These observations might suggest a relationship between methanogenic activity and hormonal factors. Using our data, we predict that the percentage of breath CH 4 producers within the German population will increase from its current value of 30 % (2013) to 35 % by 2050. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A cathode-on-top single-chamber {{microbial}} electrolysis cell (MEC) {{was constructed}} {{by putting the}} cathode above the anode. The cathode was made of mipor titanium tube coated with platinum and the anode was graphite granules with exoelectrogens absorbed on its surface. Sodium acetate {{was used as the}} substrate. In 24 h batch tests, when the applied voltages increased from 0. 2 V to 1. 0 V with an interval of 0. 1 V, the hydrogen production rates increased from 0. 03 L/L/d to 1. 58 L/L/d, and the overall hydrogen recoveries increased from 26. 03 % to 87. 73 %. The maximum overall energy recovery was 86. 78 % when the applied voltage was 0. 6 V. Meanwhile, hydrogen production was accompanied by evolution of methane, and the main <b>methane</b> <b>producer</b> in this MEC was hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The methane production rate increased with the increase of the hydrogen production rate when the applied voltage was under 0. 5 V; however, it maintained approximately 0. 04 L/L/d when the applied voltage was above 0. 5 V. These results demonstrate that putting the cathode above the anode is able to increase the hydrogen recoveries but also obtain high hydrogen production rates.

40|$|As the world's {{population}} approaches seven billion people, it {{is vital}} to find methods of livestock production, energy generation, and organic waste utilization that are sustainable for the future. Livestock manure has long been valued as a fertilizer and soil amendment, and more recently as a <b>methane</b> <b>producer</b> for heat and power via anaerobic digestion (AD). Microbial fuel cells (MFC) may offer an additional opportunity to gain value through direct electrical generation with little reduction in the manure?s soil building value, while concurrently reducing the manure's pollution potential. We demonstrate that simple lab-scale MFCs capable of electrical production can be used with dairy manure and the microorganisms needed for electrical generation are endogenously present. The MFCs had an average internal resistance of 136 ohms. The MFC system was operated with various raw manure concentrations (0 - 100 g/L COD at 20 oC), generating a maximum power density of 138 +- 19 mW/m 2 (COD 100 g/L). Power production was proportional to manure strength over this COD range. The MFCs where tested at 20, 37, and 55 oC. Average total Coulombs (C) captured increased from 18. 8 +- 1. 3 to 40. 5 +- 2. 4 C, from 20 to 37 oC but fell to less than 1. 42 C at 55 oC, indicating that the electrochemically active bacteria are possibly inhibited and killed at thermophillic temperatures. Coulombic efficiency also increased from 3. 4 +- 1. 2 % to 5. 8 +- 1. 4 % when the temperature was increased from 20 to 37 oC. MFCs were combined with AD. AD bottles were measured for total biogas production and composition during a 45 day period at 37 oC. Operating a MFC before AD did not have a statistically significant impact on the amount of biogas produced. However, the MFC operation did affect the timing and rate of biogas production for some of the samples. Biogas production reached a threshold of 5 mL as many as 8 days sooner in the bottles that where first operated in a MFC. The maximum slope of the biogas curves was decreased by 55 % from an average of 2. 91 to 1. 31 mL/day with prior operation in an MFC, indicating that the peak production rate was lower. The effect of AD digestion on the MFC performance was more significant with a 65 % decrease in the total Coulombs captured when AD was completed prior to use in a MFC. To compare the two processes, the respective performance of the two processes was determined by Coulombic efficiency and energy captured. The MFCs reached a maximum of 7 % Coulombic efficiency while the AD tests were all over 100 % (indicating COD destruction was underestimated). Total energy capture for the MFCs was less than 1 Joule while with the AD tests it was 120 - 220 J. Both these measures indicate that AD is currently the more efficient process at converting biodegradable substrate into energy. However, with further research and development, MFCs show promise if applied in situations that fit their unique benefits, such as operation at temperatures and COD concentrations below that needed for AD. Examples include ambient temperature manure storage ponds and post-digestion substrates.

Abundances of viruses and prokaryotes decreased with the depth, contrasting the pattern of virus-to-prokaryote ratio. According to fingerprint analyses, the community structure of viruses, bacteria and archaea gradually changed, and communities of the surface (0 - 10 cm) could be discriminated {{from those of the}} intermediate (11 - 27 cm) and deep (28 - 40 cm) sediment layers.

Furthermore, stable carbon isotope values of the exhaled methane unambiguously confirmed that this gas was produced by all of the human subjects studied. Based on the emission and stable carbon isotope patterns of various age groups we hypothesize that next to microbial sources in the gastrointestinal tracts there might be other, as yet unidentified, processes involved in methane formation supporting the idea that humans might also produce methane endogenously in cells.

The Early Permian coal seams of the Karoo Supergroup occur in several discrete sedimentary basins in South Africa, of which the Karoo basin is the largest. Using screening criteria based on geological, petrographical and analytical data some of the coal deposits can be excluded as potential coalbed <b>methane</b> <b>producers.</b> These include the Molteno Coalfield, {{large parts of the}} Karoo basin coal deposits and some of the Northern Province's coal deposits which are structurally disturbed. The traditional mining areas in the Free State, Witbank and Highveld coalfields are excluded from the coalbed methane study because the target seams occur at less than 200 metres below surface, too shallow for gas retention. Some of the coal seams in the Waterberg Coalfield occur at depths of several hundred metres below surface and these are unlikely to be mined by conventional means. These deep coals may be ideal coalbed <b>methane</b> <b>producers.</b> This regional overview was based on available, published data and two important parameters, permeability of coal and coalbed hydrology are unknown but important factors that will need {{to be taken into account}} in any future evaluations. The case study focused on an area close to Amersfoort that has a predicted potential for coalbed methane production. The study utilized 465 borehole descriptions from which isopach maps and geological cross-sections were constructed. Limited samples of borehole core provided lithological information from which a facies analyses was undertaken so as to establish the hydrodynamic origin of each facies types. The main lithofacies associated with the coal seams are mudstones, carbonaceous shales and fine- to coarse-grained sandstone. These data were combined with analyses from limited permeability data, petrographical data and proximate analyses for the Gus and Alfred seams. In addition to the sedimentary rocks, the role of dolerite intrusions was found to be significant as these occur as thick sills and dykes that occur below, within and above the coal seams. These may compartmentalize the seams into secondary targets within the study area. Thick sills overlying the coal zone also increase static loading and may be advantageous with respect to reducing the minimum depthbelow- surface requirements. Potential coalbed methane target areas are identified, although the entire study area is not suitable due to structural displacement of the coal seams, thinning of coal in places and devolatization caused by the dolerites...|$|R

This study investigated whether the structures and populations of methanogens in the rumen were associated with differences in cattle feed efficiencies by using culture-independent methods. Two 16 S rRNA libraries were constructed using ∼ 800 -bp amplicons generated from pooled total DNA isolated from efficient (n = 29) and inefficient (n = 29) animals. Sequence analysis of up to 490 randomly selected clones from each library showed that the methanogenic composition was variable: less species variation (22 operational taxonomic units [OTUs]) was detected in the rumens of efficient animals, compared to 27 OTUs in inefficient animals. The methanogenic communities in inefficient animals were more diverse than those in efficient ones, as revealed by the diversity indices of 0. 84 and 0. 42, respectively.

The results of this work showed that sonicating hog manure at specific energy (SE) of 500 kJ/kg TS resulted in a 20 % increase in methane production and 36 % increase in VSS destruction. The viability of using ultrasonication as a pretreatment method for elimination of <b>methane</b> <b>producers</b> and enrichment of hydrogen producers has been confirmed at SE of 79 kJ/g TSS.

These observations further suggest that diets may be manipulated to mitigate methane from ruminant livestock. A second experiment was conducted using, eight multiparous, lactating Jersey cows in a twice replicated 4 × 4 Latin square using a headbox type indirect calorimetry {{to determine the effects of}} feeding different concentrations of fat and hemicellulose on energy utilization and methane production. For fat concentration manipulation, tallow was included at either approximately 0 or 2 % of the diet DM. For hemicellulose concentration manipulation, the inclusion rates of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and soybean hulls were changed and resulted in diets containing either 11. 3 % or 12. 7 % hemicellulose (DM basis). The factorial arrangement of the treatments were both high and low fat and hemicellulose (LFLH, LFHH, HFLH, and HFHH). Results suggest that methane production was not affected by treatment however methane produced per unit of DMI tended to decrease with inclusion of fat. Fiber digestibility improved with increasing concentration of hemicellulose. Methane per unit of digested NDF tended to decrease with increasing concentration of hemicellulose. Energy utilization overall was improved as net energy of lactation was improved with increasing hemicellulose in low fat diets. Advisor: Paul J. Kononof...|$|R
40|$|Large {{individual}} applications of SO 4 2 - (10 2 - 10 3 kg SO 4 2 - -S/ha) {{are known to}} suppress methane emissions from rice paddies by up to ~ 70 %. The application of large quantities of SO 4 2 - amendments to rice paddies has therefore been proposed as a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy. In a similar system, natural peatlands, research has established that very low rates of SO 4 2 - deposition (~ 25 kg SO 4 2 - -S/ha/yr as small weekly pulses), {{similar to those of}} regions experiencing acid rain pollution, suppress methane emissions by as much as 30 - 40 %. It is thought that this is due to stimulation of sulfate-reducing microbial populations that out-compete <b>methane</b> <b>producers</b> for substrates. Given that acid rain S pollution is forecast to increase in Asia, the major rice growing region, we sought to establish the potential for acid rain to suppress CH 4 emission from rice agro-ecosystems by experimentally simulating acid rain inputs of S deposition to rice mesocosms in the laboratory. We used soils from Portuguese rice growing regions as they experience low ambient S deposition, and investigated the effect of simulated sulfate deposition (small regular pulses) on CH 4 emissions, pore- water concentrations of CH 4 and alternate electron acceptors. We also applied an annual dose of S deposition as a single pulse of sulfate to one set of replicate rice mesocosms. After a lag time of 7 weeks, CH 4 emission from the mesocosms subjected to the small weekly applications of ‘acid rain' sulfate as Na 2 SO 4 at a rate of 100 kg SO 4 2 - -S/ha/yr (amounting to a total deposition of ~ 20 kg SO 4 2 - -S/ha throughout the 10 week experiment) were reduced below the control by an average of 22 %, and as much as 35 % on a single date. CH 4 emissions from the ‘single pulse' experiment were significantly suppressed by the applied sulfate as were pore-water CH 4 concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms {{living in}} anoxic rice soils {{contribute}} 10 to 25 % of global meth-ane emissions. The most important carbon source for CH 4 production is plant-derived carbon that enters soil as root exudates and debris. Pulse labeling of rice plants with 13 CO 2 resulted in incorporation of 13 C into the ribosomal RNA of Rice Cluster I Archaea in the soil, indicating that this archaeal group {{plays a key}} role in CH 4 production from plant-derived carbon. This group of micro-organisms has not yet been isolated but appears to be of global environmental importance. The translocation of plant photosynthates below ground and their subsequent decom-position by rhizospheric microorganisms are key to the terrestrial ecosystem carbon budget (1). It has been shown that 30 to 60 % of net photosynthesized carbon is allocated to roots, and as much as 40 to 90 % of this fraction enters soil in the forms of root exudates, sloughed-off cells, and decaying roots (2). In wetland soils and rice paddies, the below-ground carbon flow provides a major carbon source for meth-ane production (3, 4). However, little is known about the microbiota that are involved in the rhizosphere carbon cycle, and the soil micro-biota is considered a Bblack box [in studies of soil carbon dynamics (5). A combination of stable isotope probing (SIP) and biomarker-based fingerprinting can be a powerful approach to investigate micro-bial species and in situ activity (6, 7). Bio-markers that have been used with SIP include nucleic acids (7 – 11) and phospholipid fatty acids (6, 12 – 14). Nucleic acids are particularly useful because they provide specific taxonomic information (15). Here we report on the appli-cation of RNA SIP in an intact rice-soil system to identify the active <b>methane</b> <b>producers</b> in the rhizosphere.

40|$|The 13 C {{content of}} {{microbial}} products {{are controlled by}} many factors, including the 13 C content of the growth substrate, growth rate, the flux of carbon through {{various parts of the}} biochemical network, and the isotopic fractionation imposed by the enzymes of that network. We analyzed the 13 C content of products of the methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri and found that fractionation varied strongly with substrate availability. These results inform our analysis of methanogen lipids from carbonates of the Lost City Hydrothermal Field. This ultramafic ecosystem produces methane highly enriched in 13 C relative to most biotic methane. We find that the 13 C enrichment in methanogen lipids is even stronger [...] demonstrating that the Methanosarcinales in active vents are <b>methane</b> <b>producers,</b> and that they are likely carbon-limited. Archaea {{in other parts of the}} vent field at Lost City are methanotrophs. The application of lipid biomarkers helps unravel the multiple biological and abiotic sources of methane at Lost City. Closer examination of lipids from Lost City shows that most are ether-type glycolipids. The dominance of glycolipids over phospholipids may be a phosphorus-conservation strategy in waters that are likely phosphorus-poor. Ether core lipids are similar to those produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria in environments where methane is oxidized anaerobically. Insoluble residues in Lost City carbonates contain proteinaceous organic material and have end-member d 15 N values near 0 0 / 00, suggesting active nitrogen fixation is occurring. Biomass and lipids from Yellowstone hot springs also showed surprising enrichments in 13 C. The common factor is high pH; unusual 13 C enrichment may be common in alkaline hydrothermal systems. Organisms in terrestrial and marine alkaline hydrothermal systems produced organic carbon with d 13 C outside of the usual biological range.

40|$|Nitrogen removal {{wetlands}} {{are constructed}} in agricultural areas {{as a measure}} {{to reduce the amount}} of non-point source nitrogen that reaches coastal areas. Methane and nitrous oxide, two greenhouse gases, are produced under anaerobic conditions and an increased amount of waterlogged areas will therefore increase the potential emission of these gases. The question has arisen: Are we solving one environmental problem with measures that render another? In a study in pristine New Zealand wetlands, I found that plant phosphorus and nitrate in soil best describe the variation in anaerobic soil respiration to carbon dioxide and methane. Plant phosphorus, indicating wetland productivity, was positively correlated with methane production, whereas nitrate in soil was negatively correlated with methane production. Swedish constructed nitrogen removal wetlands are considered to be highly productive and they have high concentrations of nitrate in the water. Will the Swedish nitrogen removal wetlands produce a lot of methane or will the production be hampered? In a field study I found that temperature explains most of the seasonal variation in methane emission. When the temperature effect was taken into account I found a negative effect of nitrate on methane emission. In laboratory experiments I also found that temperature was important for methane production, and that this was due to low substrate availability at lower temperatures, i. e. temperature had an indirect effect on <b>methane</b> <b>producers.</b> At higher nitrate additions more nitrous oxide was produced and methane was to some extent restricted by high nitrate concentrations. Low carbon availability in a meadow soil compared to in sediment from a recently restored wetland resulted in lower nitrous oxide production from meadow soil than from wetland sediment. A faster conversion of nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas also suggests that nitrogen removal is more efficient in a permanently inundated wetland than in a meadow soil that is only occasionally wet. In another study I compared the benefit (nitrogen removal) with the risk (methane emission) in 36 nitrogen removal wetlands in southwestern Sweden. There was no positive relationship between nitrogen removal and methane emission, which means that a wetland can be optimized for nitrogen removal without an increased risk of methane emission. Nitrate concentration in the water was positively correlated to nitrogen removal and negatively correlated to methane concentration in the water (at constant temperature). The results therefore suggest that nitrogen removal wetlands should be located in highly nitrate-loaded areas. Overall I have shown that nitrate concentrations occurring in the constructed nitrogen removal ponds, can have a negative impact on methane development...|$|R
40|$|Producer gas is a biomass derived {{gaseous fuel}} which is {{extensively}} used in internal combustion engines for power generation application. Unlike the conventional hydrocarbon fuels (Gasoline and Natural gas), the combustion properties of producer gas fuel are much different. Therefore, setting of optimal spark time for efficient engine operation is required. Owing to the fluctuating tendency of producer gas composition during gasification process, the heat release patterns (dictating the power output and emissions) obtained {{are quite different}} from conventional fuels. It was found that, valve lift timing is yet another factor which influences the burn rate of producer gas fuel, and thus, the heat release rate of the engine.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the possibility of developing spectroscopic techniques for trace gas detection, with particular emphasis on their applicability to breath analysis and medical diagnostics. Whilst key breath molecules such as methane and carbon dioxide will feature throughout this work, {{the focus of the}} research is on the detection of breath acetone, a molecule strongly linked with the diabetic condition. Preliminary studies into the suitability of cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) for the analysis of breath are carried out on methane, a molecule found in varying quantities in breath depending on whether the subject is a methane-producer or not. A telecommunications near-infrared semiconductor diode laser (1. 6 µm) is used with an optical cavity based detection system to probe transitions within the vibrational overtone of methane. Achieving a minimum detectable sensitivity of 600 ppb, the device is used to analyse the breath of 48 volunteers, identifying approximately one in three as <b>methane</b> <b>producers.</b> Following this, a second type of laser source, the novel and widely tunable Digital Supermode Distributed Bragg Reflector (DS-DBR) laser, is characterised and the first demonstration of its use in spectroscopy documented. Particular emphasis is given to its application to CEAS and to probing the transitions of the two Fermi resonance components of the CO_ 2 3 ν_ 1 + ν_ 3 combination bands found within the spectral range (1. 56 - 1. 61 µm) of the laser, providing the means to determine accurate ^{ 13 }CO_ 2 /^{ 12 }CO_ 2 ratios for use in the urea breath test. Not all molecules exhibit narrow, well-resolved ro-vibrational transitions and the next section of the thesis focuses on the detection of molecules, such as acetone, with broad, congested absorption features which are not readily discernible using narrowband laser sources. To provide the necessary specificity for these molecules, two types of broadband source, a Superluminescent Light Emitting Diode (SLED) and a Supercontinuum source (SC), both emitting over the 1. 6 - 1. 7 µm region, are used {{in the development of a}} series of broadband cavity enhanced absorption (BB-CEAS) spectrometers. The three broadband absorbers investigated here, butadiene, acetone and isoprene, all exhibit overtone and combination bands in this spectral region and direct absorption measurements are taken to determine absorption cross-sections for all three molecules. The first BB-CEAS spectrometer couples the SLED device with a dispersive monochromator, attaining a minimum detectable sensitivity of 6 x 10 ^{- 8 } cm^{- 1 }, which is further enhanced to 1. 5 x 10 ^{- 8 } cm^{- 1 } on replacing the monochromator with a Fourier Transform interferometer. The spectral coverage is then extended to 1. 5 - 1. 7 µm by coupling the first SLED with a second device, providing a demonstration of simultaneous multiple species detection. Finally, a SC source is used to provide greater power and uniform spectral intensity, resulting in an improved minimum detectable sensitivity of 5 x 10 ^{- 9 } cm^{- 1 }, or 200 ppb, 400 ppb and 200 ppb for butadiene, acetone and isoprene respectively. This device is then applied to acetone-enriched breath samples; the resulting spectra are fitted with a simulation to return the acetone levels present in the breath-matrix. Following this, the development of a prototype breath acetone analyser, carried out at Oxford Medical Diagnostics Ltd. (OMD), is described. To fulfill the requirements of a compact and commercially-viable device, a diode laser-based system is used, which necessitates a thorough investigation into all possible sources of absorption level change. Most notably, this includes a study into the removal and negating of interfering species, such as water vapour, and to a lesser extent, methane. A novel solution is presented, utilising a water-removal device in conjunction with molecular sieve so that each breath sample generates its own background, which has allowed breath acetone levels to be measured within an uncertainty of 200 ppb. Spectroscopic detection then moves to the mid-infrared with the demonstration of a continuous wave 8 µm quantum cascade laser, which allows the larger absorption cross-sections associated with fundamental vibrational modes to be probed. Following the laser's characterisation using methane, including a wavelength modulation spectroscopy study, the low effective laser linewidth is utilised to resolve rotational structure in low pressure samples of pure acetone. Absorption cross-sections are determined before the sensitivity of the system is enhanced for the detection of dilute concentrations of acetone using two types of multipass cells, firstly a White cell and secondly a home-built Herriott cell. This allows an acetone minimum detectable absorption of 350 ppb and 20 ppb to be attained, respectively. Following this, an optical cavity is constructed and, on treating breath samples in a water-removal device prior to analysis, breath acetone levels determined and corroborated with a mass spectrometer. <p. Finally, a preliminary study probing acetone in the ultraviolet is presented. Utilising an LED centred at 280 nm with a low finesse optical cavity and an imaging spectrograph, detection of 25 ppm of acetone is demonstrated and possible vibronic structure resolved. Combining large absorption cross-sections with the potential to be compact and commercially viable, further development of this arrangement could ultimately represent the optimum solution for breath acetone detection.

40|$|Objective: This study {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} methane production and colonic transit time in children with chronic constipation. Methodology: Forty children, from 3 to 13 years of age, suffering from chronic constipation were included. Methane production was defined when the breath methane concentration was greater than 3 ppm. the total and segmental colonic transit times were measured with radio-opaque markers. Results: Soiling was present in 34 (85. 0 %) of 40 patients with constipation. Methane production was present in 25 of 34 (73. 5 %) patients with constipation and soiling and only in 1 (16. 7 %) of 6 with constipation but without soiling (P = 0. 014). the medians of total colonic transit time were 80. 5 and 61. 0 hours, respectively (P = 0. 04), in <b>methane</b> and nonmethane <b>producers.</b> Segmental colonic transit times were 17. 5 and 10. 5 hours, respectively (P = 0. 580), in right colon, 29. 5 and 10. 5 hours (P = 0. 001), respectively, in left colon, and 31. 5 and 27. 0 hours (P = 0. 202), respectively, in the rectosigmoid. By the sixth week of treatment, {{the reduction in the}} total colonic transit time was greater in patients who had become nonmethane producers. Conclusion: the presence of breath methane in children with chronic constipation may suggest the possibility of prolonged colonic transit time.

40|$|In {{the search}} for new {{non-invasive}} diagnostic methods, healthcare researchers have turned their attention to exhaled human breath. Breath consists of thousands of molecular compounds in very low concentrations, {{in the order of}} parts per million by volume (ppm v), parts per billion by volume (ppb v) and parts per trillion by volume (ppt v). They are the result of the different biological process taking place inside the body. When a disease is present the production of specific molecules is altered. In this work in particular, we investigate two cases. One being the concentration of acetone on minors with type  1 diabetes (T 1 D). In the second case we compare the breath of three groups to establish significant differences and to identify relevant molecules. The groups under study are healthy children, children with asthma and children with cystic fibrosis (CF).   The main challenges in human breath research are the detection of concentration changes in small quantities and the establishment of a direct relation between specific molecules and particular diseases. We use quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), a multipass cell and Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) detectors to study the absorption of the molecular components of breath. We improve the identification of molecules by applying a multiline fitting algorithm.   The different molecules present in breath have a strong absorption signature in the mid-infrared. For this reason we use QCLs emitting in the region between 832 and 1262. 55 cm - 1. In this region each molecular species has a unique absorption fingerprint that allows its identification. The absorption is magnified by increasing the interaction distance between the light of the QCLs and the gas sample. We use a multipass cell with two astigmatic mirrors. The multiple reflections in the mirrors provide an effective interaction distance of 54. 36 meters inside a volume of only 0. 6 liters. For the detection we use MCT detectors directly because the QCLs emit a very specific wavenumber at a time. The absorption spectra are built by scanning the wavenumber of the QCLs twice: first with the multipass cell empty, to build a reference, and then with the breath sample to measure the absorption.   The scan of the QCLs eliminates the need of extra elements to separate the wavenumbers to build the absorption spectra. However, scanning over a broad wavenumber region introduces a new challenge: to guarantee its repeatability. This includes the assurance that the QCLs emit the same wavenumbers with the same intensities in every single scan. Only by minimizing the variability between independent scans we can create reliable absorption spectra and improve the sensitivity of the setup. We use two MCT detectors to monitor the intensity fluctuations. One detector is dedicated to monitor the intensity fluctuations of the QCLs while the other detector measures the intensity of the QCLs after the light has crossed the multipass cell. The variation of the wavenumber emission produces that independent scans are warped and uncorrelated with respect to each other. We implement two methods to correlate the measurements taken with the empty multipass cell and the measurements with the breath samples: a scan correlation using selected wavenumbers and a scan correlation using semiparametric time warping. Both methods are successful in obtaining a meaningful absorption spectrum. The selection of wavenumbers is more adequate to study molecules with a smooth profile and the semiparametric time warping method is more suitable for molecules with sharp absorption features. The result of the wavenumber and intensity corrections give the system a noise equivalent absorption sensitivity (NEAS) of 2. 99 × 10 − 7 cm − 1 Hz − 1 / 2. With this NEAS we can detect ppb v concentrations of acetone in presence of 2 % of water in the same wavenumber region.  The complexity of the gas mixture in breath makes the identification of specific molecular components difficult. We implement a multiline fitting algorithm to analyze specific molecules and determine their concentrations. We use this method to study the concentration of acetone and methane in the exhaled breath of healthy children. For acetone we use its absorption signature in the 1150 - 1250 cm - 1 region. Our results show that the production of acetone in healthy children is below the standard range established for healthy adults, between 0. 39 and 1. 09 ppm v. But the information and studies in this regard are limited and therefore more studies should be performed. In the case of methane we use its absorption fingerprint between 1258 and 1262. 5 cm - 1. The methane concentration in the breath of the participants is below 1 ppm v, which classifies them as non-producers. Given the small number of participants, eleven, this result is in accordance with previous reports establishing that only 10 % to 20 % of the children are <b>methane</b> <b>producers.</b>  We perform a specific study to investigate the acetone concentration in the exhaled breath of T 1 D patients. We analyze the breath of two minors and one adult T 1 D patient, and the breath of one healthy volunteer. Simultaneously, we measure the blood glucose and ketone concentrations in blood to inspect their relation with acetone in exhaled breath. For each volunteer, we performed a series of measurements over a period of time, including overnight fasting of 11 ± 1 hours and during ketosis-hyperglycemia events for the minors. The results highlight the importance of performing personalized studies because the response of the minors to the presence of ketosis was consistent but unique for each individual. As in the case of healthy children mentioned above, we also find that the acetone concentration in the breath of T 1 D minors in stable conditions is lower than the standard range for healthy adults. This emphasizes the need to perform more studies with children and specifically with T 1 D minors. We strongly believe that {{a better understanding of the}} production of acetone in exhaled breath can help to develop new diagnostic methods. For example, it can be used to detect chronic ketosis, which is a condition that many children present in the early stages of T 1 D. In many cases children live with chronic ketosis for years before being diagnosed with T 1 D. By detecting abnormal concentrations of acetone we can help to diagnose T 1 D earlier.  In a separate study we explore the clinical applicability of our spectroscopic setup by comparing the exhaled breath of 35 healthy children, 39 children with stable asthma and 15 with stable CF. Their age range is 6 – 18 years. We collect two to four exhaled breath samples in Tedlar bags and obtain their absorption spectrum in the region between 832 and 1262. 55 cm - 1. The results show a poor repeatability (Spearman’s ρ = 0. 36 to 0. 46) and agreement of the complete profiles. However, we identify wavenumber regions where the profiles are significantly different. Using these regions and the information from two molecular databases we present a list of molecules that can be used to discriminate between healthy children and children with asthma or CF. Our suggestion is to perform more studies and use the identified molecules as basis to understand the underlying inflammatory processes of asthma and CF. This study shows that the identification of the molecular components of exhaled breath is important and may be useful to develop new personalized treatments.  Because scientists like to dream about the future, we also explore the future possibilities in exhaled breath research. We strongly believe the next generation of exhaled breath systems will be a hybrid between optical detection systems, electrochemical methods and nanotechnology. This idea is firmly supported by the latest developments in small hollow waveguides for lasers and the most advanced pre-concentration and filtering methods for gas samples. Furthermore, the growing interest in new, non-invasive medical systems is making exhaled breath research a very important player in the global economy. We cannot foresee all the benefits exhaled breath research can offer to society but without doubt its value is immense. ImPhys/Optic...|$|R
40|$|In Sweden, {{biofuels}} {{have come}} into substantial use, in an extent that are claimed to be bigger than use of fossil oil. One driving force for this have been the CO 2 -tax that was introduced in 1991 (1). According to SVEBIO:s calculations (2) based on the Swedish Energy Agency´s prognosis, the total energy consumption in Sweden 2012 was 404 TWh. If the figure is broken down on the different energy sources (figure 1) one {{can see that the}} consumption roughly distribute in three different, equally sized, blocks, Biofuels, fossil fuels and water & nuclear power. The major use of the fossil fuels is for transport and the water & nuclear power is used as electric power. The main use of the biofuels is for heating in the industrial sector and as district heating. In 2009 the consumption from those two segments was 85 TWh, and 10 TWh of bio power was co-produced giving an average biomass to electricity efficiency of 12 %. This indicates a substantial conversion potential from hot water production to combined heat and power (CHP) production. in Sweden 2013 broken down on the different energy sources. In 2006 the pulp, paper and sawmill industry accounted for 95 % of the bio energy consumption in the industrial sector, and the major biofuel consumed was black liquor (5). However, the pulp and paper industries also produced the black liquor in their own processes. The major energy source (58 %) for district heating during 2006 was woody biomass (chips, pellets etc.) followed by waste (24 %), peat (6 %) and others (12 %) (5). The use of peat has probably decreased since 2006 since peat is no longer regarded as a renewable energy source. While the use of biofuel for heating purpose is well developed and the bio-power is expected to grow, the use in the transport sector is small, 9 TWh or 7 % in 2011. The main consumption there is due to the mandatory addition (5 %) of ethanol to gasoline and FAME to diesel (6). The Swedish authorities have announced plans to increase the renewable content to 7. 5 % in 2015 on the way to fulfill the EU’s goal of 10 % renewable transportation fuels in 2020. However the new proposed fuel directive in EU says that a maximum of 5 % renewable fuel may be produced from food sources like sugars and vegetable oils. Another bothersome fact is that, in principle, all rape seed oil produced in Sweden is consumed (95 - 97 %) in the food sector, and consequently all FAME used (in principle) in Sweden is imported as FAME, rape seed oil or seed (6). In Sweden a new source of biodiesel have emerged, tall oil diesel. Tall oil is extracted from black liquor and refined into a diesel fraction (not FAME) and can be mixed into fossil diesel, i. e. Preem Evolution diesel. The SUNPINE plant in Piteå have a capacity of 100 000 metric tons of tall oil diesel per annum, while the total potential in all of Sweden is claimed to be 200 000 tons (7). 100 000 tons of tall oil corresponds to 1 % of the total diesel consumption in Sweden. in Sweden for 2010 and a prognosis for 2014. (6). Accordingly, the profoundest task is to decrease the fossil fuel dependency in the transport sector, and clearly, the first generation biofuels can´t do this on its own. Biogas is a fuel gas with high methane content {{that can be used in}} a similar way to natural gas; for instance for cooking, heating and as transportation fuel. Today biogas is produced by fermentation of waste (municipal waste, sludge, manure), but can be produced by gasification of biomass, for instance from forest residues such as branches and rots (GROT in Swedish). To get high efficiency in the production, the lower hydrocarbons, mainly <b>methane,</b> in the <b>producer</b> gas, should not be converted into synthesis gas. Instead a synthesis gas with high methane content is sought. This limits the drainage of chemically bonded energy, due to the exothermic reaction in the synthesis step (so called methanisation). In 2011 0. 7 TWh of biogas was produced in Sweden by fermentation of waste (6) and there were no production by gasification, at least not of economic importance. The potential seems to be large, though. In 2008 the total potential for biogas production, in Sweden, from waste by fermentation and gasification was estimated to 70 TWh (10 TWh fermentation and 60 TWh gasification) (8). This figure includes only different types of waste and no dedicated agricultural crops or dedicated forest harvest. Activities in the biogas sector, by gasification, in Sweden are the Göteborgs energi´s Gobigas project in Gothenburg and Eon´s Bio 2 G-project, now pending, in south of Sweden. If the producer gas is cleaned and upgraded into synthesis gas also other fuels could be produced. In Sweden methanol and DME productions are planned for in the Värmlands metanol-project and at Chemrecs DME production plant in Piteå. Nationellt förgasningscente...|$|R
