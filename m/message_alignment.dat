40|$|The hybrid hiding {{encryption}} algorithm, as {{its name}} implies, embraces concepts from both steganography and cryptography. In this exertion, an improved micro-architecture Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of this algorithm is presented. This design overcomes the observed limitations of a previously-designed micro-architecture. These observed limitations are: no exploitation {{of the possibility of}} parallel bit replacement, {{and the fact that the}} input plaintext was encrypted serially, which caused a dependency between the throughput and the nature of the used secret key. This dependency can be viewed by some as vulnerability in the security of the implemented micro-architecture. The proposed modified micro-architecture is constructed using five basic modules. These modules are; the message cache, the <b>message</b> <b>alignment</b> module, the key cache, the comparator, and at last the encryption module. In this work, we provide comprehensive simulation and implementation results. These are: the timing diagrams, the post-implementation timing and routing reports, and finally the floor plan. Moreover, a detailed comparison with other FPGA implementations is made available and discussed. Comment: Submitted on behalf of EDAA ([URL]...|$|E

40|$|This study {{introduces}} a sexual script in heterosexual marriage, {{based on interviews}} with 12 married women and 13 married men. The qualitative data analysis revealed a two-phase sexual script, beginning with priming messages and culminating in synchronizing messages. Synchronizing messages took one of three forms—in-synch, token acceptance, or out-of-synch. In-synch <b>messages</b> showed <b>alignment</b> between an initiation message and an acceptance message such that a sexual episode occurred. Token acceptance messages, made by women, conveyed compliance with a sexual episode despite low desire. Out-of-synch messages rejected an initiation message...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The main aim of Enterprise Architecture (EA) is {{to master}} the {{development}} and the evolutions of Information Systems (IS). The EA process consists of designing the IS target architecture from several views, {{according to the company}} strategy. The business view represents the target organization of the particular company. The functional view focuses on the target functional architecture of that company’s IS. In this paper, we propose a new formal solution to analyze and to improve the consistency between the target functional view and the target business view of telecom services. This solution is based on the definition of a strategic alignment of the target functional view with the target business view. Alignment is validated with a real case study implemented and deployed at Orange [...] France Telecom on their <b>messaging</b> service. An <b>alignment</b> measure completing this analysis provides an estimation of the gap between a target functional view and a target business view...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} management project was to provide answers to the question to what extent does academic theory influence / support the corporate approach to strategic alignment, as expressed in published strategy documents? In order to do this a literature review was undertaken to gather and understand the relevant and current academic principles. The literature review covers the following major areas of academic thinking: business strategy, IT strategy and strategic alignment. The literature for strategic alignment is broken down into two natural categories; the intellectual and the social perspectives. The research had to be conducted on a commercial organisation that had the resources and commercial scope to support an analysis of a pragmatic approach to strategic alignment, IBM was selected for the analysis. Published strategic alignment material from IBM {{was used for the}} basis of this research. The research results proved very interesting. The strategic alignment material from IBM unexpectedly supported a chronological analysis of their approach. The material covers the period from 2002 to 2006 and indicates over that time IBM changed their strategic <b>alignment</b> <b>message</b> on almost a yearly basis. The project concludes with a discussion of what the possible influences on IBM approach are. The supposition is that the two possible causes for the change are marketing demand and environmental demand. The discussion finishes up with what the implications are if the environmental supposition is correct...|$|R
40|$|Aim/Purpose: This journal paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} historical aspects of data management, {{leading to the}} current data issues faced by organizational executives in relation to big data {{and how best to}} present the information to circumvent big data challenges for executive strategic decision making. Background:	This journal paper seeks to understand what executives value in data visualization, based on the literature published from prior data studies. Methodology: The qualitative methodology was used to understand the sentiments of executives and data analysts using semi-structured interview techniques. Contribution: The preliminary findings can provide practical knowledge for data visualization designers, but can also provide academics with knowledge to reflect on and use, specifically in relation to information systems (IS) that integrate human experience with technology in more valuable and productive ways. Findings: Preliminary results from interviews with executives and data analysts point to the relevance of understanding and effectively presenting the data source and the data journey, using the right data visualization technology to fit the nature of the data, creating an intuitive platform which enables collaboration and newness, the data presenter’s ability to convey the data <b>message</b> and the <b>alignment</b> of the visualization to core the objectives as key criteria to be applied for successful data visualizations Recommendations for Practitioners: Practitioners, specifically data analysts, should consider the results highlighted in the findings and adopt such recommendations when presenting data visualizations. These include data and premise understanding, ensuring alignment to the executive’s objective, possessing the ability to convey messages succinctly and clearly to the audience, having knowledge of the domain to answer questions effectively, and using the right technology to convey the message. Recommendation for Researchers: 	The importance of human cognitive and sensory processes and its impact in IS development is paramount. More focus can be placed on the psychological factors of technology acceptance. The current TAM model, used to describe use, identifies perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use as the primary considerations in technology adoption. However, factors that have been identified that impact on use do not express the importance of cognitive processes in technology adoption. Future Research: Future research requires further focus on intangible and psychological factors that could affect technology adoption and use, as well as understanding data visualization effectiveness in corporate environments, not only predominantly within the Health sector. Lessons from Health sector studies in data visualization should be used as a platform...|$|R
