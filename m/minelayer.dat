5|$|The German-built {{seaplane}} tender Zmaj {{was commissioned}} into the KJRM in 1930, but was {{converted to a}} <b>minelayer</b> in 1937. Captured by the Germans in April 1941, she saw service in the seaplane tender, aircraft rescue and troop transport roles as Drache. In late 1942, she was re-commissioned as a <b>minelayer,</b> and was used for shipboard trials with helicopters in 1943 before being sunk in September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav <b>minelayer</b> Zmaj (Dragon) {{was built}} in Germany as a {{seaplane}} tender for the Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1928–30. She {{does not appear to}} have been much used in that role and was converted to a <b>minelayer</b> in 1937. Captured by the Germans in 1941, she was renamed Drache (Dragon) and redesignated as an aircraft tender and later as a troop transport, before she was rebuilt as a <b>minelayer</b> in 1942. She laid one minefield in 1943 that sank two Allied destroyers and badly damaged a third in the Aegean Sea. Drache was also used by the Germans to evaluate the shipboard use of helicopters for reconnaissance purposes. She was sunk by Allied aircraft in 1944 at Samos and scrapped in place after the end of World War II.|$|E

5|$|Renamed Aso by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) {{she served}} as a {{training}} ship after extensive repairs. The ship was converted into a <b>minelayer</b> in 1917 and was decommissioned in 1930 {{to serve as a}} target ship. She was eventually sunk as a target in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Asama {{continued}} to make training cruises until she ran aground again in 1935, after which she became a stationary training ship {{for the rest of}} her career. Tokiwa was converted into a <b>minelayer</b> in 1922–24. She was placed in reserve in 1927 after she was damaged by an accidental explosion of several mines. The ship became a training <b>minelayer</b> in 1940. During the Pacific War, Tokiwa participated in the occupation of the Gilbert Islands and Rabaul and Kavieng in New Guinea. Damaged by American aircraft shortly afterwards, the ship was forced to return to Japan for repairs. Tokiwa laid minefields during 1944–45 until she was twice damaged by mines in 1945. Shortly before the end of the war, the ship was badly damaged by American aircraft and her crew was forced to beach her. Tokiwa was salvaged in 1947 and subsequently broken up for scrap. Asama survived the war intact and was scrapped in 1946–47.|$|E
5|$|Blonde {{remained}} with the 4th Battle Squadron through 1916, {{although she was}} detached for several months mid year. She had been transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron by April 1917 and was converted into a <b>minelayer</b> later in the year, although she never laid any mines in combat. Similarly, Blanche {{remained with}} the 3rd Battle Squadron until January 1916 when she joined her sister in the 4th Battle Squadron. The ship participated in the Battle of Jutland, but was on the unengaged side of the fleet {{and did not have}} the opportunity to fire at the Germans. She was detached from the 4th Battle Squadron at the beginning of 1917, presumably to be converted into a <b>minelayer.</b> Blanche was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron by April and laid some mines {{at the entrance to the}} Kattegat in February 1918.|$|E

5|$|HMS Esk was an E-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. She {{was designed to be}} easily converted into a fast <b>minelayer</b> by removing some guns and her torpedo tubes. Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36, during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of the}} conflict. Esk was converted to a <b>minelayer</b> when World War II began in September 1939, and spent most of her time laying mines. During the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940, the ship laid mines in Norwegian territorial waters before the Germans invaded, but was recalled to home waters to resume her minelaying duties in early May. During one such sortie, Esk was sunk during the Texel Disaster on the night of 31 August 1940, when she ran into a newly laid German minefield.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Goito was {{withdrawn}} from front-line service and converted in a <b>minelayer,</b> with {{a capacity for}} 60 naval mines in place of her torpedo tubes. Montebello remained on active duty until 1898, when she was converted into a training ship for engine room personnel, and was re-boilered with coal- and oil-fired equipment from several manufacturers in 1903. Confienza and Monzambano were the last {{members of the class}} to leave active service, being stricken from the naval register on the same day, 26 August 1901 and sold for scrapping. Goito continued to take part in fleet maneuvers as late as 1907 in her <b>minelayer</b> configuration, and both she and Manzambano remained in the Regia Marinas inventory during the Italo-Turkish War of 191112 and World War I. Neither ship saw action in either conflict, though Goito laid defensive minefields in the Adriatic Sea after Italy entered World War I in 1915. Montebello was eventually stricken on 26 January 1920, and Goito followed her to the breakers' yard on 15 March.|$|E
5|$|All four ships {{spent the}} {{majority}} of their time in service with the main Italian fleet, alternating between active duty for training exercises and reserve status. In 1897, Goito was converted into a <b>minelayer</b> and Montebello became a training ship for engine room personnel. Monzambano and Confienza were simply sold for scrap in 1901. Goito laid defensive minefields after Italy entered World War I in 1915, but otherwise did not see action during the war. The two surviving vessels remained in the Italian fleet until 1920, when they too were broken up for scrap.|$|E
50|$|After the {{collision}} damage was repaired, Scott focused on providing navigational {{information for the}} <b>minelayers</b> placing the Northern Barrage between Greenland and Scotland from the spring of 1942 until the project was abandoned {{in the autumn of}} 1943. She surveyed the minefields in advance, and then accompanied the <b>minelayers</b> while the fields were placed.|$|R

50|$|Ruotsinsalmi {{together}} with Riilahti participated in ferrying the Finnish gunboats past Hanko in August 1941. After two failed attempts by gunboats to rendezvous with <b>minelayers</b> on the nights of 25-26 and 27-28 August the <b>minelayers</b> penetrated the Soviet minefield {{and met with}} the gunboats west of Hanko and then escorted them through to Helsinki on 29 August 1941.|$|R
5|$|Another Malta convoy (Operation Substance) was {{conducted}} in mid-July, heavily escorted by Force H and elements of the Home Fleet and another in early August (Operation Style), albeit with only Force H covering the convoy. Several weeks later, Fury participated in Operation Mincemeat, during which Force H escorted a <b>minelayer</b> to Livorno to lay its mines while Ark Royals aircraft attacked Northern Sardinia as a diversion. In late September, the destroyer escorted another convoy to Malta in Operation Halberd.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, UB-10 {{had been}} {{converted}} into a <b>minelayer</b> by the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes. UB-10 was seriously damaged in a British air raid on Flanders in July 1918, and was decommissioned in September 1918 in a worn out condition. She was not deemed seaworthy to sail to Germany when the bases in Flanders were being evacuated by the Germans in October 1918 and was scuttled off Zeebrugge in early October.|$|E
5|$|Express, {{the eighth}} ship {{of that name}} to serve with the Royal Navy, was ordered 1 November 1932, from Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson at Wallsend under the 1931 Naval Programme, {{for use as a}} {{destroyer}} that could quickly be converted for use as a <b>minelayer</b> when required. She was laid down 24 March 1932, and launched on 29 May 1934. The ship was commissioned on 2 November 1934, at a total cost of £247,279, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament.|$|E
5000|$|Amenities {{ships were}} {{expected}} to provide an alternative to shore leave in remote locations without commercial recreation facilities. Two former <b>minelayers,</b> [...] and [...] were converted to amenities ships after the Northern Barrage was completed. These 7,500-ton ships were former Blue Funnel Liners launched in 1929 and initially converted to auxiliary <b>minelayers.</b> They underwent further conversion at Vancouver in 1944 including installation of a brewery to make beer for shipboard consumption. These ships had been painted grey for service as North Atlantic <b>minelayers,</b> but were repainted white for service in the western Pacific. The war ended before they were used in their intended role as amenities ships.|$|R

2500|$|The French Navy {{noted the}} {{effectiveness}} of mines during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and experimented with them by converting two elderly torpedo-gunboats in 1911–12. They were not very successful and the French concluded that specially designed ships were necessary. Two new <b>minelayers</b> were ordered {{as part of the}} 1912 Naval Program, [...] and , the first purpose-built <b>minelayers</b> of the French Navy.|$|R
5|$|Italy had {{declared}} neutrality {{at the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. She continued to serve as a <b>minelayer</b> during the war in support of Revel's strategy. She was officially reclassified as a <b>minelayer</b> on 1 July 1921, though she did not remain in service for very long, being stricken from the naval register on 4 March 1923 and thereafter broken up for scrap. At the time of her disposal, Tripoli was the last torpedo cruiser still in the Italian fleet's inventory, surpassing even the , which had been built fifteen years after Tripoli entered service.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} refloated by Japanese {{engineers}} the following year; repairs, re-boilering, and {{the replacement of}} her armament with Japanese weapons took until 1908 to complete. Renamed Aso in Japanese service, she initially served as a training ship before she was converted into a <b>minelayer</b> in 1920. Aso was decommissioned on 1 April 1930 and renamed Hai Kan No. 4. She was sunk as a target on 4 August 1932 by two submarine torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Berlin {{served in}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet from her commissioning to 1911, when she was sent abroad for overseas duties. She returned to the scouting forces the following year, where she remained through {{the first two years}} of World War I. She spent 1916 as a <b>minelayer,</b> and was disarmed in 1917. She was one of six cruisers permitted to Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, and she remained in service with the new Reichsmarine through the 1920s as a training ship. She was withdrawn from active duty in 1929, and later used as a barracks ship by the Kriegsmarine, a role she filled through World War II. After the end of the war, she was loaded with chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skagerrak.|$|E

On 10 March, she took part in minelaying operations, alongside her fellow destroyers Z25 and Z35. On 11-12 March she bombarded Soviet forces near Narva-Jõesuu. From 13 March to 22 April she took part in six different minelaying operations. One such operation lasted from 13-14 April, in which German destroyers Z28, Z35, Z39, German <b>minelayers</b> Brummer, Linz, Roland, T30, M14, and M22 laid the [...] "Seeigel 6b" [...] mine barrage, south of Suur Tyärsaari.

5|$|Despite being {{designed}} as a <b>minelayer,</b> the German Navy never operated her as such. She and her sister were used to raid a British convoy to Norway in October 1917. The two cruisers sank two escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve merchant ships of the convoy. The Kaiserliche Marine considered sending the two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans to abandon the plan. Brummer {{was included in the}} list of ships interned at Scapa Flow following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. Brummer was successfully scuttled, and unlike most of the other wrecks, she was never raised for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|During the First Balkan War, which {{broke out}} in the closing weeks of the Italo-Turkish War, Coatit and an {{international}} fleet was sent to safeguard foreign nationals in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople, which was threatened by a Bulgarian offensive. Neither ship saw action during World War I, though Agordat was involved in the occupation of Constantinople following the Ottoman defeat in November 1918. Both ships were reduced to secondary duties after the war, with Coatit being converted into a <b>minelayer</b> in 1919 and Agordat being reduced to a gunboat in 1921. Neither ship served for long in these new roles; Coatit was scrapped in 1920 and Agordat was sold to ship breakers in 1923.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large winches on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright {{so it could be}} re-floated and patched before being scrapped.
