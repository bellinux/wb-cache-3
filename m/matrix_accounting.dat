50|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that certain species of mycorrhizal fungi may obtain at least a portion of their carbon via saprotrophic nutrition, the bulk of mycorrhizal carbon acquisition happens by way of trading for host-derived photosynthetic products. Mycorrhizal systems represent a major carbon sink. Laboratory studies predict that around 23% of plant-derived carbon is allocated to extrametrical mycelium, although an estimated 15-30% of this is lost to fungal respiration.Carbon allocation is distributed unequally to extramatrical mycelium depending on fungal taxa, nutrient availability, and the age of the associated mycorrhizas. Much of the carbon allocated to extramatrical mycelium accumulates as fungal biomass, making up an estimated one-third of the total microbial biomass and one-half of the total dissolved organic carbon in some forest soils. Carbon also supports the production of sporocarps and sclerotia, with various taxa investing differentially in these structures rather than in the proliferation of extramatrical mycelium. Carbon acquisition also goes toward the production of fungal exudates. Extramatrical hyphae excrete a range of compounds into the soil <b>matrix,</b> <b>accounting</b> for as much as 40% of total carbon usage. These exudates are released primarily at the growing front, and are used in functions such as mineralization and homeostasis.|$|E

In contrast, non-equilibrium budding remains experimentally widely unexplored especially when time scales fall well below the characteristic diffusion time of lipidsτ. We show that localized mechanical perturbations, initiated by driving giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) through their lipid phase transition, leads to the immediate formation of rapidly growing, multiply localized, non-equilibrium buds, when the transition takes place at short timescales (<τ). We show that these buds arise from small fluid-like perturbations and grow as spherical caps in the third dimension, since in plane spreading is obstructed by the continuous rigid gel-like <b>matrix.</b> <b>Accounting</b> for both three and two dimensional viscosity, we demonstrate that dissipation decreases the size scale of the system and therefore favours the formation of multiple buds as long as the perturbation takes place above a certain critical rate.

We present two techniques to estimate the uncertainties on the spectral parameters of the separated components.

This contribution is considered as an additional term to the GW self-energy. The study {{is based on a}} variational solution of the T-matrix integral equation within a local approximation. A key quantity of such a solution, the local electron-hole interaction, is obtained at the small four-momentum transfer limit. Performed by making use of this limit form, extensive calculations of quasiparticle properties in the homogeneous electron gas over a broad range of electron densities are reported. We carry out an analysis of how the T-matrix contribution affects the quasiparticle damping rate, the quasiparticle energy, the renormalization constant, and the effective mass enhancement. We find that in comparison with the GW approximation the inclusion of the T matrix leads to an essential increase of the damping rate, a slight reduction of the GW band narrowing, a decrease of the renormalization constant at the Fermi wave vector, and some "weighting" of quasiparticles at the Fermi surface.
