50|$|Detecting {{modulation}} {{depends on}} {{the angle of the}} source versus the target; if the source is too far off-center with a turbine or other moving surface, the modulation may not be evident because the moving part of the engine is shielded by the engine mounting. Modulation increases, however, when the source is at right angles to the axis of rotation of the <b>moving</b> <b>element</b> of the target. For fully exposed moving elements, (e.g., propeller blades or helicopter rotors), modulation {{is a function of the}} radar beam being off-center to the center of the <b>moving</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{attention}} on visual evoked potentials triggered by motion-onset {{were examined in}} four experiments. A set of randomly oriented bars was used as stimuli. The first experiment showed that responses to motion-onset following pattern-onset by less than 300 ms were suppressed. In the other three experiments, the amplitude of N 170 was reduced when attention was drawn away from the <b>moving</b> <b>elements</b> and towards spatially interspersed bars that remained static. The superposition of the two sets made spatial selection unlikely.

50|$|When the {{conditions}} permit (fixed camera, stationary lighting conditions, etc.), background subtraction {{can help to}} detect pedestrians. Background subtraction classifies the pixels of video streams as either background, where no motion is detected, or foreground, where motion is detected. This procedure highlights the silhouettes (the connected components in the foreground) of every <b>moving</b> <b>element</b> in the scene, including people. An algorithm has been developed, {{at the university of}} Liège, to analyze the shape of these silhouettes in order to detect the humans. Since the methods that consider the silhouette as a whole and perform a single classification are, in general, highly sensitive to shape defects, a part-based method splitting the silhouettes in a set of smaller regions has been proposed to decrease the influence of defects. To the contrary of other part-based approaches, these regions do not have any anatomical meaning. This algorithm has been extended to the detection of humans in 3D video streams.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the extent to}} which motion repulsion and binocular motion rivalry depend on the distance between <b>moving</b> <b>elements.</b> The stimuli consisted of two sets of spatially intermingled, finite-life random dots that moved across each other. The distance between the dots moving in different directions was manipulated by spatially pairing the dot trajectories with various precisions. Data from experiment 1 indicated that motion repulsion occurred reliably only when the average distance between orthogonally <b>moving</b> <b>elements</b> was at least 21. 0 arc min. When the dots were precisely paired, a single global direction intermediate to the two actual directions was perceived. This result suggests that, at a relatively small spatial scale, interaction between different directions favors motion attraction or coherence, while interaction at a somewhat larger scale generates motion repulsion. Similarly, data from experiment 2 indicated that binocular motion rivalry was significantly diminished by spatially pairing the dots, which moved in opposite directions in the two eyes. This supports the recent proposal that rivalry occurs at or after the stage of binocular convergence, since monocular cells could not have directly responded to our interocular pairing manipulation. Together, these findings suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying motion perception are highly sensitive to the fine spatial relationship between <b>moving</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Building {{on recent}} work in sensor {{networks}} and distributed manipulation, we propose Actuator Networks– networks of devices capable of exerting {{influence on their}} environment in addition to monitoring it. We show how an Actuator Network {{can be used to}} guide a <b>moving</b> <b>element</b> to a desired location in space through the creation of potential gradients, and introduce an algorithm capable of calculating the required actuation. In this algorithm, motion is achieved with three steps: “Push, Cage, and Squeeze”, whose sequential application we term a PCS cycle. Guiding a <b>moving</b> <b>element</b> via PCS cycles is robust to modeled trajectory error and provides a framework into which path planning and obstacle avoidance can be integrated. We explore the PCS cycle as an example of one of the types of distributed actuation possible with an Actuator Network. We introduce models, notation, terms and properties related to the nature of Actuator Networks, describe the distributed guidance algorithm, and discuss simulation results showing how an Actuator Network with eight nodes can guide a <b>moving</b> <b>element</b> to a desired location while avoiding obstacles...|$|E
