40|$|Children's {{emerging}} morality {{involves the}} development of <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition. Developmental research suggests that emotions {{play an important role}} in dealing with <b>moral</b> conflict situations, <b>and</b> they help children differentiate moral concepts from other social judgments. However, emotions and their role in <b>moral</b> cognition <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> behavior have yet to be addresses systematically in empirical research. In this volume, the authors show how integrative developmental research on children's <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition can help us understand how children's morality evolves. As both <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition are related to children's moral, prosocial behavior, as well as to their immoral, aggressive behavior, studying how <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition interact is not only of conceptual significance to developmental researchers, but also of practical importance to educators. A central premise of the volume is that moral emotions interact with moral cognition in different ways across development. An integrative developmental perspective on <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition thus offers an important conceptual framework for understanding children's emerging morality and designing developmentally sensitive moral intervention strategies. The authors summarize the empirical literature linking moral emotions to <b>moral</b> cognition <b>and</b> discuss promising conceptual avenues and methodological approaches to study children's <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition. They also provide examples illustrating how the principles of integrative moral education can be applied in educational practice...|$|R
5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote {{a defense}} of his {{decision}} to duel {{while at the same}} time intending to throw away his shot. Hamilton viewed his roles of being a father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively. His desire to be available for future political matters also played a factor.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E

Their responses indicated that Neill had significant impact on how the profession perceived teacher–pupil relations.

Hemmings received little response from heads of state comprehensive schools.|$|E

5|$|Many of Portland's middle- and upper-class citizens, {{including}} Dow, believed drunkenness {{was a great}} {{threat to}} the city's <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> financial well-being.

The group initially focused its efforts on the evils of distilled beverages, but by 1829, Dow declared he would abstain from all alcoholic beverages. At the same time, he associated himself with anti-Masonic and anti-slavery causes, and became more involved with politics generally. In the 1832 presidential election, unsatisfied with both Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, Dow backed William Wirt, a minor-party candidate.|$|E

5|$|Sheryl Crow is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Sheryl Crow, {{released}} on September 24, 1996 by A Records. Unlike its predecessor Tuesday Night Music Club, which was written by a casual collective formed by Crow and several other musicians, Sheryl Crow was entirely produced by Crow, who wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana. The album covers topics of American life, relationship breakups, and <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> ethical issues, while encompassing a variety of music genres such as rock, blues, alternative rock, country, and folk.|$|E

In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E
