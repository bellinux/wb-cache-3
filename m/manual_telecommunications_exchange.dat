40|$|The paper {{proposes that}} the notion of complex systems usefully {{describes}} a group of large scale, customized products and their associated supply industries. Examples include flight simulators (FSs), <b>telecommunications</b> <b>exchanges,</b> military systems, airplanes, chemical process plants and heavy electrical equipment. Complex systems, made up of many interconnected customized components, exhibit emerging properties through time as they respond to the evolving needs of large users. Taking the FS industry as a case history, the study identifies some of the basic rules governing innovation in this industry. These rules contrast sharply with those typically found in the 'conventional', market contest Schumpeterian model. Innovation in FS is coordinated by an institutional structure made up of suppliers, users, regulators, industry associations and professional bodies. In contrast with co. tventional market selection, new designs are negotiated prior to product development. Long-term stability among FS makers is observed, despite radical technological discontinuities, as industrial adjustment occurs via the exit and entry of specialist suppliers. There is no dominant design in the usual sense, nor do the conventional rules of volume competition and- process-intensive innovation apply in FS. Competitive strategies remain focused upon " design, engineering and prototype development, rather than incremental process innova-| tion.

40|$|The {{goal with}} the present thesis is to develop tools, methods and models to assess the {{upstream}} processes in the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology for current and new electronic products. The {{goal is to get}} a better understanding on how to collect data to be used in a life cycle inventory (LCI) and use life cycle approaches to environmentally assess the electronics. Firstly, a comprehensive LCA from cradle-to-grave of a private branch exchange (PBX) was performed and an LCI database in the LCA software EcoLab was built up. Secondly, a model and method for LCI data collection from cradle-to-gate of the upstream processes, which could be applied to any electronic product, was developed. Thirdly, a gallium arsenide (GaAs) Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) Switch Product based on the a System-In-a-Package (SIP) concept using a Liquid Crystalline Polymer (LCP) substrate was manufactured and the developed model for LCI data collection was applied to assess the environmental load. There exist several environmental assessment approaches for electronics, but still no effective model for LCI data collection exists. The objective is to develop a model for LCI data collection of the upstream processes of electronic products, apply it and find the environmental load of a GaAs MMIC Switch Product based on so-called SIP concept utilising a LCP substrate. EcoLab and available literature data were used to analyse the environmental loads. The results show that manufacturing of hardware has {{a significant impact on the}} LCA results for a <b>telecommunications</b> <b>exchange.</b> For Paper I, as much as 50 % of the upstream manufacturing processes applied to the raw materials to transform them into components were left out. Integrated circuits and printed wiring boards dominate the hardware contribution to the environmental load of the whole <b>telecommunications</b> <b>exchange.</b> The observed significant environmental impact of inductors in the LCA in paper I may well be an effect of the LCI data used being poorly representative of the full range of inductive components. An LCI of a digital telephone would lead to more than 120 unit processes requiring to be inventoried, but some of the unit processes for silicon containing components are similar, which would simplify the inventory. The result of an environmental assessment of the manufacturing process for a GaAs switch showed that spin coating and deposition are environmental hot spots. From the present work it is shown that the data gathering requirement is vast, but not as large as it would be if every component had to be inventoried from cradle-to-gate. The data collection can be minimized if the proposed model for data collection is used. In the present thesis it is also shown that the data collection model could be used for a GaAs MMIC SIP switch module. The upstream processes are not negligible in LCA of electronics, especially not the processing of monocrystalline wafers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{an engineering}} process {{model of the}} cost of local <b>exchange</b> <b>telecommunications</b> firms with an analytical model of optimal incentive regulation (with ex post cost observability), to study empirically the properties of the optimal regulatory mechanism.

Our findings are that, for fixed territory, strong economies of scale allow local <b>exchange</b> <b>telecommunications</b> to retain monopoly characteristics even when the (informational) costs of regulation are properly accounted for, the incentive correction term is small in magnitude, and that optimal regulation can be well approximated through relatively simple linear contracts...|$|R

I propose broadening the definition of an index using a functional perspective—any portfolio strategy that satisfies three properties should be considered an index: (1) it is completely transparent; (2) it is investable; and (3) it is systematic, i. e., it is entirely rules-based and contains no judgment or unique investment skill. Portfolios satisfying these properties that are not market-cap-weighted are given a new name: “dynamic indexes. ” This functional definition widens the universe of possibilities and, most importantly, decouples risk management from alpha generation.

When the market underestimates the firm's ability to deliver quality, contingent price contracts are strictly optimal and increase the fraction of buyers.
