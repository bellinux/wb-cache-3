To <b>make</b> brief <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> of clinical success, coronary care units initially managed to reduce mortality by controlling severe arrhyth-mias and heart failure. Further reduction of major adverse cardiac events was subsequently achieved through early coronary artery reperfusion by means of pharmacological thrombolysis and percutaneous coronary intervention with stent deployment.

So they put me into a hand-barrow with an awning to it, and wheeled me down to the dock and on board a boat, and away to Blackwell's Island to the Corporation Hospital. There I got worse--got pretty much as you see me now. Couldn't cure me. After three years, I grew sick of lying in a grated iron bed {{alongside}} of groaning thieves and mouldering burglars. They gave me five silver dollars, and these crutches, and I hobbled off. I had an only brother who went to Indiana, years ago. I begged about, to <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> sum to go to him; got to Indiana at last, and they directed me to his grave. It was on a great plain, in a log-church yard with a stump fence, the old gray roots sticking all ways like moose-antlers. The bier, set over the grave, it being the last dug, was of green hickory; bark on, and green twigs sprouting from it. Some one had planted a bunch of violets on the mound, but it was a poor soil (always choose the poorest soils for grave-yards), and they were all dried to tinder. I was going to sit and rest myself on the bier and think about my brother in heaven, but the bier broke down, the legs being only tacked. So, after driving some hogs out of the yard that were rooting there, I came away, and, not to <b>make</b> too <b>long</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of it, here I am, drifting down stream like any other bit of wreck." ...|$|R

[...] The old gentleman {{staggers}} at this, as if somebody had hit him a blow on the chest, and cries, [...] "He! why he's a boy!" [...] Upon that, gentlemen, the Salamander cries out that he'll be twenty-one next Lady-day; and complains that his father has always been so busy with the sun round which the earth revolves, that he has never taken any notice of the son that revolves round him; and that he hasn't had a new suit of clothes since he was fourteen; and that he wasn't even taken out of nankeen frocks and trousers till he was quite unpleasant in 'em; and touches on a good many more family matters to the same purpose. To <b>make</b> short of <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story,</b> gentlemen, they all talk together, and cry together, and remind the old gentleman that as to the noble family, his own grandfather would have been lord mayor if he hadn't died at a dinner the year before; and they show him by all kinds of arguments that if the cousins are married, the prediction comes true every way. At last, the old gentleman being quite convinced, gives in; and joins their hands; and leaves his daughter to marry anybody she likes; and they are all well pleased; and the Gifted as well as any of them.|$|R
