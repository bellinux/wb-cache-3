5|$|In a 1989 {{review of}} the {{research}} on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then-prevalent idea of antisocial behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had <b>missed</b> <b>an</b> element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E
5|$|Injuries plagued Glencross {{throughout}} the 2013–14 season as he missed 15 games to a sprained knee, then suffered a high ankle sprain {{three weeks after}} his December 10 return.

In just the sixth game after his return, he scored his third career hat-trick in an 8-1 victory against the Edmonton Oilers.|$|E

Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill. Reforming newspapers quickly exposed {{the law and the}} bonus was repealed in January 1874.

5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin first {{appeared}} as a 40-week serial in The National Era, an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter narrative that would run {{for only a few}} weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that several protests were sent to the Era office when she <b>missed</b> <b>an</b> issue. Because of the story's popularity, the publisher John P. Jewett contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read Uncle Tom's Cabin in book form, she eventually consented to the request.|$|E
5|$|George Burley was {{appointed}} manager in January 2008. Burley suffered from disruptions to the squad. During a goalless home draw against Norway, Burley substituted in Chris Iwelumo, who <b>missed</b> <b>an</b> open goal from 3 yards. Striker Kris Boyd, {{who had been}} left on the bench, announced his retirement from international football. Burley dropped Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor from the team for a qualifying match against Iceland after it was reported they had been drinking through {{the night at the}} team hotel. The two players made gestures at photographers while sitting on the substitutes' bench during the match against Iceland and were then banned by the SFA. Despite failing to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the SFA initially decided to keep Burley in the job, but then decided to dismiss him after a heavy defeat in a friendly match against Wales.|$|E

Celtic were drawn against Real Madrid, and goals from George McCluskey and Johnny Doyle gave Celtic a 2–0 win in the first leg at Parkhead. Goalkeeper Peter Latchford had an {{excellent}} match, and in particular his saves from England striker Laurie Cunningham and Spanish star Santillana were crucial in helping Celtic keep a clean sheet. The return leg took place two weeks later at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in front of approximately 120,000 fans. Johnny Doyle <b>missed</b> <b>an</b> excellent chance to score early in the first half, and then just before half-time Santillana pulled a goal back for Real. Uli Stielike levelled the tie {{in the second half}} with a powerful volley past Latchford, before Juanito added a third near the end to send Celtic out 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E

Unfortunately for Cochet in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon <b>missed</b> <b>an</b> easy ball when three match points were at stake. Lacoste and Borotra revived {{from that moment on}} and closed out the final set 8–6. In singles he was put out of the contest by Borotra in the semifinals and thus was unable to retain his title.
