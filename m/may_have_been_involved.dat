5|$|They are {{medium-sized}} dog, {{and have}} a double layered coat, which comes {{in a variety of}} brown related shades. A versatile hunting dog, they are also suitable for apartment life due to work by breeders to develop a breed with an even temperament. The AWS <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> {{in the development of the}} Boykin Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Sussex Wilfrid was {{reconciled}} with Archbishop Theodore; the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says that Theodore expressed a desire for Wilfrid to succeed him at Canterbury. Wilfrid <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in founding monasteries near Bath {{as well as in}} other parts of Sussex, but the evidence backing this is based on the wording used in the founding charters resembling wording used by Wilfrid in other charters, not on any concrete statements that Wilfrid was involved.|$|E
5|$|Emicho's company {{then went}} on to Cologne, and others {{continued}} on to Trier, Metz, and other cities. Peter the Hermit <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia. Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of Coloman of Hungary. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.|$|E
50|$|Narasimhagupta's {{governor}} in Malwa, Bhanugupta <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in this conflict.|$|R
25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, Gregory's cave <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in {{the manufacture}} of moonshine.|$|R
50|$|In {{an article}} for Premiere magazine, Sam Raimi implied that Maguire and his Spider-Man co-star Kirsten Dunst <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> romantically <b>involved</b> during the production.|$|R
5|$|Tyrannosaur tooth marks are {{the most}} {{commonly}} preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. They have been reported from ceratopsians, hadrosaurs and other tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurid bones with tooth marks represent about 2% of known fossils with preserved tooth marks. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body, rather than knife-like cutting functions. Tooth wear patterns hint that complex head shaking behaviors <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in tyrannosaur feeding.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrive at}} the police station to see Billy. Doggett {{interviews}} the boy, who seems to be mute. In attempt to get Billy to speak, Doggett keeps his backpack from him. This infuriates Lisa and leads Scully to question Doggett’s expertise in child abduction cases. Scully suggests that Billy is an alien abductee, but Doggett believes Ronald Purnell, a local , <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in the boy's disappearance. Doggett questions Purnell, who expresses confusion when the agent suggests that he should meet Billy. As Doggett sits in his car, he pulls out a photo of his deceased son, Luke.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} reign, Echmarcach <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in {{military}} activities in Wales with Gruffudd ap Rhydderch (died 1055). For instance {{in the year}} 1049, English and Welsh sources record that Norse-Gaelic forces were utilised by Gruffudd ap Rhydderch against his Welsh rivals and English neighbours. Specifically, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the thirteenth/fourteenth-century Brut y Tywysogion, and the twelfth-century Chronicon ex chronicis record that a Norse-Gaelic fleet sailed up the River Usk, and ravaged the surrounding region. These sources further reveal that Gruffudd ap Rhydderch and his Norse-Gaelic allies later surprised and routed the English forces of Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester (died 1069).|$|E
50|$|Mr. Lapham was a Quaker but <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deeply <b>involved</b> in the occult. Workers at {{the house}} have {{reported}} unusual occurrences which some have attributed to paranormal activity.|$|R
25|$|Twain {{moved to}} San Francisco in 1864, {{still as a}} journalist, and met writers such as Bret Harte and Artemus Ward. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> romantically <b>involved</b> with the poet Ina Coolbrith.|$|R
50|$|Ua Dubhtaigh {{sponsored}} {{the creation of}} the Cross of Cong, which bears his name. He <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in {{the creation of the}} Corpus Missal, which dates from the early-to-mid 1130s.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, {{as is the case}} with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many {{opposition}} figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason. Between 1966 and 1967, two mutinies in Stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe. The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe {{was sentenced to death}} in absentia and the same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held under arrest in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu government <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved.</b> Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile by the promise of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Device Forts were {{designed}} and built by teams of English engineers. The master mason John Rogers was brought back from his work in France and worked on the Hull defences, while Sir Richard Lee, another of the King's engineers from his French campaigns, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> {{in the construction of}} Sandown and Southsea; the pair were paid the substantial sums of £30 and £36 a year respectively. Sir Richard Morris, the Master of Ordnance, and James Needham, the Surveyor of the King's Works, led on the defences along the Thames. The efforts of the Hampton Court Palace architectural team, under the leadership of the Augustinian canon, Richard Benese, contributed to the high-quality construction and detailing seen in many of Henry's Device projects.|$|E
50|$|Rougier <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in the {{independent}} construction of a 'Rougier' biplane, although {{there is only a}} single, hard to identify, photograph which may show a standard Voisin that was owned by Rougier.|$|R
50|$|McMynn {{school was}} torn down when McMynn Tower (Senior apartments) was built circa 1975. It was located across from Memorial Hall. Lucas Bradley, a local and builder <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in the {{building}} work.|$|R
5000|$|The crime <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unsolved for {{two years}} when, in October 2003, local media again covered the murder. Erickson {{reportedly}} had several dreams about the crime after seeing an article in a newspaper and, a few days later, mentioned the murder to Ferguson asking him if he thought he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved.</b> [...] "It <b>was</b> crazy that someone <b>had</b> <b>been</b> murdered a couple blocks away from where we <b>had</b> <b>been</b> partying". said Erickson. Ferguson reassured him that he <b>was</b> not <b>involved</b> in the crime. Over time, Erickson says, he began to think {{more and more about}} the murders and {{about the fact that he}} could not remember that evening.|$|R
5|$|The shock {{generated}} by the Pacific electric ray can be enough to knock down an adult human. It should be treated with caution, especially at night when it is active, and {{has been known to}} charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed. It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities, but <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in several unexplained, fatal diving accidents. This species fares poorly in captivity, as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium. Since 2000, the Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific electric rays by offering them moving food.|$|E
5|$|The small moon Dia, 4 {{kilometres}} in diameter, {{had gone}} missing since its discovery in 2000. One {{theory was that}} it had crashed into the much larger moon Himalia, 170 kilometres in diameter, creating a faint ring. This possible ring appears as a faint streak near Himalia in images from NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto. This suggests that Jupiter sometimes gains and loses small moons through collisions. However, the recovery of Dia in 2010 and 2011 disproves the link between Dia and the Himalia ring, although {{it is still possible}} that a different moon <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Acrocanthosaurus was its row of tall neural spines, {{located on the}} {{vertebrae}} of the neck, back, hips and upper tail, which could be more than 2.5times {{the height of the}} vertebrae from which they extended. Other dinosaurs also had high spines on the back, sometimes much higher than those of Acrocanthosaurus. For instance, the unrelated Spinosaurus had spines nearly 2meters (6.5ft) tall, about 11 times taller than the bodies of its vertebrae. The lower spines of Acrocanthosaurus had attachments for powerful muscles like those of modern bison, probably forming a tall, thick ridge down its back. The function of the spines remains unknown, although they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in communication, fat storage, or temperature control. All of its cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae had prominent depressions (pleurocoels) on the sides, while the caudal (tail) vertebrae bore smaller ones. This is more similar to carcharodontosaurids than to Allosaurus.|$|E
50|$|His brother, Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie, {{was from}} the far right, and, {{initially}} {{a member of the}} Action Française, <b>may</b> even <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> with the Cagoule terrorist group. Ultimately, Henri d'Astier also took part in the Resistance.|$|R
50|$|In 1052 William of Talou {{rebelled against}} his nephew Duke William of Normandy. Eustace <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in this rebellion, {{although}} there is no specific evidence, for after William of Talou's surrender he fled to the Boulonnais court.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{identity}} {{of the people who}} lived in the region at the time is not known, although some researchers have postulated that they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> belonged to the Kura-Araxes people and added that they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very <b>involved</b> in trade.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{submission}} of the English nobles, resistance continued for several years. William left control of England {{in the hands}} of his half-brother Odo and one of his closest supporters, William fitzOsbern. In 1067 rebels in Kent launched an unsuccessful attack on Dover Castle in combination with Eustace II of Boulogne. The Shropshire landowner Eadric the Wild, in alliance with the Welsh rulers of Gwynedd and Powys, raised a revolt in western Mercia, fighting Norman forces based in Hereford. These events forced William to return to England at the end of 1067. In 1068 William besieged rebels in Exeter, including Harold's mother Gytha, and after suffering heavy losses managed to negotiate the town's surrender. In May, William's wife Matilda was crowned queen at Westminster, an important symbol of William's growing international stature. Later in the year Edwin and Morcar raised a revolt in Mercia with Welsh assistance, while Gospatric, the newly appointed Earl of Northumbria, led a rising in Northumbria, which had not yet been occupied by the Normans. These rebellions rapidly collapsed as William moved against them, building castles and installing garrisons as he had already done in the south. Edwin and Morcar again submitted, while Gospatric fled to Scotland, as did Edgar the Ætheling and his family, who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in these revolts. Meanwhile, Harold's sons, who had taken refuge in Ireland, raided Somerset, Devon and Cornwall from the sea.|$|E
5|$|Development of Space Race began {{soon after}} the {{founding}} of Atari in Summer 1972 under the name Asteroid. Co-founders Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney had the initial idea for the game while developing the 1971 Computer Space, the first arcade video game, but felt the more complicated Computer Space was a better first game. After leaving Nutting Associates and founding Atari in May 1972, Bushnell spent a few days designing Asteroid, but soon had to drop the project to focus on running the company. After the release of Pong, Atari's first game, development resumed on the title in Spring 1973. Dabney has claimed credit for the game's final design, though Pong designer Allan Alcorn has stated that he and Bushnell <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> as well. Asteroid, codenamed VP-2, {{was designed to be}} a racing game that would be simple to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway; Atari had initially offered Pong during its development to fulfill the contract, but had been rejected. The company was also interested in producing a very different game from their previous success, as they felt that innovative design was what would separate them from their competitors, which they saw as flooding the market with Pong clones rather than making new video games.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{afterwards}} Ralph paid a {{visit to}} England, perhaps to visit Shrewsbury Abbey, which was a daughter house of Séez. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in the mediating the surrender of Robert of Bellême at Shrewsbury in 1102, for some chroniclers state that it was Ralph who delivered the keys of the castle to King Henry I of England. In 1103 he took refuge in England from the demands of Robert of Bellême for homage. Ralph declined to do homage because Pope Urban II had ordered that no clergy could do homage to the laity. Robert was also demanding heavy taxes, and Ralph fled with Serlo, Bishop of Séez, who was also subjected to Robert's demands. He passed his time in England with his friends Saint Anselm and Gundulf the Bishop of Rochester. He attended the translation of Saint Cuthbert's remains at Durham, where he was one of examiners of the body, and declared the saint's remains uncorrupt. In 1106 he visited Anselm at the Abbey of Bec, but probably did not try to assert himself at Séez. After Anselm was elected to the see of Canterbury, Ralph appears to have become part of the archbishop's household.|$|E
25|$|Dreyer (2007) {{suggest that}} Hong Bao <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> {{with several other}} destinations, such as Djofar, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, and Brava. However, P. Pelliot {{suggested}} that the fleet squadrons detached at Hormuz to travel to Aden, the East African ports and perhaps Lasa.|$|R
50|$|The film New Women {{is based}} on her life. It stars actress Ruan Lingyu who also {{committed}} suicide shortly after the film's release in 1935. It is speculated that director Cai Chusheng <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> romantically <b>involved</b> with Ai and thus, made the film for personal reasons.|$|R
50|$|Hitler <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> romantically <b>involved</b> with Erna, who <b>was</b> {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> beautiful, charming, cultured and intelligent.

25|$|Roger Stone, Republican {{strategist}} {{and political}} infighter <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in the discussions, {{and according to}} Pigeon, knew about the plan in advance.|$|E
25|$|Some {{allegations}} {{suggested that}} the former prime minister's son Mark Thatcher <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved,</b> however he has strongly denied receiving payments or exploiting his mother's connections in his business dealings.|$|E
25|$|There is {{not much}} known about how he {{supported}} himself during such extensive travels within and beyond the lands of Islam. Lunde and Stone speculate that like many travelers he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in trade.|$|E
5000|$|The Kingdom Come limited series {{featured}} {{an alternative}} Wonder Woman who {{was similar to}} the mainstream version. <b>Having</b> <b>been</b> created immortal by the gods, she retained her youth despite the passage of decades, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> romantically <b>involved</b> with a middle-aged Superman. This alternative Wonder Woman resided on Earth-22.|$|R
50|$|Baker (1606-58) was High Sheriff of Suffolk and {{connected}} {{to the court of}} Charles I. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> indirectly <b>involved</b> in another Bernini bust, carrying the triple portrait of Charles I by Van Dyck to Rome; it was from this portrait that Bernini carved the now-destroyed bust of King Charles.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{designer}} was Anthony Lloyd, {{although his}} partner, his father-in-law William Curtis Green RA (1875-1960), <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> in the design. Lloyd adopted an austere style, with some classical motifs. The building {{was described by}} Nikolaus Pevsner as [...] "large and monumental and self-consciously Lutyens, though with occasional rococo bits".|$|R
