5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} runs {{up and down}} the peninsula, to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, {{commuter}} buses run infrequently and, due to the length of the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses also come across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.|$|E
5|$|Meat was <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> {{therefore}} more prestigious. Game, {{a form of}} meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, the {{drainage}} boards {{have been charged}} with watching the rhynes and keeping them clear, under the overall responsibility of the Environment Agency. With rising sea levels, the work required to maintain the sea defences is likely to become <b>more</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> it has been proposed that two inland seas be created. Other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options.|$|E

50|$|Stealth {{aircraft}} are typically <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> to develop <b>and</b> manufacture. An {{example is the}} B-2 Spirit that is many times <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> to manufacture <b>and</b> support than conventional bomber aircraft. The B-2 program cost the U.S. Air Force almost $105 billion.|$|R

5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel {{capacity}} {{is more than}} double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can {{spend as much time}} as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> because traditional generators can adapt to demand. However both solar power and wind power are variable renewable energy, meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through transmission lines to {{where it can be}} used now. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid and for future 100% renewable energy scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a brief boom in textile {{manufacture}} {{was followed}} by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners (the textile trade was concentrated in Lancashire). Weavers who could have expected to earn 15shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw their wages cut to 5shillings or even 4s6d by 1818. The industrialists, who were cutting wages without offering relief, blamed market forces generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws, the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were forced to buy the <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large.|$|E

5|$|In July 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{expressed}} concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing {{might result in}} the destruction of the endangered least Bell's vireo habitat. Two of the four alternative routes considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course, which the public opposed. In April1988, the Sierra Club denounced the Prospect Avenue route; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards the golf course. Environmental concerns raised in June1988 related to the least Bell's vireo included decrease of insects, a darker environment after overpasses are constructed, and the fragmenting of habitat. Nevertheless, Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of a <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> less traveled northern route. Upset because of the delays, the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston, asking for their assistance. Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections.|$|E
5|$|Prior to federation, {{the various}} Australian colonies could, and often did, charge tariffs on goods {{from the other}} colonies, ostensibly for the {{protection}} of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest large city, <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets. In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity. Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings. Along the Riverina the Murray was—and remains—part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.|$|E
5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E

5|$|The film {{serves as}} a satire of the social conditions, {{dominant}} practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, {{as well as the}} film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Filmmaking was becoming <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> requiring larger technical resources, particularly with the rise of sound production, making it increasingly difficult for amateur filmmakers to enter the profession. This deepened a divide between amateurs and Hollywood professionals, and as a result, a growing number of amateurs started lampooning Hollywood in their films, including A Hollywood Extra. The subject of the film is an extra who starts his Hollywood career with hopes and dreams, but ultimately finds himself used and discarded by the industry, and his artistic ambitions destroyed. At the start of the film, the protagonist has a name (Mr. Jones) and a letter of recommendation outlining his talents, but his abilities are ignored and he is reduced to a number, symbolizing his dehumanization.|$|E
5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although {{it is seen as}} a high caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups because it is <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> larger than most places where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.|$|E
