40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the Norwegian <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> market {{by identifying the}} threats and possibilities for an insurance company to expand on the Norwegian market. The thesis uses a constructive research method. The main focus is on a market analysis consisting of a specific competitor analysis. By knowing the competition, {{the scope of the}} market and the average profitability the thesis will give a direction for insurance company X on how to continue their expansion on the Norwegian market. This is done by identifying the competitors on the market and analyzing them one by one. In addition theme interviews with <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>brokers</b> {{and a member of the}} Nordic <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> organization are held where the industry in general is analyzed.

The hull insurance market is dominated by a few large insurers while the protection and indemnity is dominated by one insurer. If an insurer wants to expand on the Norwegian market it is important to choose the right partners, carefully evaluate every risk and expand slowly...|$|R

5000|$|On 1 January 1887 {{she married}} Alexander Leslie Tweedie a <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>broker</b> born in India, and heir to a {{considerable}} fortune. They lived happily and well, in modest luxury, and had two sons, Harley Alexander Tweedie (6 May 1888 - 1926) and Leslie Kinloch Tweedie (11 January 1890 - 17 January 1916). Sadly, her husband died suddenly and unexpectedly at their home in Aldburgh, Suffolk nine years later, 25 May 1896, killed by the shock and responsibilities of financial disaster following the catastrophic failure of his marine insurance syndicate (caused by unforeseen British Admiralty court findings {{in the case of}} the ship the Benwell Tower [...] which ruined both Alexander and his brother George Straton Tweedie, and a third partner Frederick Stumore). A few weeks later her father also died suddenly intestate, leaving her nothing of his estate. She was left essentially destitute, with two young boys to raise. With no capital to draw on and no other means of income she turned to writing, relying on her writing skills and publishing contacts made during earlier, happier times.|$|E
40|$|The {{conduct of}} <b>Marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>broker</b> {{is subject to}} the general {{principles}} of agency law. However, it is also affected by the traditional customs and contemporary market practices in the field of marine insurance. As a result, marine insurance broker’s duties and liabilities have unique features which are different or not that common for other general agents. Firstly, marine insurance brokers have duties that will not be observed by other general agents who effect a contract on behalf of their principal. For example, <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>broker</b> has a personal liability to pay the premium under the marine insurance contract he obtained for the assured. Secondly, marine insurance broker’s multiple roles in the course of its business frequently raise the issue of conflict of duty and interest. Thirdly, the broker’s way of placing a cover makes it hard to put the line between the broker’s service of providing information and the service of providing advice. This is crucial for assessing the broker’s liabilities when he fails to obtain the cover for the assured. These exceptional features make marine insurance broker’s duties and liabilities a valuable topic for research. However, there is no scholarly monograph which specifically considers these matters. The thesis will examine whether the exceptional duties should be reformed to comply with the general law of contract and agency. If not, is there any reform that can be made to improve the clarity, certainty and fairness of these duties. The thesis will also identify the broker’s duties that are inclined to give rise to conflict of duty and interest and analyse how the issues are being treated by the court, and regulation authorities. Then the author will make recommendations on how to avoid the conflict of duties and interest. Finally, the thesis will discuss how the broker’s liabilities are being assessed and how the brokers can protect their own risks of extensive liability by inserting a limitation of liability clause in the retainer...|$|E

50|$|But {{insurance}} {{was also}} formalized as a contractual business, first offered by merchants {{as part of}} their normal trade, later by specialized insurers. This type of business started with <b>marine</b> <b>insurance.</b> In 1598 (three years before a similar institution was established in England) the city of Amsterdam instituted a Kamer van Assurantie en Avarij (Chamber of <b>Marine</b> <b>Insurance)</b> which was charged with regulating this business. This drew on the example of Antwerp where this business {{had been going on for}} a long time before that. From 1612 on the Assuradeuren (<b>insurance</b> <b>brokers)</b> had their own corner in the Amsterdam stock exchange, where they offered policies on hulls and cargoes to many different destinations. From 1626 the prijscourant (offering stock and bond prices) of the Dutch stock exchanges offered quotations for ten destinations. A century later that number had grown to 21. A large number of private firms insured domestic and foreign shipping alike, making Amsterdam Europe's principal center for <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> until the third quarter of the 18th century. One of these companies, founded during the 1720 Dutch financial Bubble (related to the English and French bubbles of the same year) as the Maatschappij van Assurantie, Discontering en Beleening der Stad Rotterdam has been continuously doing business as an insurance firm, Stad Rotterdam Verzekeringen, to this day.|$|R
