Two regimes of reaction rate were observed in aqueous buffer, clear second order kinetics resulted in DMAc. In aqueous buffer (pH 7. 4) a reactivity thiolysis > aminolysis > hydrolysis was found, while in DMAc aminolysis was faster than thiolysis. This can be explained by formation of thiolate at pH 7. 4, which is not possible in anhydrous DMAc. Reactions of (MDI(AcCys) 2) are by a factor of 2 to 4 faster than those of pTI-AcCys. p-Toluidine (pTA) was found in the aqueous system due to hydrolysis, while no 4, 4 ’-methylene dianiline (MDA) could be detected. Under physiological conditions hydrolysis should compete with thiolysis under homogeneous conditions while ureas and carbamates should be much more stable against hydrolysis. No free isocyanate groups could be detected in any of the reactions.

The flavoprotein alcohol oxidase from the yeast Candida boidinii catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols to aidehydes with transfer of the electrons to molecular oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide. The mechanism of alcohol oxidase with beta substituted ethanois as substrates has been examined using kinetic isotope effects, structure-reactivity correlations, and pH effects. Initial velocity line patterns for ethanol and bromoethanol as substrates for alcohol oxidase showed parallel lines, consistent with an irreversible step between the binding of the alcohol and oxygen, whereas <b>methoxyethanol,</b> fluoroethanol, chloroethanol, iodoethanol, and trifluoroethanol showed intersecting line patterns, consistent with a reversible step between the binding of the alcohol and oxygen. The effects of substituents in beta substituted ethanois on V/K values showed a good correlation with the a, value of the substituent after correction for steric, and hydrophobic effects, with a p value of- 1. 24. This value is inconsistent with a carbanion intermediate. Primary and solvent deuterium isotope effects were determined on the V/K values for several beta substituted ethanols. As the primary deuterium isotope effect increased, the solvent isotope effect decreased. The observed D(V/K) EtOH values in H 2 O (1. 54 ? 0. 14) and D 20 (1. 51 ? 0. 19) were similar, consistent with a concerted mechanism. The above studies are consistent with an asynchronous concerted mechanism in which the OH bond cleavage is further advanced than carbon hydrogen bond cleavage. With methanol, ethanol, and trifluoroethanol as substrates for alcohol oxidase, a single ionizable group with a pKa value of 8. 3 must be deprotonated for binding and catalysis. This residue is proposed to be histidine. The D(V/K) EtOH values at low pH (1. 62 ? 0. 12) and high pH (1. 54 ? 0. 14) were similar, consistent with ethanol not being a sticky substrate...|$|E

Proteins from forelimb buds GD 11 � 4 h, which were precipitated out using 40 – 60 % ammonium sulfate, then were analyzed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 -D SDS–PAGE) technique. The 2 -D gels reveal one protein with 41. 6 kDa and pI 6. 4, which expression was downregulated after MAA treatment. Tentative protein identification via peptide mass database search and definitive protein identification via a primary sequence database search indicate that the protein matches exactly to 34 / 67 kDa laminin binding protein (LBP; P 14206, SwissProt), which is encoded by p 40 gene (MGI: 105381).

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that the perovskite-related body-centred cubic material CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 (CCTO) exhibit extraordinarily giant dielectric constant at room temperature (ε ≈ 104 - 105). Besides, these high dielectric constants were found to be nearly constant in the temperature range between 100 and 500 K [1, 2]; which makes it even more attractive from the technological point of view. These properties are very important for device implementation and make CCTO a promising candidate for microelectronic applications (like decoupling capacitors, random access memories), microwave devices (for applications in mobile phones), antennas (for example, planar micro-strip antenna on CCTO substrate for 3 -GHz operation) [3]. In the microelectronics device field, homogeneous and smooth thin films with colossal dielectric constant and with low dielectric loss are desirable. In the literature, only five reports on undoped CCTO films on silicon based substrates prepared by sol-gel method can be found. The majority of these authors did not present the dielectric and microstructural properties of the produced CCTO films. In this work, thin films of CCTO were prepared by sol-gel method by spin coating a nontoxic chemical solution on typical microelectronic substrates, Si (wafer) / SiO 2 (300 nm) / TiO 2 (20 nm) / Pt (150 nm). Two different precursor solutions were studied and optimized for film production. These two solutions differ mainly on the titanium precursor, although some preparation parameters where changed as well. One of the main objectives of the thesis was to develop nontoxic precursors for CSD method and accordingly, solutions were prepared without <b>methoxyethanol</b> (highly toxic). This constitutes a great improvement considering the good properties obtained for the 300 - 400 nm thick CCTO films prepared in this work: dielectric permittivity, ε of 500 and dielectric loss, tan of 0. 19, for films derived from titanium butoxide precursor solutions (BUT-CCTO) and ε ≈ 620 and dielectric loss 0. 18 for those derived from titanium isopropoxide precursor solutions (ISO-CCTO), all values at 1 kHz. In literature, toxic precursor solution of CCTO leads to films with values for dielectric permittivity of 1000 - 2000 and dielectric loss between 0. 5 – 0. 04 [52]. Best reports on nontoxic solutions for spin coating method presented dielectric constant (≈ 150 - 250) and losses around 0. 2 - 0. 5 [45]. The physical properties of the films were characterised. The structural and microstructural characterization was conducted via X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). [CALCIUM COPPER TITANIUM OXIDE THIN FILMS FOR MICROELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS] 10 For the electrical characterization the dielectric constant and dielectric losses were measured at room temperature in the range 100 Hz- 1 MHz. AFM microstructure and especially potential images, confirmed IBLC model for conduction, since grain and grain boundaries presented different potentials due to their different electrical behaviour. This result was obtained for every sample made with both solutions. Grain size has a considerable influence on the dielectric properties of the thin films. grain films present high dielectric constant and high dielectric loss. Small grain origins lower dielectric constant but also low dielectric loss. In this work and based on IBLC model, it was found that grain and high grain boundaries density will guarantee good permittivity according with [6, 9], although with grain size increase, grain boundaries density decrease. An intermediate stage for grain size must be achieved depending on the solution used. Considering the dielectric loss, it was found to respect mainly to grain boundaries. High density of grain boundaries promotes second phase segregation (TiO 2) due to low temperature heat treatments and worst insulator behaviour [18, 24]. For one side, high density will lower dielectric loss confirming [6, 13], on the other side, second phase segregation will increase it, as reported in [18, 24]. A compromise between the capacity of the semiconductor grains to admit charges and the resistivity of the insulator grain boundaries must be achieved to obtain good quality CCTO thin films. The admission of charges by the grain is controlled by the grain size (heat treatment procedure) meanwhile the current density of the grain boundaries is controlled by second phase segregation (solution procedure) and grain boundaries density (heat treatment procedure). As a final output of this work a new non-toxic precursor solution was developed as an alternative way for preparing CCTO thin films of high dielectric constant for microelectronic applications.
