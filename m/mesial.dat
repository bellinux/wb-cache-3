5|$|Slow lorises have {{relatively}} large maxillary canine teeth, their inner (<b>mesial)</b> maxillary incisors {{are larger than}} the outer (distal) maxillary incisors, {{and they have a}} diastema (gap) between the canine and the first premolar. The first mandibular premolar is elongated, and the last molar has three cusps on the crown, the shortest of which is near the back. The bony palate (roof of the mouth) only goes {{as far back as the}} second molar.|$|E

25|$|According to Rauhut (2000), Ceratosaurus can be {{distinguished}} from related genera based on the following features: a narrow rounded horn core centrally placed on the fused nasals, a median oval groove on nasals behind horn core, a premaxilla with three teeth, premaxillary teeth with reduced extent of <b>mesial</b> serrations, chevrons that are extremely long, a pubis with a large, rounded notch underneath the obturator foramen, small epaxial osteoderms.|$|E
25|$|In Sri Lanka and the {{southern}} extent of its Indian range, the snake is primarily greenish yellow or pale green. Each scale has a black <b>mesial</b> streak or spot, and {{is more or less}} edged with black. The snake also has dark crossbars at intervals. A series of large, flower-shaped, reddish or orange vertebral spots may be present or absent. Ventrals greenish, outside the keel edged with black or spotted. Head black with vellow crossbars and spots. The flower-shaped spots are commoner in Sri Lanka than in south India.|$|E
25|$|Adda et al. (2008) {{assessed}} {{patients with}} episodic memory impairment due to epilepsy associated with <b>mesial</b> temporal sclerosis. Patients with this disorder have {{damage in the}} medial temporal lobe and hippocampus. Their performance on both event-based and time-based prospective memory tasks was significantly impaired. Their prospective memory performance was also worse {{than that of the}} control group after immediate, 30-minute, and seven-day delays, but was especially noticeable after the long delays because the patients could not maintain information for long periods of time. Patients also suffered in their speed of processing, disregarding distractions, and episodic memory.|$|E
25|$|Certain drugs {{increase}} the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated {{in the cause of}} déjà vu. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the <b>mesial</b> temporal areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|A single maxilla {{is present}} in the well-preserved {{material}} of Europasaurus, DFMMh/FV 291.17. This maxilla has a long body, with two elongate processes, a nasal and a posterior process. There is only a weak lacrimal process, like in most sauropods except Rapetosaurus. The nasal process is elongate and covers the anterior and ventral rim of the antorbital fenestra. This process extends about 120º from the horizontal tooth row. The base of the nasal process also forms the body of the lacrimal process, and at their divergence is the antorbital fenestra, similar in shape to those of Camarasaurus, Euhelopus, Abydosaurus and Giraffatitan, but about 1/2 taller proportionally. The pre-antorbital fenestra, a small opening in front of or beneath the antorbital opening, is well developed in taxa like Diplodocus and Tapuiasaurus, is nearly absent, like in Camarasaurus and Euhelopus. There were about 12-13 total teeth in the maxilla of Europasaurus, fewer than in more basal taxa (16 teeth in Jobaria and 14-25 in Atlasaurus), but falls within the range of variation in Brachiosauridae (15 in Brachiosaurus to 10 in Abydosaurus). All of the unworn teeth preserved display up to four small denticles on their <b>mesial</b> edges. A small amount of the posterior tooth crowns are slightly twisted (~15º), but much less than in brachiosaurids (30-45º).|$|E

The juvenile is warm brown above, with rusty fringes to the upperparts; and coarsely barred or spotted brown below, with pale yellow eyes; its throat has dark streaks and lacks a <b>mesial</b> (midline) stripe.|$|E
500|$|People whose PTE {{does not}} respond to {{medication}} may undergo surgery to remove the epileptogenic focus, {{the part of the}} brain that is causing the seizures. However surgery for PTE may be more difficult than it is for epilepsy due to other causes, and is less likely to be helpful in PTE than in other forms of epilepsy. It can be particularly difficult in PTE to localize the epileptic focus, in part because TBI may affect diffuse areas of the brain. Difficulty locating the seizure focus is seen as a deterrent to surgery. However, for people with sclerosis in the <b>mesial</b> temporal lobe (in the inner aspect of the temporal lobe), who comprise about one third of people with intractable PTE, surgery is likely to have good outcome. [...] When there are multiple epileptic foci or the focus cannot be localized, and drug therapy is not effective, vagus nerve stimulation is another option for treating PTE.|$|E

2500|$|Prosopagnosia is an {{inability}} to identify faces and face-like objects. [...] This represents a failure to encode incoming visual information. Neurological studies indicate that prosopagnosia is associated with bilateral lesions of the central visual system, primarily located in the <b>mesial</b> occipitotemporal region. The inability to correctly recognize a face can have detrimental consequences for building social relationships {{due to the fact}} that recognition is required for associating feelings or experiences with a stimulus.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{textbooks}} have reproduced the outdated Penfield-Rasmussen diagram, {{with the}} toes and genitals on the <b>mesial</b> {{surface of the}} cortex when they are actually represented on the convexity. The classic diagram implies a single primary sensory map of the body, when there are multiple primary maps. At least four separate, anatomically distinct sensory homunculi {{have been identified in}} the postcentral gyrus. They represent combinations of input from surface and deep receptors and rapidly [...] and slowly adapting peripheral receptors; smooth objects will activate certain cells, and rough objects will activate other cells.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the use of}} extraoperative and {{intraoperative}} ECoG in resectioning surgery {{has been}} an accepted clinical practice for several decades, {{recent studies have shown}} that the usefulness of this technique may vary based on the type of epilepsy a patient exhibits. [...] Kuruvilla and Flink reported that while intraoperative ECoG plays a critical role in tailored temporal lobectomies, in multiple subpial transections (MST), and in the removal of malformations of cortical development (MCDs), it has been found impractical in standard resection of medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with MRI evidence of <b>mesial</b> temporal sclerosis (MTS). A study performed by Wennberg, Quesney, and Rasmussen demonstrated the presurgical significance of ECoG in frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) cases.|$|E
2500|$|The etiology, {{or cause}} of edentulism, can be multifaceted. [...] While the {{extraction}} of non-restorable or non-strategic teeth by a dentist does contribute to edentulism, the predominant cause of tooth loss in developed countries is periodontal disease. [...] While the teeth may remain completely decay-free, the bone surrounding and providing support to the teeth may reabsorb and disappear, giving rise to tooth mobility and eventual tooth loss. [...] In the radiograph {{at the beginning of}} the article, tooth #21 (the lower left first premolar, to the right of #22, the lower left canine) exhibits 50% bone loss, presenting with a distal horizontal defect and a <b>mesial</b> vertical defect. [...] Tooth #22 exhibits roughly 30% bone loss.|$|E

50|$|From {{a facial}} aspect, maxillary canines are {{approximately}} one millimetre narrower than the central incisor. Their <b>mesial</b> aspects resemble the adjacent lateral incisors, while their distal aspects anticipate the first premolars. They are slightly darker and more yellow in color {{than the other}} anterior teeth. From a lingual aspect, they have well developed <b>mesial</b> and distal marginal ridges and a well-developed cingulum. A prominent lingual ridge divides the lingual aspect in half and creates the <b>mesial</b> and distal lingual fossae between the lingual ridge and the marginal ridges. From a proximal aspect, they resemble the incisors, but are more robust, especially in the cingulum region. Incisally, they are visibly asymmetrical, as the <b>mesial</b> incisal edge is slightly shorter than the distal incisal edge, which places the cusp slightly <b>mesial</b> to the long axis of the tooth. They are also thicker labiolingually than mesiodistally. Because of the disproportionate incisal edges, the contacts are also asymmetrical. Mesially, the contact sits at the junction of the incisal and middle third of the crown, while distally, the contact as more cervical, {{in the middle of}} the middle third of the crown.|$|E
