The MicroEngine could compile Pascal source code in {{a fraction of the}} time (typically about 1/10) required by contemporaries. Fast compilation made the MicroEngine especially nice as a developer's machine, and the inclusion of a semaphore primitive in the microcode was particularly useful for multi user enhancements, which were developed in Melbourne for the Canberra Australia-based Ortex Company, extended to be a <b>multiuser</b> <b>system</b> and often sold with a bundled pharmacy management system, also delivered on the Sage IV computers under UCSD Pascal IV and enabled as a <b>multiuser</b> <b>system</b> using the Sage multiuser bios rather than by extending UCSD Pascal IV to add a semaphore. This performance advantage was eroded by the later availability of p-code to native machine code translators, and mainstream 16-bit microprocessors such as the Intel 8086 and Motorola 68000.|$|E

30|$|In {{point-to-point}} scenarios, the queueing {{delay is}} the dominant factor in the system delay [14] while in <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems</b> an additional delay factor is introduced, because the system resources are {{not all the time}} available to the same user. We name this additional delay factor as the scheduling delay in <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems.</b> In the round robin systems (e.g., TDMA) the user access to the channel is known in advance, so that its scheduling delay can be easily calculated. However, in opportunistic <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems</b> where the users with the best channel conditions are selected for transmission based on their instantaneous SNIR, a user does not have any guarantee for being scheduled in a specific time, which increases its scheduling delay.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In <b>multiuser</b> {{diversity}} <b>systems,</b> {{the impact}} of largescale fading on the total system performance such as link quality and system power has not been widely addressed. Considering large-scale fading, we propose an adaptive multiuser scheduling to minimize the total system power while reducing the effect of large-scale fading on the system bit error rate. The number of active users is adapted to every shadow variation, which varies slower than small-scale fading. We consider the two widely used <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e., delay-tolerant, and delay-sensitive <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems).</b> Closed-form expressions for the bit error rate are derived. The selection procedure for the minimum number of users is introduced for guaranteed performance of the above <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems.</b> The impact of adaptive multiuser diversity gain on the system power and bit error rate is illustrated over large-scale fading channels by numerical results.

30|$|In this paper, a {{comprehensive}} comparison analysis {{in terms of}} outage probability and average symbol error ratio (SER) is presented for cooperative cognitive multiple-input and multiple-output (CC-MIMO) <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems</b> with amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. Specially, we consider two scenarios where the CC-MIMO <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems</b> have the perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). The CC-MIMO <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems</b> consist of one multi-antenna source, one single-antenna relay, and multiple multi-antenna destinations. At the secondary source and destinations, the maximal ratio transmission (MRT) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) are employed, respectively. For such CC-MIMO <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems,</b> we first obtain the exact closed-form expressions of outage probability under the two cases where the CC-MIMO <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems</b> have the perfect and imperfect CSI. Then, to reduce the implementation complexity, the tight lower bounds of outage probability and average SER are derived. Finally, to obtain insight, by using the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximation, the asymptotic estimations of outage probability are achieved. The numerical {{results show that the}} derivations are agreed with the simulations, which validate our derivations. At the same time, the results show that, for the systems without perfect CSI, the achievable diversity order reduces to one, regardless of the number of antennas at the cognitive source and destinations as well as the number of the cognitive destinations. Nevertheless, these key parameters affect the coding gain of the CC-MIMO <b>multiuser</b> <b>systems.</b> When the systems have the perfect CSI (or without feedback delay), the achievable diversity gain is determined by the minimum between the number of source’s antennas and the product of the number of destinations and the number of destination’s antennas. For the effect of PU’s parameters, our results indicate that primary systems only affect the coding gain but not the diversity gain.|$|R
50|$|OSv (stylized OSv) is a cloud {{computing}} focused computer operating system released on September 16, 2013. It is a special-purpose operating system built {{to run as}} a guest {{on top of a}} virtual machine, thus it does not include drivers for bare-metal hardware. It is a unikernel, designed to run a single Linux executable or an application written in one of the supported runtime environments (such as Java). For this reason, it does not support a notion of users (it's not a <b>multiuser</b> <b>system)</b> or processes - everything runs in the kernel address space. Using a single address space removes some of the time-consuming operations associated with context switching. It uses large amounts of code from the FreeBSD operating system, in particular the network stack and the ZFS file system. OSv can be managed using a REST Management API and an optional command line interface written in Lua.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{analytical}} framework {{to evaluate the}} system capacity of two cellular systems in an interference-limited environment: a single-user system with and without other-cell interference and a <b>multiuser</b> <b>system</b> with and without other-cell interference. In a <b>multiuser</b> <b>system,</b> we adopt the multiuser diversity scheme. We derive closed-form expressions of the system capacity for the above four cases. The analytical results agree well with simulation result. Other-cell interference with large variances increases the achievable throughput, while the averaged other-cell interference reduces the system capacity. In addition, we show that a fairness problem arising between inner cells and outer cells in the cellular network can be improved by using other-cell interference in the <b>multiuser</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, the multiuser diversity scheme {{can be a good}} candidate for future cellular networks.

We {{assume that the}} receiver is able to use all transmitted pilots, which {{is the case in}} broadcasting and in the downlink of a <b>multiuser</b> <b>system.</b> Four estimators (of which two have been proposed in the literature) are compared, both in terms of mean-squared error and bit-error rates. In the latter case, we simulate a <b>multiuser</b> <b>system</b> which incorporates channel coding. The channel estimation is a two-dimensional problem (time and frequency), and both separable and non-separable estimators are investigated. We design low-rank approximations of these estimators, and compare the performance at given complexities. The comparison shows that the use of separable estimators increases the performance substantially, compared to non-separable estimators with the same complexity. For the scenario investigated in this report the performance is further improved by applying low-rank approximations separable estimators. Godkänd; 1996; 20080220 (ysko...|$|E
