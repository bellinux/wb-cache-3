25|$|Lead(II,IV) oxide, {{also called}} <b>minium,</b> red lead or triplumbic tetroxide, {{is a bright}} red or orange {{crystalline}} or amorphous pigment. Chemically, red lead is Pb3O4, or 2PbO·PbO2. It {{is used in the}} manufacture of batteries, lead glass and rustproof primer paints.|$|E
25|$|Spanish {{influence}} {{changed the}} way in which Aztecs used pigments, particularly in their manuscripts. For example, Cochineal was replaced by Spanish dyes like <b>minium</b> and alizarin crimson. The image of Moctezuma's death (seen to the right) uses both indigenous and Spanish pigments, and is therefore representative of the transition and influence between cultures.|$|E
25|$|Lead(II,IV) oxide {{was used}} as a red pigment in ancient Rome, where it was {{prepared}} by calcination of white lead. In the ancient and medieval periods it {{was used as}} a pigment in the production of illuminated manuscripts, and gave its name to the <b>minium</b> or miniature, a style of picture painted with the colour. As a finely divided powder, it was also sprinkled on dielectric surfaces to study Lichtenberg figures.|$|E
25|$|Lead tetraoxide is {{most often}} used as a pigment for primer paints for iron objects. Due to its toxicity, its use is being limited. In the past, it was used in {{combination}} with linseed oil as a thick, long-lasting anti-corrosive paint. The combination of <b>minium</b> and linen fibres was also used for plumbing, now replaced with PTFE tape. Currently it is mostly used for manufacture of glass, especially lead crystal glass. It finds limited use in some amateur pyrotechnics as a delay charge and {{was used in the}} past in the manufacture of dragon's egg pyrotechnic stars.|$|E
500|$|The {{document}} is a [...] scroll consisting of {{three pieces of}} parchment glued together and rolled, and {{is believed to have}} been created in the Fulda monastery. A scientific study of the purple parchment took place in Munich in 1966, which showed that <b>minium</b> (red lead) and madder were used for staining the document, indicating that it was created in the Holy Roman Empire, rather than in the Byzantine Empire, where the Murex shell for making Tyrian purple was tightly controlled. This {{document is}} one of the oldest surviving examples of madder being used in the Middle Ages. The purple background was made from Byzantine silk woven with fourteen circular medallions and two half medallions. The medallions contain representations of animals fighting, inspired by Near Eastern art.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} is a total of eleven-stories high, with nine floors for patients and two additional mechanical floors. As opposed to standing parallel to the street, the building was built at a diagonal or [...] " [...] ", facing southwest towards the intersection of Parsons and 82nd Drive. The orientation allowed afternoon sunlight to hit {{the front of the}} building. It features one main wing facing southwest, with shorter wings at each end angled inward to fit the property. The hospital was built with a patient capacity of over 500 with six-bed hospital wards. It was designed with numerous windows and glass interior walls, glass-encolsed sunrooms or solariums, and cantilever balconies, all to maximize natural light entering the facility and exposure of patients to the sun. Each floor of the hospital had three sunrooms. Its basement was built with locker, dining, and storage facilities, along with a tunnel connecting to the then-Queens General Hospital buildings. Triboro Hospital's outer design has a [...] "symmetrical facade and a <b>minium</b> of ornamentation," [...] utilizing gray brick and limestone trim. It was built with four elevators installed by the Otis Elevator Company.|$|E
60|$|These Colours {{arise from}} hence, that some natural Bodies reflect some sorts of Rays, others other sorts more copiously than the rest. <b>Minium</b> {{reflects}} the least refrangible or red-making Rays most copiously, and thence appears red. Violets reflect the most refrangible most copiously, and thence have their Colour, and so of other Bodies. Every Body reflects the Rays {{of its own}} Colour more copiously than the rest, and from their excess and predominance in the reflected Light has its Colour.|$|E
60|$|And next, the Solution of all Metals into menstruums {{are much}} {{the same with the}} Vitriols, or Crystals. It seems {{therefore}} very probable, that those colours which are made by the precipitation of those particles out of the menstruums by transparent precipitating liquors should be transparent also. Thus Gold precipitates with oyl of Tartar, or spirit of Urine into a brown Yellow, Copper with spirit of Urine into a Mucous blue, which retains its transparency. A solution of sublimate (as the same Illustrious Authour I lately mention'd shews in his 40. Experiment) precipitates with oyl of Tartar per deliquium, into an Orange colour'd precipitate; nor is it less probable, that the calcination of those Vitriols by the fire, should have their particles transparent: Thus Saccarum Saturni, or the Vitriol of Lead by calcination becomes a deep Orange-colour'd <b>minium,</b> which is a kind of precipitation by some Salt which proceeds from the fire; common Vitriol calcin'd, yields a deep Brown Red, etc.|$|E
60|$|These {{considerations}} premis'd, will, I suppose, {{make way}} for the more easie reception of this following Explication of the Phænomena of hardned and temper'd Steel. That Steel is a substance made out of Iron, by means of a certain proportionate Vitrification of several parts, which are so curiously and proportionately mixt with the more tough and unalter'd parts of the Iron, that when by the great heat of the fire this vitrify'd substance is melted, and consequently rarify'd, and thereby the pores of the Iron are more open, if then by means of dipping it in cold water it be suddenly cold, and the parts hardned, that is, stay'd in that same degree of Expansion they were in when hot, the parts become very hard and brittle, and that upon the same account almost as small parcels of glass quenched in water grow brittle, which we have already explicated. If after this the piece of Steel be held in some convenient heat, till by degrees certain colours appear up{{on the surface of the}} brightned metal, the very hard and brittle tone of the metal, by degrees relaxes and becomes much more tough and soft; namely, the action of the heat does by degrees loosen the parts of the Steel that were before streached or set atilt as it were, and stayed open by each other, whereby they become relaxed and set at liberty, whence some of the more brittle interjacent parts are thrust out and melted into a thin skin on the surface of the Steel, which from no colour increases to a deep Purple, and so onward by these gradations or consecutions, White, Yellow, Orange, <b>Minium,</b> Scarlet, Purple, Blew, Watchet, &c. and the parts within are more conveniently, and proportionately mixt; and so they gradually subside into a texture which is much better proportion'd and closer joyn'd, whence that rigidnesse of parts ceases, and the parts begin to acquire their former ductilness.|$|E
60|$|Exper. 15. Lastly, In {{attempting}} to compound a white, by mixing the coloured Powders which Painters use, I consider'd that all colour'd Powders do suppress and stop in them a very considerable Part of the Light {{by which they}} are illuminated. For they become colour'd by reflecting the Light of their own Colours more copiously, and that of all other Colours more sparingly, and yet they {{do not reflect the}} Light of their own Colours so copiously as white Bodies do. If red Lead, for instance, and a white Paper, be placed in the red Light of the colour'd Spectrum made in a dark Chamber by the Refraction of a Prism, as is described in the third Experiment of the first Part of this Book; the Paper will appear more lucid than the red Lead, and therefore reflects the red-making Rays more copiously than red Lead doth. And if they be held in the Light of any other Colour, the Light reflected by the Paper will exceed the Light reflected by the red Lead in a much greater Proportion. And the like happens in Powders of other Colours. And therefore by mixing such Powders, we are not to expect a strong and full White, such as is that of Paper, but some dusky obscure one, such as might arise from a Mixture of Light and Darkness, or from white and black, that is, a grey, or dun, or russet brown, such as are the Colours of a Man's Nail, of a Mouse, of Ashes, of ordinary Stones, of Mortar, of Dust and Dirt in High-ways, and the like. And such a dark white I have often produced by mixing colour'd Powders. For thus one Part of red Lead, and five Parts of Viride Æris, composed a dun Colour like that of a Mouse. For these two Colours were severally so compounded of others, that in both together were a Mixture of all Colours; and there was less red Lead used than Viride Æris, because of the Fulness of its Colour. Again, one Part of red Lead, and four Parts of blue Bise, composed a dun Colour verging a little to purple, and by adding to this a certain Mixture of Orpiment and Viride Æris in a due Proportion, the Mixture lost its purple Tincture, and became perfectly dun. But the Experiment succeeded best without <b>Minium</b> thus. To Orpiment I added by little and little a certain full bright purple, which Painters use, until the Orpiment ceased to be yellow, and became of a pale red. Then I diluted that red by adding a little Viride Æris, and a little more blue Bise than Viride Æris, until it became of such a grey or pale white, as verged to no one of the Colours more than to another. For thus it became of a Colour equal in Whiteness to that of Ashes, or of Wood newly cut, or of a Man's Skin. The Orpiment reflected more Light than did any other of the Powders, and therefore conduced more to the Whiteness of the compounded Colour than they. To assign the Proportions accurately may be difficult, by reason of the different Goodness of Powders of the same kind. Accordingly, as the Colour of any Powder is more or less full and luminous, it ought to be used in a less or greater Proportion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Minium</b> {{was named}} for the Iberian river known to the {{imperial}} Romans as Minius, {{now known as the}} Spanish Miño and the Portuguese Minho. The name was originally applied to certain forms of cinnabar that had been coated with the <b>minium</b> oxide; however, once the red lead contaminant was determined to be chemically distinct from cinnabar crystals, the name, <b>minium,</b> was applied.|$|E
50|$|<b>Minium</b> is the {{naturally}} occurring form of lead tetroxide, Pb2+2Pb4+O4 {{also known as}} red lead. <b>Minium</b> is a light-to-vivid red and may have brown-to-yellow tints. It typically occurs in scaly-to-earthy masses. It crystallizes in the tetragonal crystal system.|$|E
50|$|There was (and is) {{considerable}} confusion {{among the}} names of ancient and medieval pigments. As noted above, the term <b>minium</b> was used for cinnabar, vermilion, and for red lead. <b>Minium</b> of red lead was sometimes called stupium in classical Latin, adding to the confusion.|$|E

50|$|Red lead or Lead tetroxide pigment {{was widely}} {{used as the}} red in Persian and Indian {{miniature}} paintings {{as well as in}} European art, where it was called <b>minium.</b>|$|E
50|$|During the Roman Empire, {{the term}} <b>minium</b> could refer {{either to the}} pigment made from ground {{cinnabar}} or to the less expensive red lead. The name came from the river Minius in Iberia (now forming part of the Spanish-Portuguese border and known as Miño or Minho), located near the main Roman cinnabar mines. Pliny the Elder {{referred to it as}} flammeus, or flame color. The <b>minium</b> of red lead was easy to make and less expensive than the pigment made from the mineral cinnabar, and it was bright and cheerful, so it became the most commonly used bright red in Medieval painting until the introduction of vermilion.|$|E
