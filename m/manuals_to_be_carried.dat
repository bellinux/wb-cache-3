30|$|The {{question}} <b>is</b> how <b>to</b> {{choose the}} sample areas where <b>manual</b> classification <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> out. A {{wide variety of}} strategies <b>is</b> available <b>to</b> this end. The determination of the minimum -variance strategy to estimate population totals and averages is a challenging issue when the strategies are evaluated from a design-based point of view. Indeed, under design-based inference {{there is a lack}} of optimal results, in the sense that it <b>is</b> not possible <b>to</b> determine the minimum-variance strategy, as is customary in model-based approaches (e.g. Thompson 2002, Chapter 9). Accordingly, we claim no general validity about the results achieved; these should <b>be</b> ascribed <b>to</b> the conditions under which they have been obtained or extended, at most, to similar, related cases.|$|R
40|$|Through {{a series}} of {{creative}} projects this doctorate set out to research how computer-assisted composition (CAC) of music affects decision-making in my compositional practice. By reporting on the creative research journey, this doctorate is a contribution towards {{a better understanding of}} the implications of CAC by offering new insights into the composing process. It is also a contribution to the composition discipline as new techniques were devised, together with new applications of existing techniques. Using OpenMusic as the sole programming environment, the manual/machine interface was explored through different balances between manual and algorithmic composition and through aesthetic reflection guiding the composing process. This helped clarify the purpose, adequacy and nature of each method as decisions were constantly being taken towards completing the artistic projects. The most suitable use of algorithms was as an environment for developing, testing, refining and assessing compositional techniques and the music materials they generate: a kind of musical laboratory. As far as a technique can be described by a set of rules, algorithms can help formulate and refine it. Also capable of incorporating indeterminism, they can act as powerful devices in discovering unforeseen musical implications and results. Algorithms alone <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> insufficient <b>to</b> simulate human creative thought because aspects such as (but not limited to) imagination, judgement and personal bias could only, and hypothetically, be properly simulated by the most sophisticated forms of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, important aspects of composition such as instrumentation, articulation and orchestration <b>were</b> not subjected <b>to</b> algorithmic treatment because, not being sufficiently integrated in OpenMusic currently, they would involve a great deal of knowledge <b>to</b> <b>be</b> specified and adapted to computer language. These shortcomings of algorithms, therefore, implied varying degrees of <b>manual</b> interventions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> out on raw materials coming out of their evaluations. A combination of manual and algorithmic composition was frequently employed so as to properly handle musical aspects such as cadence, discourse, monotony, mechanicalness, surprise, and layering, among others. The following commentary illustrates this varying dialogue between automation and intervention, placing it in the wider context of other explorations at automating aspects of musical composition...|$|R
