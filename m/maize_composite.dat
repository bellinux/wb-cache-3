40|$|Natural fiber {{composites}} are termed as biocomposites {{or green}} composites. These fibers are green, biodegradable, and recyclable and have good properties such as low density and low cost {{when compared to}} synthetic fibers. The present work is investigated on the finite element analysis of the natural fiber (<b>maize)</b> <b>composite</b> beam, processed by means of hand lay-up method. Composite beam material is composed of stalk-based fiber of maize and unsaturated polyester resin polymer as matrix with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) as a catalyst and Cobalt Octoate as a promoter. The material was modeled and resembled as a structural beam using suitable assumption and analyzed by means of finite element method using ANSYS software for determining the deflection and stress properties. Morphological analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for the fiber were examined by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer.

Short-duration (SD) <b>maize</b> <b>composite</b> EWF- 2 was intercropped with SD pigeonpea cultivars ICPL 87091 and ICPL 87105 in one trial, and with medium-duration (MD) and long-duration (LD) cultivars ICP 6927 and ICEAP 00040, respectively, in a second trial. Yields of both crops in intercropping systems were generally lower than in monocropping systems. The yield reduction in intercropping systems for LD and MD pigeon pea cultivars was in the range 7. 4 - 31. 0 %, while that of maize ranged from 8. 7 to 38. 6 %. In the SD trial, yield reduction was in the range 36. 8 - 66. 3 % in pigeonpea and 12. 9 - 41. 9 % in maize.

Methods: ALV leaves were collected, cooked and mixed with either cooked fortified or unfortified maize porridge to simulate the way it is usually consumed. Mineral and antinutrient levels were determined using standard methods and the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc was determined using an in vitro dialysability assay. Findings: The findings of the present study indicated that ALV dishes contain a reasonable amount of iron and zinc, but combining the ALV dishes with unfortified maize porridge resulted in dilution and hence a lower iron content. The amaranth-pumpkin dish contained most iron (24 mg/ 100 g). ALV dishes in the study had zinc contents ranging from 2. 6 to 3. 2 mg/ 100 g, with amaranth mixed with spider plant having the highest zinc content. Regarding antinutrients, the amaranth-cowpea dish had the highest phytate content of 2078 mg/ 100 g dry weight. ALV dishes also contained tannins and phenolic compounds. Iron percentage bioaccessibility was high in an amaranth-spider plant dish (25 %), while other dishes had lower iron bioaccessibility of less than 11 %. The percentage bioaccessibility of zinc in ALV dishes ranged from 7 to 8 %. The amaranth-spider plant dish had higher zinc bioaccessibility when composited with fortified maize meal (13 %). The percentage zinc bioaccessibility is negatively associated with phytate:zinc and phyate-calcium:zinc molar ratios. Conclusions: ALV and <b>maize</b> meal <b>composite</b> dishes have a high iron and zinc content, though they also have a high antinutrient content that has some inhibitory effects. Despite the inhibiting factors, the amount of bioaccessible iron and zinc from ALV and <b>maize</b> porridge <b>composite</b> dishes could play a significant role in planning food security strategies. However, there is a need to understand the possible effects of consuming them in different combinations with other foods. Master...|$|R

40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) landraces {{are useful}} {{materials}} that can introduce new diversity into breeding programs, {{but they will}} need to be selected to maximize their agronomic performance. The objective {{of this study was to}} use molecular markers to investigate the changes in the genetic diversity and structure over the cycles of a maize breeding program that combined intra- and interpopulation recurrent selection for grain yield in two broad-based Spanish <b>maize</b> <b>composites.</b> Using 76 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and two flowering time related indels, this study looked at 10 populations derived from a breeding program designed to exploit the heterotic pattern northern Spain × southern Spain. Agronomic evaluations demonstrated that the selection effectively increased the yield of the composites and their crosses, but, as the molecular data from this study show, the improvement was at the expense of some variability. The genetic distance between populations increased with selection, which is accordant with the increment of heterosis found in the agronomic evaluation. The changes observed were consistent with a model in which genetic drift is the main force, although selection could also play a role in the changes observed in EPS 7 and EPS 13. Allele frequencies changed significantly for one marker during intrapopulation selection and three markers under interpopulation selection, pointing to regions 3. 04, 7. 03, 9. 01, and 9. 03 as quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to grain yield.

40|$|Genetic {{correlations}} for more important agronomic traits between S 1 and HS families of two composites of <b>maize</b> (<b>Composite</b> B and M) were investigated. For the grain yield genotypic correlation between S 1 and HS families in Comp. B was significant, medium strong (0, 359 *), but {{too low for}} predictable purposes. Greater correlation for the grain yield was obtained in Comp. M, it was strong and highly significant (0, 663 **). Correlations for grain yield were lower than for the other investigated traits in both composites. For the ear height and 1000 kernel weight these correlations were higher in Comp. B, while {{for the rest of}} the traits they were greater in Comp. M, indicating greater share of the additive in the total genotypic variance in this composite. As far as the grain yield is concerned, combined S 1 -HS selection should be applied only in the Comp. M, based on the strong, highly significant correlation between investigated families. In Comp. B this is not the case. For this composite, alternative procedure, for the simultaneous improvement of the population per se and its combining ability, is first to apply S 1, and after that HS selection, but with very low intensity (about 30 %). ...|$|E
40|$|The pink {{stem borer}} (Sesamia nonagrioides Lefèvbre) {{is the most}} {{important}} pest of maize (Zea mays L.) throughout the Mediterranean area. The <b>maize</b> <b>composite</b> EPS 12 has been chosen as the base population for a breeding program based on its resistance to pink stem borer, with the main selection criterion being resistance to stem tunneling. Yield was taken as a secondary selection criterion to avoid any unwanted negatively correlated response on this character. The aims of investigation were: (1) to monitor the effects of selection for resistance to pink stem borer on allele frequency at 70 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and their impact on the genetic structure of EPS 12 and (2) to identify loci at which allelic frequencies changed significantly due to directional selection. Genetic diversity was reduced during the selection process (as expected since random genetic drift as well as selection could reduce genetic variability), but not significantly so. Although the loss of genetic variation was generally consistent with that expected in a model in which random genetic drift acts alone on neutral alleles, the changes observed in the frequency of five alleles were significantly greater than expected. Further, the linear trend of the departure from the random genetic drift model was significant for some allelic versions of two SSR markers, umc 1329 and phi 076; directional selection was therefore acting on these loci. The significant effect of directional selection on those markers suggests the presence of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for tunnel length and/or for yield under artificial infestation with Sesamia nonagrioides on the long arm of chromosome 4.

This {{study was conducted to}} examine the extent of genetic diversity, changes in allele composition and genetic structure, of 100 randomly selected S 1 lines each from the original (C 0) and advanced (C 4) selection cycles of TZL COMP 3 and TZL COMP 4, genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Results revealed that the proportion of alleles at both low and high frequencies decreased from C 0 to C 4, whereas those at intermediate frequencies increased at C 4 in the two composites. More unique and other alleles were lost at C 4 in TZL COMP 3 relative to those in TZL COMP 4. The changes in different measures of genetic diversity were either small or negligible with selection in the two composites. The proportion of markers departing from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) decreased with selection, whereas the total number of pairs of markers in linkage disequilibrium increased with selection in the two composites. Examination of changes in population structures using a model-based approach as well as cluster and multivariate analyses found a high degree of concordance in stratifying the 400 S 1 lines into four non-overlapping groups corresponding to the two selection cycles each within the reciprocal composites. The observed molecular-based divergence between cycles within the same composite and the clear differentiation between the complementary composites highlight the importance of reciprocal recurrent selection for preserving genetic diversity for long-term selection. This increases the potential of the advanced selection cycles to sustain genetic gain in productivity of hybrids adapted to the savannas in West and Central Africa.

Higher percentage of callus formation {{was reported in}} media containing 2, 4 -D. Longer duration of subculturing resulted in browning of calli and degradation of embry-oids. The overall frequency of embryogenesis ranged from 65 - 78 % and frequency of green shoot formation ranged from 35 - 48 %. In order to analyze the interactive effect of polyamines and GA 3 on {{somatic embryogenesis}}, the proliferated calli were inoculated in MS medium sup-plemented with twenty seven combinations of polyamines (Putrescine, Spermine and Spermidine) and GA 3. Higher concentration (150 µM) of Putrescine with GA 3 (50 - 150 µM) {{was found to be}} most effective for in-ducing somatic embryogenesis. Though, spermine at low-er concentration (50 µM) with GA 3 showed the drastic in-crease but putrescine at higher concentration was found comparatively more effective.

We identified 10 members of the CYC/TB 1 gene family in sunflower, which is more than found in any other species investigated to date. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these genes occur in 3 distinct clades, consistent with previous research in other eudicot species. A combination of dating the duplication events and linkage mapping indicates that only some of the duplications were associated with polyploidization. Cosegregation between CYC-like genes and branching-related quantitative trait loci suggest a minor, if any, role for these genes in conferring differences in branching. However, the expression patterns of one gene suggest a possible {{role in the development of}} ray versus disk florets.

Maize stalk fibres were chemically modified with acetic anhydride (acetylation) to enhance their compatibility with the hydrophobic rubber polymer matrix. The fibre was characterised using FTIR showing a spectrum with a well defined peak at 1742 cm- 1 (attributed to the carbonyl groups –C=O), indicating that new acetyl groups were introduced to cellulose. The curing and physico–mechanical properties of the composite as a function of filler loading was determined and compared with the values obtained using commercial grade hydrated silica. The natural rubber-maize stalk filled composites showed good processing safety in terms of torques and scorch. Compared with untreated maize-natural rubber composites, the acetylated composites exhibited higher mechanical properties, reduced moisture absorption and higher resistant to hydrothermal aging. Based on mechanical properties and statistical treatment of data, composites filled with 20 phr treated maize stalk had the optimum set of mechanical properties (tensile strength of 22. 4 MPa, elongation at break 404 % and hardness Shore A of 55) that were closely comparable with commercial hydrated silica filled <b>composites.</b> <b>Maize</b> stalk has therefore demonstrated its potential to be used to reinforce natural rubber for shoe sole production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Striga {{species are}} noxious root hemi-parasitic weeds that debilitate cereal {{production}} in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Control options for Striga are limited and developing Striga resistant crop germplasm {{is regarded as}} the best and most sustainable control measure. Efforts to improve germplasm for Striga resistance by a non-Genetic Modification (GM) approach, for example by exploiting natural resistance, or by a GM approach are constrained by limited information on the biological processes underpinning host-parasite associations. Additionaly, a GM approach is stymied by lack of availability of candidate resistance genes for introduction into hosts and robust transformation methods to validate gene functions. Indeed, a majority of Striga hosts, the world’s most cultivated cereals, are recalcitrant to genetic transformation. In maize, the existing protocols for transformation and regeneration are tedious, lengthy, and highly genotype-specific with low efficiency of transformation. Results We used Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain K 599 carrying a reporter gene construct, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), to generate transgenic <b>composite</b> <b>maize</b> plants that were challenged with the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica. Eighty five percent of maize plants produced transgenic hairy roots expressing GFP. Consistent with most hairy roots produced in other species, transformed maize roots exhibited a hairy root phenotype, the hallmark of A. rhizogenes mediated transformation. Transgenic hairy roots resulting from A. rhizogenes transformation were readily infected by S. hermonthica. There {{were no significant differences in}} the number and size of S. hermonthica individuals recovered from either transgenic or wild type roots. Conclusions This rapid, high throughput, transformation technique will advance our understanding of gene function in parasitic plant-host interactions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Malawi’s {{implementation}} of a large scale agricultural input subsidy programme in 2005 / 6 and subsequent years has attracted significant international interest. This paper reviews the background, processes, achievements and outcomes of the programme over the period 2005 / 6 to 2008 / 9. The very large scale disbursement of heavily subsidised fertilisers and (mainly hybrid and <b>composite</b> <b>maize)</b> seed to very large numbers of beneficiaries across the country represents a significant logistical achievement and led to significant increases in national maize production and productivity, and this has contributed to increased food availability, higher real wages and wider economic growth and poverty reduction. However the latter years of the programme have also been accompanied by very high international fertilizer prices and costs and by high maize prices, the latter undermining the programme’s food security, poverty reduction and growth benefits {{for the majority of}} Malawian farmers, who are very poor and rely on purchased maize for significant amounts of their staple food requirements. Estimated economic returns to the programme have been satisfactory, given other benefits of the programme not captured in cost benefit analysis. With substantial reductions in both prices and subsidised volumes of fertilisers in subsequent years, there is considerable scope for building on achievements to substantially raise programme effectiveness, efficiency and benefits. Any application of Malawi’s subsidy experience to other countries needs to take account of special characteristics of the Malawian maize economy and of measures needed to raise such programmes’ effectiveness and efficiency and ensure their best fit with and contribution to sustainable development policies...|$|R
40|$|Background Striga {{species are}} noxious root hemi-parasitic weeds that debilitate cereal {{production}} in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Control options for Striga are limited and developing Striga resistant crop germplasm {{is regarded as}} the best and most sustainable control measure. Efforts to improve germplasm for Striga resistance by a non-Genetic Modification (GM) approach, for example by exploiting natural resistance, or by a GM approach are constrained by limited information on the biological processes underpinning host-parasite associations. Additionaly, a GM approach is stymied by lack of availability of candidate resistance genes for introduction into hosts and robust transformation methods to validate gene functions. Indeed, a majority of Striga hosts, the world’s most cultivated cereals, are recalcitrant to genetic transformation. In maize, the existing protocols for transformation and regeneration are tedious, lengthy, and highly genotype-specific with low efficiency of transformation.

40|$|Maize yield in Namtumbo {{district}} {{is low and}} ranges from 1 - 2 t/ha in most small holders farms as compared to 7 - 10 t/ha reported {{in other parts of}} Tanzania. The yield is below the crop potential productivity due to low use or not using fertilizers completely. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the fertility status of soils and to determine the response of <b>maize</b> to nutrients. <b>Composite</b> soil samples were collected from 20 farms in 20 villages and used for assessment of soil fertility status. Field experiments were conducted during 2012 / 2013 season at Namabengo and Lusewa villages in Namtumbo District, to study the effects of six treatments, namely (i) control (ii) N 80 P 0 K 0 Zn 0, (iii) N 80 P 40 K 0 Zn 0 (iv) N 80 P 40 K 80 Zn 0, (v) N 80 P 40 K 80 +Zn 10 and (vi) N 120 P 40 K 80 Zn 10. Split plot design was used where the main plots factor was maize varieties and sub plots factor was nutrient combinations. Major findings of this experiment were that the major soil fertility constrains for maize production were N, P, K and Zn. The fertilizer combination of N 120 P 40 K 80 Zn 10 was the best combination for all varieties in both sites which increased grain yield from 0. 5 t ha- 1 in the control treatment to 8. 91 t ha- 1 at Namabengo site and from 3. 07 t ha- 1 in control - 7. 53 t ha- 1 at Lusewa site with the use of improved variety (DKC 8053). However, for farmers to obtain high grain production they must use good agronomic practices which include the use of improved seed, the recommended fertilizer rates (N 120 P 40 K 80 Zn 10), planting at right time and weeding twice. ...|$|R
40|$|Integrated Nutrient Management (INM), the use {{of natural}} and {{man-made}} source of plant nutrients is important due to its ability to sustain soil integrity and improve fertility for sustainable crop production. In order to investigate the effect of INM on soil and maize yield, a field experiment was conducted at the Crop Section of the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA), Teaching and Research Farm for early and late season <b>maize</b> (TZB-SR) cultivation. <b>Composite</b> soil sample of the site and poultry manure used in the experiment were analyzed before the commencement of experiment. Experimental design used was a 2 x 3 x 3 factorial experiment in randomized complete block design with three replicates. Treatment comprises two levels of poultry manure (PM) (0 and 5 t ha- 1), three levels of urea (U) (0, 50 and 100 kg ha- 1) and three levels of single-superphosphate (SSP) (0, 30, and 60 kg ha- 1) fertilizers. TZB-SR maize was planted at 75 x 25 cm spacing and the cob harvested at maturity. At {{the end of the}} experiment, soil samples were collected from each plots and analysed for chemical properties. The effect of PM application gave optimal soil chemical properties and yield of early and late maize cultivation at 5 t ha- 1 application level. Urea fertilizer effect was optimal at 100 kg ha- 1 and SSP effect optimal at 60 kg ha- 1 application level. The interaction of PM+U gave optimal soil result and maize performance at 5 t ha- 1 PM+ 100 kg ha- 1 U, PM+SSP interaction gave optimal performance at 5 t ha- 1 PM+ 60 kg ha- 1 SSP. U+SSP interaction gave optimal performance at 100 kg ha- 1 U+ 30 kg ha- 1 SSP, PM+U+SSP interaction gave optimal performance at 5 t ha- 1 PM+ 50 kg ha- 1 U+ 60 kg ha- 1 SSP and have the Highest value of OM (3. 54 %), available P (14. 57 mg kg- 1), exch.

40|$|MCom. (Risk management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The South African white maize {{market is}} {{considered}} to be significantly more volatile than any other agricultural product traded on the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX). This accentuates the need to effectively manage price risk, by means of hedging, to ensure a more profitable and sustainable maize production sector (Geyser, 2013 : 39; Jordaan, Grové, Jooste, A. & Jooste, Z. G., 2007 : 320). However, hedging at lower price levels might result in significant variation margins or costly buy–outs in order to fulfil the contract obligations. This challenge is addressed in this study by making use of technical analysis, focusing on the development of a practical and applicable composite technical indicator with the purpose of improving the timing of price risk management decisions identified by individual technical indicators. This may ultimately assist a producer in achieving a higher average hedge level compared to popular individual technical indicators. The process of constructing a composite indicator was commenced by examining the prevailing tendency of the market. By making use of the Directional Movement Index (DMI), as identified in the literature study, the market was found to continually shift between trending prices (prices moving either upwards or downwards) and prices trading sideways. Consequently, implementing only a leading (statistically more suitable for trading markets) or lagging (statistically more suitable for trending markets) technical indicator may generate false sell signals, as demonstrated by the application of these technical indicators in the white maize market. This substantiated the motivation for compiling a composite indicator that takes both leading and lagging indicators into account to more accurately identify hedging opportunities. The composite indicator made use of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic oscillator as leading indicators, and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) as lagging indicators. The results validated the applicability of such a composite indicator, as the composite indicator outperformed the individual technical indicators in the white <b>maize</b> market. The <b>composite</b> indicator achieved the highest average hedge level, the lowest average sell signals generated over the entire period, as well as the highest average hedge level {{as a percentage of the}} maximum price over the entire period. Hence, the composite indicator recognised hedging opportunities more accurately compared to individual technical indicators, which ultimately led to higher achieved hedging levels. Master...|$|R
