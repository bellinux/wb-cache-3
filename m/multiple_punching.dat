Auto shock absorbers, with helical {{surfaces}} {{together with}} <b>multiple</b> <b>punching</b> procedures needed in manufacturing processes, make the measurement and inspection difficult. TieNiu 3 DOMS is adopted to acquire their surface data, the digital point cloud data of one single vision within 10 s, automatically registering complete point cloud by rotary platform, {{so that the}} efficiency of process inspection and final quality control of the work pieces of complicated surfaces are improved. Experiments show that the surface inspection precision is better than 0. 05 mm, and one single surface inspection within minutes...|$|E

50|$|In general, sebaceous {{adenitis}} is underdiagnosed in dogs. Diagnosis confirmation requires <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies analysed by a dermopathologist {{who will}} {{comment on the}} condition of the sebaceous glands, revealing granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation surrounding the sebaceous glands or even complete destruction of sebaceous glands.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{the diagnostic and}} therapeutic efficacy of using cold knife conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 186 cases with CIN diagnosed and treated in our hospital; compared the histologic diagnoses from cervical conization and from colposcopic <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies, and then evaluated their postoperative hiistologic findings and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Of the 186 cases, there was a correlation in histologic findings between cervical conization and colposcopic <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies in 138 cases (74. 2 %), {{and there was no}} correlation in the other 48 cases (25. 8 %). Incomplete excision was performed in 8 cases (4. 3 %), but the failure rate was only 1. 1 %; the cure rate was 98. 9 %. Five cases with early invasive cancer were found. Eleven patients underwent subsequent hysterectomy. The main complications associated with conization were hemorrhage and cervical stenosis. Bleeding occurred in 8 (4. 3 %) of the patients, and cervical stenosis occurred in 3 (1. 6 %). CONCLUSION Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed more accurately using conization than by colposcopic <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies. Conization can also {{play an important role in}} the treatment for CIN. If properly performed, the procedure has a low risk of complications. It can provide an accurate histologic representation of the disease process, and be curative in most cases...|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the IBM card in 1928, IBM created a code capable of representing alphanumeric information, later adopted by other manufacturers. This code represents the numbers 0-9 by a single <b>punch,</b> and uses <b>multiple</b> <b>punches</b> for upper-case letters and special characters. A letter has two punches (zone 12,11,0 + digit 1-9); most special characters have two or three punches (zone none + digit 2-7 + 8).|$|R
50|$|At Shooto Tradition 6 Shoujou fought Shinichi Kojima for the Shooto bantamweight title. The {{first round}} saw Shoujou being {{successful}} on the feet landing multiple kicks and combinations, while Kojima was the aggressor {{in the second}} after taking Shoujou down and landing <b>multiple</b> <b>punches.</b> The third round ended quick after Shoujou went for an unsuccessful double-leg takedown prompting Kojima to take his back where he choked him out with a rear naked choke after 0:39.|$|R
50|$|In a HBO PPV non-title bout on October 18, 2008, 43-year-old Bernard Hopkins (49-5-1 with 32 KOs) won a {{unanimous}} decision over Pavlik. Hopkins and Pavlik fought at a catch weight of 170 lbs (5 pounds below the light heavyweight limit) in a twelve-round non-title bout. Hopkins dominated the whole fight with <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> combinations, good defense and movement. Both fighters fought after the bell {{and needed to}} be separated by their corners.|$|R

His quest in this game is to help get back his kidnapped sister, although it really isn't explored in the American version of the game like it is the Japanese version. In the prequel, Brawl Brothers, this character was called Hack, and in Rival Turf, Jack Flak. In this game, Norton has lost the shin bandages but his German suplex now hits twice in a row, and his <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> now ends in a [...] "Dragon Punch" [...] uppercut.|$|R

50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the fight it was apparent that Douglas was not afraid. He displayed a lot of spring and life in his body movement and he wasn't cautious in letting his punches fly whenever he saw the opportunity to attack Tyson. He used his quick and accurate jab to prevent Tyson from getting inside, where Tyson was most dangerous. When Tyson tried to get inside, Douglas tied him up, moved away, or would immediately hit Tyson with <b>multiple</b> <b>punches</b> as Tyson came within Douglas' range. Early on Douglas was more agile than Tyson and outlanded Tyson in exchanges.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{so-called}} roof collapse in soft lithography. Roof collapse {{is due to the}} adhesion between the PDMS stamp and substrate, and it may affect the quality of soft lithography. Our analysis accounts for the interactions of <b>multiple</b> <b>punches</b> and the effect of elastic mismatch between the PDMS stamp and substrate. A scaling law among the stamp modulus, punch height and spacing, and work of adhesion between the stamp and substrate is established. Such a scaling law leads to a simple criterion against the unwanted roof collapse. The present study agrees well with the experimental data. close 9410...|$|R
40|$|The {{vaginal smear}} reveals a {{spectrum}} of borderline lesions of the uterine cervix. This spectrum {{is the source of}} new clinical problems involving both the recognition and treatment of these various entities. A review of the literature of the past decade indicates that vaginal smears should be obtained regularly every year or two in all women beginning at the onset of sexual activity, but the initial smear may be falsely negative in 10 to 30 percent of cases. When patients have abnormal smears, the precise diagnosis can be established more accurately by cold-knife conization than by <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> biopsy...|$|R
50|$|In September 2013 Rhodes {{received}} a red card for a stamp on Blue Bulls captain Jono Ross. Coincidently {{it was the}} second time that weekend a player had been expelled for stamping with Nick Wood also being sent off. Citing lack of intent in the action the disciplinary pannel only suspended Rhodes for a match. Two years earlier Rhodes had faced harsher discipline after he put Siale Piutau in a headlock and the latter responded with <b>multiple</b> <b>punches.</b> Neither player was disciplined during the game but the panel suspended both for six weeks for their actions.|$|R
5000|$|Hall faced Chris Leben on December 28, 2013 at UFC 168. Leading up to {{the fight}} UFC President Dana White {{said that it was}} a must win for Hall if he wanted to keep his UFC-contract. Hall {{immediately}} landed a knee on Leben and landed <b>multiple</b> <b>punches</b> throughout the fight. Eventually Hall dropped Leben with a punch in the first round, though Leben was saved by the round ending. Leben asked his trainer [...] "Did I get knocked out?" [...] He then stated [...] "I'm done, man" [...] and the fight was ended {{between the first and second}} round.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} that Leben was offered a main event fight against Mike Swick at UFC Fight Night 11, but turned down the fight for unknown reasons; it was later revealed on the Ultimate Fighter Season 1 reunion show by UFC President Dana White's call to matchmaker Joe Silva that Leben's camp turned down the fight and that Leben himself had no prior knowledge of the fight offer. Leben instead took on Terry Martin on the same UFC Fight Night 11 card. Even after being rocked with <b>multiple</b> <b>punches</b> by Martin, a half-dazed Leben defeated Martin by knockout at 3:56 of the third round.|$|R
40|$|Wegener’s granulomatosis is {{characterized}} by a granulomatous arteritis involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts, progressive glomerulonephritis and systemic symptoms attributable to small vessel vasculitis. Although multisystemic manifestations are frequent, involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is uncommon. Cases have been reported of intestinal perforation, ulceration and hemorrhage. A patient whose initial presentation of Wegener’s granulomatosis was odynophagia secondary to esophageal vasculitis is described. Endoscopy revealed <b>multiple</b> <b>punched</b> out ulcerations in the esophagus, which resolved with standard therapy for systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis. There are only two previous reports of symptomatic esophageal vasculitis in patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis. These reports illustrate the need to consider odynophagia as a reflection of disease activity as opposed to complications of immunosuppressive therapy...|$|R
50|$|Ovarian {{drilling}} {{was first}} used {{in the treatment of}} PCOS in 1984 and has evolved as a safe and effective surgery.  After performing laparoscopic electrosurgical ovarian drilling in CC-resistant patients in 1984, Gjönnaess found that this technique increased ovulation rates to 45 percent and pregnancy rates to 42 percent. In 1988, laparoscopic <b>multiple</b> <b>punch</b> resection of ovaries on the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, slightly modified from Gjönnaess's operation, caused a reduction in LH pulsation and pituitary responsiveness in the treatment of PCOS. In 1989, ovarian drilling was conducted with argon, carbon dioxide (CO2) or potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser vaporization causing spontaneous ovulation in 71 percent of those treated. The procedure has been modified and popularized in the treatment of patients with CC-resistance.|$|R

It appears that McCoy or Sinister himself had his powers altered in a manner that allowed Blob to project his gravitational field outward. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Dukes' new powers were used to sweep the X-Men off their feet with the Silver Samurai receiving a double dose. Quicksilver attempted to fell the behemoth with <b>multiple</b> <b>punches,</b> but Dukes remained standing regardless of how many hits he got in. It was not until Rogue stepped in with a punch that had the power necessary to overtake him that the mammoth would topple over. Following the Sinister Six's defeat, Blob managed to escape.|$|R
