The {{purpose of this study}} was to collect data in order to examine the factors operative on households in Belfast that have as their outcome a distinctive pattern of ethnic (religious) residential segregation and <b>mixing.</b> <b>Main</b> Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions Housing history: date of move, type of dwelling, number of storeys, use of bath, tenure, predominant religion of the street. Expected length of residence, household changes. Attitude to and satisfaction (initial and present) with neighbourhood at time of arrival and since. Perceived changes in the neighbourhood. Knowledge of predominant religion at time of arrival and since, any changes observed, number of close friends in neighbourhood. Reasons for move to present address and for leaving previous address. Types of alternatives considered and explored. Favoured location/house type (reasons). Specific areas respondent would not move into. Comparison of present and previous addresses. Details of any council tenancies, preferred tenure (past and present), respondent's assessment of religious impartiality/discrimination by local authorities. Number of properties inspected. Religious affiliation and church attendance. Reasons for move. Background Variables Age, sex, marital status, employment status, occupation of head of household and spouse. Location of children's school, journey to work (time, method). Membership of clubs/organisations, number of relatives in Belfast and frequency of contact...|$|E
40|$|A small {{quantity}} of dimethyl ether {{was added to}} the fast stream of oxygen which contained ca. 10 °o 0 atoms produced by 2450 Mc. electrodeless discharge, and the time-variations of the composition were determined by means of time-of-flight mass spectrometer furnished with the inlet pinhole situated downstream in the range of 1 to 9 msec. after the <b>mixing.</b> <b>Main</b> products were H 2 O, HCHO, CO and CH 3 OH, and a trace amount of H 2, whereas CH 4, C 2 H 6, C 2 H 4, CO 2, (CH 30 CH 2) z and HCOOH could not be observed. Meanwhile, similar experiments were tried in the nitrogen stream with the 0 atoms generated by addition of NO of an equivalent amount to the N atoms which were produced by microwave discharge. In the absence of oxygen molecules such as in this procedure, clear-cut distinctions could be observed in the products, i. e., formation of H 2 and Oz and non-appearance of water, and it has been deduced that this difference results from the choise of the reaction paths of the H atoms produced by 0 + 0 H- 4 - 1 + 02 between H+O 2 + M- 44 H+O 2 +M and H+RH—>H 2 +R. The reaction rates in the presence of oxygen molecules can be expressed by —d(CH 3 OCH 3) /dt=kia(CH 3 OCH 3) (0) anddt 0 ~=ki(e(CH 3 OCH 3) (0) +r(0) 2 a,(3,r=const.), which support the mechanism proposed by us in the same reaction caused by the 0 atoms produced by IIg-photosensitized reaction of N 2 O, viz., the degradation of ether by 0 and OH. The rate constant of the first step CH 3 OCH 3 -I-O—>CH 30 CH 2 +OH, ki, has been deter-mined to be 3 x 107 1. /mole sec. (30 °C) in agreement with the value reported previously...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates some {{differences}} between partitive and non-partitive count quantifiers {{with respect to}} their ability to participate in cumulative readings and their compatibility with collectively interpreted <b>mixed</b> <b>main</b> predicates. An analysis of quantification is adopted in which a quantifier takes an individual as its first argument. The type of this individual argument together with some independent assumptions is argued to be responsible for the observed data. The analysis is subsequently expanded to a related set of facts concerning partitive and non-partitive mass quantifiers: their (in) compatibility with non-homogeneous main predicates. ...|$|R

50|$|Guilds were a {{major part}} of an economy that was very state {{dominated}} like the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman dynasty, especially along its seaboards and borderlands opportunities of commerce tended to diversify economies and put together sundry people and ideas. The Ottoman society was extremely <b>mixed</b> <b>main</b> due to conquest and immigration; therefore there was a vast number of religion and Jews were very much included. The Ottoman society was a spiritual economy {{but not as much as}} Europe. This was mainly because the Ottoman Empire was mixed religiously meaning there were many different religions mixed within guilds.|$|R

50|$|The earlier scout cruisers {{were too}} slow to {{accomplish}} their intended duties of working with destroyer flotillas and defending the fleet against attacks by enemy destroyers. The primary emphasis of the Arethusa-class cruisers was a design speed of 30 kn, {{to allow them to}} lead destroyers in combat. In support of this goal, they were the first cruisers to use destroyer-type high-speed steam turbines and oil-fired boilers were chosen to save weight and increase their power to meet the specification. They retained the side protection introduced in the later ships of the previous , but reverted to a <b>mixed</b> <b>main</b> armament that was a feature of the earlier ships of that class.|$|R
