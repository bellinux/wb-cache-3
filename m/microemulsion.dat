25|$|The drug {{exhibits}} {{very poor}} solubility in water, and, as a consequence, suspension and emulsion {{forms of the}} drug {{have been developed for}} oral administration and for injection. Ciclosporin was originally brought to market by Sandoz, now Novartis, under the brand name Sandimmune, which is available as soft gelatin capsules, as an oral solution, and as a formulation for intravenous administration. These are all nonaqueous compositions. A newer <b>microemulsion,</b> orally-administered formulation, Neoral, is available as a solution and as soft gelatin capsules (10mg, 25mg, 50mg and 100mg). The Neoral compositions are designed to form microemulsions in contact with water. Generic ciclosporin preparations have been marketed under various trade names, including Cicloral (Sandoz/Hexal), Gengraf (Abbott) and Deximune (Dexcel Pharma). Since 2002, a topical emulsion of ciclosporin for treating inflammation caused by keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) has been marketed under the trade name Restasis (0.05%). Inhaled ciclosporin formulations are in clinical development, and include a solution in propylene glycol and liposome dispersions.|$|E

Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were plotted to identify microemulsification region of propofol. The propofol <b>microemulsions</b> were evaluated for globule size, physical and chemical stability, osmolarity, in vitro hemolysis, pain caused by injection using rat paw-lick test and in vivo anesthetic activity. The <b>microemulsions</b> exhibited globule size less than 25  nm and demonstrated good physical and chemical stability.
