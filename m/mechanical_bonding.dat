40|$|The {{analysis}} of suit[2]-, suit[3]ane and tetrafould [2]-rotaxanes on {{the bases of}} calix[4]- arene {{with the help of}} the "mechanical disconnection operation" show that these structures possess only one <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond,</b> which is suggested to be called bi-, tri- and tetrafurcated one, respectively, since such structures bear two, three and four divergent mechanical entanglements. In the same time, introduction of the external bulky groups to these structures transforms such unique <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonds</b> into several single ones. There can be several different invariants which have only one <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond,</b> but possess different number of the intrinsic mechanical entanglements like, for example, in [2]-catenane and doubly braided [2]-catenane. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond</b> in the last case is proposed to be called the tight one. The constrictive bonds in carceplexes are classified as the spherical <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonds.</b> Thus, the whole classification of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonds</b> (together with the previously proposed ones), is presented. </p...|$|R

5000|$|... = Properties of Polyrotaxanes =In a polyrotaxane, {{unlike a}} {{conventional}} polymer, the molecules are linked by <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding,</b> such as hydrogen boding or change transfer, not covalent bonds.

50|$|Gypsum lath (rock lath) {{consists}} of gypsum plaster sandwiched between two sheets of absorbent paper, the finish side treated with gypsum crystals for the plaster to chemically bond to and sometimes perforated to allow <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding.</b> It was improved in 1910 by the paper wrapping {{the edges and}} multiple variations were developed in the 1930s. Gypsum lath is commonly used in place of wood since it is noncombustible, easy to use, and gives better results. The popularity of the lath and plaster method declined in the 1950s, as it {{was replaced by the}} less expensive drywall method. Gypsum lath is available with a foil facing which acts as a vapor barrier and heat reflector, and as a veneer base for plaster veneer.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of a uniform nickel phosphorous (Ni–P) electroless (EL) coating on micronsized SiC particles was investigated in this study. Metal coated ceramic particles {{could be used in}} applications including as the fabrication of cast metal matrix composites. Such ceramic particles have a better wettability in molten metal. In this work, the effects of EL coating parameters, SiC particle size and morphology on the coating uniformity and <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> at the SiC/Ni–P interface were studied. The results indicated that etching treatment was very effective (especially for coarse powders) on the <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> at the interface. Theoptimum values of bath temperature and pH were determined to be 50 +_ 2 0 C and 8 +_ 0. 2, respectively. The best uniformity and <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> were obtained for SiC particles with average particle size of 80 μm (considered relatively as coarse powders in this study). The ball milling of SiC particles (with the average particle size of 80 μm) for 1 h led to the {{formation of}} a multi-modal particle size distribution which resulted in a non-uniform quality of particulate coating. The larger SiC particles after ball milling were more completely covered by the Ni–P coating compared to the smaller more fragmented particles. The smaller ceramic particles processed via Ni–P EL coating lead to formation of segregated clusters of Ni–P and therefore such ceramic particles contained many uncoated parts...|$|E

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Dielectric {{elastomers}} are soft actuation materials with promising applications in robotics and biomedical devices. In this paper, a bio-inspired artificial muscle actuator with artificial tendons is developed for robotic arm applications. The actuator uses dielectric elastomer as artificial muscle and functionalized carbon fibers as artificial tendons. A VHB 4910 tape is used as the dielectric elastomer and PDMS is used as the bonding material to mechanically connect the carbon fibers to the elastomer. Carbon fibers are highly popular for their high electrical conductivities, mechanical strengths, and bio-compatibilities. After the acid treatments for the functionalization of carbon fibers (500 nm - 10 pm), one end of carbon fibers is spread into the PDMS material, which provides enough bonding strength with other dielectric elastomers, while the other end is connected to a DC power supply. To characterize the actuation capability of the dielectric elastomer and electrical conductivity of carbon fibers, a diaphragm actuator is fabricated, where the carbon fibers {{are connected to the}} actuator. To test the <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> between PDMS and carbon fibers, specimens of PDMS bonded with carbon fibers are fabricated. Experiments have been conducted to verify the actuation capability of the dielectric elastomer and <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> of PDMS with carbon fibers. The energy efficiency of the dielectric elastomer increases as the load increases, which can reach above 50 %. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> is strong enough for robotic arm applications...|$|E

40|$|If {{it would}} be {{possible}} to install Tight Fit Pipe by means of reeling, {{it would be}} an attractive new option for the exploitation of offshore oil and gas fields containing corrosive hydrocarbons. Tight Fit Pipe is a mechanically bonded double walled pipe where a corrosion resistant alloy liner pipe is mechanically fitted inside a carbon steel outer pipe through a thermo-hydraulic manufacturing process. Reeling is a fast method of offshore pipeline installation where a pipe is spooled on a reel, which is positioned on a vessel. The vessel subsequently sails to the offshore location where the pipe is unwound, straightened and deployed to the seabed. However, reeling of Tight Fit Pipe is not yet proven technology. The reeling process imposes high plastic strains (due to bending) in the pipe, which may cause unacceptable liner pipe wrinkling and Tight Fit Pipe ovalisation. This PhD project aimed to make a contribution to the possible development of the installation of Tight Fit Pipe by means of the reeling method. The focus of this research was on the initiation and the degree of liner pipe wrinkling as well as the degree of ovalisation occurring during the spooling-on phase of the reeling process, both theoretically and experimentally; the latter by performing full scale bending tests on 12. 75 inch outer diameter Tight Fit Pipe. One of the test results indicates that a higher mechanical bending strength decreases liner pipe wrinkling and makes the Tight Fit Pipe more suitable for reeling. However, test results also show that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> strength for the Tight Fit Pipe tested was significantly reduced, irrespective of whether a high or a low initial <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> strength had been used prior to spooling-on. These findings justify further research into this phenomenon as the eventual <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> strength after reeling installation may be vital for its anticipated application during operation.

50|$|Many {{mechanically}} interlocked molecules {{have been}} studied to construct molecular machines.

40|$|While <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> stabilizes {{tetrathiafulvalene}} (TTF) radical dimers, {{the question}} arises: what role does topology play in catenanes containing TTF units? Here, we report how topology, together with <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding,</b> in isomeric [3]- and doubly interlocked [2]catenanes controls {{the formation of}} TTF radical dimers within their structural frameworks, including a ring-in-ring complex (formed between an organoplatinum square and a { 2 + 2 } macrocyclic polyether containing two 1, 5 -dioxynaphthalene (DNP) and two TTF units) that is topologically isomeric with the doubly interlocked [2]catenane. The separate TTF units in the two { 1 + 1 } macrocycles (each containing also one DNP unit) of the isomeric [3]catenane exhibit slightly different redox properties compared {{with those in the}} { 2 + 2 } macrocycle present in the [2]catenane, while comparison with its topological isomer reveals substantially different redox behavior. Although the stabilities of the mixed-valence (TTF 2) ^(•+) dimers are similar in the two catenanes, the radical cationic (TTF^(•+)) _ 2 dimer in the [2]catenane occurs only fleetingly compared with its prominent existence in the [3]catenane, while both dimers are absent altogether in the ring-in-ring complex.
