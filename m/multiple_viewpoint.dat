40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIntegration of product life cycle activities in design and manufacture has been pursued and advanced for over 20 years. A commonly accepted computational approach to integrating product design and manufacture software is to define a neutral representation of product related information for the software applications and capture them in product models. Product models provide a source and repository for all product related information during the product development activities. However, in a team-based environment, the information of product representation needs to be viewed from multiple perspectives. This is because each team member {{is likely to be}} interested in different aspects of the information. This leads to the need for <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> information representations of the product to be integrated with each other to support product development activities. While much work has been done into the concept of product modelling, {{there is a need to}} extend this approach to support information integration between <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> product representations by defining techniques to capture the knowledge of relationships of such <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> information representations. The research reported in this thesis identifies a novel method for integrating <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> representations of products. An ontology is defined with two separate but related layers to capture <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> product representations and the knowledge of relationships between such multiple viewpoints separately. This ontology contains: product model as information layer; knowledge layer to capture integration knowledge; and knowledge links to facilitate the communication of both layers. The work uses injection moulded product design and manufacture as an example to explore and demonstrate the research idea. An experimental two-layered ontology has been implemented using an object-oriented database and Visual c++ programming language. Experiments have been performed to demonstrate how the two-layered ontology can support the integration of <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> information. This research contributes to the understanding of the definition of information and knowledge models and methods of integration to support <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> information of products...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} system which can capture a dynamic 3 D scene and {{synthesize}} its arbitrary views in real time. Our system consists of four components: a fresnel lens, a micro-lens array, an IEEE 1394 digital camera, and a PC for rendering purpose. The micro-lens array forms an image which consists {{of a set of}} elemental images, in other words, <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> images of the scene. The fresnel lens controls the depth of field by demagnifying the 3 D scene. The problem is that the scene demagnified by the fresnel lens is compressed along its optical axis. Therefore, we propose a method for recovering the original scene from the compressed scene. The IEEE 1394 digital camera captures <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> images at 15 frames per second, and transfers these images to the PC. The PC synthesizes any perspective of the captured scene from the <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> images using image-based rendering techniques. The proposed system synthesizes one perspective of the captured scene within 1 / 15 second. This means that a user can interactively move his/her viewpoint and observe even a moving object from various directions...|$|E

Transformation and shading operations can be performed once per image sequence instead of once per view. Geometric position, color, and texture coordinates can be computed using linear interpolation. Both view independent and dependent shading algorithms are supported. Both one and two-dimensional grids of perspectives can be rendered.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the development of representational and modelling techniques employed in the creation of statistical models of melody and four-part harmony. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> systems, along with techniques such as Prediction by Partial Match, in the construction of cognitive models of melodic perception. Primitive viewpoints represent surface and underlying musical attributes, while linked viewpoints model combinations of such attributes. A viewpoint selection algorithm optimises <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> systems by minimising the information theoretic measure cross-entropy. Many more linked viewpoints are used in this research than have previously been available, and the results show that many new viewpoints are incorporated into optimised systems. A significant aspect of this work is the proposal and implementation of a set of novel extensions of the <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoint</b> framework for four-part harmony. Statistical models are constructed with the aim that given a soprano part, alto, tenor and bass parts are added in a stylistically suitable way. Version 1 is as closely related to the modelling of melody as possible (chord replacing note), and is a baseline for gauging expected improvements as the framework is extended and generalised. Three versions of the framework have been implemented, and their performances compared and contrasted. The results indicate that the baseline version has been improved upon. Time complexity issues are discussed in detail, and selected viewpoints are examined from a music theoretic point of view for insights into why they perform well. Finally, melodies and harmonisations of given melodies are generated using the best performing models. The quality of the music suggests that, in spite of the improvements achieved so far, the models are still unable to fully capture the musical style of a corpus. Another six versions of the framework are described, which are expected to contribute further improvements...|$|E

The purpose of my creative project, Re-envisionina the Ordinary: A Study of Vantage Points in Painting, {{was to use}} unusual vantage points and <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoints</b> as compositional devices to show familiar household scenes and objects in a new way. Analysis of artworks and writings by realist painters such as Edgar Degas, Paul Cezanne and Pierre Bonnard helped me learn how each of these artists used unusual or <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoints</b> While researching these artists, I began to understand why space {{is one of the}} fundamental issues of art. I found that, as an artist, I cannot use vantage points and viewpoints without considering the larger issue of space. Artists throughout time have wrestled with the question: how does one represent three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface? By presenting different treatments of space, I showed how various artists have answered the question. Leonardo da Vinci solved the problem using linear perspective. Edgar Degas and Pierre Bonnard answered the question usingoriental space and unusual or <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoints.</b> Paul Cezanne's solution was a new system of unified space. Contemporary artists provide other answers to the question of space. Rene Magritte used the illusionary devices of linear perspective to paint his surreal world. Philip Pearlstein returned to Degas' and Cezannes' concept of space to emphasize both the three-dimensionality of the figures and the twodimensionality of the picture plane. David Hockney found his solution in the <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoints</b> of cubism. My creative project is my answer to the question. I integrated unusual vantage points, and <b>multiple</b> <b>viewpoints</b> to create ten paintings with unified space. I used some conventions of linear perspective to show depth. For example, sizes and details in my paintings diminish with distance. I then contradicted the three-dimensionality by using some conventions of oriental space that flatten the picture plane: oblique perspective, overlapping and positioning an object next to the front surface.
