500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> don't kill me; do whatever {{you have to do to}} get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E
500|$|Zacharias {{was born}} in Madras, India. He is descended from {{a woman of the}} Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste. His mother was from Madras (now Chennai) while his father was from Kerala. He grew up in Delhi. According to Zacharias, before her marriage, Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin {{ancestor}} about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community. Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household, and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14. [...] Zacharias says that it was [...] that touched him and meant to him as the defining paradigm: [...] "Because I live, you also will live." [...] He said that he thought, [...] "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." [...] and that he committed his life to Christ praying, [...] "Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hospital bed well, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth." [...] In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University College & Seminary) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990 Mr. Zacharias did a 2-3 month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in the town of Cambridge. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees.|$|E
2500|$|Liston {{never complained}} about prison, {{saying he was}} {{guaranteed}} three meals every day. The athletic director at Missouri State Penitentiary, Rev. Alois Stevens, suggested to Liston that he try boxing, and his obvious aptitude, along with an endorsement from Stevens, {{who was also a}} priest, aided Liston in getting an early parole. Stevens organized a sparring session with a professional heavyweight named Thurman Wilson to showcase Liston's potential. After two rounds, Wilson had taken enough. [...] "Better get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ring, he is going to kill me!" [...] he exclaimed.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} three years of the Fourth Doctor's tenure, {{producer}} Philip Hinchcliffe further reduced the use of the sonic screwdriver. Exceptions include Robot (which was the last story to be produced by Barry Letts), where it was again used to detonate mines, and as a [...] "miniature sonic lance" [...] to cut out a lock. Aside from unlocking doors, the device was greatly downplayed during the Fourth Doctor's second and third seasons. It saw a resurgence once Graham Williams took over as producer in 1977. In the final story of season 15, The Invasion of Time, the Fourth Doctor conceded, [...] "Not even the sonic screwdriver can get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Be Love Now, {{published}} in 2010, explanation was {{given for the}} content removal in a dialogue between Ram Dass and his guru Neem Karoli {{that took place in}} 1971. [...] "I had mixed up Hari Dass and Maharaji when I heard the story from Hari Dass." [...] "The story", which is repeated with some changes in another autobiographical book Polishing the Mirror: How to Live from Your Spiritual Hearth, was about who left his home at the age of eight. Several sources pointed out that Neem Karoli (Lakshmi Narayan Sharma) left his home at the age of 11–12 years old, [...] "After the wedding, the groom left home and wandered the country". For Baba Hari Dass, leaving home took place at younger age when he was eight years old. With a sense of needed spiritual liberation and the discussion he had with his mother, [...] "Take <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> box of earth and sky," [...] Baba Hari Dass left home and was not bound by the customary child marriage in India arrangement prevalent at that time, before it was declared illegal in 1929, or by the family's promise obligations that such marriage would impose.|$|E
