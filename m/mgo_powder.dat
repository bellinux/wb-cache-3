40|$|The role of <b>MgO</b> <b>powder</b> in {{preventing}} defluidization during the fluidized bed reduction of fine iron ores with different iron valences is investigated. The inhibiting effect of <b>MgO</b> <b>powder</b> on {{different types of}} fine iron ores is the same at 973 K, whereas it is sequenced as FeO> Fe 3 O 4 > Fe 2 O 3 at 1073 and 1173 K. Specific diffusion couples are employed to clarify the valence-dependent inhibiting mechanism. Electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffraction results, and the estimation of diffusion activation energy indicate that the inhibiting effect of <b>MgO</b> <b>powder</b> on defluidization is mainly caused by the physical barrier effect for all iron oxides below 1073 K, while the defluidization prevention of Fe 3 O 4 and FeO at 1173 K is mainly attributed {{to the formation of}} Fe 2 MgO 4 and MgO. FeO compounds on the surface, respectively. As a result, the required MgO content to prevent defluidization is sequenced as m(Fe 2 O 3) > m(Fe 3 O 4) > m(FeO) at 1173 K.

Starting with A 3, the yield at first is very high, then drops {{to a level of}} 84 % of BD yield, and then again increases up to 87 % of BD yield. The reason for this behaviour of the yields might be due to a poor MgO adsorption over the alumina support. As a result, not all of the MgO is impregnated over the alumina support, and is in a “free state” as <b>MgO</b> <b>powder.</b> When the catalyst was later fed into the reactor, the ratio between MgO-alumina catalyst and <b>MgO</b> <b>powder</b> might have induced such differences showing the instability of the catalysts A 3, A 4, and A 5.
