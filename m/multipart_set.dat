40|$|The higher-level {{functions}} of heat, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems changed along the last forty years, simply from providing thermal comfort to a <b>multipart</b> <b>set</b> of requirements. Since the eighties, HVAC systems {{must also be}} able to provide indoor air quality and to recover energy. During the mentioned period, the manufacturing project teams somewhat redesigned those systems in order to accommodate the new FRs. This procedure disagrees with the fifth theorem of Axiomatic Design (AD), which in such cases requires a complete system redesign. The recent rise in the price of the oil barrel emphasizes the need to recover energy in any building, namely in HVAC systems. The energy regulations, ASHRAE 90. 1 in the US and the EPBD (Energy Performance Building Directive) in the EU, address this problem. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse an HVAC system that is independent in terms of thermal comfort and indoor air quality, and to add the “reduce energy ” functional requirement (FR). This new FR has four “children ” functions: “adapt flows”, “recover energy”, “choose equipment efficiency ” and “define efficient network conditions”. Raising the design matrix to a set of well-known market solutions allows identifying the existing couplings. Taking into account the independent solutions alone, and merging them with the guide solutions established in the regulations, one can conclude that regulations might lead to efficient working conditions...|$|E

50|$|One way {{to measure}} {{completion}} is to access multiple servers and retrieve lists of articles. Because Message-ID: headers are nominally unique throughout the network, comparison of the lists is mostly a straightforward task. Practical limitations {{to this type of}} measurement include the impossibility of obtaining lists from all servers worldwide, the fact that many servers filter out spam or employ Usenet Death Penalties, and that some servers mask incompletion by hiding <b>multipart</b> binary <b>sets</b> with missing articles. It is also necessary to take into account propagation times and retention; an article may simply have not yet arrived at a given server, or it may have been present but already expired.|$|R
40|$|The Computer Graphics Interface (CGI) {{describes}} {{the interface between}} device-independent and device-dependent parts of a graphics system. This <b>multipart</b> standard describes <b>sets</b> of functions for the control and data exchange over this interface. This interface may be implemented as a software-to-software interface (as a procedural binding {{to one or more}} software packages or as a data-stream binding used in the network environment), or as a software-to-hardware interface (as a data-stream binding to one or more devices presenting a standardized Computer Graphics Interface as their device protocol). Part I of this standard includes the graphics standards reference model and the CGI's relationship to other standards. The CGI function sets contain only graphics and graphics control functions. I/O protocols used to convey these functions between parts of the system are not included...|$|R
