50|$|The {{forming process}} {{is most often}} used to shrink or expand {{cylindrical}} tubing, {{but it can also}} form sheet metal by repelling the work piece onto a shaped die at a high velocity. High-quality joints can be formed, either by electromagnetic pulse crimping with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> or by electromagnetic pulse welding with a true metallurgical weld. Since the forming operation involves high acceleration and deceleration, mass of the work piece plays a critical role during the forming process. The process works best with good electrical conductors such as copper or aluminum, but it can be adapted to work with poorer conductors such as steel.|$|E

50|$|After {{a day on}} {{the lunar}} surface the LK's engine would fire again, using its landing leg {{structure}} as a launch pad. To save weight, the engine used for landing would also blast the LK back to lunar orbit for an automated docking with the LOK, using the Kontakt docking system. The cosmonaut would then spacewalk back to the LOK carrying the Moon rock samples, and the LK would then be cast off. After this, the LOK would fire its rocket for the return to Earth. The LK's docking port was a latticework of 96 hexagon-shaped holes arranged in an isometric grid, each as a potential docking port for the snare-shaped probe of the LOK to fit in without precise alignment of the two craft. Due to weight restrictions, the docking interface was designed to be as simple as possible, with a strictly <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> and no electrical or fluid connections. Docking and undocking were only possible a single time.|$|E

5000|$|In the US, Federal Communications Commission rules require {{users of}} {{selective}} calling {{to monitor the}} channel (i.e. switch to carrier squelch) before transmitting. In other words, the user must monitor (listen) {{to make sure the}} channel is not in use by someone on another selective calling code before transmitting. To enforce this rule, base stations often have a monitor switch on the microphone. The push-to-talk button is split into two segments. One segment turns the selective calling off. The other segment of the button transmits. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> prevents the transmit button from being pressed until the monitor button is down. This is called, [...] "compulsory monitor before transmit." [...] In mobile radios, microphones are stored in a hang-up box. When the microphone is pulled out of the hang-up, the radio reverts to carrier squelch, (the selective calling feature is disabled). The user automatically monitors—verifies no one else is using the channel—by pulling the mike out of the hang-up box. Hand-held radios sometimes have LED indicators that show when the channel is in use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the weapon showed the {{emphasis}} on accurate, rapid fire emphasised by British Army training during this period. The adjustable flip-up aperture rearsight with a 300-yard battle setting when folded down was an excellent design, allowing rapid and accurate sight acquisition, and was advanced for the period. The Mauser-type bolt had a low-profile bolt handle with an integral safety lug built into its base that locked in the receiver. The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle is low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, again facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee-Enfield, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently. The action was configured to be easily operable, even when heated by sustained rapid fire, with slick operation, cock-on-closing feature and positive camming action when opening or closing the bolt. The Pattern 1913 Enfield bolt locking lugs had a 4 degree helical angle with matching angles on the receiver lug seats (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The Lee-Enfield rifle also featured helical locking surfaces. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The angled lugs had no tendency to unwind with chamber pressure since the [...] "angle of repose" [...] of smooth, lubricated steel surfaces is approximately 8 degrees. One advantage was that when the bolt handle was turned up was that the lugs cleared each other immediately so full effort {{was applied to the}} extraction cam. The trigger had a <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> to prevent firing unless the bolt was fully locked. The action was large and strong compared to other military service rifle bolt actions, since it had to be capable of handling the dimensionally large [...]276 Enfield cartridge variants, and the barrel was given a heavy profile. The Pattern 1913 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve. It was a long and comparatively heavy rifle - the Lee-Enfield Mk III weighed 8 lb empty - and the pronounced sight protector 'ears', the 'pot-belly' magazine and 'dog-leg' bolt handle gave it an ungainly air.|$|E
5000|$|The rifle {{maintains}} the British cock-on-closing feature, {{in which the}} bolt's mainspring is loaded and the rifle cocked {{as part of the}} return stroke of the bolt, which aided rapid fire, especially as the action heated up. Most bolt action designs after the Mauser 98 cocked as part of the opening stroke. The rifle has a characteristic [...] "belly" [...] due to a deeper magazine, allowing the rifle to hold six rounds of the US [...]30-06 cartridge in the magazine, and one in the chamber. The M1917 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve. In a manufacturing change from the Mauser 98 and the derivative Springfield, the bolt is not equipped with a third 'safety' lug. Instead, as on the earlier Model 1895 (Chilean) Mauser, the bolt handle recesses into a notch in the receiver, which serves as an emergency locking lug in the event of failure of the frontal locking lugs. This change saved machine time needed on the rifle bolt, cutting costs and improving production rates, and this alteration has since been adopted by many commercial bolt-action rifle designs for the same reasons.The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle is low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee-Enfield, P13 and P14, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently.The M1917 Enfield bolt locking lugs had a 4 degree helical angle with matching angles on the receiver lug seats (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The design probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The angled lugs had no tendency to unwind with chamber pressure since the [...] "angle of repose" [...] of smooth, lubricated steel surfaces is approximately 8 degrees. One advantage was that when the bolt handle was turned up was that the lugs cleared each other immediately so full effort was applied to the extraction cam. The trigger had a <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> to prevent firing unless the bolt was fully locked. The location of the safety on the right rear of the receiver has also been copied by most sporting bolt-action rifles since, as it falls easily under the firer's thumb. The trigger pull is ≥ 3 lb-f N. One notable design flaw was the leaf spring that powered the ejector, which could break off and render the ejector inoperable. A combat-expedient repair method was to slip a bit of rubber under the bolt stop spring. A redesigned ejector, incorporating a small coil spring in place of the fragile leaf spring, was developed and can be fitted to the M1917 to remedy this issue.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis: This study {{presents}} the results of experiments performed on RC (Reinforced Concrete) beams strengthened with NSM(Near Surface Mounted) reinforcement. A total of 8 specimens have been tested. The specimens can be classified into EBR(Externally Bonded Reinforcement) specimens and NSM(Near Surface Mounted) reinforcements specimens. Two of NSM specimens were strengthened with 12 <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> grooves with a width of 20 mm and spacing of 200 mm in order to prevent debonding failure of the CFRP(Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) reinforcement. Experimental results revealed that NSM specimens used CFRP reinforcements more efficiently than the EBR specimens, but debonding failure between adhesive and concrete occurred. This showed that, similarly to EBR specimens, NSM specimens also required countermeasures against debonding failure. Failure mode of NSM specimens added with <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> grooves failed by rupture of CFRP rod and strip. The measured ultimate load showed an increase of 15 % compared with the common NSM specimens. The application of <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> grooves made it possible to avoid debonding failure and to enhance strengthening performance...|$|R
30|$|Bond {{resistance}} of reinforcing bars {{embedded in concrete}} depends primarily on frictional resistance and <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock.</b> Chemical adhesion provides withholding property between steel and concrete. Frictional bond provides initial resistance against loading and further loading mobilizes the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> between the concrete and bar ribs. Mechanical interlocks lead to inclined bearing forces which in turn lead to transverse tensile stresses and internal inclined splitting (bond) cracks along reinforcing bars. These cracks are commonly referred as Goto cracks (Goto 1971).|$|E

In a second step {{the opposite side}} of the micro-structured metal was irradiated by a continuous wave (CW) fiber laser to achieve the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> between the two materials. A tight relationship between the microstructure parameters and pull-out test performance was observed. The greatest strength was achieved when the distance between subsequent grooves was minimized. The T-joint mechanical performance did not reveal any significant dependence on the considered range of joining areas. The morphological and topographical features of the detached surfaces showed that the micro-structured grooves were completely filled during the laser conductive joining process. Different alignment angles of patterns produced different failure modes although there was no evidence of an additional <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} surface-hardening {{processes}} on {{the changes in}} surface characteristics and adhesion of black copper oxide substrate with epoxy resins are studied. Various techniques, namely SEM, XPS, AFM, XRD, Auger electron spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, D-SIMS and RBS, were used to identify the changes in surface characteristics. Dense, fibrillar cupric oxide crystals characterized the as-deposited oxide coating with high surface roughness. The surface-hardening process flattened and consolidated the fibrils without changing the compositional and thermodynamic characteristics of the coated surface. The surface-hardening process reduced the total thickness of copper oxide by approximately 50 - 150 nm. The reduction in oxide thickness was not a predominant factor for the reduced bond strength of the surface-hardened coating. The bond strengths of both the as-deposited and surface-hardened black oxide coatings increased with oxidation time, until saturation at about 120 - 150 s. For the as-deposited oxide coating, <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking,</b> high wettability and resistance to surface contamination are the three major sources for improved adhesion, amongst which the enhanced <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> provided by the fibrillar cupric oxide is the most important.
