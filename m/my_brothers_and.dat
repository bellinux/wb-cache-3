500|$|According to Haggard's {{daughter}} Lilias, {{the phrase}} [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed" [...] originated {{from his childhood}} and [...] "the particularly hideous aspect" [...] of one rag-doll: [...] "This doll {{was something of a}} fetish, and Rider, as a small child, was terrified of her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember". Haggard wrote that [...] "the title She" [...] was taken [...] "from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those of <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> sisters who were in her charge." ...|$|E

The U.S. Congress meanwhile passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which heavily punished abetting escape and forced law enforcement officials—even in states that had outlawed slavery—to assist in their capture. The law increased risks for escaped slaves, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario (then part of the United Province of Canada), which, as part of the British Empire, had abolished slavery. Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as waves of poor Irish immigrants competed with free blacks for work.|$|E

Maimonides ruled that all Jews must believe with perfect faith, each day, that the mashiach will come and the resurrected of the dead will take place. He rules that anyone who does not believe this, denies the entire Torah. The Chafetz Chaim, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, wrote [...] "our days are the days of Messiah’s coming.
