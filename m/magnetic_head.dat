2500|$|Some data streams, {{especially}} high-speed {{serial data}} streams (such as the raw stream {{of data from}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> of a disk drive), are sent without an accompanying clock. [...] The receiver generates a clock from an approximate frequency reference, and then phase-aligns to the transitions in the data stream with a PLL. This process {{is referred to as}} clock recovery. In order for this scheme to work, the data stream must have a transition frequently enough to correct any drift in the PLL's oscillator. Typically, some sort of line code, such as 8b/10b encoding, is used to put a hard upper bound on the maximum time between transitions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> {{inside the}} POS Terminal is a fixed {{component}} {{and for this}} reason it only can be cleared by cleaning cards that are flexible enough to clean the leading, center and trailing edges of this round reader head. The cleaning of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> is very important because it's responsible for the reading of the card and so it decides acceptance or rejection of the inserted card.The cleaning card is not only cleaning the reading area of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> which is cleared. There is also a cleaning process within the device along the card path. The cleaning in these high dirt build-up areas is especially important and ensures efficient cleaning of the card reader.|$|E
50|$|When system {{behavior}} varies {{considerably in}} normal operation, multiple control laws {{may have to}} be devised. Each distinct control law addresses a specific system behavior mode. An example is a computer hard disk drive. Separate robust control system modes are designed in order to address the rapid <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> traversal operation, known as the seek, a transitional settle operation as the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> approaches its destination, and a track following mode during which the disk drive performs its data access operation.|$|E

50|$|Motorized {{readers are}} built in, for example ATMs. The credit/debit-card is {{inserted}} into the card slot, where the first <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> is placed. If a magnetic stripe can be recognized, a shutter will be opened and the card will be transported to the second <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> by roles. The card is read, thereby the device knows whether the transaction goes over the micro chip or the magnetic stripe. If no micro chip {{is placed on the}} card, the transaction goes directly above the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head.</b> If the data gives the order for a transaction over the micro chip, the card is placed on the chip reading contact and is stopped. The chip contacts, are fitted on the chip and now the transaction begins. If the reading of the magnetic stripe respectively by the micro chip is not possible, the card will be declined.A cleaning card for a motorized card reader will need a magnetic stripe built into it to activate the acceptance shutter.|$|E
50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> {{acts as a}} {{stimulus}} on the PUF and amplifies the random magnetic signal. Because of the complex interaction of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head,</b> influenced by speed, pressure, direction and acceleration, with the random components of the PUF, each swipe of the head over the magnetic PUF will yield a stochastic, but very distinctive signal. Think {{of it as a}} song with thousands of notes. The odds of the same notes recurring in an exact pattern from a single card swiped many times are 1 in 100 million, but overall the melody remains very recognizable.|$|E
5000|$|Magneto-optical drives are not Floptical drives, which {{likewise}} combine ferromagnetic {{and optical}} technologies, albeit {{in a different}} manner. Flopticals are 21 megabyte 3.5" [...] magnetic diskettes using optical tracks to increase the tracking precision of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head,</b> from the usual 135 tracks per inch to 1,250 tracks per inch. No laser or heating is involved; a simple infrared LED is used to follow the optical tracks, while a <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> touches the recording surface. The drives can also read and write traditional 3.5" [...] diskettes, although not the 2.88 megabyte variety. Flopticals were manufactured by Insite Peripherals, a company founded by Jim Burke.|$|E

The optical servo tracks allow for an increase in the tracking precision of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head,</b> from the usual 135 tracks per inch to [...] tracks per inch. Floptical disks provide 21 MB of storage. The drive has a second set of read/write heads so that it can read from and write to standard 720 kB and 1.44 MB ( [...] KiB) disks as well.|$|E

50|$|During {{the same}} time frame a {{transition}} to perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) is occurring, in which for reasons of improved stability and higher areal density potential, the traditional in-plane orientation of magnetization in the disk is being changed to a perpendicular orientation.

50|$|Universal: A {{final version}} called the {{universal}} phonogène {{was completed in}} 1963.

This was obtained through a rotating <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> called the Springer temporal regulator, an ancestor of the rotating heads used in video machines.|$|E

A strap-down <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> reference of simple design provided the wing leveler with directional autopilot capability.

50|$|The {{design of}} the SuperDisk system came from an early 1990s project at Iomega. It {{is one of the}} last {{examples}} of floptical technology, where lasers are used to guide a <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> which is much smaller than those used in traditional floppy disk drives. Iomega orphaned the project around the time they decided to release the Zip drive in 1994. The idea eventually ended up at 3M, where the concept was refined and the design was licensed to established floppy drive makers Matsushita and Mitsubishi. Other companies involved in the development of SuperDisk include Compaq and OR Technology.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{digital data}} streams, {{especially}} high-speed serial data streams (such as the raw stream {{of data from}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> of a disk drive and serial communication networks such as Ethernet) are sent without an accompanying clock signal. The receiver generates a clock from an approximate frequency reference, and then phase-aligns the clock to the transitions in the data stream with a phase-locked loop (PLL). This is one method of performing a process commonly known as clock and data recovery (CDR). Other methods {{include the use of}} a delay-locked loop and oversampling of the data stream.|$|E
50|$|The disc {{consists}} of a ferromagnetic material sealed beneath a plastic coating. The only physical contact is during recording when a <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> is brought {{into contact with the}} side of the disc opposite to the laser. During reading, a laser projects a beam on the disk and, according to the magnetic state of the surface, the reflected light varies due to the magneto-optic Kerr effect. During recording, laser power is increased to heat the material to the Curie point in a single spot. This enables an electromagnet positioned {{on the opposite side of}} the disc, to change the local magnetic polarization. The polarization is retained after the temperature drops.|$|E
50|$|Most {{magnetic}} tape recorders use one capstan motor and one pinch roller located after the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> {{in the direction of}} the moving tape. However multiple pinch rollers may also be employed in association with one or more capstans. An example of the application of multiple pinch rollers is the Technics-RS1520 tape recorder, which utilizes two pinch rollers located on opposite sides of a single capstan shaft, providing a more stable transport across two sets of <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads.</b> Dual pinch rollers are also used (along with dual capstans) in auto-reverse cassette decks to drive the tape in both directions as needed. In this case, only one pinch roller is pressed against its corresponding capstan at a time.|$|R

This instrument is intended to replace the conventional combination of mechanical compass and directional gyroscope currently in use in general aviation aircraft, at appreciable savings in cost and reduction in maintenance. Design of the sensing element, the signal processing electronics, and the computer algorithms which calculate the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> of the aircraft from the magnetometer data have been integrated {{in such a way as}} to minimize hardware requirements and simplify calibration procedures.

5000|$|The primary {{motivation}} behind {{developing this}} technology {{was the possibility}} of far greater storage capacities than either magnetic tape or optical discs. For example, {{the goal of the}} LOTS project in 1995 was to [...] "achieve a data-transfer rate of at least 100 megabytes per second (MB/s) to store more than 1 terabyte on the IBM cartridge", as well as an average access time of 10 seconds; at the time, these specifications were significantly superior to its primary competitor, magnetic tape, which only stored about 10-50 gigabytes per cartridge and had a data-transfer rate of about 15 MB/s. It was also considered more durable than magnetic tape, since it is not vulnerable to magnetic fields and is read by lasers instead of physical contact with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|Later {{helically}} scanning recorders instead usually use {{a method}} called slant-azimuth recording, also called symmetric phase recording. The head drum usually contains two heads with the magnetic gap of one head slanted slightly leftwards and the magnetic gap {{of the other}} head slanted slightly rightwards. (The slant of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> {{is referred to as}} its azimuth adjustment). Because of the alternating slants, each head will not wrongly read the signal recorded by the other head and the stripes can be recorded immediately next to each other, alternating between left slant on one television field and right slant on the next television field. (In practice, it's not uncommon for the recorded stripes to overlap somewhat). Later machines including the JVC VHS and the Sony Betamax use slant-azimuth recording as well as all later machines and their digital derivatives.|$|E
50|$|Runway designations {{change over}} time because the {{magnetic}} poles slowly drift on the Earth's surface and the magnetic bearing will change. Depending on the airport location and how much drift takes place, {{it may be necessary}} over time to change the runway designation. As runways are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10 degrees, this will affect some runways more than others. For example, if the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> of a runway is 233 degrees, it would be designated Runway 23. If the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> changed downwards by 5 degrees to 228, the Runway would still be Runway 23. If on the other hand the original <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> was 226 (Runway 23), and the heading decreased by only 2 degrees to 224, the runway should become Runway 22. Because the drift itself is quite slow, runway designation changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require an accompanying change in aeronautical charts and descriptive documents. When runway designations do change, especially at major airports, it is often changed at night as taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers {{at each end of the}} runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators. In July 2009 for example, London Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom changed its runway designations from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night.|$|R
