[...] The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). Thus has arisen the term postmodern family, which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and child-free couples."- Brian K. Williams, Stacey C.

500|$|Lindsay Zoladz, {{a writer}} of Pitchfork, {{observed}} when <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> TLC, their brains immediately go to the sounds and images of CrazySexyCool: [...] "Waterfalls", [...] "Red Light Special" [...] and the silk pajamas in [...] "Creep". Ebony Michael A. Gonzales reminisced about {{the time when the}} video first debuted on MTV, TLC returned as the [...] "lipstick liberators," [...] much to the surprise of a public used to their tomboy style. The journalist then also compared the [...] "splashy" [...] video to its previous versions as [...] "less urban" [...] and more [...] "Madison Avenue commercial chic." [...] Like Gonzales, PopMatters writer Quentin B. Huff also noticed the [...] "striking" [...] difference between the t-shirt and baggy pants look on their last video [...] "What About Your Friends" [...] and the new [...] "silky nightgown come-ons" [...] look on [...] "Creep" [...] and [...] "Red Light Special". In the book Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context, author Carol Vernallis analyzed that the girls' outfits in [...] "Creep" [...] helped suggesting their [...] "sexual availability," [...] but the low-angle camera placement, the texture and movement of billowing silk fabric suggest a [...] "phallic sexuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{mouthpiece}} of a horse's bit is {{the first}} factor <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> when assessing the severity and action of the bit. Therefore, it is carefully considered when choosing a bit for a horse. [...] Many mouthpieces are not allowed in certain competitions. [...] Bit mouthpieces may be single jointed, double-jointed, [...] "mullen" [...] (a straight bar), or have an arched port {{in the center of}} varying height, with or without joints. [...] Some have rollers, rings or small [...] "keys" [...] that the horse can move with its tongue. [...] Mouthpieces may be smooth, wire-wrapped or otherwise roughened, or of twisted wire or metal.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{its size}} and several decades of history prior to the {{addition}} of other campuses, the University of Minnesota Twin Cities (sometimes abbreviated UMTC) is what <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> upon hearing [...] "University of Minnesota". [...] It can actually be subdivided into multiple parts. [...] Most significantly, Minneapolis and neighboring Saint Paul (actually, the suburb of Falcon Heights) each have distinct campuses. [...] The Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses are connected via a dedicated bus transitway.

I did not write a diplomatic history or a history of foreign affairs in his life.

2500|$|Canzone Napoletana is what <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{when they}} think of Neapolitan music. It {{consists}} of {{a large body of}} composed popular music—such songs as [...] 'O sole mio, Torna a Surriento, Funiculì funiculà, etc. The Neapolitan song became a formal institution in the 1830s through the vehicle of an annual song writing competition for the yearly Festival of Piedigrotta, dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta, a well-known church in the Mergellina area of Naples. The winner of the first festival was a song entitled Te voglio bene assaie; it was composed by the prominent opera composer, Gaetano Donizetti. The festival ran regularly until 1950 when it was abandoned. A subsequent Festival of Neapolitan Song on Italian state radio enjoyed some success in the 1950s but was eventually abandoned as well. The period since 1950 has produced such songs as Malafemmena by Totò, Indifferentemente by Mario Trevi and Carmela by Sergio Bruni. [...] Although separated by some decades from the earlier classics of this genre, they have now become [...] "classics" [...] in their own right. (See main article for more information.) ...|$|E

The white-collar crime involves people making use of their occupational position to enrich themselves and others illegally, which often causes public harm. In white-collar crime, public harm wreaked by false advertising, marketing of unsafe products, embezzlement, and bribery of public officials is more extensive than <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> which go unnoticed and unpunished.|$|R

6000|$|Observe, {{there is}} not a single false, or even overcharged, expression. [...] "Mound" [...] of the sea wave is {{perfectly}} simple and true; [...] "changing" [...] is as familiar as may be; [...] "foam that passed away," [...] strictly literal; and the whole line descriptive of the reality with a degree of accuracy which I know not any other verse, in the range of poetry, that altogether equals. For most people have not a distinct idea of the clumsiness and massiveness of a large wave. The word [...] "wave" [...] is used too generally of ripples and breakers, and bendings in light drapery or grass: it does not by itself convey a perfect image. But the word [...] "mound" [...] is heavy, large, dark, definite; there is no mistaking the kind of wave meant, nor missing the sight of it. Then the term [...] "changing" [...] has a peculiar force also. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> waves as rising and falling. But if they look at the sea carefully, they will perceive that the waves do not rise and fall. They change. Change both place and form, but they do not fall; one wave goes on, and on, and still on; now lower, now higher, now tossing its mane like a horse, now building itself together like a wall, now shaking, now steady, but still the same wave, till at last it seems struck by something, and changes, one knows not how,--becomes another wave.|$|E

Running with Sir William Pulteney (who was a business partner of his father), they beat the two Whig candidates so easily that their opponents withdrew {{two days before the}} close of the poll. Clarges suspected the motives and patriotism of the Whigs, who had fought for the exclusion of the Duke of York; he described them as [...] "now making excuses for those, who <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> guilty <b>of</b> the basest and most dishonourable action that was ever done in this nation".|$|R

50|$|Although <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> first <b>of</b> four-wheel {{vehicles}} {{when they}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> tractors, a tractor may {{have one or}} more axles. The key benefit is the power itself, which only takes one axle to provide. Single-axle tractors, more often called two-wheel tractors or walk-behind tractors, have had many users {{since the beginning of}} internal combustion engine tractors. They tend to be small and affordable. This was especially true before the 1960s, when a walk-behind tractor could often be more affordable than a two-axle tractor of comparable power. Today's compact utility tractors and advanced garden tractors may negate most of that market advantage, but two-wheel tractors still enjoy a loyal following, especially where an already-paid-for two-wheel tractor is financially superior to a compact or garden tractor {{that would have to be}} purchased. Countries where two-wheel tractors are especially prevalent today include, Thailand, China, Bangladesh, India, and other Southeast Asia countries.|$|R

In contrast, this chapter suggests that the characteristics of flow also {{have the potential to}} be evil. First, we will explain how flow can lead to addiction when exercising, playing games, and using the Internet. Then we will consider how flow is linked to impaired risk perception and risky behavior. As a third negative facet of flow, we will outline how it can also be experienced in antisocial contexts and during combat.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{symptom of the}} {{papillary}} tumor is a headache. Because headaches are so common, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> nothing <b>of</b> it. This is why brain tumors are so dangerous. There are {{not a lot of}} symptoms that go along with them so people tend to wait a long time before seeking medical help. Most of the time people will go see a doctor when their headaches become consistent and start to never go away. This symptom however occurs secondary to hydrocephalus, which is a result from compression of the cerebral aqueduct. The cerebral aqueduct is a narrow channel in the midbrain, which connects the third and fourth ventricles. When a tumor blocks the pathway of the cerebrospinal fluid, this will cause headaches in the patient. Often when hydrocephalus occurs, a shunt is put in place in order to alleviate the pressure. In one case study, an endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed as a first line procedure to treat the hydrocephalus and also for diagnostic purposes.|$|R
