5|$|Aside from {{professional}} wrestling performances, celebrity involvement {{has been a}} <b>major</b> <b>key</b> {{in the production of}} WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more hype and media attention for the event, in this way receiving more attraction to the event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E
5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is {{a somber}} movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively conservative in its key scheme, moving to the relative <b>major</b> <b>key</b> {{and back to the}} tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in the opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a transformation of the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, ternary form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major colored by its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E
5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a <b>major</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E

5|$|The opening song {{played in}} the first four seasons (and the end credits in all seasons) has a folk rock {{instrumentation}} with bass guitar, trumpets and rhythmic drums. Its beat is fast in the opening and leisurely in the closing credits. It is in the minor key and it features a tritone or a diminished fifth, creating a melodic dissonance, which captures the show's surrealistic nature. In the latter parts of season 4 and season 5, the opening tune has an electro funk arrangement with pop qualities. Seasons 6-9 have a sprightly bluegrass instrumentation with a usage of banjo and is set in the <b>major</b> <b>key.</b> For the later seasons, the arrangement is electro rock with a breakbeat influence, which feature electric guitars backed up by synthesized, groovy drumbeats.|$|E

25|$|Between his two Overtures on Russian Themes, Balakirev became {{involved}} with folk song collecting and arranging. This work alerted him to {{the frequency of the}} Dorian mode, the tendency for many melodies to swing between the <b>major</b> <b>key</b> and its relative minor on its flat seventh key, and the tendency to accentuate notes not consistent with dominant harmony. These characteristics were reflected in Balakirev's handling of Russian folk song.|$|E

50|$|A diminished seventh chord may {{alternatively}} {{resolve to}} a major or major-minor seventh chord whose root {{is one of the}} notes of the diminished seventh chord (common tone), the most common being the raised supertonic seventh, which resolves to the tonic in <b>major</b> <b>keys</b> (ii7 - I) and the raised submediant, which resolves to dominant triad or seventh in <b>major</b> <b>keys</b> (vi7 - V), with the altered tones resolving upward by half step in both cases.|$|R

25|$|The circle can {{be easily}} used {{to find out the}} common chord {{progression}} for basic keys. The circle of fifths shows every <b>major</b> <b>key</b> with its corresponding minor key (of the Aeolian mode). This can be used as the vi chord in a progression. The V and IV chord can be found by moving clockwise and counterclockwise from the root chord respectively. The corresponding minor keys of the V and IV are the iii and ii respectively.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the whistle}} is {{essentially}} a diatonic instrument, {{it is possible to}} get notes outside the principal <b>major</b> <b>key</b> of the whistle, either by half-holing (partially covering the highest open finger hole) or by cross-fingering (covering some holes while leaving some higher ones open). However, half-holing is somewhat more difficult to do correctly, and whistles are available in many keys, so for other keys a whistler will typically use a different whistle instead, reserving half-holing for accidentals. Some whistle designs allow a single fipple, or mouthpiece, to be used on differently keyed bodies.|$|E
25|$|For minor scales, {{rotate the}} letters {{counter-clockwise}} by 3, so that, e.g., A minor has 0 sharps or flats and E minor has 1 sharp. (See relative key for details.) A {{way to describe}} this phenomenon is that, for any <b>major</b> <b>key</b> , a scale can be built beginning on the sixth (VI) degree (relative minor key, in this case, E) containing the same notes, but from E – E as opposed to G – G. Or, G-major scale (G – A – B – C – D – E – F# – G) is enharmonic (harmonically equivalent) to the e-minor scale (E – F# – G – A – B – C – D – E).|$|E

25|$|A {{borrowed}} chord is {{one from}} a different key than the home key, the key of the piece it is used in. The most common occurrence of this is where a chord from the parallel major or minor key is used. Particularly good examples can be found throughout the works of composers such as Schubert. For instance, for a composer working in the C <b>major</b> <b>key,</b> a major III chord (e.g., an E major chord) would be borrowed, as this chord appears only in the C minor key. Although borrowed chords could theoretically include chords taken from any key other than the home key, {{this is not how}} the term is used when a chord is described in formal musical analysis.|$|E
25|$|Wetz's three symphonies are powerful, {{introverted}} {{works in}} the style of late romantic symphonic music being cultivated at the time, yet his works show their own distinct personalities separating them from the tradition. For Wetz, the subdued nature of the closing passages of his works confirm the integrity of these works. The first symphony's end, for instance, begins in the key of C minor (as Bruckner did also) and almost dissolves in a bright <b>major</b> <b>key</b> before, after a recall of earlier music, an austere and minor-mode conclusion not heard in any Bruckner finale (closer to the mood of the conclusions to some Bruckner opening movements) comes around. This was certainly influenced by the spirit of the times in which he lived, which were certainly not typical. His quartets follow the same techniques in form and gesture as his symphonies, but these were invested with substantially more intense feeling than the more public symphonies.|$|E
25|$|Tchaikovsky's {{first three}} symphonies, while {{seemingly}} optimistic and nationalistic, are also chronicles of {{his attempts to}} reconcile his training from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Russian folk music and his own innate penchant for melody. Both worked against sonata form, the paramount architectural concept in Western classical music, not with it. The First, while conventional in form, shows Tchaikovsky's individuality strongly; it is rich in melodic invention and exudes Mendelssohnian charm and grace. The Second Symphony is among the more accessible of Tchaikovsky's works and exists in two versions. While the latter version is the one generally performed today, Tchaikovsky's friend and former student Sergei Taneyev considered the earlier one to be finer compositionally speaking. The Third, the only symphony Tchaikovsky completed in a <b>major</b> <b>key,</b> is written in five movements, similar to Robert Schumann's Rhenish Symphony, shows Tchaikovsky alternating between writing in a more orthodox symphonic manner and writing music {{as a vehicle to}} express his emotional life; with the introduction of dance rhythms into every movement except the slow one, the composer widens the field of symphonic contrasts both within and between movements.|$|E
