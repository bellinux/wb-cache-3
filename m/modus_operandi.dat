5|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} by the United States Fire Administration, Kazmierczak {{is believed to have}} studied Virginia Tech perpetrator Seung-Hui Cho's actions and used a similar <b>modus</b> <b>operandi.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} legends tell of her various exploits and marriages, including {{union with}} Shiva. These tales relate, among other things, {{the birth of}} the god Shasta and the destruction of Bhasmasura, the ash-demon. Mohini's main <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> is to trick or beguile those she encounters. She is worshipped throughout Indian culture, but mainly in Western India, where temples are devoted to her depicted as Mahalasa, the consort of Khandoba, a regional avatar of Shiva.|$|E
5|$|McKenzie {{was killed}} on 17 July 1889 by {{severance}} of the left carotid artery. Several minor bruises and cuts {{were found on the}} body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though his colleague George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed. Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> to deflect suspicion from himself, and those who ascribe it to the Ripper.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{complicated}} battle tactics {{for both}} sides, but the Russians and the Austrians, having {{arrived in the}} area first, were able to overcome many of its difficulties by strengthening a causeway between two small ponds. They had also devised a solution to Frederick's deadly <b>modus</b> <b>operandi,</b> the oblique order. Although Frederick's troops initially gained {{the upper hand in}} the battle, the sheer number of Allied troops gave the Russians and Austrians an advantage. By afternoon, when the combatants were exhausted, fresh Austrian troops thrown into the fray secured the Allied victory.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{dreams of}} a red light that leads him to the corpse {{of a young girl}} buried in a park in Manassas, Virginia. When he awakens, he heads to the park and finds the girl's skeleton. The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as a vacuum cleaner salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although he confessed to all of the murders.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi.</b>|$|E
5|$|Martin {{killed at}} least three people in Singapore and Thailand, and may have killed others in Belize, Mexico, and the United States. His <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> was to pose as a tourist and {{converse}} with another randomly chosen caucasian, either aboard their flights or while waiting at airports. He stayed in the same hotels as his victims in a room near theirs. Once he had an excuse {{to be in their}} rooms, he used an electroshock weapon to immobilise them before killing them by striking their heads with a hammer and cutting them up in their bathrooms. He chose caucasians as his victims because they were vacationing far away from their home countries, which made him less likely to be discovered. His motive apparently included money, as large amounts were withdrawn using the credit cards of Gerard Lowe and Timothy MacDowall.|$|E
5|$|The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party at {{one point}} had agreed to join as well, seeing that the ARF's {{political}} ideology was socialism. However, the Hunchakians claimed the new party was not Marxist enough and withdrew from the union. The original aim of the ARF was to gain autonomy for the Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire. The party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s and held its first major meeting in Tiflis, Russian Empire, in 1892. At that meeting, the party adopted a decentralized <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere. The party set its goal of a society based on the democratic principles of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and agrarian reform.|$|E
25|$|It {{would go}} through the <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> and the motives of the accused.|$|E
25|$|Police {{identified}} {{a number of}} attacks which matched Sutcliffe's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> and tried to question the killer, but he was never charged with other crimes.|$|E
25|$|Goma-2 ECO {{was never}} before used by al-Qaeda, but the {{explosive}} and the <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> were described by The Independent as ETA trademarks, although the Daily Telegraph {{came to the}} opposite conclusion.|$|E
25|$|His {{singular}} {{and often}} exhausting <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> involves taking the work through from conception to creation, entirely unassisted in his purpose-built bronze casting foundry at Clonlea, in Blackrock. This {{is one of}} the things that make him unique among the bronze casting fraternity.|$|E
25|$|The Miniature Killer's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> is {{inspired}} by the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, a series of intricate crime-scene dioramas that are actually used to help train the Baltimore Homicide Investigation unit. These dollhouses are explored in detail in the documentary Of Dolls and Murder.|$|E
25|$|It was the Dutch <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> at {{the time}} to {{intercept}} the annual Portuguese trading fleet, especially since their capture of the Santa Catarina in 1603 had been so profitable its booty sold {{for more than half of}} the original capital of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).|$|E
25|$|His <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> was to {{commission}} a yacht, take delivery (boats usually took 18–24 months to build), {{use it for}} a couple of years, then commission a new yacht with improvements. When the new boat was finished, he would sell the old boat at a profit and repeat the cycle.|$|E
25|$|All {{the victims}} were murdered in Monroe County, except for Gibson, {{who was killed in}} {{neighboring}} Wayne County. The retired detective Robert Keppel has argued that the detectives investigating the case over-relied on the concept of <b>modus</b> <b>operandi,</b> at times searching for multiple suspects due to small differences in the profiles of each victim.|$|E
25|$|No {{forensic}} evidence linked Fred {{to the murder}} of Anne McFall, and he always denied killing her. However, the fact her body had been extensively dismembered, and was missing several phalange bones, plus the fact the cubicle dimensions of the grave in which her body was buried match the <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> of Fred's later murders.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Klass heaped praise on {{astronomer}} and UFO investigator Allan Hendry's The UFO Handbook, but Hendry objected {{strongly to}} Klass's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi,</b> which Hendry argued consisted of suppressing and distorting evidence, unscientific reasoning, ad hominem attacks, smear campaigns, scientific {{bait and switch}} tactics, and seemingly refusing to evaluate evidence that conflicted with his preconceptions. Nuclear physicist and UFO researcher Stanton T. Friedman also frequently jousted with Klass.|$|E
25|$|Bible John is the {{nickname}} of {{a serial killer}} who {{is believed to have}} murdered three young women after meeting them at the Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow, Scotland, between 1968 and 1969. The killer has never been identified although the known movements and <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> of convicted Glaswegian serial killer Peter Tobin suggests that he may have been behind the killings. However, this has never been proven and the case remains unsolved.|$|E
25|$|Shari Lynne Ball, a 20-year-old {{aspiring}} model, {{went missing}} in October 1983 from Boca Raton, Florida. Her badly decomposed {{body was found}} by a hunter in Shelby, New York, sometime later, but was not identified until 2014. Her cause of death could not be determined, but foul play was suspected. Wilder is currently being looked at for possible involvement, since it matches his <b>modus</b> <b>operandi,</b> but no evidence links him to the crime.|$|E
25|$|These contentions were refuted by William Charvet, who {{contended that}} any {{similarities}} in <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> did not constitute automatic {{proof of his}} client's guilt, and that the evidence presented {{did not support the}} prosecution's contention beyond a reasonable doubt that Bonin had murdered any of the four Orange County victims, or the two victims killed in Los Angeles County. Specifically, Charvet attacked the credibility of James Munro, and further contended Bonin was simply a scapegoat for four unsolved murders.|$|E
25|$|Many {{details about}} the unit's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> have been {{revealed}} by former members. One issued {{a statement to the}} Troops Out Movement in July 1978. In 2012–13, a former MRF member using the covername 'Simon Cursey' gave a number of interviews and published the book MRF Shadow Troop about his time in the unit. In November 2013, a BBC Panorama documentary was aired about the MRF. It drew on information from seven former members, {{as well as a number}} of other sources.|$|E
25|$|But somehow, a small {{misunderstanding}} arose between Mahatma Gandhi and Sree Narayana Guru, {{regarding the}} <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> of the Satyagraha. One of Guru's dialogues with the General Secretary of the SNDP was misinterpreted {{in such a}} way that it led to believe that the ideals of Gandhiji and Guru clashed. There was a stage when someone suggested to Gandhiji to withdraw the support for the Satyagraha because the spiritual leader of the Thiyyas was urging his followers to use violence, which is against the principles of Satyagraha.|$|E
25|$|The Armenian {{national}} liberation movement gathered momentum {{with the establishment}} of Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Social Democrat Hunchakian Party and Armenakan (later named as Ramgavar). The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hentchaks) had the goal to gain Armenia's independence from the Ottoman Empire. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) originally aimed for autonomy of the Armenian-populated areas, which changed to establishment of Armenian state with the coming years. ARF adopted a decentralized <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> according to which the various chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Between 1990 and 1994, Bond {{collaborated with}} artist Liam Gillick on their Documents Series {{a group of}} eighty-three fine art works which {{appropriated}} the <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> of a news gathering team, to produce relational art. To make the work the duo posed as a news reporting team—i.e., a photographer and a journalist—often attending events scheduled in the Press Association's Gazette—a list of potentially newsworthy events in London. Bond worked as if a typical photojournalist, joining the other press photographers present; whilst Gillick operated as the journalist, first collecting the ubiquitous Press kit before preparing his audio recording device.|$|E
25|$|Testimony to Human Rights Watch {{indicates}} the <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> of the militants was similar in other towns populated by Muslim residents; a further 8 Muslim residents {{disappeared from the}} village of Tabalo after the assailants had the locals gather and walk to Kasiguncu township. At least 14 Muslim transmigrants from Lombok and Java subsequently disappeared after being abducted from another town by an estimated 100 masked militants who had ordered the locals to gather at the village hall. Witnesses described the militia as having a list of names of people to abduct and several trucks to transport them.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 {{he was one}} of {{the founders}} of Mea Shearim, whose name he coined. His <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> was to buy a house in each new {{neighborhood}} that he helped establish, live in it for a while, and then move to a new home in the next neighborhood that he founded. In each neighborhood he supervised the purchase and construction of homes and assisted home buyers in acquiring loans. He also helped establish community institutions and spoke in the local synagogue. One of his sermons inspired a wealthy philanthropist named David Reiss to underwrite the founding of another neighborhood, Beit David, in 1873.|$|E
25|$|He {{married in}} 1968, {{but his wife}} left him after one week. Wilder emigrated to the United States in 1969. He lived in Boynton Beach, Florida, in an upscale home, and was {{successful}} in real estate, while developing an interest in photography. From about 1971 through 1975, he faced various charges related to sexual misconduct. He eventually raped a young woman he had lured into his truck on the pretense of photographing her for a modeling contract. This was {{to become part of}} his <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> during his later rape and murder spree. Despite several convictions, Wilder was never jailed for any of these crimes.|$|E
25|$|Impatient to {{complete}} his epic cycle, Wagner began work on the preliminary draft of Götterdämmerung on 2 October 1869, {{while he was still}} at work on the third act of Siegfried. There was to be no fair copy of this the final opera in the cycle, so the three acts passed through just three stages: preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf), orchestral draft (Orchesterskizze), and full score (Partiturerstschrift). Wagner had altered his <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> once again while at work on the last two acts of Die Meistersinger: now it was his practice to finish both complete drafts of each act in turn before beginning the full score of the entire opera.|$|E
25|$|Police officers, soldiers, or militiamen {{have been}} implicated {{in most of the}} hundred or so murders of journalists since {{democracy}} was restored in 1986. Employed by corrupt politicians or hired as contract killers, they usually target local radio presenters who have upset the people they are working for. The same <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> is nearly always used: two masked men on a motorcycle gun the journalist down as he is leaving his place of work. For a few thousand dollars, they eliminate the person who has been too outspoken. The cycle of violence has never ended because the culture of impunity is so strong, especially on Mindanao.|$|E
25|$|SHAC's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> {{is known}} as {{secondary}} and tertiary targeting. Activists engage in direct action—ranging from lawful protests to intimidation, harassment, and violent attacks—not only against HLS, its employees, and its employees' families, but also against secondary and tertiary targets such as HLS's business partners, and their business partners, insurers, caterers, cleaners, children's nursery schools, and office suppliers. A New York yacht club, for example, was covered in red paint because members of the club worked for Carr Securities, which traded in HLS shares. The campaign drove down HLS's profits, suppressed its share price, and {{made it difficult to}} find business and financial partners.|$|E
25|$|The <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> of {{engraving}} is as follows. The mill {{is placed}} in contact with {{one end of the}} copper roller, and being mounted on a lever support as much pressure as required can be put upon it by adding weights. Roller and mill are now revolved together, during which operation the projection parts of the latter are forced into the softer substance of the roller, thus engraving it, in intaglio, with several replicas of what was cut on the original die. When the full circumference of the roller is engraved, the mill is moved sideways {{along the length of the}} roller to its next position, and the process is repeated until the whole roller is fully engraved.|$|E
25|$|Sutcliffe {{attacked}} Olive Smelt in Halifax in August. Employing {{the same}} <b>modus</b> <b>operandi,</b> he struck {{her from behind}} and used a knife to slash her, this time above her buttocks. Again he was interrupted, and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt suffered emotional scars, including clinical depression. On 27 August, Sutcliffe attacked 14-year-old Tracy Browne in Silsden. He struck her from behind and hit her on the head five times while she was walking along a country lane. He ran off {{when he saw the}} lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack, but confessed to it in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The {{aftermath}} of a Jigsaw game is discovered by a SWAT team. The victim, Troy, was meant to rip chains from his body in order to escape from a bomb. Lieutenant Daniel Rigg calls Detectives Mark Hoffman and Allison Kerry to the scene. Kerry, who is guilt-ridden over the disappearance of Eric, {{points out that the}} room's only exit was welded shut, breaking Jigsaw's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> of giving his victims a chance to survive. That night, while reviewing the videotape, she is abducted and awakens in a harness that is hooked into her ribs. Kerry manages to retrieve the key from a suspended beaker of acid and unlock it before the timer expires, but it tears her rib cage apart anyway, killing her.|$|E
25|$|Authorities rated Rîmaru's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi</b> as ferocious and cruel, {{based on}} his {{propensity}} for cutting off clothes, biting off flesh, dragging his victims, and hacking away at them with his weapons, also raping them while they were unconscious. Rîmaru was judged to be aggressive, impulsive and sadistic. He showed signs of vampirism; for instance, he poked several holes into the flesh of Florica Marcu, who later related how he sucked blood out of them. Cannibalism was also present; he would bite women's vaginas, pubic areas and breasts, and the missing pieces of flesh were no longer found at the crime scenes. Additionally, he had necrophiliac tendencies, continuing his rapes after his victims had died and also beating and stabbing their corpses.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{the results}} of an eight-year review of the forgery were released, {{identifying}} Dawson's <b>modus</b> <b>operandi.</b> Multiple specimens demonstrated the same consistent preparation: application of the stain, packing of crevices with local gravel and fixation of teeth and gravel with dentist's putty. Analysis of shape and trace DNA showed that teeth from both sites belonged to the same orangutan. The consistent method and common source indicated the work of one person on all the specimens, and Dawson was the only one associated with Piltdown II. The authors did not {{rule out the possibility that}} someone else provided the false fossils to Dawson, but ruled out several other suspects, including Teilhard de Chardin and Doyle, based on the skill and knowledge demonstrated by the forgeries, which closely reflected ideas fashionable in biology at the time.|$|E
