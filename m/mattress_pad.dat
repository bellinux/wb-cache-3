5000|$|A <b>{{mattress}}</b> <b>pad,</b> mattress topper, or underpad {{is designed}} to lie atop a mattress.

It is of particular benefit when the existing mattress is worn or uncomfortable. Toppers quite often have a contoured profile to facilitate airflow. Visco-elastic foam toppers are regularly used in medical institutions because of their pressure relieving properties. The foam used in the construction of these memory foam toppers reacts to both pressure and temperature.

50|$|A draw sheet {{is a small}} {{bed sheet}} placed {{crosswise}} over {{the middle of the}} bottom sheet of a mattress to cover the area between the person's upper back and thighs, often used by medical professionals to move patients. It can be made of plastic, rubber, or cotton, and is about half the size of a regular sheet. It can be used in place of a <b>mattress</b> <b>pad</b> if a rubber mattress is used. The draw sheet {{may or may not be}} tucked into the sides of the bed. When a draw sheet is used to move patients, it is sometimes known as a lift sheet. Nursing manuals recommend that, when a plastic or rubber draw sheet is used, a cotton drawsheet is placed over it. If a folded sheet is used as a draw sheet, the folded edge of the sheet is positioned at the person's upper body. Draw sheets used as lift sheets are generally not tucked in, though sometimes after the move, they are.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. More than 50 {{million people}} in the U. S. suffer from chronic sleep disorders, {{including}} snoring, bruxism, restless legs syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea. Clinical diagnosis of severe cases often requires expensive, hospital-based polysomnography testing, while less severe cases may benefit from lower-cost in-home sensor systems to collect physiological data over multiple nights. Remedies for sleep disorders, depending on the diagnosis, range from life style modification and medication prescription to throat surgery. There is a need for unobtrusive, in-bed sensing systems as well as robotic devices to alleviate certain sleep disorder symptoms. Two companion devices are presented. The SleepSmart device is a multi-sensor <b>mattress</b> <b>pad</b> controlled by software to detect heart rate, breathing rate, body orientation and index of restlessness. A spectral analysis module is combined with an event detection module to accumulate nightly reports, signal alarms when appropriate and, in future iterations, modify ambient conditions in the bedroom. A companion project has developed Morpheus, a mattress actuation system to encourage a person to roll over in bed to alleviate snoring based on acoustic sensor data analysis. The combination of the two systems is expected to lead to novel, in-home consumer devices to aid persons affected by mild forms of sleep disorders.

5000|$|The U.S. Flammable Fabrics Act is an {{act that}} was passed in 1953 to {{regulate}} the manufacture of highly flammable clothing.

[...] The Federal Trade Commission was initially placed as the enforcement authority but this responsibility was later transferred over to the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 1967 when the act was amended to include interior furnishings, paper, plastic, foam, and other materials used in wearing apparel and interior furnishings. The Consumer Product Safety Commission was given the authority, under the U.S. Flammable Fabrics Act, to issue mandatory flammability standards.

30|$|The fire {{performance}} of mattresses is regulated in the United States using {{two types of}} ignition source; smoldering and open flame ignition. The current U.S. mattress flammability standards that have the most significant impact on industry and the consumer are 16 CFR 1632 (16 CFR 1632 Standard for the flammability of <b>mattresses</b> and <b>mattress</b> <b>pads</b> [1991]) and 16 CFR 1633 (16 CFR 1633 [2007]). The two federal flammability regulatory standards (16 CFR 1632 and 16 CFR 1633) are mandatory, and all manufacturers must comply with {{them in order to}} sell residential mattresses in the U.S. (Table 1). The 16 CFR 1632 regulation, introduced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in 1973, defines the fire resistance of mattresses to cigarette ignition, a smoldering source. The smoldering ignition test measures the char length over the mattress surface and the extent of damage to the mattress after a specified time period (Table 1).|$|R
30|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, the {{landscape}} of mattress-related fires has significantly changed. In the U.S., numbers of mattress-related residential fires have consistently fallen with time. The credit for this improvement can be attributed in parts to factors including the introduction of: smoke detectors/alarms (Ahrens [2011 a]), smoldering ignition resistant mattresses regulated by 16 CFR 1632 (16 CFR 1632 Standard for the flammability of <b>mattresses</b> and <b>mattress</b> <b>pads</b> [1991]), child-resistant lighter regulated by 16 CFR 1210 ([1994]), reduced ignition propensity cigarettes (Hall [2012]), and other non-regulatory factors including a general decline in smoking and wider awareness of fire safe behaviours (Tohamy & Aiken [2007]). Despite these approaches, mattresses/beddings are still reported as the first items ignited in almost one-third of the fires originating in the bedroom and {{almost half of the}} associated deaths and injuries (Ahrens [2011 b]; Ahrens [2008]; Greene & Miller [2010]).|$|R

40|$|Magnets produce {{energy in}} the form of {{magnetic}}fields. Two main types of magnets exist: static orpermanent magnets, in which the magnetic field is generated by the spin of electrons within the material it-self, and electromagnets, in which a magnetic field is gen-erated when an electric current is applied. Most magnets that are marketed to consumers for health purposes are static magnets of various strengths, typically between 30 and 500 mT. Magnets have been incorporated into arm and leg wraps, <b>mattress</b> <b>pads,</b> necklaces, shoe inserts and bracelets. 1 Static magnets represent a multi-billion-dollar industry. 2 They are marketed with claims of effectiveness for reducing pain of various origins. One survey suggested that about 28 % of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or fibro-myalgia use magnets or copper bracelets for pain relief. 3 However, evidence for the scientific principles or biological mechanisms to support such claims is limited. According to one proposed mechanism, nociceptive C-fibres have a lower threshold potential, and magnetic fields selectively attenuate neuronal depolarization by shifting the membrane resting potential. 4 Another theory suggests that magnetic fields pro-mote an increase in blood flow through the skin and the sub-cutaneous and muscular tissues, which reduces the pain. 5 In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials of static magnets for treating pain...|$|R

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this paper}} is to report a study to {{determine}} the effects of absorbent pads on the pressure-relieving properties of 'standard' and pressure management mattresses. Background. Pressure ulcers and incontinence often co-exist. There is a strong association between poor mobility and continence problems and patients using pressure management products are therefore also likely to be using absorbent pads. Methods. An instrumented articulated anthropometric phantom with simulated soft body 'tissues' in the gluteal and sacral areas was used as the 'subject'. The phantom was raised and lowered on to three mattresses (standard foam, visco-elastic foam and surface-cut foam) in three states: naked, wearing a dry pad (Tena Super, SCA Hygiene AB) and wearing a wet pad. The pressure mapping device Xsensor was used to record the distribution of pressure over the sacral and ischial areas of the phantom. Peak pressure was used as the primary outcome variable and 10 repeats were made on each mattress under each condition. Results. There were substantial and significant differences for all three mattresses in recorded peak pressures between the naked buttocks and the buttocks wearing a dry pad. There were no significant differences between measurements made using the dry vs. wet pad. Peak pressures frequently occurred over areas of pad folds. Additional testing showed that pads that were 'smoothed' by hand had significantly lower peak pressures than 'unsmoothed' pads. Conclusions. Absorbent pads have a substantial adverse effect on the pressure redistribution properties of <b>mattresses.</b> <b>Pad</b> folds appear to contribute to this effect, which can be ameliorated slightly by smoothing. Absorbent pad manufacturers should consider engineering pads that minimize disruption to pressure management. Further examination of continence and pressure management products is necessary to establish optimum combinations for nursing care...|$|R
