40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of organic wastes derived from winery and distillery industry on the carbon and nitrogen mineralisation in amended soils. The influence of soil type was also monitored. Incubation experiments with three different calcareous soils (clay-loam, loam and sandy textu-red) mixed with four winery and distillery organic wastes (grape stalk, grape <b>marc,</b> <b>wine</b> lees and exhaus-ted grape marc) were made to monitor the organic C, the specific respiration (qCO 2) and different forms of nitrogen produced by these wastes. The evolution of C mineralisation fitted a first-order kinetic for all amended soils. An initial increase was observed in the qCO 2 values, after tending towards {{the values of the}} control, showing the pattern of the soil to recover its initial equilibrium status. The addition of these was-tes in the soils produced a slight increase of the inorganic nitrogen, observing an inhibition in the N mine-ralisation in the soils amended with grape stalk. Organic matter mineralisation was probably influenced by soil type, the sandy soil favouring more the N and C mineralisation processes than the clayey-loam and loam soils...|$|E

Biodiesel achieves a reduction in CO 2 emissions and uses renewable raw materials from plant oils (cottonseed, rapeseed, soya, palm, and sunflower) and from other wastes. Grape <b>marc,</b> vinasses, <b>wine</b> lees, and winery wastewater have been used as raw materials to produce lactic acid, biofuels including ethanol, enzymes, chemical intermediates and energy through anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis process.|$|R
40|$|Winemaking {{produces}} solid (grape <b>marc)</b> {{and liquid}} (<b>wine</b> lees and deposit of the must) wastes named “oenological by-products”, which, according to European regulations, must be eliminated following the environmental regulatory requirement [1]. In France, these European regulations forced wine growers, until the 2013 / 2014 campaign, to deliver all by-products to wine distilleries. This French obligation {{is known as}} the “prestation vinique” [2,  3]. Following the Common Market Organisation wine reform, a consultation was initiated by FranceAgriMer on the potential value of oenological by-products. The French Institute of Vine and Wine (IFV) coordinated a national experimentation from 2010 to 2013 about recovery of by-products, with the support of members of the Technical Group: Association des Viticulteurs d'Alsace (AVA), Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC), Institut Technique des Corps Gras (ITERG), et Union Nationale des Groupements de Distillateurs d'Alcool (UNGDA). Distillation of grape <b>marc</b> and <b>wine</b> lees spreading and composting, and anaerobic digestion of grape marc were studied in order to answer the following questions: What technical feasibility? What environmental impact? What cost for winegrowers? What conformity with the regulations, including environmental regulatory obligations? [4]...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} are {{presented}} the researches made {{in order to obtain}} protein biomass with the aid of lactic bacteria grown on an economically medium, achieved by using secondary products from the winery: <b>marc</b> and <b>wine</b> yeast. Therefore, there were cultivated two strains of Lactobacillus sp. on five different growth medium. The protein biosynthesis and evolution of lactic fermentation were monitored by determining the optical density (OD) of the culture at a wavelength λ = 600 nm and by counting the colony forming units (CFU) by serial dilutions and seeding on plates and by determination of lactic acid obtained. The results showed that the fermentation medium represented by diffusion solution of the marc, enriched with peptone is economically profitable compared to other culture media containing peptone, yeast extract, glucose, minerals, amino acids and vitamins presented in the literature...|$|R

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} discussed the potential {{use of the}} <b>marc</b> from the <b>wine</b> production {{for the removal of}} metals from wastewaters. Marc containing stems, peels and seeds without any prior chemical treatment were homogenized and rinsed with distilled water to remove soluble impurities. IR spectrometry was used for characterization of the major functional groups responsible for the adsorption of metal ions. The experimental part of this work consisted of the assessment of the optional pH value for adsorption of copper and the maximum adsorption capacity of the used material in column and batch method. The results show that the optional pH values for adsorption of copper were in the range pH 3 – 4. Maximum adsorption capacity were calculated form adsorption isotherms by applying the Langmuir model and found to be 0, 260 4 mg/g Cu at a column method and 1, 246 2 mg/g Cu after 30 minutes the batch adsorption method. Further, it was experimentally demonstrated that the adsorption of copper in addition to the pH depends also on the initial copper concentration in the solution, contact time and other parameters whose optimization would achieve greater adsorption capacity of the referred material. The results indicate that the <b>marc</b> from the <b>wine</b> production have good potential form removing metals from wastewaters by adsorption...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study on}} the {{volatile}} composition of grappa low-wines. Grappa low wines are the first distillation products, with about 15 - 20 % v/v ethanol, when grappa is produced using continuous distillation. Different methods and conditions of <b>marc</b> and <b>wine</b> lees storage on an industrial scale have been considered. New technology for the storage of large amounts of grape marc, called the 'Grappa system', was evaluated. By comparison with a traditional ensilage method, the low-wines obtained from the Grappa system resulted in higher concentrations of ethanol, lower levels of methanol, slightly different concentrations of fusel alcohols and higher concentrations of ethyl esters and terpenes. The use of phosphoric acid and sodium methabisulphate to achieve a partial control of marc fermentation had no effects using the Grappa system method. This could be the result of the mixing technique used which was spraying alone and was only slightly effective for the homogenous treatment of the mass. On the contrary, the lower content of methanol, 2 -butanol and n-propanol confirmed the effectiveness of phosphoric acid addition to the wine lees...|$|R
40|$|The {{alcoholic}} drink called “aguardente de zimbro” is normally presented at touristic documentation about “Serra da Estrela” and {{included in the}} food heritage of the region. However, {{there is a lack}} of technical and scientific information about this beverage. This work intends to achieve a first characterization of this product concerning its technology, and its sensory properties and physico-chemical characteristics. A few number of commercial samples of this product and other alcoholic beverages made with juniper were analyzed. It was performed several analytical determinations to the samples, namely alcoholic strength, dry matter, total acidity, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, pH, chromatic characteristics, methanol, acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate in order to characterize analytically the juniper spirits, namely the Portuguese ones. It was also done the descriptive sensory analysis of the beverages. Based on the results the three Portuguese commercial beverages “Aguardente de zimbro”, which are currently in the market, seem to be made from three different alcoholic distillates (grape <b>marc</b> spirit, <b>wine</b> spirit and arbutus spirit). The three commercial beverages presented a yellowish colour. However, the three beverages presented a quite different flavour profile, so further research is needed in order to establish and understand the sensory profile of the traditional beverage...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with investigations {{on the possibility of}} producing grape-based alcoholic drinks from newly created grapevine varieties, such as Riesling Italian, Seedling 14660, Muscat Hamburg and Godominka. All chemical parameters for produced grape brandies, <b>marc</b> brandies and <b>wine</b> distillates complied with standards of quality as prescribed by the Regulations for quality of alcoholic drinks. Organoleptic evaluation proved that Seedling 14660 produced best scored wine distillate (17. 85), Muscat Hamburg and Godominka gave best scored grape brandy (18. 25) and Godominka yielded best scored marc brandy (18. 40). Sensory properties of assessed brandies and wine distillate indicate that aroma and quality are gaining in intensity and level of improvement, starting from <b>wine</b> distillate to <b>marc</b> brandies. Also, intensive fruity-floral aroma reminding of lily-of-the-valley and iris fragrance is evident...|$|R
40|$|The {{winemaking}} process generates many by-products besides wastewater, mainly grape marcs, grape stalks, {{and wine}} lees. Anaerobic digestion is particularly suitable to treat winery waste {{because of its}} high content of nutrient-rich organic matter and for its noticeable energetic potential. To date, only results from mesophilic tests have been extensively reported. In this study, potential methane production and kinetic constants were determined by batch trials under thermophilic conditions and compared with mesophilic values already reported in literature. Grape <b>marcs</b> and <b>wine</b> lees {{appeared to be the}} most promising substrates with an estimated potential of 0. 34 and 0. 37 Nm 3 CH 4 /kgVSfed, respectively, while grape stalks generated only 0. 13 Nm 3 CH 4 /kgVSfed. In order to assess the feasibility of a continuous anaerobic digestion process, a lab-scale semi-continuous reactor was constructed. Because of the consumption of buffer capacity, the biological process was difﬁcult to control. On the other hand, biogas was produced when working with a hydraulic retention time of 40 d and with previously fermented grape marcs; a speciﬁc biogas production of 0. 29 Nm 3 /kgVSfed was observed. The results of the continuous tests were used to calculate the potential energy recovery from grape marcs produced in Italy (808 thousands of tons per year) in terms of heat and electricity; about 245 GWh of heat and 201 GWh of electricity per annum could be generated in Italian scenario...|$|R

40|$|In Spain, large {{quantities}} of wine are produced every year (3, 339, 700 tonnes in 2011) (FAO, 2011) with the consequent waste generation. During the winemaking process, solid residues like grape stalks are generated, as well as grape <b>marc</b> and <b>wine</b> lees as by-products. According to the Council Regulation (EC) 1493 / 1999 on the common organization of the wine market, by-products coming from the winery industry must be sent to alcohol-distilleries to generate exhausted grape marc and vinasses. With an adequate composting treatment, these wastes {{can be applied to}} soils as a source of nutrients and organic matter. A three-year field experiment (2011, 2012 and 2013) was carried out in Ciudad Real (central Spain) to study the effects of wine-distillery waste compost application in a melon crop (Cucumis melo L.). Melon crop has been traditionally cultivated in this area with high inputs of water and fertilizers, but no antecedents of application of winery wastes are known. In a randomized complete block design, four treatments were compared: three compost doses consisted of 6. 7 (D 1), 13. 3 (D 2) and 20 t compost ha- 1 (D 3), and a control treatment without compost addition (D 0). The soil was a shallow sandy-loam (Petrocalcic Palexeralfs) with a depth of 0. 60 m and a discontinuous petrocalcic horizon between 0. 60 and 0. 70 m, slightly basic (pH 8. 4), poor in organic matter (0. 24 %), rich in potassium (410 ppm) and with a medium level of phosphorus (22. 1 ppm). During each growing period four harvests were carried out and total and marketable yield (fruits weighting < 1 kg or visually rotten were not considered), fruit average weight and fruit number per plant were determined. At the end of the crop cycle, four plants per treatment were sampled and the nutrient content (N, P and K) was determined. Soil samplings (0 - 30 cm depth) were carried before the application of compost {{and at the end of}} each growing season and available N and P, as well as exchangeable K content were analyzed. With this information, an integrated analysis was carried out with the aim to evaluate the suitability of this compost as organic amendment...|$|R
