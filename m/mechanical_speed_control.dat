40|$|A key {{topic in}} {{classical}} control theory is the Internal Model Principle (IMP). A particular {{case of the}} IMP for tracking periodic references or attenuating periodic disturbances in closed-loop control systems is a technique called repetitive control. This work proposes and describes an educational laboratory plant to show the students the advantages of repetitive controllers in systems with periodic references or disturbances. The plant {{has been designed to}} be low cost, easy to build, and subject to periodic disturbances with a clear physical explanation. More specifically, it consists of a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) electronic amplifier, a small dc motor, and a magnetic setup that generates a periodic load torque under constant <b>mechanical</b> <b>speed</b> operation. The <b>control</b> objective for the closed-loop control system is to regulate the <b>mechanical</b> <b>speed</b> to a constant value in spite of the periodic load torque disturbance. In order to accomplish this performance specification, a detailed design of a digital repetitive controller is presented, and some basic experimental results are provided to prove its good behavior. The paper also includes some repetitive control concepts and facts that teaching experience shows as essential to understand the design process. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|Electrically powered models utilize <b>mechanical</b> or {{electronic}} <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> {{units to}} adjust the amount of power delivered to the electric motor. The power delivered {{is proportional to the}} amount of throttle called for by the transmitter - the more you pull the trigger, the faster it goes. The voltage is [...] "pulsed" [...] using transistors to produce varying output with smooth transitions and greater efficiency. Electronic speed controllers use solid state components to regulate duty cycle, adjusting the power delivered to the electrical motor. In addition, most electronic speed controllers can use the electric motor as a magnetic brake, offering better control of the model than is possible with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>speed</b> control.Mechanical speed controllers use a network of resistors and switch between them by rotating a head with an electrode around a plate that has electrical contacts. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>speed</b> controllers are prone to being slow to react because they are actuated by servos, waste energy in the form of heat from the resistors, commonly become dirty and perform intermittently, and lack a dedicated braking ability. They appear only in vintage RC models, and are now essentially obsolete.Most electric cars up to recently used brushed motors but now many people are turning to brushless motors for their higher power output and because they require much less maintenance. They are rated either in relative turns or Kv. The Kv number tells how many RPM the motor will turn per volt, assuming no load and maximum efficiency. However, the ability of the system to put out power is dependent {{on the quality of the}} batteries used, wires and connectors supplying power. Due to their power, brushless motors are also used in bigger monster trucks and 1/8 nitro-powered buggies that have been converted to electric. High quality brushless systems can be much more powerful than nitro and can accomplish feats such as standing backflips when installed in a monster truck, most notably the HPI Savage Flux. Some 1/5 scale gas to electric conversions are in production but are uncommon due to high price.A new (2012) form of electric r/c racing is MAGracing. Small 1/32 scale cars and powered by rechargeable batteries and steering and <b>speed</b> are <b>controlled</b> by r/c. Extra steering guidance is provided by steel wires hidden in the track surface enabling more accurate steering than is attainable with free running r/c cars. Tracks can therefore be much narrower and smaller making the system suitable for 'in home' racing. Cars can be driven back onto the track afteran 'off', using reverse if necessary, so that track marshals are not required.|$|R
