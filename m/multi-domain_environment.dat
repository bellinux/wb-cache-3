The mechanism combines the traditional locality-aware peer selection with the consideration of ISP business relationship. By leveraging between the two peering strategies, the risk of possible congestion on critical inter-connected links can be effectively alleviated due to more concentrated P 2 P traffic over fewer inter-ISP links under pure cooperative peering schemes. According to our analytical modelling, the proposed hybrid approach is able to achieve better performance for P 2 P users, and can retain desirable network efficiency as of the cooperative peer selection strategy.

If the particular business process or business service is supported with an IT system, then the compliance assurance relates also to this supporting system. This dissertation thesis presents the concept of continual compliance management in service oriented systems with a special focus on application of advanced process automation tools. The aim of this thesis was design of methods and procedures for reliability and credibility of business processes both internally in single domain, and in case of business process outsourcing including iterated and/or dynamic outsourcing i. e. in <b>multi-domain</b> <b>environment</b> with a special emphasis on automation level maximization. Particular process and/or service {{is considered to be}} reliable and credible if we are able to prove its compliance with the defined requirements in a trusted way. The first part of this thesis is dedicated to traditional methods for compliance {{achievement and}} assurance as a basis and inspiration for methods based on high level of automation. The second part of this thesis presents the concept of design, implementation and verification of compliance in service oriented systems. It introduces the terms of ideal target process, Key Assurance Indicator (KAI) and Key Security Indicator (KSA). For <b>multi-domain</b> <b>environment</b> there is the concept of Protection Level Agreement (PLA).

This paper focuses on internal threats manifested when pub/sub brokers misbehave by deviating from their prescribed protocol. Broker misbehavior may partially or fully compromise the pub/sub service integrity. In this paper, we exploit the notion of overlay neighborhoods and develop a solution to protect content-based pub/sub systems against misbehaving (a. k. a., byzantine) brokers. Our approach gives correct brokers the ability to oversee the actions of their neighbors, identify cases of deviation from the protocol and take steps to subvert the threat. As {{a result of this}} collective oversight, the system can preserve its service integrity despite presence of a configurable number of byzantine brokers.
