25|$|Compared to the Lexus RX 330 and RX 350, the RX 400h {{featured}} a different front grille and round fog lights, and also differently styled LED taillights {{in place of}} the conventional LED ones on the RX 330/RX 350. Different exterior colors were offered. In 2007, Hybrid badging was added to the rear side doors. The RX 400h interior {{featured a}} hybrid information display on the navigation screen showing electrical <b>motor,</b> <b>gasoline</b> engine, and regenerative braking activation in real time. Some RX 400h models without navigation screens displayed the information on a small monochrome display on the instrument panel. When launched in 2005, the RX 400h came exclusively with brushed aluminum interior accents, {{in place of the}} wood trim offered in the standard RX.

With approximately 5% of the world's population, the United States is responsible for approximately 25% of annual global oil consumption and according to 2008 estimates has a per-person daily consumption rate more than double that of the European Union. Automobiles are the single largest consumer of oil, consuming 40%, and are also the source of 20% of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Big Three {{automakers}} {{had their}} own electric car programs during the late-1960s. In 1967, much smaller AMC partnered with Gulton Industries {{to develop a new}} battery based on lithium and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk. A nickel-cadmium battery supplied power to an all-electric 1969 Rambler American station wagon. Other [...] "plug-in" [...] experimental AMC vehicles developed with Gulton included the Amitron (1967) and the similar Electron (1977). More battery-electric concept cars appeared over the years, such as the Scottish Aviation Scamp (1965), the Enfield 8000 (1966) and two electric versions of General <b>Motors</b> <b>gasoline</b> cars, the Electrovair (1966) and Electrovette (1976).

5000|$|A {{leaf blower}} (often {{referred}} to as simply a blower) is a gardening tool that propels air out of a nozzle to move debris such as leaves and grass cuttings. Leaf blowers are powered by electric or <b>gasoline</b> <b>motors.</b> <b>Gasoline</b> models have traditionally been two-stroke engines, but four-stroke engines were recently introduced to partially address air pollution concerns. Leaf blowers are typically self-contained handheld units, or backpack mounted units with a handheld wand. The latter is more ergonomic for prolonged use. Larger units may rest on wheels and even use a motor for propulsion. These are sometimes called [...] "walk behind leaf blowers" [...] because they must be pushed by hand to be operated.|$|R

50|$|Diesel {{engines are}} more {{susceptible}} to hydrolock than gasoline engines. Due to their higher compression ratios, diesel engines have a much smaller final combustion chamber volume, requiring much less liquid to hydrolock. Diesel engines also tend to have higher torque, rotating inertia, and stronger starter <b>motors</b> than <b>gasoline</b> engines. The result is that a diesel engine is more likely to suffer catastrophic damage.|$|R
