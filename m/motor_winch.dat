50|$|Typically, windjammers are {{equipped}} with semi-mechanized rigging, steel profile masts and yards and steel cables as running rigging where possible. Often also the running rigging was handled by <b>motor</b> <b>winches</b> instead of manpower. Since the windjammer hull is optimized for good hydrodynamics because of sail handling, they were (and still are) capable of sustained high cruising speeds; most four-masted barques were able to cruise at 15 kn on plausible winds, some logged 18 kn regularly and Herzogin Cecilie {{is known to have}} logged 21 kn.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Grand Coulee Dam, the Keller, a cable ferry, served the crossing, at the confluence of the Columbia River and the Sanpoil River. The Keller had an on-board <b>motor</b> to <b>winch</b> the boat across the river.|$|R
50|$|Later {{systems have}} used modern {{electronic}} controls and quickly reversible motors with good slow-speed {{control to the}} hoist <b>winch</b> <b>motors,</b> so as to give a positioning accuracy of inches.

50|$|Hoist (<b>winch)</b> <b>motors</b> {{are either}} fixed speed or {{variable}} speed. Fixed speed motors are used at heavy-load and/or slow-speed line sets (e.g., electrics and orchestra shell line sets). Variable speed motors are used at line sets requiring dynamic motion {{that may be}} viewed by the audience (e.g., drapery and scenery line sets). Scenery hoists commonly allow travel at rates of hundreds of feet per minute.|$|R

In {{order to}} improve the {{economic}} benefits of tunneling to rotary drilling rig,in this paper,the rotary drilling rig main winch hydraulic system was improved,by increasing an hydro pneumatic accumulator storage and releasing gravitational potential energy of kelly bar,as well as increasing reversing motor and the main <b>winch</b> <b>motor</b> to form a hydraulic transformer. So ensured the high pressure when the energy release and reduced the rotary drilling rig engine power,what’s more,this system’s feasibility had been verified by theoretical calculation...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the main engine, a Rover Meteormark IVB1 (V12, 27-liter capacity, 650 hp), the Entpannungspanzer 56 Centurion has an auxiliary engine (Morris USHNM A41 Mk 2/1: 4 cylinders, 918 cm³, 16 hp) and a <b>winch</b> <b>motor</b> (Rolls-Royce B80 Mk. 2: 8 cylinder in line 5600 cm³, 136 hp).

The animatronic was originally programmed {{in time to}} the musical soundtrack, appearing to play to the organ, however this has not been maintained for many years. In 2014 the graveyard canopy was demolished following years of little maintenance. The station chandeliers were also removed, due to the <b>winch</b> <b>motors</b> used to lower them for inspection being left to seize up. Little of the attraction's original show design and scenery now exists as how it was intended.|$|R

40|$|A balloon-borne winch {{system has}} been {{developed}} and flight tested which permits the repetitive lowering and hoisting of a stratospheric sampling payload for distances of up to 20 km from a float altitude of 35 - 40 km. This new approach to in situ stratospheric measurements permits multiple scans of various depths and velocities, closely spaced {{over a period of}} hours or days, thus dramatically increasing observational effectiveness. The <b>motor</b> driven <b>winch</b> permits control of ascent velocities from 0 - 9 m/s with energy derived from a large battery; for descent, the motors are used as generators, velocity is controlled over the same range, and the energy is dumped radiatively to space. The 1. 75 mm diameter tether is of braided Kevlar construction with a nylon jacket; it exhibits a 2900 N break strength. Both the winch and the payload suspended by the tether are fully instrumented to evaluate potentially destructive system-induced dynamics and the effects of stratospheric wind shears. The system was successfully flight tested by lowering a 62 kg payload for a distance of 12 km from a float altitude of 38. 5 km and hoisting it back up again, both at velocities ranging between 5 - 9 m/s. Observations indicated minimal system-induced dynamical effects, and no adverse effects due to the 8 m/s wind shear present during flight...|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of making bridges moveable is the lower cost, {{due to the}} absence of high piers and long approaches. The principal disadvantage is that the traffic on the bridge must be halted when it is opened for passages. For seldom-used railroad bridges over busy channels, the bridge may be left open and then closed for train passages. For small bridges, bridge movement may be enabled without the need for an engine. Some bridges are operated by the users, especially those with a boat, others by a bridgeman (or bridge tender); a few remotely using video-cameras and loudspeakers. Generally, the bridges are powered by electric <b>motors,</b> whether operating <b>winches,</b> gearing, or hydraulic pistons. While moveable bridges in their entirety may be quite long, the length of the moveable portion is restricted by engineering and cost considerations to a few hundred feet.|$|R
40|$|Ice core {{drilling}} is optimized {{by analyzing the}} main factors that influence the drilling time. These factors are {{the depth of the}} bore-hole, power of the driving <b>motor</b> of the <b>winch,</b> mean speed of lowering and hoisting, speed of penetration, penetration per run and time of surface operations. One of the major characteristics which influences the drilling time is the mean travel speed. This paper presents the equations for calculation of the mean travels speed depending on the depth of drilling and other factors. The influence of the main factors on the total time is analyzed. The mean travels speed is a more significant factor than penetration per run. The influence {{of the power of the}} <b>winch</b> driving <b>motor</b> is similar to that of the mean travel speed. Determination of the optimal values of factors allow optimization of deep ice drilling accounting for the features of drilling...|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} at Strépy-Thieu {{consists of}} two independent counterweighted caissons which travel vertically between the upstream and downstream sections. Due to Archimedes' Principle, the caissons weigh the same whether they are laden with a boat or simply contain water. In practice, variations in the water level mean that the mass of each caisson varies between 7200 and 8400 tonnes. The caissons have useful dimensions of 112 m by 12 m and a water depth of between 3.35 and 4.15 m. Each caisson is supported by 112 suspension cables (for counterbalance) and 32 control cables (for lifting/lowering), each of 85 mm diameter. The mass of the counterbalance was calculated to keep the tension {{in each of the}} control cables below 100 kN at all times. The suspension cables pass over idler pulleys with a diameter of 4.8 m. Four electric <b>motors</b> power eight <b>winches</b> per caisson via speed-reduction gearboxes and the 73.15-metre lift is completed in seven minutes. The structure is massively reinforced to provide rigidity against torsional forces during operation and has a mass of approximately 200,000 tonnes. The vertically moving watertight gates are designed to withstand a 5 km/h impact from a 2000 tonne vessel.|$|R
5000|$|The Johnstown Inclined Plane was {{designed}} by Hungarian engineer Samuel Diescher, who had also designed the Duquesne, Castle Shannon and Fort Pitt Inclines in Pittsburgh. The funicular consists of a parallel set of [...] broad gauge railroad tracks with a 70.9 percent grade or an angle of 35 degrees and 28 minutes from the horizontal. The incline is 896.5 ft long and ascends 502.2 ft vertically {{to the top of}} Yoder Hill and the borough of Westmont, the station of which is at an elevation of 1693.5 ft above sea level. The rails are supported by 720 14 ft railroad ties made from Southern Yellow Pine. The incline is lit at night by 114 high-pressure sodium-vapor lamps mounted along the sides of tracks. There used to be a stairway between the two tracks with 966 steps, but these were removed circa 1963.Two cars traverse the slope; as one descends, the other ascends and acts as a counterweight. The cars are 15 ft wide, 15 ft tall, and 34 ft long, and are large enough to carry either 65 people, 6 motorcycles, or an automobile. While the cars are open to the elements, an enclosed seating area containing a bench is situated along the outer side of the incline. The cables connecting the cars are 2 in, 6&times;36 right regular lay, steel wire rope. They are wound around a 3 ST, 16 ft drum that connects the cars together. The cable on the north track is 1075 ft long, while the south cable is 7 ft shorter. Each car weighs 22 ST, but they, and consequently the cables, can carry an additional load of 15 ST. A [...] electric motor turns the drum, simultaneously winding and unwinding the cable, to power the incline.

40|$|The HIGHWIND {{project is}} {{investigating}} an exciting {{new type of}} wind power capable of harnessing higher altitude wind. It is based on tethered planes that fly at high velocity across the wind. During takeoff and landing, the kites are swung around in horizontal circles by a rotating arm (carousel), while being slowly reeled in or out by an electric winch. Since the winch is being used simultaneously for control as well as power generation, the electrical/mechanical system must be designed both for efficiency as well as speed and accuracy. A pair of masters students {{will be responsible for}} selecting, purchasing, installing, and testing the power electronics for the <b>motor</b> driving the <b>winch</b> that reels the kite in and out, the power electronics for the motor driving the carousel arm, as well as a petrol powered generator of sufficient capacity. Mechanical construction of the carousel is already underway. The carousel will be mounted on a trailer and testing will be conducted primarily outdoors.

40|$|In this paper, a 9 {{degree of}} freedom seaweed {{harvester}} dynamical model is presented. The model presented describes the coupled dynamics of a vessel and a harvesting device, lifted by a winch, subject to sea waves disturbances. In order to find an appropriate harvesting path, which minimizes the harvester motions, the model response is simulated for different encounter angles. This 9 DOF seaweed harvester model is defined by merging the unified ship model, given in Fossen [1], Perez [2], including the seakeeping fluid memory effects, and the Nielsen [3], Fard [4] 9 DOF shipcrane model, which includes an elastic coupling between the vessel and the harvester, and computes the harvester hydrodynamics, as in [5]. For the ship-harvester elastic coupling, a linear stiffness matrix, based on Shashikala et al [6], has been computed. The model obtained also includes {{the effects of the}} vessel forward speed, the wave and current loads, the ship propellers and motion control forces, and the <b>winch</b> <b>motor</b> dynamics. The motor dynamic is based on the control-oriented models of Messineo et al [7]. A mathematical formulation is first presented, and its assumptions are discussed. Then, a model simulation, obtained by modifying the Fossen et al [8] Simulink MSS Toolbox, and its results, are discussed. The harvester position variance and the RMSE index are compared, for the simulation results of different harvesting paths, and a compromise solution is discussed...|$|R
40|$|On January 6, 2016 at El Paso, the Guppy <b>winch</b> <b>motor</b> was changed. After {{completion}} of the operational checks, the load bar was being reinstalled on the cargo pallet when the motor control FORWARD relay failed in the energized position. The pallet was pinned at all locations (each pin has a load capacity of 16, 000 lbs.) while the winch was running. The wire rope snapped before aircraft power could be removed. After disassembly, the fractured wire rope was shipped to ES 4 lab for further characterization of the wire rope portion of the failure. The system was being operated without {{a clear understanding of}} the system capability and function. The proximate cause was the failure of the K 48 -Forward Winch Control Relay in the energized position, which allowed the motor to continuously run without command from the hand controller, and operation of the winch system with both controllers connected to the system. This prevented the emergency stop feature on the hand controller from functioning as designed. An electrical checkout engineering work instruction was completed and identified the failed relay and confirmed the emergency stop only paused the system when the STOP button on both connected hand controllers were depressed simultaneously. The winch system incorporates a torque limiting clutch. It is suspected that the clutch did not slip and the motor did not stall or overload the current limiter. Aircraft Engineering is looking at how to change the procedures to provide a checkout of the clutch and set to a slip torque limit appropriate to support operations...|$|R
40|$|Overhead {{tasks such}} as those {{frequently}} found in aircraft manufacturing pose health risks to the workers due to the strain imposed on the shoulders. To {{reduce the risk of}} injury, a set of supernumerary robotic limbs (SRL) were designed to perform these overhead tasks. The SRL is designed with limits in the hardware and software to protect the human and prevent collisions between robot and operator. The arms are designed to have a workspace above and in front of the head of the user free from singular configurations so the robot is free to operate where the tasks will be performed. To further protect the human, the mount that attaches the SRL to the shoulders was redesigned to be lighter and to better distribute the load. In this manner, the shoulders will become less fatigued from the static load of carrying the SRL To complete the task of positioning cables and routing them through the ceiling of an airplane, a winch end effector was designed to latch onto the fuselage arches and pull the cable through these arches. In order to control the SRL, the concept of principal components analysis was used to reduce the input space. This concept was specifically used to map the motion of the operator's hands onto the appropriate speed for the <b>winch</b> <b>motor</b> to operate. In this manner, the winch would pull the cable at the same rate that the human fed the cable. The human would then be able to control the speed of the winch simply by executing the task at whatever pace they so desired. by Jay McKenna. Thesis: S.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of ice core drilling is {{to obtain the}} highest quality core while minimizing the effort needed. This requires a control system with precision control and convenient operation. An intermediate-depth portable ice core drilling system designed and constructed at the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) has been tested during four expeditions under different working conditions. Several design options were tested to both control and monitor performance of the winch, thermal and electro-mechanic drills. An attempt {{has been made to}} develop a universal controller that can be used with either thermal or electro-mechanical drills and with various power sources, ranging from a conventional alternating current (AC) portable generator, custom high voltage direct current (DC) generator or an array of solar panels. Currently, controller system built in two configurations : (1) to operate a 500 m winch, dry hole electro-mechanical (EM) drill and fluid electro-thermal (ET) drill at low (1 kW) power, and (2) to operate a 500 m winch, EM and ET drills at high power (400 Vdc and 6. 0 kW). To allow the use of different power sources and different drills a modular design was chosen. The control system includes three modules : (1) for measuring and indicating drill depth, drill rate, and cable tension, (2) for driving reversible <b>winch</b> and drill <b>motors</b> at the same time (225 Vdc, 2. 25 kW), and (3) for driving a high power (400 Vdc, 20 kW) drill or <b>winch</b> <b>motor.</b> The controllers are built around industrial servo-amplifiers (SA) for DC brush motors and have over-voltage and over-current protection. This design permits convenient positioning of each module on the winch frame. This paper describes the details of the design and functional options of an ice drill control system...|$|R
5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic Chain Jacks and Stud Link Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous <b>motors</b> powering the <b>winches.</b> These <b>motors</b> cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|R
40|$|The US Coast Guard {{approached}} NIOSH {{about an}} increase in the number of winch entanglement injuries being reported among commercial shrimp fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. In August of 2012, a 15 year-old boy, fishing on a shrimp boat, died when his clothing became caught in an operating deck winch. This fatality received widespread coverage within the industry and further highlighted the need for action. Using the NIOSH Commercial Fishing Incident Database (CFID), researchers at the Alaska Pacific Office began studying the incidence of shrimp winch entanglements and found a total of 35 severe work-related injuries, including eight fatal injuries, caused by deck winches reported in the Southern shrimp fleet from 2000 - 2011. NIOSH has developed a prototype system that will allow a victim of a try-net winch entanglement to shut off electrical power via a bumper switch. Bumper switches mounted to the winch frame provide an alternate method to turn off the electric winch. The prototype auxiliary-stop circuit is not an emergency-stop device that will arrest the momentum of the drum, but an alternate device to de-energize the <b>winch</b> <b>motor.</b> NIOSH believes that the auxiliary-stop circuit control is a feasible and cost-effective interim safety measure until a more comprehensive retrofit that will immediately stop the drum can be implemented. NIOSH formed partnerships with boat owners from various cultural groups to collaborate with the auxiliary-stop testing. Three prototype systems were installed on the F/V Daytin and Destin of Dulac, LA, the F/V Lucky CJ of Port Arthur, TX and the F/V Miss Opal of Brownsville, TX. Feedback from the fishermen will be used to refine the prototype design to make it robust enough to reliably withstand the harsh fishing environment. Researchers and industry collaborators will also strive to make the auxiliary-stop circuit compatible with most electrical systems used on side-trawl shrimping vessels fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Upon the successful completion of the field-testing, NIOSH will seek partners to promote this system to shrimp fishermen. Through collaborations and partnerships with shrimper associations and safety groups, the successfully tested auxiliary-stop design plans will be made available to shrimpers via various internet websites. NIOSH plans to release the information in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese to better reach the target audience. NIOSHTIC No 2004721...|$|R
