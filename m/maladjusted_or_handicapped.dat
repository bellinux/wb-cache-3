40|$|Aim	To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} having a chronically ill <b>or</b> <b>handicapped</b> sibling and adolescents’ emotional and conduct problems. Method	Data were derived from the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) 2013 survey. A study of adolescents aged from 11 to 16 years old. Both an adolescent survey and a survey answered by the parents were linked. A total of 2421 adolescents having at least one sibling participated in the study. A number of 103 adolescents had a sibling with a chronic illness <b>or</b> <b>handicap.</b> Problem behavior is measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results	Results showed having a chronically ill <b>or</b> <b>handicapped</b> sibling is related to having both emotional and conduct problems. When looking at the problem behavior separately, having a chronically ill <b>or</b> <b>handicapped</b> sibling only appeared to be significant for emotional problems. Both the moderation effect of gender and the mediation effect of parental support appeared not to be significant. Conclusion	This study suggests having a chronically ill <b>or</b> <b>handicapped</b> sibling {{can be related to}} developing problem behavior. Therefore keeping an eye on these adolescents is recommended, so possible problem behavior can be prevented...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} {{the long term}} outcome of extremely preterm growth retarded infants in relation to obstetric management and various perinatal events. METHODS: A cohort study was undertaken in two tertiary care centres with different obstetric management. All infants with fetal growth retardation due to placental insufficiency and resulting in fetal distress at 26 to 32 weeks of gestation, were included for the years 1984 - 89. Main outcome measures were impairment, disability, <b>or</b> <b>handicap</b> at 2 years corrected age and at school age (4 1 / 2 to 10 1 / 2 years). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty five (98 %) were followed up until 2 years corrected age in the outpatient department; 114 (90 %) were assessed at school age. Impairments were found in 37 % and disabilities <b>or</b> <b>handicaps</b> in 9 % of the assessed infants, with no difference between centres. All disabled <b>or</b> <b>handicapped</b> children had already been identified by 2 years corrected age. CONCLUSIONS: Disability <b>or</b> <b>handicap</b> were related to neonatal complications (intracerebral haemorrhage or bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and not to obstetric variables, thus making antenatal prediction impossible. The incidence of disability <b>or</b> <b>handicap</b> in these growth retarded infants was comparable with that of other preterm infant...|$|R

50|$|Since Freud's {{presentation}} {{of the theory of}} psychosexual development in 1905, no evidence has confirmed that extended breast-feeding might lead to an oral-stage fixation, nor that it contributes to a person becoming <b>maladjusted</b> <b>or</b> to developing addictions (psychologic, physiologic). The pediatrician Jack Newman proposed that breast feeding a child until he or she chooses to wean (ca. 2-4 years of age) generally produces a more psychologically secure, and independent person. Contradicting the Freudian psychosexual development concept of oral-stage fixation, the Duration of Breast-feeding and the Incidence of Smoking (2003) study of 87 participants reported no causal relation between the breast-feeding period and whether or not a child matures into a person who smokes.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the optimum {{mode of delivery}} of the early preterm fetus in breech presentation. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of two cohorts of preterm breech fetus. SETTING: Two tertiary care centres: at one centre the preferred management for preterm breech presentation was vaginal delivery; at the other centre, the preferred method was caesarean section. POPULATION: All singleton infants delivered after breech presentation from 1984 through 1989, at a gestational age of 26 to 31 weeks. Those with lethal congenital abnormalities, placenta praevia, placental abruption, fetal death or fetal distress {{before the onset of}} labour were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival without disability <b>or</b> <b>handicap</b> documented at two years corrected age. The influence of a number of relevant variables on this outcome was assessed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: There was no difference in survival without disability <b>or</b> <b>handicap</b> between the centres (odds ratio 1. 5, 95 % CI 0. 6 - 3. 9 vaginal delivery compared with caesarean section). Survival without disability <b>or</b> <b>handicap</b> was positively influenced by increasing birthweight and corticosteroids > 24 h before birth, and negatively influenced by footling presentation. CONCLUSION: A policy of caesarean section for early preterm (26 - 31 weeks) breech delivery is not associated with increased survival without disability or handica...|$|R
