40|$|This note {{compares the}} effect of an MBS-Treasury swap (a {{strategy}} of purchasing long-maturity agency MBS and selling long-maturity <b>Treasury</b> <b>bonds)</b> versus the <b>Treasury</b> twist (purchasing long-maturity <b>Treasury</b> <b>bonds</b> and selling short-maturity ones). We make two main points: 1. Purchasing long MBS brings down long MBS yields by more than would an equal sized purchase of long <b>Treasury</b> <b>bonds</b> and thus is likely to create a larger stimulus to economic activity via a larger reduction in homeowner borrowing costs 2. Purchasing <b>Treasury</b> <b>bonds</b> brings down <b>Treasury</b> yields, but this decrease indicates a welfare cost rather than a benefit to the economy. Thus {{it would be better}} to sell rather than purchase long-term <b>Treasury</b> <b>bonds.</b> These points lead us to conclude that a superior large-scale asset purchase policy for the Fed is an MBS-Treasury swap where the Fed purchases long-maturity MBS, financed by a sale of longmaturity <b>Treasury</b> <b>bonds.</b> MBS rates fall more when the Fed purchases MBS than when it purchases Treasurie...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{establishes}} within-market and cross-market {{information content}} of order flow for stocks, corporate <b>bonds</b> and <b>Treasury</b> <b>bonds</b> in China. With tick-by-tick data {{over three years}} on the Shanghai Security Exchange market, we show significant information content of order flow and its relationship with time-varying market conditions. Bi-directionally negative cross-market effects of order flow on returns both between stocks and bonds and between corporate and <b>Treasury</b> <b>bonds</b> are observed after the commonality and lead-lag relationship of the three markets are controlled. Our results provide evidence that cross-market portfolio rebalancing or flight produces cross-market effect of order flow.

The data used in this research are between Jan 1, 1959 to Nov, 2008. There are 8 recessions during this period, including current one. We conducted two sets of tests. The first set consists of spread between 10 -year <b>Treasury</b> <b>bond</b> and 3 -month Treasury bill and spread between 10 -year <b>Treasury</b> <b>bond</b> and 3 -month LIBOR; and we find the predictive power of spread between 10 -year <b>Treasury</b> <b>bond</b> and 3 -month Treasury bill is much stronger than the other one.

For the second test, we find that although there is a couple of recession involved and data is relatively limited, predictive power of spread between 10 -year T-bond and 3 month still stands out and we also find the spread between 3 -month LIBOR and 10 -year SWAP could be a better indicator in the future by using more data.
