Some producers make a (lesser) second or third wine that they also mark cru classé de Provence. Also, no geographic limitation is implied, so as the producers buy and sell new plots of land, sometimes far from the original winery, the wines from those vineyards become cru classé. In addition, the list cannot be changed, no new wineries can be added and a winery cannot lose the cru classé status.

25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E

40|$|As {{analysis}} of Kant’s account of virtue in the Lectures on Ethics shows that Kant thinks of virtue {{as a form}} of moral self-mastery or self-command that represents a model of self-governance he compares to an autocracy. In {{light of the fact that}} the very concept of virtue presupposes struggle and conflict, Kant insists that virtue is distinct from holiness and that any ideal of moral perfection that overlooks the fact that morality is always difficult for us fails to provide an appropriate model of human virtue. No <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> morally <b>good</b> we are or become, virtue remains a disposition to do one’s duty from duty, out of necessitation by practical reason. Yet, even though finite rational beings require a power of self-constraint in accordance with the commands of duty to comply with the law (which we obey reluctantly), the virtuous agent displays a unified soul that is at peace. This picture of virtue uncovered from the Lectures on Ethics thus reveals the way in which Kant’s conception of virtue accords with his foundational commitments in his moral theory, while at the same time representing a more complex theory of moral character and a life lived in accordance with practical reason...|$|R

40|$|Gourna, a vernacular {{village in}} Upper Egypt, was built over a Pharonic {{heritage}} site. During the 1940 s, {{and in order}} to protect the monuments from theft, the Egyptian government commissioned the renowned Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy to design a new settlement for the Gournii. Despite the great effort exerted by Fathy to design The New Gourna in an environmentally and socially responsive manner, the project had consider-ably failed as most of the residents refused to move to the new village. Recently, the government repeated the attempt but this time the second version of the New Gourna came significantly different. In order to force them to move, the government demolished most of the houses of the residents of Gourna and left only a few houses to be re-used as museums for the vernacular architecture of the village. The main objective of the paper is to investigate if the second version of the New Gourna is going to overcome the sustainability problems associated with Fathy’s New Gourna and if it is going to deal successfully with the sustainable vernacular architecture of the region.

The S-embedding maps leaves of G one-to-one to good leaves of H; it may be many-to-one on internal nodes. We measure the quality of an S-embedding by its harvest, the fraction H of good leaves of H that are images of leaves of G, and its congestion, {{the largest number of}} edges of G that get “routed ” across the same edge of H. We consider three scenarios for an N-leaf tree H. In the worst-case scenario: if the fraction G of H’s leaves are labeled good, then one can S-embed an HGN-leaf G in H with congestion log log N+ a constant depending only on G and H, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> the <b>good</b> leaves are distributed; this congestion cannot be lowered by more than a small constant factor. In the expected-case scenario, where leaves of H are labeled good or not, independently, with fixed probability: with probability exceeding 1 − N −Ω(1), for any 0 < H ≤ 1 / 8, one can S-embed an HN-leaf G in H with congestion O(log log log N); we do not know if this congestion can be lowered. In the salvaging scenario: we present an algorithm that, in time O(N(log N) 3 C+ 2), S-embeds in a given a leaf-labeled H the largest possible G, subject to the prespecified bound C on congestion.
