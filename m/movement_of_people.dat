5|$|As London {{extended}} east, East Enders often {{moved to}} {{opportunities in the}} new suburbs. The late 19th century saw a very major <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to West Ham and East Ham to service the new docks and industries established there.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> from China into Maritime Southeast Asia was {{the arrival of}} Mongol forces under Kublai Khan that culminated in the invasion of Java in 1293. Their intervention hastened {{the decline of the}} classical kingdoms such as Singhasari and precipitated the rise of the Majapahit empire.|$|E
5|$|The <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and {{information}} largely characterizes the inter-world {{relationships in the}} present day. A majority of breakthroughs and innovation originate in Western Europe and the U.S. and later their effects permeate globally. As judged by the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, most of the Top 30 Innovations of the Last 30 Years were from former First World countries (e.g., the U.S. and countries in Western Europe).|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E
30|$|As {{described}} in the Introduction, in order to study the connectivity and stability of organizational evolution, the population of organizations in Stockholm is modeled as a labor flow network where nodes are organizations and links are <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> between organizations. In this network, connections between organizations take place through <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> either directly through a movement a given year, or indirectly through a sequence <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> that goes through several organizations, which is called a directed path.|$|R

5|$|Trade routes {{not only}} {{supplied}} physical goods, they facilitated the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and ideas throughout Mesoamerica. Shifts in trade routes occurred {{with the rise}} and fall of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse. Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period Manche Ch'ol traded the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's {{population}} recovered {{quickly after}} the war, as {{a wave of}} skilled migrants from the Republic of China moved in to seek refuge from the Chinese Civil War. When the Communist Party eventually took full control of mainland China in 1949, even more skilled migrants fled across the open border for fear of persecution. Many newcomers, especially {{those who had been}} based in the major port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, established corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses and shifted their base operations to British Hong Kong. The establishment of a socialist state in China (People's Republic of China) on 1 October 1949 caused the British colonial government to reconsider Hong Kong's open border to mainland China. In 1951, a boundary zone was demarked as a buffer zone against potential military attacks from communist China. Border posts along the north of Hong Kong began operation in 1953 to regulate the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and goods {{into and out of the}} territory.|$|E

50|$|Regionally, the German-speaking {{majority}} of Switzerland {{is the most}} Eurosceptic, while the French-speaking Switzerland {{tends to be more}} pro-EU. However, in the 2001 referendum, the {{majority of}} French-speakers voted against EU membership. According to a 2016 survey conducted by M.I.S Trend and published in L'Hebdo, 69 percent of the Swiss population supports systematic border controls, and 53 percent want restrictions on the EU accord <b>of</b> the free <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>peoples</b> and 14 percent want it completely abolished. However, 54% of the Swiss population said that if necessary, they would ultimately keep the freedom <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>people's</b> accord.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the centuries}} {{since the first}} emigrations, there have been {{continued}} links and <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> {{up to and including}} the Second World War, when small numbers <b>of</b> Breton <b>people</b> escaped German-occupied Brittany to live in Cornwall.|$|R
25|$|The Crusades, 1095–1270, {{which were}} {{intended}} to wrest the Holy Places of Palestine from Islamic control, resulted {{in the building of}} castles in Syria and Palestine. The Crusades brought about a very large <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and, with them, ideas and trade skills, particularly those involved in the building of fortifications and the metal working needed for the provision of arms, which was also applied to the fitting and decoration of buildings. The continual <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> rulers, nobles, bishops, abbots, craftsmen and peasants, was an important factor in creating a homogeneity in building methods and a recognizable Romanesque style, despite regional differences.|$|E

50|$|According to {{more recent}} {{researchers}} {{there seem to}} have actually been two <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> (<b>of</b> all ages) in 1212 in Germany and France. The similarities of the two allowed later chroniclers to combine and embellish the tales.|$|R
