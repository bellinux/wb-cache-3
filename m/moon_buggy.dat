5|$|Filming {{began on}} 5 April 1971 with the desert near Las Vegas {{doubling}} for the South African scenes, followed by filming in the Great Basin Desert, Nevada in May for scenes in which Bond drives a <b>moon</b> <b>buggy.</b> On 7 June production moved to Pinewood Studios for filming at sets of the returning Ken Adams; his sets spread through four of Pinewood's stages. Filming also {{took place in}} London, Dover, Southampton, Amsterdam and the south of France; principal photography finished 13 August 1971.|$|E
5|$|The site {{used for}} the Willard Whyte Space Labs (where Bond gets away in the <b>Moon</b> <b>Buggy)</b> was actually, at that time, a Johns-Manville gypsum plant located just outside Las Vegas. The home of Kirk Douglas was {{used for the}} scene in Tiffany's house, while the Elrod House in Palm Springs, {{designed}} by John Lautner, became Willard Whyte's house. The exterior shots of the Slumber mortuary were of the Palm Mortuary in Henderson, Nevada. The interiors were a set constructed at Pinewood Studios, where Ken Adam imitated the real building's lozenge-shaped stained glass window in its nave. During location filming, Adam visited several funeral homes in the Las Vegas area, the inspiration behind the gaudy design of the Slumber mortuary (the use of tasteless Art Nouveau furniture and Tiffany lamps) came from these experiences. Production wrapped with the crematorium sequence, on 13 August 1971.|$|E
5|$|Tiffany reneges on her deal to meet {{back with}} Bond and instead flees, passing off the {{diamonds}} {{to the next}} smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds: a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. Bond fakes Metz by telling him he is Klaus Hergersheimer, a technician he met in the facility. His cover is blown when the real Hergersheimer shows up. Bond attempts to remain hidden, but is seen by a technician. He manages to evade the security guards by stealing a <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> and reunites with Tiffany. The laboratory report Bond's activity to the sheriff's office. Bond and Tiffany make {{their way back to}} Las Vegas; they are seen there by the Las Vegas police, who engage in a car chase, but Bond manages to evade all the cars.|$|E
50|$|In the series, <b>Moon</b> <b>Buggies</b> {{are driven}} with two handles, each {{controlling}} {{one side of}} the vehicle. Hence, similar to the manner in which tanks are steered, manoeuvres are accomplished by pushing one stick forwards and pulling the other backwards. They are normally driven by two people, although single driver operation is equally possible. Buggies may be deployed from airlocks or the cargo holds of Eagle Transporters, permitting use on Earth-type planets. The dashboard normally houses only an ignition switch, but some Buggies are fitted with additional controls, including airlock switches. The rear section carries specialised mission equipment.|$|R
50|$|Morning finds Bergman {{and party}} searching {{the forest for}} Sandra and the others. As they {{approach}} the mystery ravine, Carter grabs the <b>moon</b> <b>buggy's</b> control stick from Kano and swerves just before they enter the wall of mist. He reckons it must {{be involved in the}} disappearances. Everyone has passed this way, entered the mist and vanished. They opt to go around; on the other side, they come across the cave and hear a moaning dirge. The cave chief stands swaying before a shallow grave, half-dead and covered with gore, as his mate prepares him for burial.|$|R
500|$|Since the car chase in Las Vegas {{would have}} many car crashes, the filmmakers had an {{arrangement}} with Ford {{to use their}} vehicles. Ford's only demand was that Sean Connery had to drive the 1971 Mustang Mach 1 which serves as Tiffany Case's car. The <b>Moon</b> <b>Buggy</b> {{was inspired by the}} actual NASA vehicle, but with additions such as flailing arms since the producers didn't find the design [...] "outrageous" [...] enough. Built by custom car fabricator Dean Jeffries on a rear-engined Corvair chassis, it was capable of road speeds. The fibreglass [...] tires had to be replaced during the chase sequence because the heat and irregular desert soil ruined them.|$|E
500|$|Reviews were mixed, and {{the camp}} tone had a mostly {{negative}} reaction. The film currently has a 67% [...] "fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Connery was applauded by Kevin A. Ranson of MovieCrypt and Michael A. Smith of Nolan's Pop Culture. Critic Roger Ebert noted, {{in a positive}} review, the irrelevance of the plot and [...] "moments of silliness", such as Bond finding himself driving a <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> with antennae revolving and robot arms flapping. He praised the Las Vegas car chase scene, particularly the segment when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels. Twenty-five years after its release, James Berardinelli criticised {{the concept of a}} laser-shooting satellite and the performances of Jill St. John, Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean. Christopher Null called St. John [...] "one of the least effective Bond girls – beautiful, but shrill and helpless". Steve Rhodes said, [...] "looking and acting like a couple of pseudo-country bumpkins, they (Putter Smith and Bruce Glover) seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie." [...] But he also extolled the car chase as [...] "classic". According to Danny Peary, Diamonds are Forever is [...] "one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series" [...] and that [...] "until Blofeld's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle we associate with James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn't exotic enough, there's little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you'd find on The Avengers, but not nearly as amusing – and the trouble Bond gets into, even Maxwell Smart could escape." [...] IGN chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only The Man with the Golden Gun and Die Another Day. Total Film listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively). The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of the Guardian, who said it was [...] "oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world." ...|$|E

He will, but only on the condition she stop firing. She declines, suggesting that the Alphans might survive if she can destroy the remaining Deltan missile bases. Koenig cryptically comments that, if this is her final decision, she only has herself to blame. She then realises the <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> is a trap. As the vehicle rolls beneath the ship (and out of the sight-line of the guns), the driver's helmet falls off...revealing the spacesuit is empty.

She guesses they are deriving sustenance from the cumulative minute emissions of radiation from all the electrical equipment on Alpha. Koenig orders all non-essential systems powered down. When they sight the <b>moon</b> <b>buggy,</b> Koenig is lowered down by a harness (as the surface terrain is too unstable to support the Eagle) to intercept them. Believing they are driving through the country with two luscious girls, Carter and Ehrlich see Koenig as a ski-mask-clad maniac. They assault him, disconnecting the tube from his oxygen tank.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Moon</b> <b>Buggy</b> is {{a fictional}} vehicle {{that appears in}} the 1970s British science-fiction {{television}} series Space: 1999. It is Moonbase Alpha's all-purpose land vehicle. Capable of operating in both atmosphere and vacuum, it is used for long-distance travel, and travel to locations that are inaccessible to the Eagle Transporter spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{full-size}} <b>Moon</b> <b>Buggy</b> filming {{vehicle was}} a modified amphibious vehicle called the Amphicat, {{which is also}} featured in the children's TV series Banana Splits. A number of scale models, complete with miniature astronauts, were also used by the Space: 1999 special effects unit; they included motorised and remote-controlled versions.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian {{version of}} the Amphicat was {{featured}} as the <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> used by Moonbase Alpha personnel in the television series Space: 1999 and the US version as the Banana Splits' cars in the TV show Banana Splits. It also appeared in the TV series Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp and in an episode of Blakes 7.|$|E
5000|$|The show's vehicles, {{including}} the Eagle space shuttle and the <b>Moon</b> <b>Buggy,</b> were represented {{with a mixture}} of full-sized props, photographic blow-ups, and detailed scale models. Dozens of models for the various alien spaceships and the Mark IX Hawk from the [...] "War Games" [...] episode were built by model maker Martin Bower, often at several different sizes to account for the intended use.|$|E

The player controls a <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> that travels over the moon's surface, viewing it from the side as it moves towards {{the right side of the}} screen. While driving it, obstacles such as craters and mines must be avoided, and various enemies such as UFOs from above and tanks on the ground must be shot down.|$|E
50|$|He began custom {{fabrication}} in the 1960s {{and built}} the Mantaray (from Bikini Beach; 1963), Black Beauty (from the The Green Hornet), the Monkeemobile, the Landmaster from Damnation Alley; (1977), the <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> (that James Bond steals in Diamonds Are Forever), the trolley (from Who Framed Roger Rabbit). Jeffries is also an expert on dune buggies, produced his own models, and has contributed to books about them. He did all of the custom fabrication work on the movie Convoy in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he rented the shop from Burns Truck & Parts.|$|E
50|$|Maya {{comes to}} his rescue {{in the form of}} a space animal which can exist in a vacuum. In the mêlée, Ehrlich's {{spacesuit}} is breached and he must be taken to Moonbase for medical attention. Carter takes off in the <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> and Koenig pursues on foot. Carter arrives at the monitoring depot and welds the airlock door shut. He and Bartlett then proceed through the dome's interior to the core access hatch. Not having the security codes to open the massive lead hatch, they use the thermal lance to cut into its locking mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Kano complies, and Ferro relays the {{sequence}} to his waiting accomplice. After stunning the sentries, Anna uses the code to gain {{entry to the}} food stores. Kano shoves Ferro off him and sounds the red-alert klaxon. Making his way to an exit, Ferro encounters Helena and takes her hostage. Bargaining with the doctor's life, Ferro demands an Eagle, a <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> and provisions sufficient for three years time. Obsessed {{with the need to}} 'return life to its place of origin', Ferro and Anna reject all appeals to reason.|$|E
50|$|When Koenig recovers, he and Maya quickly seal off and depressurise Alpha, {{then proceed}} to the {{disposal}} site in Eagle Two. Older and located some distance from Disposal Areas One and Two, it {{was not involved in}} the cataclysmic explosion of 1999. Six concrete-capped shafts store atomic waste ten thousand feet below the surface. One will be blasted open, then an atomic trigger-device introduced and remote-detonated to start the chain reaction. From above, Verdeschi's Eagle Three spots a <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> parked amid the surrounding hills; Sanderson has driven from Alpha and is waiting for them.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1971 James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever, a brief scene {{depicts the}} action {{taking place in}} a Moon setting where astronauts are being trained. Agent 007 steals {{what appears to be}} a <b>Moon</b> <b>buggy</b> from the model set, and drives it off to escape from an enemy compound. This scene may have helped to spread the idea of the Moon {{landings}} being a hoax. However, model sets like the one in the film had been used prior to the moon landing in order to simulate conditions.|$|E
50|$|Eagle One {{sets down}} at the first expedition's landing site, a {{clearing}} in a sub-tropical forest. As Carter begins the aerial search, he notes a few pockets of mist through breaks in the forest canopy, but no sign of people—Alphan or otherwise. While the support team reconnoitres the immediate area, Koenig and Helena drive off in a <b>moon</b> <b>buggy,</b> following a series of trail-markers left by the reconnaissance party. Entering the forest, they leave the vehicle and continue on foot. At a swampy watering hole, they are brought up short by the tracks of a gigantic animal.|$|E
50|$|Outside, Koenig arrives, {{makes his}} way through a throng of jelloids, and discovers the sealed door. Using the <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> as a {{battering}} ram, he drives into the door repeatedly and breaks the weld. He wonders how the aliens are still active. Maya surmises that, as the functioning human brain produces electrical energy, they must be drawing on these emissions to keep going at survival level. To reduce this energy source, Koenig orders Helena to render the entire staff unconscious, excluding herself and the chief engineer. Donning a gas mask, the doctor releases anaesthetic gas into the ventilation system.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, Sandra awakens to find Carter gone. Having {{left early}} to scout the area, the {{astronaut}} has reached Koenig's <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> {{by the time}} a concerned Sandra calls. He jokes that all her fussing will make her boyfriend Paul Morrow jealous. Signing off, he follows the markers, but veers from the designated trail to take a short-cut through tall grass—and falls head-first into a camouflaged pit. When Sandra tries to call again, she receives no answer. Nervous, she contacts Alpha. Morrow consoles her with the news that Bergman is flying down to lead a new search mission.|$|E
50|$|Koenig grants {{permission}} to land—away from Moonbase Alpha. The voice acknowledges, but the mammoth craft approaches anyway, {{coming to a}} halt on a bluff overlooking the base. The stranger announces its wish to receive a special delegation, asking for Koenig, Bergman and Helena Russell by name. Realising they have little choice, the trio drives over to the ship in a <b>moon</b> <b>buggy.</b> They board and a lift conveys them to the control centre. The chamber is built on an enormous scale, its complex mechanisms indistinguishable from works of art. After the doors slam shut behind them, the three are examined by a probing beam of light.|$|E

50|$|They {{make their}} way to Command Centre, evading the Security forces bent on killing them, and play the white noise recording. It works as expected, and pandemonium erupts when the staff sees the true {{identity}} of their friends and loved ones. Amid the chaos, the aliens suddenly vanish. Koenig knows this is no victory and calls up a picture of the atomic fuel store, where Carter and Ehrlich have cut through the door's lock with a thermal lance. Still under alien control, the two men proceed by <b>moon</b> <b>buggy</b> to the waste domes with the fuel core. Koenig takes Maya and Verdeschi with him in Eagle Five to stop them. Meanwhile, at the waste-dome monitoring depot, Bartlett primes the domes for detonation.|$|E
