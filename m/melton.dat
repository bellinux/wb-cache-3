5|$|In 1348, William de <b>Melton</b> {{obtained}} King Edward III's {{permission to}} give his manor to William Edendon, Bishop of Winchester. The ownership of the manor of Bentworth was then passed by marriage to the Windsor family, who had been constables of Windsor Castle. The Bentworth Hall estate was evidently returned to the <b>Melton</b> family, because it is mentioned among their possessions in a document dated to 1362. It then passed to William's similar-named son, Sir William de <b>Melton.</b> Sir William's son, John de <b>Melton,</b> who inherited the house in 1399, was recorded as owner of the manor of Bentworth in 1431. He died in 1455, and was succeeded by his son until the latter's death in 1474, then finally his grandson John <b>Melton.</b> After {{the death of the}} last, the manor of Bentworth remained in the possession of the Windsor family for at least 150 years.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas <b>Melton,</b> an expert on embryonic stem cell biology, although <b>Melton</b> vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended his position on {{embryonic stem cell research}} itself.|$|E
5|$|After St. Gatien's {{defeat in}} the Cambridgeshire, Hammond responded to the earlier {{challenge}} of Lord Hastings by suggesting a level-weight match race between St. Gatien and <b>Melton</b> {{at some point in}} the following season for a stake of between £5,000 and £20,000.|$|E

5|$|In autumn Lord Hastings, {{the owner}} of the 1885 Derby winner <b>Melton</b> issued a {{challenge}} to Jack Hammond for a £1,000 match race between his horse and St. Gatien, with <b>Melton</b> to receive nine pounds. The challenge was declined, as St. Gatien had already been heavily backed for the Cambridgeshire Handicap, a race in which he had been assigned 136 pounds and Hammond did not want to disrupt the horse's preparation. St. Gatien returned to the racecourse after a break of four months in Her Majesty's Plate over two miles at Newmarket on October 12. The race proved meaningless as a contest, his only opponent being a three-year-old filly called Jane who had finished runner-up in the 1000 Guineas. St. Gatien started at odds of 1/33 and won with predictable ease by twenty lengths.|$|E

5|$|In 2005 {{the group}} moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM1380 WLRM, and {{switched}} to a nightly schedule, Monday through Friday. Farley left the program in November of that year. Two years later, Geoff <b>Melton,</b> a former co-host, joined to help set up the show's website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network.

5|$|Kennedy {{signed with}} Mick Docherty's Hartlepool United of the Fourth Division in November 1983.

5|$|Organized {{racing in}} Italy started in 1837, when race meets were {{established}} in Florence and Naples and a meet in Milan was founded in 1842. Modern flat racing came to Rome in 1868.

Jagannadh wanted to cast Ayesha Takia as the female lead. Due to a last minute change, the makers opted to replace Takia and considered several actresses including Deepika Padukone. Jagannadh approached Parvati <b>Melton</b> to play the female lead. She declined the offer because, at that time, her parents were against her decision to become an actress. He also approached Kangana Ranaut who could not accept the role because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of her scenes in Gangster (2006). After seeing stills of Ileana D'Cruz in her Telugu debut Devadasu (2006), Jagannadh signed her as the female lead since he needed a girl who looked like a teenager {{to play the role}} of the aerobics teacher.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{interest}} in the 1886 season concerned the newly inaugurated Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, which offered a then record prize of £10,000.

5|$|Later in the 1960s {{and into}} the 1970s, locally {{prominent}} bands gradually changed from primarily cover bands to more well rounded groups, while the city's musical opportunities grew with the foundation of venues and institutions. This period {{has been called the}} Normaltown River of Music, and included long-time local performers like Mad Dog <b>Melton</b> as well as Brian Burke, Davis Causey and Randall Bramblett, many of whom later worked with Gregg Allman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The most influential local bands to emerge from this period included the Normaltown Flyers, and Dixie Grease. The oldest bar featuring live music in Athens is Allen's Hamburgers where the Normaltown Flyers were the house band for many years. Allen's opened in 1955 on Prince Avenue, closed for a brief time, and has since reopened on Hawthorne Ave. as part of a restoration project. Bars like The Last Resort (currently the Last Resort Grille restaurant) opened in the 1960s, beginning the local club scene just as some bands were beginning to gain some regional fame for Athens.|$|E

Texas won the 2005game 62–0 making it the only shutout of the 2005season for the Longhorns.|$|E
5|$|Vic Lombardi {{replaced}} Behrman {{in the top}} of the sixth. He allowed {{just one}} hit to Dickson, keeping the score 5–1 when Brooklyn came up to bat.
