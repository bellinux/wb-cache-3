5|$|Saturn's {{interior}} is probably {{composed of a}} core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core {{is surrounded by a}} deep layer of <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach , higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{is thought}} to consist of a dense core {{with a mixture of}} elements, a {{surrounding}} layer of liquid <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of molecular hydrogen. Beyond this basic outline, there is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as rocky, but its detailed composition is unknown, as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below). In 1997, the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements, indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times that of Earth, or roughly 4%–14% of the total mass of Jupiter. The presence of a core during at least part of Jupiter's history is suggested by models of planetary formation that require the formation of a rocky or icy core massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the protosolar nebula. Assuming it did exist, it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior. A core may now be entirely absent, as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely.|$|E
5|$|The {{core region}} may be {{surrounded}} by dense <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet. Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere. Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Jupiter, {{as well as on}} Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 Eremets and Troyan {{reported}} {{observing the}} liquid <b>metallic</b> state of <b>hydrogen</b> and deuterium at static pressures of [...] This claim was questioned by other researchers in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} reacts violently with water, yielding caesium hydroxide, <b>metallic</b> gold, and <b>hydrogen</b> gas; {{in liquid}} ammonia {{it can be}} reacted with a caesium-specific ion exchange resin to produce tetramethylammonium auride.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{proposals}} {{to use the}} compound formed by the chemical reaction of <b>metallic</b> uranium and <b>hydrogen</b> (uranium hydride—UH3) as a combination fuel and moderator in {{a new type of}} reactor.|$|R
5|$|Above {{the layer}} of <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> lies a {{transparent}} interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ionisation}} {{energy of}} hydrogen (1312.0 kJ/mol) {{is much higher}} than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion, and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis. (The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as alkalides, but these are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) An argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic, unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens. The radius of the H− anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens: indeed, H− is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons. It was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties; while this has been shown to not be the case, under extremely high pressures, such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> The electrical resistivity of liquid <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> at 3000 K is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 K at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal-to-metal transition.|$|E
5|$|Standard {{planetary}} models {{suggest that}} the interior of Saturn {{is similar to that}} of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles. This core is similar in composition to the Earth, but more dense. Examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of the Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000km. This is surrounded by a thicker liquid <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000km and consists of gas.|$|E

5000|$|Stannane [...] or {{tin hydride}} is an {{inorganic}} compound with the chemical formula [...] It is a colourless gas and the tin analogue of methane. Stannane {{can be prepared}} by the reaction of SnCl4 and LiAlH4. Stannane decomposes slowly at room temperature to give <b>metallic</b> tin and <b>hydrogen</b> and ignites on contact with air.|$|R
30|$|Hydrogenolysis is a {{catalytic}} {{chemical reaction}} that breaks a chemical bond in an organic molecule with the simultaneous {{addition of a}} hydrogen atom to result in molecular fragments. Propylene glycol (1, 2 -propanediol (1, 2 -PD)) and 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD) could be obtained through the hydrogenolysis of glycerol {{in the presence of}} <b>metallic</b> catalysts and <b>hydrogen</b> [23],[36].|$|R
5|$|Every planet {{began its}} {{existence}} {{in an entirely}} fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts, but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel, and mantles of silicates. Jupiter and Saturn {{are believed to have}} cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water, ammonia, methane and other ices. The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter {{can be thought of as}} a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field is fourteen times {{as strong as}} that of Earth, ranging from 4.2gauss (0.42 mT) at the equator to 10–14 gauss (1.0–1.4 mT) at the poles, making it the strongest in the Solar System (except for sunspots). This field {{is thought to be}} generated by eddy currents—swirling movements of conducting materials—within the liquid <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> core. The volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide forming a gas torus along the moon's orbit. The gas is ionized in the magnetosphere producing sulfur and oxygen ions. They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a plasma sheet in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet causing deformation of the dipole {{magnetic field}} into that of magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature that produces bursts in the range of 0.6–30MHz.|$|E

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{properties of the}} superconducting state induced in <b>metallic</b> molecular <b>hydrogen</b> {{under the influence of}} pressure 347 GPa were determined. In particular, {{it has been shown that}} the critical temperature (T_C) changes in the range from 120 K to 90 K for μ^*∈, where μ^* is the value of the Coulomb pseudopotential. Next, the energy gap near the temperature of zero Kelvin (2 Δ(0)) was calculated. It has been stated, that the dimensionless ratio 2 Δ(0) /k_BT_C slightly decreases with the increase of μ^* from 3. 98 to 3. 84. In the last step, the ratio of effective electron mass (m^*_e) to the bare electron mass (m_e)) was determined. It has been proved that m^*_e/m_e takes its highest value equal to 1. 96 for T=T_C...|$|R
5|$|The bulk of Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, like Earth's, {{is generated}} by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten iron and nickel, Jupiter's is composed of <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south magnetic poles {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere. Jupiter's field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, it was {{reported}} that the sample of claimed <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> was lost, after the diamond anvils it was contained between broke.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> {{is a kind}} of {{degenerate}} matter, a {{phase of}} hydrogen in which it behaves like an electrical conductor. This phase was predicted in 1935 on theoretical grounds by Eugene Wigner and Hillard Bell Huntington.|$|E
50|$|A {{stoichiometric}} mixture of caesium and gold will {{react to form}} yellow caesium auride (Cs+Au−) upon heating. The auride anion here behaves as a pseudohalogen. The compound reacts violently with water, yielding caesium hydroxide, <b>metallic</b> gold, and <b>hydrogen</b> gas; in liquid ammonia it can be reacted with a caesium-specific ion exchange resin to produce tetramethylammonium auride. The analogous platinum compound, red caesium platinide (Cs2Pt), contains the platinide ion that behaves as a pseudochalcogen.|$|R
40|$|Silicon is {{produced}} in a NaF, Na 2 SiF 6, and Na matrix when SiF 4 is reduced by <b>metallic</b> sodium. <b>Hydrogen</b> is evolved during acid leaching to separate the silicon from the accompanying reaction products, NaF and Na 2 SiF 6. The hydrogen evolution reaction was studied under conditions simulating leaching conditions by making suspensions of the dry silicon powder in aqueous fluoride solutions. The mechanism for the hydrogen evolution is {{discussed in terms of}} spontaneous oxidation of silicon resulting from the cooperative effects of (1) elemental sodium in the silicon that reacts with water to remove a protective silica layer, leaving clean reactive silicon, and (2) fluoride in solution that complexes with the oxidized silicon in solution and retards formation of a protective hydrous oxide gel...|$|R

25|$|At high {{pressure}} and temperatures, <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> might {{exist as a}} liquid rather than a solid, and researchers think it is present in large quantities in the hot and gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some extrasolar planets.|$|E
25|$|On October 5, 2016, Ranga Dias and Isaac F.

50|$|An {{additional}} {{method of}} UN synthesis employs fabrication directly from metallic uranium. By exposing <b>metallic</b> uranium to <b>hydrogen</b> gas at temperatures {{in excess of}} 280 °C, UH3 can be formed. Furthermore, since UH3 has a lower specific volume than the metallic phase, hydridation {{can be used to}} physically decompose otherwise solid uranium. Following hydridation, UH3 can be exposed to a nitrogen atmosphere at temperatures around 500 °C, thereby forming U2N3. By additional heating to temperatures above 1150 °C, the sesquinitride can then be decomposed to UN.|$|R

25|$|Like Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, Saturn's {{is created}} by a fluid dynamo within a layer of circulating liquid <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in its outer core.

On Saturn, like on Jupiter, the north magnetic pole is located in the northern hemisphere, and the south magnetic pole lies in the southern hemisphere, so that magnetic field lines point away from the north pole and towards the south pole. This is reversed compared to the Earth, where the north magnetic pole lies in the southern hemisphere. Saturn's magnetic field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are much weaker than the dipole.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{experiments}} are continuing {{in the production}} of <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in laboratory conditions at static compression and low temperature. Arthur Ruoff and Chandrabhas Narayana from Cornell University in 1998, and later Paul Loubeyre and René LeToullec from Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique, France in 2002, have shown that at pressures close to those {{at the center of the}} Earth (...) and temperatures of , hydrogen is still not a true alkali metal, because of the non-zero band gap. The quest to see <b>metallic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in laboratory at low temperature and static compression continues. Studies are also ongoing on deuterium.

40|$|Kohn-Sham density {{functional}} theory (DFT) is a widely-used {{electronic structure}} theory for materials {{as well as}} molecules. DFT is needed especially for large systems, ab initio molecular dynamics, and high-throughput searches for functional materials. DFT's accuracy and computational efficiency are limited by the approximation to its exchange-correlation energy. Currently, the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) dominate materials computation mainly due to their efficiency. We show here that the recently developed non-empirical strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA improves significantly over LDA and the standard Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA for geometries and energies of diversely-bonded materials (including covalent, <b>metallic,</b> ionic, <b>hydrogen,</b> and van der Waals bonds) at comparable efficiency. Thus SCAN may be useful even for soft matter. Often SCAN matches or improves upon the accuracy of a computationally expensive hybrid functional, at almost-GGA cost. SCAN is therefore {{expected to have a}} broad impact on materials science...|$|R
40|$|The absorption, diffusion, and {{desorption}} {{of atomic}} hydrogen in layered orthorhombic molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO 3) was investigated using density functional theory.
