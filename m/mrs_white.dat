40|$|We {{identified}} {{nine children}} with a leukoencephalopathy of similar type according to clinical and MRI findings. The patients included three affected sibling pairs. The age range was 3 to 19 years. The onset of the disease was in childhood; the course was both chronic-progressive and episodic. There were episodes of deterioration following infections and minor head traumas, and these could result in unexplained coma. In eight patients with advanced disease, MRI revealed a diffuse cerebral hemispheric leukoencephalopathy, in which increasing areas of the abnormal white matter had a signal intensity close to that of CSF on all pulse sequences. In one patient {{in the early stages}} of disease, initial MRI showed diffusely abnormal cerebral white matter, which only reached the signal characteristics of CSF at a later stage. In the patients in whom the disease was advanced, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<b>MRS)</b> of the <b>white</b> matter showed an almost complete disappearance of all normal signals and the presence of glucose and lactate, compatible with the presence of mainly CSF and little brain tissue. Spectra of the cortex were much better preserved. However, in addition to the normal resonances, there were signals representing lactate and glucose. <b>MRS</b> of the <b>white</b> matter in the patient whose disease was at an early stage was much less abnormal. Autopsy in one patient confirmed the presence of extensive cystic degeneration of the cerebral white matter with reactive change and a preserved cortex. Typical involvement of pontine tegmental white matter was suggested by MRI and confirmed by autopsy. The disease probably has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, but the basic metabolic defect is not known...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} 13 {{patients with}} neurological manifestations of {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) based on previous and/or current neurological or psychotic episodes by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) together with psychiatric and cognitive assessment.

Proton <b>MRS</b> centred on <b>white</b> matter lesions in 5 patients showed {{a reduction in the}} N-acetyl aspartate creatine ratio compared with normal appearing white matter in the SLE group and in 10 healthy controls. This pattern of abnormality does not allow differentiation of SLE lesions from the chronic plaques occurring in multiple sclerosis. There was a very high incidence of current psychiatric morbidity in the SLE group, namely in 12 of the 13 patients.

40|$|Experimental {{autoimmune}} neuritis (EAN) {{has been}} studied in rat sciatic nerves {{by a combination of}} high b-value 1 H and 2 H double quantum filtered (DQF) diffusion MRS. The signal decays of water in the 1 H and 2 H DQF diffusion MRS were found to be not monoexponential and were analyzed using the q-space approach. The q-space analysis of the 1 H diffusion data detected two diffusing components, one having broad and the other having narrow displacement profiles. These components were shown to be very sensitive to the progression of EAN disease. The q-space parameters were found to be abnormal at day 9 postimmunization before the appearance of clinical signs. The assignment of the component with the narrow displacement profile to axonal water has been corroborated by the 2 H DQF diffusion MRS results. The displacement and the relative population of this slow and restricted diffusing component followed the processes of demyelination, axonal loss, and remyelination that occur in EAN. The displacements extracted from the slow-diffusing component with the narrow displacement correlated well with the average size of the axons as deduced from electron microscopy (EM). The component with the broad displacement showed significant changes which were attributed to the formation of endoneurial edema. This observation was also corroborated by the 2 H DQF diffusion MRS experiments. It seems, therefore, that q-space analysis of high b-values diffusion MRS is a promising new approach for early detection and better characterization of the different pathologies associated with EAN. This study demonstrates the utility of high-b-value q-space diffusion <b>MRS</b> for studying <b>white</b> matter-associated disorders in general...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) imaging {{is one of}} {{the most}} important diagnostic tools in modern medicine. Compared to other imaging modalities, it provides superior soft tissue contrast of all parts of the body and it is considered to be safe for patients. Today almost all MR is performed in a nonquantitative manner, only comparing neighboring tissue in the search for pathology. It is possible to quantify MR-signals and relate them to their physical entities, but time consuming and complicated calibration procedures have prevented this being used in a practical manner for clinical routines. The aim of this work is to develop and improve quantification methods in MRspectroscopy (MRS) and MR-imaging (MRI). The techniques are intended to be applied to diffuse diseases, where conventional imaging methods are unable to perform accurate staging or to reveal metabolic changes associated with disease development. Methods: Proton (1 H) MRS was used to characterize the white matter in the brain of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Phosphorus (31 P) MRS was used to evaluate the energy metabolism in patients with diffuse liver disease. A new quantitative MRI (qMRI) method was invented for accurate, rapid and simultaneous quantification of B 1, T 1, T 2, and proton density. A method for automatic assessment of visceral adipose tissue volume based on an in- and out-ofphase imaging protocol was developed. Finally, a method for quantification of the hepatobiliary uptake of liver specific T 1 enhancing contrast agents was demonstrated on healthy subjects. Results: The 1 H <b>MRS</b> investigations of <b>white</b> matter in MS-patients revealed a significant correlation between tissue concentrations of Glutamate and Creatine on the one hand and the disease progression rate on the other, as measured using the MSSS. High accuracy, both in vitro and in vivo, of the measured MR-parameters from the qMRI method was observed. 31 P MRS showed lower concentrations of phosphodiesters, and a higher metabolic charge in patients with cirrhosis, compared to patients with mild fibrosis and to controls. The adipose tissue quantification method agreed with estimates obtained using manual segmentation, and enabled measurements which were insensitive to partial volume effects. The hepatobiliary uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA was significantly correlated in healthy subjects. Conclusion: In this work, new methods for accurate quantification of MR parameters in diffuse diseases in the liver and the brain were demonstrated. Several applications were shown where quantitative MR improves the interpretation of observed signal changes in MRI and MRS in relation to underlying differences in physiology and pathophysiology...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory cytokines are {{implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). The influence of hypothermia (HT) on cytokines after HI is unclear. Our aim was to assess in a piglet asphyxia model, under normothermic (NT) and HT conditions: (i) the evolution of serum cytokines over 48 h and (ii) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine levels at 48 h; (iii) serum pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine profile over 48 h and (iv) relation between brain injury measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and brain TUNEL positive cells with serum cytokines, serum pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and CSF cytokines. METHODS: Newborn piglets were randomized to NT (n = 5) or HT (n = 6) lasting 2 - 26 h after HI. Serum samples were obtained 4 - 6 h before, during and at 6 - 12 h intervals after HI; CSF was obtained at 48 h. Concentrations of interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, - 4, - 6, - 8, - 10 and TNF-alpha were measured and pro/anti-inflammatory status compared between groups. White matter and thalamic voxel lactate/N-acetyl aspartate (Lac/NAA) (a measure of both oxidative metabolism and neuronal loss) were acquired at baseline, after HI and at 24 and 36 h. RESULTS: Lac/NAA was reduced at 36 h with HT compared to NT (p = 0. 013 basal ganglia and p = 0. 033 white matter). HT showed lower serum TNF-alpha from baseline to 12 h (p < 0. 05). Time-matched (acquired within 5 h of each other) serum cytokine and MRS showed correlations between Lac/NAA and serum IL- 1 beta and IL- 10 (all p < 0. 01). The pro/anti-inflammatory ratios IL- 1 beta/IL- 10, IL- 6 /IL- 10, IL- 4 /IL- 10 and IL- 8 /IL- 10 were similar in NT and HT groups until 36 h (24 h for IL- 6 /IL- 10); after this, 36 h pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios in the serum were higher in HT compared to NT (p < 0. 05), indicating a pro-inflammatory cytokine surge after rewarming in the HT group. In the CSF at 48 h, IL- 8 was lower in the HT group (p < 0. 05). At 48 h, CSF TNF-alpha correlated with Lac/NAA (p = 0. 02) and CSF IL- 8 correlated with white matter TUNEL positive cell death (p = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Following cerebral HI, there was a systemic pro-inflammatory surge after rewarming in the HT group, which is counterintuitive to the putative neuroprotective effects of HT. While serum cytokines were variable, elevations in CSF inflammatory cytokines at 48 h were associated with <b>MRS</b> Lac/NAA and <b>white</b> matter cell death...|$|R

2500|$|From 1844 to 1863 White {{experienced}} between 100 and 200 visions, {{typically in}} public places and meeting halls.
