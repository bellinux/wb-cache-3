5000|$|Jo Boaler {{began her}} career as a {{secondary}} mathematics teacher in urban London secondary schools, including Haverstock School, Camden. After her early career in secondary mathematics education, Boaler received a Master's degree in Mathematics Education from King's College London with distinction in 1991. She completed her PhD in mathematics education at the same university and won the award for best PhD in education from the British Educational Research Association in 1997. In 1998, Jo Boaler became an Assistant Professor of Mathematics Education at Stanford University in the Graduate School of Education. She gained tenure in 2001 and became a full professor there in 2006. From 2000 to 2004, Boaler served {{as the president of the}} International Organization of Women and Mathematics Education. In January 2007, she was awarded the <b>Marie</b> <b>Curie</b> Foundation <b>Chair</b> of Excellence [...] at Sussex University. After three years in this post, in 2010 she returned to Stanford and resumed her position as Professor of Mathematics Education. In 2013, Boaler taught the first Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) on mathematics education, called “How to Learn Math”. Its purpose was to educate teachers and parents about a new way of teaching math in order to help students overcome their fear of math while improving their academic performance. Over 40,000 teachers and parents participated, with about 25,000 completing the full 2-to-16-hour course. [...] At the end of course, 95% of survey respondents indicated that they would modify their ways of teaching math. Boaler also provides consultation to other Silicon Valley digital educational institutions, such as Novo-ed, Inner Tube Games, and Udacity. In addition, she teaches workshops on teaching for a growth mindset, drawing upon the work of Carol Dweck, author and developer of the theory of growth mindset.|$|R

The intron-exon structure of AOX has been well characterized in several species, revealing a large degree of conservation.

40|$|Atom probe {{tomography}} {{was used}} to compare Na and Sr modified Al-Si hypoeutectic alloys. Both Na and Sr promote the formation of nanometre-sized clusters in the Si eutectic phase. Compositional analyses of the clusters show an Al:Sr ratio of 2. 92 +/- 0. 46 and an Al:Na ratio of 1. 07 +/- 0. 23. It is proposed that SrAl 2 Si 2 and NaAlSi clusters are formed at the Si/liquid interface and take part in the modification process by altering the eutectic Si growth.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of noise on an extended chaotic system using as benchmark the Lorenz' 96 model. The analysis of the system's time evolution and its time and space correlations show numerical evidence for two distinct stochastic resonance-like behaviors {{as a function of}} the external noise intensity, or the system size, and they result to be only weakly sensitive to an external periodic signal. The underlying mechanisms can be associated to a noise induced chaos reduction. A new view of the stochastic resonance phenomenon in a nonstationary situation is shown, studying the resonant phenomena implications in forecasting by exploiting a new method that quantifies the reduction of chaos error evolution process.

40|$|Von Neumann’s {{standard}} {{paradigm of}} a game in extensive form and Kolmogorov’s standard model of a stochastic process both rely on constructing a fixed state space large enough to include all possible future eventualities. This allows a typical single-person decision problem to be represented as a decision tree. Yet not all eventualities can be foreseen. Also, any practical decision model must limit the state space rather severely. In this way the standard paradigm excludes not only Schumpeter’s ideas regarding entrepreneurship, innovation and development, but also Shackle’s “unexpected events”. This paper proposes an alternative approach using “decision jungles ” with an evolving state space.

40|$|To {{appear in}} Statistical Mechanics Research Focus, Special volume (Nova Science Pub., NY, in press) (LaTex, 16 pgs, 14 figures). We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} a time-correlated noise on an extended chaotic system. The chosen model is the Lorenz' 96, a kind of toy model used for climate studies. The system is subjected to both temporal and spatiotemporal perturbations. Through the analysis of the system's time evolution and its time correlations, we have obtained numerical evidence for two stochastic resonance-like behaviors. Such behavior is seen when a generalized signal-to-noise ratio function are depicted {{as a function of the}} external noise intensity or as function of the system size. The underlying mechanism seems to be associated to a noise-induced chaos reduction. The possible relevance of those findings for an optimal climate prediction are discussed, using an analysis of the noise effects on the evolution of finite perturbations and errors.
