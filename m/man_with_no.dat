5|$|Clint Eastwood {{is dressed}} as the <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>No</b> Name from the Dollars Trilogy films. The film Paint Your Wagon is {{referenced}} {{at the beginning}} of the episode. The film does star Eastwood and Lee Marvin and was directed by Joshua Logan, but the writers did not base their parody or the song on the film at all. The man in the film that confronts Clint Eastwood is modelled after Lee Van Cleef.|$|E
5|$|Clinton Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, filmmaker, musician, and {{political}} figure. After achieving {{success in the}} Western TV series Rawhide, he rose to international fame with {{his role as the}} <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>No</b> Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of Spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.|$|E
5|$|Hollis {{is a young}} Federal Bureau of Investigation {{special agent}} who becomes a protégée to {{offender}} profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) when he begins working in Virginia. She struggles to understand the criminal mind, as her sister was murdered by a <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> motive. She has an estranged half-sister, Tamra, who has become a heroin addict. Hollis also {{has to deal with}} her father's bout with an Alzheimer's-like illness, which has possibly been induced by the Millennium Group—a secretive organisation to which Black had previously belonged, and which he now believes to be responsible for bioterrorism. Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) uses Hollis' father's illness as leverage to coerce her into cooperating with the Millennium Group.|$|E

5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the <b>Man</b> <b>With</b> <b>No</b> Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E

25|$|The {{composer}} subsequently scored Leone's {{other two}} Dollars Trilogy (or <b>Man</b> <b>With</b> <b>No</b> Name Trilogy) spaghetti westerns: For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). All three films starred the American actor Clint Eastwood as The <b>Man</b> <b>With</b> <b>No</b> Name and depicted Leone's own intense {{vision of the}} mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music {{to be an important}} part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.|$|E
5000|$|Toby's Room {{received}} a generally good reception, {{especially when it}} came to talking about the themes of what a female artist does in wartime, and how one deals with those that are disfigured and suffering as a result of war. Lee of The Guardian says: [...] "Barker makes us see, with steadiness and without sensationalism, the <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> eyes, the <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> mouths, the <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> jaws, <b>men</b> whose tongues stick out through holes in their cheeks, men who are being patched up and operated on [...] "and sent on their way with whatever the surgeons had managed to supply by way of a face".Lee also notes Barker's frequent return to T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland as a touchstone for the First World War. ("the wound and the wasteland are the same thing. They aren't metaphors for each other, it's closer than that.") ...|$|R

25|$|Both Hobson and Rose {{see this}} whiteshamanism {{as a modern}} sort of ‘cultural imperialism.’ In her {{discourse}} on whiteshamanism, “Just What’s All This Fuss About Whiteshamanism Anyway?”, Rose compares a white <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> real blood connection to Native Americans calling himself a shaman to a man claiming to be a Rabbi who isn’t Jewish.|$|E
25|$|The film's working {{title was}} I due magnifici straccioni (The Two Magnificent Tramps). It was changed just before {{shooting}} began when Vincenzoni thought up Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (The Good, the Ugly, the Bad), which Leone loved. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, River of Dollars, or The <b>Man</b> <b>With</b> <b>No</b> Name, but decided on The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.|$|E

Ethan says {{that he will be}} dying a happy <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> regrets and the heart full of Sofia's love and bids all goodbye. At these words, all the guests, come to his couch and hug him, with Ethan laughing heartily.|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} {{problem is}} that since women tend to marry men in higher socioeconomic groups than their own, the shortage {{of women in the}} marriage market will leave the least desirable, the poorest, and uneducated <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> marriage prospects.|$|R
25|$|Assisted by {{his cousin}} Buckingham, Richard mounts a {{campaign}} to present himself as the true heir to the throne, {{pretending to be a}} modest, devout <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> pretensions to greatness. Lord Hastings, who objects to Richard's accession, is arrested and executed on a trumped-up charge of treason. Together, Richard and Buckingham spread the rumour that Edward's two sons are illegitimate, and therefore have no rightful claim to the throne; they are assisted by Catesby, Ratcliffe, and Lovell. The other lords are cajoled into accepting Richard as king, in spite of the continued survival of his nephews (the Princes in the Tower).|$|E
25|$|In {{filming the}} pivotal gunfights, Leone largely removes {{dialogue}} {{to focus more}} on the actions of the characters, which was important during the film's iconic Mexican standoff. This style can also be seen in one of the film's protagonists, Blondie (aka The <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>No</b> Name), which is described by critics as more defined by his actions than his words. All three characters can be seen as anti-heroes killing for their personal gain. Leone also employed stylistic trick shooting, such as Blondie shooting the hat off a person's head and severing a hangman's noose with a well-placed shot, in many of its iconic shootouts.|$|E
25|$|However, {{inspired}} by Mandel, General Charles de Gaulle eventually created a French government-in-exile in London {{and tried to}} rally the several colonies to his cause. He hoped to gain strategic bases and gather troops for forces sufficient to liberate metropolitan France. During 1940 a few colonies joined the Free French side, but others remained under Vichy control. General de Gaulle's reputation was then as a military <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> political experience or following. His charisma wasn't sufficient to gather the allegiance of senior colonial administrators or Generals. As a result, a battle was engaged between Free French colonies and Vichy French colonies, each one siding with the Axis or the Allies.|$|E

50|$|An {{interesting}} narrative approach {{adds to the}} abstractness - as {{the film}} {{is presented as a}} flashback of a contemporary artist (Raghuvir Yadav). He remembers the many stories of a born-raconteur (Rajit Kapur) during the gossip sessions of four young <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> better way to pass time.|$|R
25|$|When {{the film}} was {{released}} on the televised network ABC on February 23, 1975, a {{four and a half}} minute prologue was added to the film to contextualise the character and justify the violence. Written and directed by Monte Hellman, it featured an unidentified official (Harry Dean Stanton) offering the <b>Man</b> <b>With</b> <b>No</b> Name a chance at a pardon in exchange for cleaning up the mess in San Miguel. Close-ups of Eastwood's face from archival footage are inserted into the scene alongside Stanton's performance. This prologue opened television presentations for a few years before disappearing; it reappeared on the Special Edition DVD and the more recent Blu-ray, along with an interview with Monte Hellman about its making.|$|E
25|$|A Fistful of Dollars was an Italian/German/Spanish co-production, {{so there}} was a {{significant}} language barrier on set. Leone did not speak English, and Eastwood communicated with the Italian cast and crew mostly through stuntman Benito Stefanelli, who also acted as an unlicensed interpreter for the production and would later appear in Leone's other pictures. Similar to other Italian films shot at the time, all footage was filmed silent, and the dialogue and sound effects were dubbed over in post-production. For the Italian version of the film, Eastwood was dubbed by stage and screen actor Enrico Maria Salerno, whose 'sinister' rendition of the <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>No</b> Name's voice contrasted with Eastwood's cocksure and darkly humorous interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Summiting Everest {{with disabilities}} such as amputations and {{diseases}} has become {{popular in the}} 21st century, with stories like that of Sudarshan Gautam, a <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> arms who {{made it to the}} top in 2013. A teenager with Down's syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery. Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches. Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include Mark Inglis (no legs), Paul Hockey (1 arm only), and Arunima Sinha (1 leg).|$|E

25|$|Although suicide {{was officially}} {{accepted}} {{as the cause}} of death, some medical experts have raised doubts, suggesting that the evidence does not support this. The most detailed objection was provided in a letter from three medical doctors published in The Guardian, reinforced by support from two other senior doctors in a later letter to the newspaper. These doctors argued that the post-mortem finding of a transected ulnar artery could not have caused a degree of blood loss that would kill someone, particularly when outside in the cold (where vasoconstriction would cause slow blood loss). Further, this conflicted with the minimal amount of blood found at the scene. They also contended that the amount of co-proxamol found was only about a third of what would normally be fatal. Dr Rouse, a British epidemiologist wrote to the British Medical Journal offering his opinion that the act of committing suicide by severing the wrist arteries is an extremely rare occurrence in a 59-year-old <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> previous psychiatric history. Nobody else died from that cause during the year.|$|E
