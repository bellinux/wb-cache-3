500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were unhappy with the rock prop used in the episode. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Glenn Neufeld strapped Visitor's feet to the stage {{in order to ensure}} that the crystal didn't move. Different versions of the crystal were then applied for different scenes, with the larger versions incorporating a seat for the actress so that she could relax inside the prop between takes. The prop caused problems for Visitor due to her claustrophobia, which was the second time during season three that a Wolfe scripted episode had caused her these types of problems after [...] "". She also didn't like how it appeared on screen: [...] "I thought it was going to look like my body turning to stone. Instead I looked like a big old hot fudge sundae, and <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> the cherry on top." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E
500|$|A common {{concern was}} that it was simply too {{vulnerable}} in traffic. Your Computer commented that [...] "a periscope would be handy if you intended driving the C5 on busy roads since your head is only at bonnet level." [...] The Guardian's motoring correspondent wrote of her [...] "grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic... On a sharp turn it too easily lifts a rear wheel, is hazardously silent, and low down. It disappears below a car driver's sight-line when pulling up alongside. The prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic, dwarfed by heavy lorries, buses, and cars, is worrying. Their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic." [...] Another Guardian writer wrote that he [...] "would not want to drive [...] C5 in any traffic at all. <b>My</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> on a level with the top of a juggernaut's tyres, the exhaust fumes blasted into my face. Even with the minuscule front and rear lights on, I could not feel confident that a lorry driver so high above the ground would see me." [...] Sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing the C5's industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, in a C5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an Austin Mini to illustrate that the C5 driver's seated position was actually higher than that of a Mini driver.|$|E
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

Quinn responded, saying, [...] "I apologize to anyone, obviously, who is a Notre Dame alum, or for those fans who thought I wasn't being very business like. I was there for awhile, and at that moment in time, when you finally get picked after waiting for 4 1/2 hours, the last thought in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> spit out your gum, fix your hair or make sure your shirt and everything looked good.

The most profound order existed throughout the entire army, when the foremost man stepped, every man stepped at the same time: I could hear the step. When the front rank reached the Western horizon a battle ensued, as we could distinctly hear {{the report of the}} arms and the rush. No man could judge of my feelings when I beheld that army of men, as plainly as I ever saw armies of men in the flesh it seemed as though every hair of <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> alive.

2500|$|The band soon {{recorded}} a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement {{and handed it}} to Peter Jesperson in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of Oar Folkjokeopus, a punk rock record store in Minneapolis, and had also founded Twin/Tone Records with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at Jay's Longhorn Bar, a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey. (The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.) He eavesdropped as Jesperson put in the tape, only to run away as soon as the first song, [...] "Raised in the City", played. Jesperson played the song again and again. [...] "If I've ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping that tape in", said Jesperson. [...] "I didn't even get through the first song before I thought <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> going to explode".|$|E
2500|$|The {{fourth day}} of the {{competition}} had started earlier with another withdrawal, as fifth seed and 2007 Masters Cup semifinalist Andy Roddick announced he was {{pulling out of the}} event, after injuring his ankle during a practice session on the previous day. [...] "Yesterday in the warm-up during practice I just went over on it. [...] We tried the best we could to get it better but I can't really stop and start on it very quickly." [...] commented Roddick. The American's withdrawal allowed 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek, who accepted the invitation to Shanghai as first alternate, after sixteen players ranked above him, and below last qualifier Gilles Simon, refused to come to the Masters Cup. Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, to tell him he might enter the competition : [...] "I called Štěpánek earlier today to let him know where <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> at, and then just told him when I came off the practice court. So he knew as early as anybody else." [...] Štěpánek's unexpected appearance (Murray had commented [...] "Štěpánek's turned up without his own racquets, he borrowed some socks off me earlier and he hasn't got his contact lenses either") marked the Czech's first career participation to the year-end championships.|$|E
