Morbidity indicators for the last 25 years were studied; prevailing ways of transmission, age pattern, and main causes of death among HIV-infected persons. A comparative analysis of morbidity was carried out. Microsoft Excel 2007 was used to analyse obtained data statistically. The significance of “clinical outcomes” was assessed by analysing confidence indexes of frequency distribution by the χ 2 test with Fisher’s angular transformation or the Mantel-Haenszel test. The sequential recognition procedure by Bayes’ method was used as the basis for mathematical modelling. There are observed the declining role of transmission through injection and the increasing role of sexual transmission. HIV is diagnosed most frequently in young people aged 15 – 30. However, an increased morbidity rate of older people has been discovered during the last 2 - 3 years. The mathematical modelling of the epidemiological situation discovered that this infection spreading among the socially safe population against the backdrop of intensifying sexual transmission, accompanied by a rising female morbidity rate and the percentage of children born by HIV-infected mothers. Obtained results substantiate the need for a unified personalized registration system for HIV-infected individuals, which would include information about the scope and effectiveness of treatment, diagnostic, preventive, and rehabilitation measures that were taken when providing <b>medical</b> and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> to this category of patients...|$|R

In this article, the duration of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> periods are investigated using Norwegian administrative data covering the years 1992 – 2002. Two types of analysis were performed. First, discrete time–event history analysis was used to investigate the duration of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> and the likelihood of re-entries among those who succeed in exiting <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> Second, panel data methods were used to study {{the amount of money that}} individuals receive in <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> The results show that most periods of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> are relatively short.

Hardly any of the investigated countries provide <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> benefits above the EU near poverty threshold. <b>Social</b> <b>assistance</b> benefit levels have not converged in Europe. Instead, divergence can be observed, which is mainly due to lagging developments in eastern and southern Europe...|$|R
40|$|Using large {{samples of}} persons born in 1985 we {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the neighbourhood where young people grew up and the probability that they will receive <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> when aged 19 to 21, for the three Swedish metropolitan regions- Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. We also investigate to what extent use of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> receipt and other parental characteristics affect the probability of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> receipt as a young adult. Logistic regressions are estimated for the majority population and “visible minorities”. A main result is that the rate of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> receipt in the neighbourhood has a sizable effect on the probability of receiving <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> as a young adult. We discuss several possible explanations for this. We also find that the probability of receiving <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> is negatively correlated with having completed secondary school and positively correlated with having become a young mother. The probability of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> receipt is strongly positively linked to <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> receipt in the parental home and negatively linked to income in the parental home. Having parents with long educations decreases the probability of receipt for the majority population while among “visible minorities ” it does not though receipt decreases by year since immigration. ...|$|R

In 2009-10, manufacturing in SA had average annual employment of 83,700 persons compared with 103,300 for health care and <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> Health care and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> represented nearly 13% of the state average annual employment.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} active labour market programmes (ALMPs) on the duration until regular employment for non-western immigrants in Denmark receiving <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> (cash benefits). 1 The reason why we focus on <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients is {{that the majority of}} non-western immigrants in Denmark are not members of an unemployment insurance fund, implying that they are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits when they become unemployed; instead they receive <b>social</b> <b>assistance,</b> and they are heavily over-represented among <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients, especially among long-term recipients. For instance, in 1998 (the second year of our estimation period) immigrants from non-western countries made up 4.8 % of the population and received 38 % of the total amount of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> benefits; see Pedersen (2000). Immigrants from western countries are much more similar to natives in terms of labour market attachment and only few receive <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> benefits.|$|R

This article assesses the issue of workers' motivation. Although there are combinations of factors that result in low motivation to search for jobs, the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> system is especially at fault and structural changes must be made to better foster workers' engagement and motivation. The problem with the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> system is finding the balance between protecting people from poverty and motivating them to work. unemployment, long-term unemployment, labour market, <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> system, unemployment benefits, <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> benefits, minimum wage, incentive gap...|$|R
