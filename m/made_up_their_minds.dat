5|$|Unhappy in {{the estate}} agency, Kingsbury took up the {{position}} of caretaker on a farm at Boundary Bend, {{not far from where}} Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure – walking through western Victoria and New South Wales. In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman. They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury. As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> to enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the Australian Imperial Force on 29 May 1940.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} the elections, about {{one third of the}} {{electorate}} had not yet <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds,</b> resulting in polls giving strongly varying indications. For this reason campaigning continued on election day itself. An aspect of this was tactical voting, with SP telling PvdA voters that a strong SP would force PvdA to form a left-wing coalition, VVD saying something similar to CDA voters concerning a right-wing coalition, PvdA and CDA saying they needed to be strong to prevent the other party from forming or dominating a coalition and ChristianUnion saying it has the best cards to participate in any coalition. Shortly before the elections, PvdA leader Bos showed himself more interested in the much talked about left-wing coalition of PvdA, SP and GroenLinks (possibly with ChristenUnie), which he had refused to talk about for months.|$|E
25|$|With the {{eventual}} outcome {{in terms of}} both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability to predict what was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company Survation claiming that 13% of voters <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> in the final days and 17% {{on the day of the}} election. The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they said they did not release the poll (commissioned by the Daily Mirror) on the concern that it was too much of an outlier with other poll results.|$|E

During the municipal elections earlier that year PvdA grew strong and after that they even grew to 60 seats in the polls, but after March a gradual decline had set in, almost halving the size of PvdA in the polls.|$|E
25|$|Angry at Ian, the Doctor {{tries to}} take him and Barbara home, but in The Reign of Terror they {{end up in the}} French Revolution, where Barbara and Susan are {{captured}} and nearly guillotined. In the second season opener, Planet of Giants (1964), the TARDIS crew are miniaturised and Barbara becomes infected by a deadly insecticide. Barbara sees the departure of Susan and aids in the rescue of the abandoned orphan Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), who takes Susan's place on the TARDIS. In the subsequent adventure, The Romans, Barbara is sold off as a slave and ends up as a servant in Nero's palace; due to his interest in her, Nero's wife Poppaea tries to poison her. Barbara and Ian leave in The Chase (1965). After the Daleks who have been pursuing the TARDIS have been destroyed, Barbara suggests to Ian they use the abandoned Dalek time machine to get home. The Doctor is furious and tries to persuade them to stay with him by suggesting the journey might kill them, but the two teachers had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> After an emotional farewell to the Doctor and Vicki, Barbara and Ian are returned to London, albeit two years after their disappearance. Back on the TARDIS, the Doctor uses the time-space visualiser to check they have returned safely, and tells Vicki how much he will miss them.|$|E

25|$|Vladimir {{had been}} prince of Novgorod {{when his father}} Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his {{half-brother}} Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, {{with the help of}} his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{stopped in}} New London, Connecticut, {{to pick up}} a {{replacement}} assistant engineer, leaving on July 3, 1871. By the time the ship reached St. John's, there was dissension among the officers and scientific staff. Bessels, backed up by Meyer, had openly rejected Hall's command over the scientific staff. The dissension spread to the crew, which was divided along nationalist lines. In his diary, Assistant Navigator George Tyson wrote that {{by the time they reached}} Disko Island, Greenland, [...] "...expressions are freely made that Hall shall not get any credit from this expedition. Already some have <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> how far they will go and when they will get home again." [...] Hall asked Captain Davenport of the supply ship Congress to intervene. Davenport threatened to have Meyer shackled for insubordination and sent back to the United States, at which point all of the Germans threatened to quit. Hall and Davenport were forced to back down, however Davenport delivered a strongly worded speech on naval discipline to the crew.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, {{in order}} to {{establish}} the male DNA line, a panel of researchers conducted a Y-DNA study of living descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field, and of a descendant of Sally's son, Eston Hemings. The results, published in the journal Nature, showed a Y-DNA match with the male Jefferson line. In 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF) assembled a team of historians whose report concluded that, together with the DNA and historic evidence, there was a high probability that Jefferson was the father of Eston and likely of all Hemings' children. W. M. Wallenborn, who worked on the Monticello report, disagreed, claiming the committee had already <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> before evaluating the evidence, was a [...] "rush to judgement," [...] and that the claims of Jefferson's paternity were unsubstantiated and politically driven.|$|E
2500|$|The album's innominate title {{actually}} came about by accident. According to Jim Bickhart's liner {{notes on the}} original double album sleeve, the group's intention was to name the release something more grandiose, such as Phoenix or The Byrds' First Album. These working titles were intended to signify the artistic rebirth that the band felt the album represented. Another proposed title for the album was McGuinn, White, Parsons and Battin but McGuinn felt that this title might be misinterpreted by the public. The band still had not <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> regarding a title when Melcher, while filling out record company documentation for the album sessions, wrote the placeholder [...] "(Untitled)" [...] in a box specifying the album's title. A misunderstanding ensued and before anyone associated with the band had realized, Columbia Records had pressed up the album with that title, including the parentheses.|$|E
2500|$|According to a legal {{analysis}} by former Supreme Court President Vilma Morales, Zelaya automatically ceased being President of Honduras {{with the publication}} of decree PCM-020-2009 and thus no coup d'état existed. However, PCM-027-2009 was never processed by the Honduran courts. This new decree published in La Gaceta 26 June 2009 explained further the purpose, form and objectives of the opinion poll, to be carried out by the National Institute of Statistics. But the courts had already <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> about every attempt {{that had to do with}} this issue. Zelaya's lawyers were also denied the possibility to participate in the process. PCM-027-2009 was sheltered in article 5 of the [...] "Law of Citizen Participation" [...] and articles 2 and 5 of the Honduran Constitution. Zelaya defined his actions as a non-binding opinion poll, but his political opponents presented his actions as a binding referendum oriented at reforming articles in the Honduran Constitution concerning forms of government and re-election.|$|E

2500|$|Another dubious {{match in}} 1873 {{is the one}} between an amateur team made up {{of those who had}} toured Canada and the USA in August and September 1872 and XV of the MCC.

2500|$|Pandya affairs first {{claimed the}} {{attention}} of Kulothunga Chola III. The {{civil war in the}} Pandya country had not yet settled {{when he came to the}} throne, and the Chola forces were still involved in active fighting there. Kulothunga Chola III succeeded for the best part of his reign to continue the Chola hegemony on the Pandya kingdom. Parakramabahu of Sri Lanka, known as Ilangai in Tamil, renewed his efforts against the Cholas and even persuaded Pandya Emperor Vira Pandya to make common cause with him. Vikrama Pandya sought the help of Kulothunga Chola III against Vira Pandya, which led to an invasion of the Pandyan kingdom by Kulothunga Chola III. The battle resulted in the defeat of the Pandya and Sinhala forces, Vira Pandya was driven into exile, and Vikrama Pandya was installed on the throne of Madurai. This campaign ended before 1182. From his exile, with the aid of his allies, Vira Pandya made another effort to retrieve his fortune, but the attempt was stopped by Kulothunga Chola III on the battlefield of Nettur. Thence, Vira Pandya fled to Ceylon'. This was Kulothunga Chola III's first campaign in the Pandyan kingdom and he met with unprecedented success. The success in this war culminated in there being [...] "no further fighting as both the ruler of Venad and Vira Pandya <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> to submit to Kulothunga Chola III and offered their obeisance to the open durbar (court) at Madurai, where Chola emperor performed a [...] "Virabhishekam" [...] and anointment of war heroes, who contributed to the Chola victory against the Pandyas and their allies from Sinhala and Venad kingdoms." ...|$|E
