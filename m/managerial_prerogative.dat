50|$|Despite the {{potentially}} important influence that a forum {{may have on}} a workplace, few such forums are found in practice. This is due to employers' viewing fora as an inroad to <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative,</b> and the concern of unions that fora will undermine collective bargaining structures.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Managerial</b> <b>Prerogatives</b> are {{considered}} natural rights that allow employers {{to manage their}} employees. They are the discretionary powers left at any moment {{in the hands of}} managers. Every act which a manager or his subordinates can lawfully do, without the consent of the worker organization, is done by virtue of this prerogative. [...] Consequently, employee’s are unable to negotiate with them on terms and conditions.For this reason Trade Unions work to aid employees as well as control and regulate these <b>prerogatives.</b> <b>Managerial</b> <b>prerogatives</b> give managers the power to control the direction in which their businesses are heading. Employees do not have this power. Managers of various types of businesses practice their managerial rights.|$|R
50|$|Managers {{use their}} prerogatives to dismiss or fire {{employees}} for reasons specified by them. If these reasons {{are not enough}} to defend the dismissal, then this situation is considered an unfair dismissal. <b>Managerial</b> <b>prerogatives</b> give managers the ability to dismiss employees. These prerogatives vary from country to country. Manager rights sometimes from company to company within the same country.|$|R
50|$|Control was the {{essential}} managerial {{function in the}} time of industrialism in all countries and social systems.In the UK, there are constraints on <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative</b> rights mainly pertaining to the right of firing employees. In order to successfully dismiss a worker, the manager must provide sufficient evidence that his decision to fire was fair to all parties. This is judged in a court of law.====Johnstone v Bloomsbury: Health Authority==== Johnstone v Bloomsbury: Health Authority is an example of managerial prerogatives used in an abusive manner. Dr. Johnstone had been asked to work for a set time per week and also be ready when asked to work for additional hours. This was abused when his manager asked him to work inhumane hours, affecting Johnstone’s health and well-being. His manager was able to impose these hours on Dr. Johnstone but there are human rights in the UK that protect Johnstone and his health.|$|E
5000|$|The Danish {{flexicurity}} {{model has}} its roots in the nineteenth century, when negotiations among employers and trade unions during the so-called September Compromise of 1899 (also called Labour Market Constitution) laid the ground for a mutually beneficial (profitable and secure) state. The 'Constitution' was revised in 1960 and renamed Basic Agreement. It settled the freedom of trade union association as well as the <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative</b> to manage and divide the work including the right to hire and dismiss the labour force at any time necessary. [...] "It is thus important to understand that the Danish model of labour market regulation, including the right to form associations, is based on these voluntaristic principles and that legislation or interference of the state is kept on a minimum. The right of association and the recognition of labour market associations are based on the mutual recognition of conflicting interests." [...] The Danish tripartite agreements amongst employers, workers, and the state are supported by an intricate system that allows for an active response from the state, which supports the 'activation' of workers.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{case study}} data, this article {{analyzes}} contrasting workplace union responses to organizational restructuring in the United Kingdom’s aerospace industry. It critically evaluates two distinct union strategies that resonate with contemporary debates governing the future role of trade unions in the British workplace. The first response {{is based on}} “partnership” with management while the second reflects traditional “oppositionalism” via the assertive defense of rank-and-file member interests. The article highlights inherent weaknesses in partnership strategies arising from problems of management intention and union incorporation. By contrast, while militant opposition was more successful in constraining the exercise of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives,</b> the traditions of “sectionalism” (or “localism”) in plant-based union organizing meant that this strategy was limited to securing a partial and transient defense of jobs and labor standards...|$|R
40|$|Information technology’s (IT) {{influence}} on formative contexts and on requisite leadership roles is conceptualized {{both as an}} enabling force for organizational networking and a reduc-ing force for diversity in leadership functions and cultural contexts. The contemporary “New Age ” leadership literature calls for personal and ideological leadership unencumbered by issues of cultural context, communicative complexities {{and the need for}} more comprehensive and sophisticated global social analysis. At the same time, this literature punctuates a no-ticeable indifference to the issue of strategic IT literacy on behalf of agency elites. A preoccu-pation with “lean and mean”, unbridled <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives,</b> competitive rhetoric overstressing means at the expense of legitimate ends, business process re-engineering, downsizing, and IT-mediated globalization can be construed as an abject failure of agency elites to understand and protect distinctive competencies in governance and in organized action. Administrative theory urgently requires a renewed understanding of vulnerability and resilience in agency behavior and the need for renewed institutional and IT-literate leadership...|$|R
40|$|In Garcetti v. Ceballos, the U. S. Supreme Court, by {{the narrowest}} of margins, held that {{allegations}} of police perjury made in memoranda to his superiors by Richard Ceballos, a supervisory {{prosecutor in the}} Los Angeles County District Attorney 2 ̆ 7 s office, were unprotected by the First Amendment because “his expressions were made pursuant to his duties. ” The academic reaction to this holding has been harshly negative; scholars argue that the holding will prevent the public from learning of governmental misconduct that is known only to those working within {{the bowels of the}} government itself. This Article rejects the scholarly consensus on Garcetti. It argues that the critics’ claim that Garcetti undervalues the role of whistleblowers in enhancing the quality of public discussion and debate is misconceived because Garcetti is not properly understood as a whistleblower case. Moreover, although the Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion is admittedly undertheorized, its holding is consistent with fundamental principles of First Amendment law. Rather than stifling public discussion and debate about public institutions, Garcetti rests on an understanding of the First Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to free speech as a means of achieving political accountability—an understanding with powerful roots in First Amendment jurisprudence. The Court’s opinion contains an account—concededly undertheorized—of managerial control over employee speech as essential if management is to be held politically accountable for the performance of public institutions. This Article endeavors to fill out that account. The Article begins with an exploration of Garcetti. Part I demonstrates that Garcetti essentially abandons the Court 2 ̆ 7 s prior approach to the First Amendment rights of public employees by embracing a new inquiry that focuses on an identification of the scope of legitimate managerial prerogatives. <b>Managerial</b> <b>prerogative,</b> in turn, ensures that political officials have effective control over the functioning of public offices—and therefore are fairly held politically accountable for the operations of those offices. Part I concludes with a consideration of the future of public employee speech litigation in light of the emerging law of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative.</b> Part II considers the implications of this new law of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative</b> in another employment-related context—laws forbidding discriminatory harassment. There has been a powerful current of scholarly argument that the First Amendment places substantial limitations on the power of government to forbid sexually or racially harassing speech. At least four members of the Supreme Court have expressed significant support for this view. Part II demonstrates that under the concept of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative</b> embraced by Garcetti, governmental power to forbid harassing speech in the workplace is largely unconstrained by the First Amendment. In Part III, the Article places Garcetti {{within the context of a}} broader trend in recent First Amendment jurisprudence. Part III sketches the emerging doctrinal framework of this new First Amendment law of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative</b> and then, to illustrate the character of emerging doctrine, applies this framework to institutions of higher education and the concept of academic freedom—an issue noted but set aside in Garcetti. Part III argues that the emerging First Amendment law of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative</b> permits public universities to regulate academic speech in a manner that is consistent with scholarly norms as a means of achieving legitimate institutional objectives...|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} relations {{policies of the}} Howard government during its first three terms have produced {{a major change in}} the way decisions, especially over non-wage issues, are made in Australian workplaces: they have significantly increased the exercise of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative.</b> This has been achieved by reducing the scope and importance of awards, encouraging decentralized enterprise bargaining {{while at the same time}} greatly restricting the power of the unions, and promoting individual contracts, the effects of which are both to directly increase management power and to further undermine the power of the unions. This conclusion will be massively extended with the legislative proposals anticipated for the fourth Howard government and announced in late May 2005. Amongst other things, the further decline of awards, the elimination of unfair dismissal provisions for collective and individual agreements, the continued attacks on unions and the promotion of individual contracting will serve even further to enhance <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative...</b>|$|E

50|$|These {{countries}} have similar laws pertaining to managerial {{rights and the}} parameters {{in which they can}} be practiced. These are countries including Lebanon, Japan, China, and India, where <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives</b> are defined and there are actions that managers can and can’t do. Laws also define negotiable and non-negotiable matters.Negotiable matters are those that employees can change by using their bargaining power. These include general rights such as the ability to hire, dismiss, promote, demote, and change work hours and wages, in any way they wish to do so. Managers are able to control the size of their work force, as well as regulate social security.Non-negotiable items are those that cannot be swayed by employees and are decided solely by the manager. These include decisions on the products developed, the equipment used to develop them, and the prices of the products made. They also include the decision on the location of the business. The workload given to employees is also non-negotiable, as managers make this decision. Confidential and company records are also non-negotiable items.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In late 2005, the Australian Parliament {{enacted the}} Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth), which {{established}} a new legal regime for federal labour law {{known as the}} Work Choices laws. These laws came into force on 27 March 2006. The major argument enunciated in this address is that in their present form, the Work Choices laws are unsustainable and will be altered and softened in six to eight years. First, these new laws are examined and it is concluded that they elevate <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives</b> to new heights over and above fair outcomes. Second, the reasons given for the unsustainability of these laws are: the opposition of State and Territory governments; their prescriptive nature; the failure of employers to engage with them; and because the collective bargaining provisions contravene international labour law. Third, some features of a balanced set of post-Work Choices labour laws are examined, including collective bargaining, a minimum wage, safety, compensation, and discriminatory and unfair terminations. Finally, {{it is suggested that}} a truly national employment law code could be created through the enactment of cooperative federal and State legislation...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of new management strategies and flexible working {{practices in the}} manufacturing industry has caused a fragmentation of the traditional collective base of British trade unions. Such changes have led some commentators to argue that, in order to survive, manufacturing unions must reject oppositional stances and instead offer support for company objectives, work reforms and partnership relations with management at the workplace level. This article compares {{the responses of the}} Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) and the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union (MSF) to the rapid and wide-ranging restructuring of the UK's aerospace industry. The article questions current typologies of union policy and identity and associated prescriptive analysis of appropriate union strategy. We argue that such prescriptive analysis understates the complexity of union behaviour at the workplace level. Our findings suggest that the local traditions of workplace organizing far outweigh the influence of national union strategy. In the case of the MSF, the workplace unions failed to engage with the restructuring of work and were constrained by technical union traditions of sectionalism. By contrast, the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) workplace unions were able to adapt their historical form of organizing, based on work group representation and job control, to maintain significant constraints against <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is the {{contention}} {{of this paper}} that a paradox engulfs the modern corporation, especially those organisations that desire ‘cultural change ’ and pursue participative management techniques. This ‘paradox of prerogative ’ occurs when managements simultaneously recognise the need for increasing employee participation but are unwilling to modify the practice and perception of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative.</b> The contemporary protrusion of this paradox is highlighted in post-tayloristic developments in management theory. The underlying assumption is that granting autonomy to employees leads to enhanced quality of work life and improved productivity. However at the same time, this paper argues that managements fear increasing employee autonomy and participation will erode the traditional notion of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative</b> and in turn, their right to control aspects of the employment relationship. This paper explores this paradox with respect to firms operating in the Australian retail and insurance sectors. These organisations were selected due to their adoption of participative practices and simultaneous attempt to strengthen or alter their corporate cultures. These case studies confirm {{the hypothesis that the}} extension of employee participation/autonomy is conditional upon the creation of a corporate monoculture that seeks to disguise {{the true nature of the}} labour process...|$|E
40|$|At {{the core}} of the present global crisis lies an ideological {{oversight}} that indicates standard business models are subject to fail due to moral hazard: <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative,</b> particularly the U. S. variant, is not self-regulating in respect to either corporate risk or the stewardship of stakeholder trust. We know there is variance in national political economies, but less is known about legal factors informing firm-specific variance, especially as these regards trust and transparency. This paper reports research seeking to bridge this ‘gap’ by the introduction of comparative legal ecology employment models of the enterprise. The construct is derived from reflection upon industrial relations research into the existence and nature of Japan’s ‘lifetime employment system’. Construct parameters include employment security, labor unions and the degree of employee participation permitted (if any); model schematics are offered for the United States of America, Germany, Japan, Denmark, and the People’s Republic of China. The comparative models help to account for variance in the legal extent and nature of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative,</b> job security, and the degree of information, power, and resource transparency of any enterprise. These offer, in consequence, clear and clearly comparative benchmarks of industrial democracy...|$|E
40|$|The paper uses {{research}} into industrial dormitories in Southern China {{to examine the}} role performed by employer-controlled accommodation {{in the management of}} human resources. The current rapid industrialization in China has been fuelled by the over 100 million internal migrants who move around the country on an annual basis and are housed in industrial dormitories within or close to production facilities. The paper argues that having labour supply `on tap' facilitates management extending the working day, responding rapidly to fluctuations in product demand and functions as a form of coercive control, whereby employers have power not only over employment but also the housing needs of employees. The paper examines the history and contemporary use of employer-controlled accommodation, and argues that in both scale and systematic application, the current Chinese case is unique in the history of human resource management. Drawing on a case study of a large factory and dormitory, `China Wonder Electronics' based in the Southern city of Shenzhen, the paper outlines the ways in which by working and living together, workers are able to develop collective resources that can be mobilized against <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives,</b> and challenge what is structurally a weak employment relationship for labour faced with the combined forces of big business and the state. The paper concludes by discussing the strengths and limitations for workers in what we are calling a dormitory labour regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{general study}} of {{institutional}} arrangements {{that are designed}} to impact on <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives</b> is typically cast in the genre of forms of industrial democracy. While the last few decades have seen a decline in interest in this area of study, developments in the European Union have enabled an ongoing dialogue specifically on the topic of consultation. Although consultation is generally seen by scholars as a modest form of industrial democracy, formal European Directives have provided the opportunity to assess the representative strength or otherwise of initiatives such as European Works Councils that are explicitly designed to address social policy and inequality in the workplace. Drawing on 41 case studies, we examine the determinants of European Works Councils morphology, activities undertaken and general outcomes. We note {{that it is important to}} presumptively inquire as to what is being theorized rather than simply take the implicit position that European Works Councils are the prime institution of influence. This leads us to establish the primacy of management and in particular, the vector of management decision-making as the primary independent variable that predicts much about the operation and robustness of European Works Councils. Accordingly, we find that strong centralized management, rather than the usual suspects of differing national industrial relations systems and cultural differences, typically account for much of what we understand in terms of the role that European Works Councils play...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{accounts}} of workplace union representation have emphasised {{the exclusion of}} shop stewards from management decision-making processes, and have posited a shift in shop steward activity away from dealing with collective issues through bargaining, towards dealing with individual issues through casework, {{as part of the}} wider decline of union influence. This thesis challenges those accounts by showing that they utilise a problematic conceptual framework and rest upon questionable empirical foundations. An alternative framework is proposed which incorporates a clearly conceptualised definition of bargaining ??? something missing from previous accounts ??? and which develops and synthesises conceptual elements from Marxist-influenced sociologies of work, bargaining theory, and industrial relations scholarship. It is shown that efforts to influence management decision making and to restrict <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives</b> continue to figure prominently in shop steward activity, even though the reduction of union influence is undeniable and formal arrangements for union-management relations have been recast. Moreover, these efforts are often to some extent successful. This analysis is supported by considerable evidence from two detailed workplace studies, including an innovative use of diaries, which contribute important new insights into the activity of contemporary shop stewards. This thesis argues that the persistence of shop steward bargaining is best understood in relation to underlying dynamics of conflict and exploitation within the employment relationship under capitalism. Bargaining processes are explored in terms of changing patterns of bargaining opportunities and bargaining resources, which are linked to changing management practices. While the form and location of bargaining processes have changed, the prevalence of issues around the effort bargain and frontier of control demonstrate the continuing influence of the dynamics of workplace relations on patterns of shop steward activity. While further research is required, the theoretical and conceptual framework developed in this thesis suggests that similar processes are likely to be found elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|Alan Fox's unitarist {{ideology}} {{provided a}} useful categorisation of managerial perspectives on managing employees {{and the nature}} of organisation. However, it was an intuitive framework, developed as part of a reformist argument for a pluralist system of industrial relations. It was not based on a systematic, empirical study of managers and, while applied to research, there has been little testing of the construct. The primary research question addressed in this thesis is whether managers in contemporary SMEs exhibit unitarist characteristics. A number of subsidiary questions follow. The first set explores managers' attitudes towards <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative,</b> conflict, collective workplace relations and trade unions. Analysis of the data produced 11 unitarist dimensions. The second addresses whether organisational and personal characteristics and managers' perceptions of the limitations on management are significant for SME managers' ideological frameworks. The third identifies whether consultative, participative and collective practices are employed in work organisations. The definition of managerial ideology, including both managers' beliefs and values and also their workplace behaviour and practices, led to testing the relationship between the unitarist dimensions and managerial practice, and managers' satisfaction with employees. Finally, the thesis investigated whether there were any significant links between managerial practices and managers' satisfaction with employee performance. The methodology included a mail survey of SME managers in Eastern Australia with 206 respondents, and an interview programme of 20 SME managers in Brisbane, Queensland. The significant findings of this research are, first, that consultative or participative managerial practices do not necessarily reflect a pluralist ideology or orientation. SME managers limit the scope of decisions for involving employees, and usually shopfloor employees, utilising practices that do not compromise managerial power or <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative.</b> Second, organisational and personal characteristics are relatively unimportant contextual variables in management behaviour in SMEs, unless it was described as a family business. Third, this thesis provides an alternative to the conclusions of some industrial relations scholars that managers employ a mix of unitarist and pluralist strategies. The adoption of apparently pluralist management practices in consultation and employee participation are revealed in this research as being predominantly non-threatening to <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative</b> and organisational power structures in workplaces in terms of who is involved or excluded, and about what matters employees are consulted or involved. The overall results of managers' attitudes to collective workplace arrangements and trade unions confirm a general unitarist orientation in Australian SMEs. Fourth, the evidence does not suggest any clear binding of values and beliefs with managerial behaviour. Underpinning normative perspectives on management is an underlying commitment to protecting managers' power in the work organisation. It is this fundamental political commitment that both guides and constrains strategic choice in managing employees in SMEs. Unitarist ideology is thus central to the norms of management, and goes to the core of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogative.</b> Finally, the results indicated that SME managers in the study usually did not demonstrate strong attachments to their views on the issues presented to them...|$|E
40|$|In February 1944 the Canadian federal {{government}} introduced Order in Council PC 1003, {{a system of}} compulsory collective bargaining which has been conventionally characterized as {{the culmination of the}} gradual evolution in federal labour relations policy towards the greater recognition of trade unions and collective bargaining. The issue addressed in this thesis is whether this characterization is accurate. As against the tendency to present federal intervention in collective bargaining as having developed towards some inevitable maturity, the account presented herein seeks {{to draw attention to the}} suppressed alternatives of history. Thus, the thesis begins with an examination of PC 1003 'S historical antecedents dating back to 1900. This is followed by an examination of the developments during the Second World War. Instead of concentrating upon federal collective bargaining policy as a means of responding to wartime pressures by establishing a mechanism for mediating and resolving disputes between labour and capital, the thesis emphasizes the extent to which the policy was part of the large post-war settlement. By ignoring this, the conventional account has failed to provide any guidance for understanding either the actual provisions wheich were introduced or the longevity of PC 1003 as the dominant institutional model for Canadian labour relations. By contrast, if PC 1003 is understood as part of an attempt to forge a post-war settlement between labour and capital it is possible to identify the general thrust of the Order. Although it represented a fundamental shift in Canadian labour policy in that employers were compelled to recognize unions for the purpose of collective agreements, PC 1003 did not radically alter the balance of power to make it easier to organize or constrain <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives.</b> In fact, PC 1003 was consistent with the {{federal government}}'s historical preoccupation with promoting responsible unions and attaining industrial peace and stability. </p...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{conceptual}} {{foundations of the}} legal principles that govern the operation of company and labour law. The paper argues that far from seeing the doctrinal architecture of company and labour law {{as a product of}} apolitical and objective rules a paradigm shift is required. The rule book conception of law is a misguided methodological framework. In sharp contrast to that methodology this paper avers the legal principles governing company and labour law must be viewed through the prism of the sovereignty of property rights. In effect, the viewpoint that law is an autonomous domain is eschewed in this paper. Instead the historical, social and economic forces directing legal developments in two crucial fields are illuminated. The upshot is a study illustrating the dialectical bond that exists between company and labour law. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part examines the way prescriptive law is the keystone of labour law. The role of the control test and implied terms are scrutinized in order to illuminate the way that the common law of employment facilitates the hegemony of <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives.</b> Apolitical legalism plays no role in this sphere of law. The second part considers the juridical forms that entrench the power of shareholders and managers in the modern company. In this sphere of law the courts sanction facilitative law by prioritizing the voluntarist assumptions of business people. The curve of legal reasoning in company law is dominated by the courts treating the leading personnel in companies as the personification of economic relations. The owners and administrators of capital are regarded as occupying the commanding heights of the economy, and are given judicial support to choose their own constitutional arrangements. Shareholders and directors are vested w ith a large degree of autonomy and discretion that is translated into the capacity to opt {{in and out of the}} regulatory web. The final part sums up the factors that underpin the triumph of the prescriptive and facilitative law that dominates labour and company law. 30 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{democratisation}} of Korea {{during the}} past decade has been accompanied by mass worker protest from the country's independent trade union movement and finally involving the official trade unions. Far from being simply a struggle against autocratic government, chaebol workers, led by radical trade unionists, have sought to relieve their organisations from subordination to their employers by, among other means, challenging the Korean government's intransigence over reforming restrictive labour legislation. This challenge culminated in a general strike earlier this year after the government instead of reforming the labour legislation sought to maintain its restrictions and strengthen <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives.</b> Historically, the Korean labour movement has been a movement of struggle. Even before, but certainly during the Japanese colonial period (1910 - 1945), followed by the post-WWII division of the Korean Peninsular (1945) and the Korean War (1950 - 1953), the subordination of workers and trade unions to the interests of a state-supported monopolistic capitalism has made this so. From the 1960 s, the rapid industrialisation of Korea was achieved through the symbiotic relationship {{between the state and the}} chaebol, not the trade unions, the legacy of which still bedevils Korean industrial relations today. As in Japan, the radical labour movement which emerged after WWII in Korea in 1945 was rolled back in the late 1940 s as Cold War politics determined government policies. However, in spite of the government-chaebol hostility to organized labour, in the 1970 s, an independent labour movement was revived by union activists and pro-democracy activists to counter it. In the mid- 1980 s, this radical alliance, after securing community support, organized strikes and civil unrest in support of recognition of an independent trade union movement which could collectively bargain with chaebol managements. This paper identifies the historical antecedents of Korea’s post-WWII and contemporary labour movement with the purpose of demonstrating the significance of the former for understanding the latter. ...|$|R

Aggressive acts against individuals influence the arbitrators to sustain the employer’s punishment more so than property related misdeeds; the arbitral decision-making process is a stepped process demarcated by the arbitrator’s initial assessment of the employer’s respect for distributive justice when choosing dismissal as a disciplinary action and misjudgements in distributive justice see arbitrators reversing the dismissal. ...|$|E

However, even if {{widely regarded as the}} direction to go to reform labor market institutions, it is cautioned that the features of the Nordic model may not replicable in practice.

40|$|Order-in-Council PC 1003, {{which was}} {{implemented}} by Mackenzie King 2 ̆ 7 s Liberal government in 1944, signalled {{the adoption of}} a Wagner-style collective bargaining scheme as the key element in Canadian labour relations policy. Despite various refinements and amendments to collective bargaining legislation across Canada, PC 1003 has provided the basic statutory framework for labour relations for the past fifty years. In their paper, Fudge and Glasbeek evaluate the legacy of PC 1003. They recognize that it represented a fundamental and positive change in Canadian labour relations policy; the government compelled employers to recognize and to bargain with duly elected representatives and/or trade unions. But they argue that, despite the progress represented by this step, PC 1003 was not intended to alter the balance of power radically, that is, to ensure trade unions better agreements and/or to guarantee strong constraints on <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives.</b> By locating PC 1003 in the broader political and economic context of World War II and the immediate post-war reconstruction period, Fudge and Glasbeek identify the inherent structural limitations in the scheme. They chronicle how labour relations board policies regarding bargaining unit determination and certification entrenched a fragmented bargaining structure, reinforced the sex segregation of the labour market and promoted a specific form of responsible trade unionism. The logic of the assumption that collective bargaining was to reflect an atomized, privately organized market system made PC 1003 particularly inapposite to the public sector, they maintain. Fudge and Glasbeek argue that this helps to explain why it has been relatively easy for governments to roll back public sector collective bargaining rights. They also consider why the Canadian labour movement has reacted to increased labour market competition in the 1980 s and 1990 s by calling for reforms to the PC 1003 model which will enhance union bargaining rights, rather than endorsing a wholesale revision of the legislative framework. They suggest that unions have tended to identify their success both in increasing their membership and in bargaining improved terms and conditions of employment from 1944 to the mid- 1970 s with the legislative framework. This ignores the extent to which favourable economic conditions (protective trade barriers and managed competition) were a pre-condition for effective trade union organization and collective bargaining. Fudge and Glasbeek conclude that recent changes in the Canadian labour market, which include the proliferation of small firms, the expansion of precarious employment and increased competition, draw attention to the fundamental problem with the union movement 2 ̆ 7 s strategy of maintaining or upgrading the PC 1003 model...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{critically}} examines {{and questions}} {{the effectiveness of}} a competency-based training policy for frontline management training and development in Australia - the Frontline Management Initiative (FMI). This represents a crucial landmark in Australian Government training policy, in that the training and development of frontline managers was given a national impetus {{and for the first time}} a frontline management program with nationally recognised qualifications and transferable competencies was developed. Since the very nature of management and managerial competence are matters of long-standing debates, the application and effectiveness of the FMI for the 'frontline manager' and the organisation as a whole constitutes a critical aspect of this work. The study explores the interaction between national, institutional, organisational and individual factors and their impact on the implementation of the FMI in organisations. Data to address the research questions were sought through a series of interviews and questionnaires, six case studies, and supplemented by an extensive analysis of the literature and policy documents regarding the FMI. An institutional perspective on the FMI policy development process was obtained through interviews with policy makers and other individuals who have played prominent roles in the FMI. Interviews with senior managers from the case study organisations provided organisational perspectives on the FMI, and interviews and questionnaires completed by FMI participants provided participant perspectives. An important theme of this thesis is that the political and economic context played an important role in shaping the frontline management recommendations. The FMI is a political construction of what is believed to be the characteristics of an effective 'enterprising frontline manager'. The thesis demonstrates that training and development activities are not only influenced by the organisational environment, but also restrained by national institutions developed over time to deliver and accredit training. In particular the development of a national training system linked with training packages (that enable organisations to provide firm-specific training) and national qualifications reflect a conflict between employee needs and enterprise needs. The current focus of national training which reflects 'enterprise needs', requires employees to be made more 'competent' to suit industry requirements, with the result that the provision of transferability of competencies and qualifications to other firms and industries has been compromised. The analysis of FMI practice indicates that the role and performance of frontline managers are significant issues in all the case study organisations. In an environment characterised by change and (senior managerial) expectations as to what frontline managers ought to be doing, frontline management development is viewed as a key organisational process aimed at delivering successful organisational renewal. For frontline managers these new expectations signal fundamental changes in their roles. An important finding is that the organisational context within which the implementation of the FMI has taken place and the nature of participant characteristics (especially educational qualifications) have influenced participants' perceptions and attitudes towards the FMI. While the rhetoric surrounding the implementation of the FMI focuses on greater organisational productivity, high performing managers, self direction, flexible approach to skill recognition, national accreditation and transferability of skills, in practice the underpinning assumptions of the FMI, including organisational reality (power and politics), make at least some of this rhetoric questionable. As a MD and training technology for managers it is neither a neutral nor an objective process and therefore should not be viewed as an isolated process taking place in organisations. The FMI is a means of crafting distinct frontline managerial identities in organisations and as such may also fall victim to workplace practices and <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives.</b> The National Training Framework also emerges as a critical factor in maintaining the quality, credibility and relevance of the FMI training and qualification. Weak training arrangements have had important consequences for the implementation of the FMI. In particular inconsistent implementation of National Training Framework policies has impacted on the quality and relevance of FMI training delivery, the recognition that training receives (within and outside organisations) and the extent to which it achieves the objectives of transferable and consistent training outcomes for frontline managers. Finally, the overall success of the FMI policy is questioned in this thesis. The thesis demonstrates that perceptions of a 'successful' FMI policy are strongly linked to institutional interests. Attention is drawn towards the 'politics of FMI' and the instrumental behaviour displayed by policy makers to protect their institutional interests...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree of Magister of Technologiae: Human Resource Management in the Faculty of Business at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2013 Broadly speaking, employee participation is the totality of forms, either directly (personal or by employees themselves) or indirectly (through employees’ representatives) by which individuals, groups, and/or collectives secure their interests or contribute to the decision making process. Employee participation has often been heralded as a solution, if not the panacea for low institutional effectiveness, efficiency and productivity. Institutional productivity is a basic goal of management in today’s highly competitive HE institution environment. This is because higher productivity signifies that the employees are rendering services of good quality and this will attract new students. The primary objective of any public HE institution is to render services of good quality to the students (inputs) so as to produce more graduates (outputs or productivity). Employee participation in decision making beyond collective bargaining is relatively new in South African civil service. Recognizing the need to supplement CB and for South African civil service to be more competitive, the LRA of 1995 No 66 introduced the system of Workplace Forums. A Workplace Forum is an in-house body, which is intended {{for the promotion of}} participative management through consultation, cooperation, joint decision making and information sharing. This new dispensation was mainly aimed at improving the effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of South African workplaces. More so, the new dispensation also aimed to promote shop floor democracy, and to encourage power sharing in South African workplaces. However, the uptake of this new dispensation in the public HE institution for this study is slow due to the adversarial relationship between the unions in the HE institution where this study was conducted. The reality is that, there are platforms in the Faculty for this study through which employees can voice their opinions. This notwithstanding, the respondents for this study stated that this platforms are not effective because management most of the time uses its prerogatives (Executive Ruling) to decide on issues under debate for the interest of the Faculty. The fact that there is an adversarial relationship between the unions in the institution for this study and the fact also that management most of the time uses its prerogatives to ignore the inputs of the employees means that meaningful employee participation is a “show” and not “real” in the institution and Faculty where this study was conducted. This study investigates the impact of employee participation in decision making on a Faculty’s productivity. A qualitative method was employed, and face-to-face semi-structured interviews were used to collect data for this study. The data that was collected for this study was analyzed qualitatively by using themes. The overall finding shows that it is perceived that employee participation has a positive impact on the Faculty’s effectiveness, efficiency and productivity. This is because the respondents stated that they render effective and efficient services to the students because there are more than enough opportunities or platforms where they can contribute to the Faculty’s decisions and management. However, the respondents also indicated that they would be more effective, efficient and productive if the management of the Faculty should translate their inputs into practice. The study also found that employee participation {{is still in its infancy}} in the institution and Faculty owing to the three main factors below:  Lack of management commitment in the process. This is as a result of fear on the part of management to loose its <b>managerial</b> <b>prerogatives</b> and control over the Faculty; and  Lack of trade union support. This is because there is an adversarial relationship between the unions in the institution for this study; and  Lack of employees’ commitment. This is due the fact that employees see no commitment on the part of the unions in the institution and management of the Faculty for this study. In order for there to be any meaningful or effective employee participation in decision making in the institution and Faculty for this study, the above obstacles should be overcome...|$|R
