50|$|A cock egg is {{most often}} a pullet's first effort, {{produced}} before her laying mechanism is fully ready. In a <b>mature</b> <b>hen,</b> a wind egg is unlikely, but can occur if a bit of reproductive tissue breaks away, stimulating the egg-producing glands to treat it as a yolk and wrap it in albumen, membranes and a shell as it travels through the egg tube. This has occurred if, instead of a yolk, the egg contains a small particle of grayish tissue. This type of egg occurs in many varieties of fowl, including chickens (both standard and bantams), guineafowl, and Japanese (Coturnix) quail.|$|E
40|$|When {{the nucleus}} of a <b>mature</b> <b>hen</b> {{erythrocyte}} is introduced into the cytoplasm of a HeLa cell it resumes the synthesis of RNA and DNA. This reactivation of the red cell nucleus in the heterokaryon {{is associated with a}} marked increase in its volume. There is a direct relationship between the volume of the nucleus and the amount of RNA which it makes. The nuclear en-largement is not a consequence of increased RNA synthesis, or of DNA synthesis: enlargement is the primary event, and the increase in RNA synthesis is determined by it. The possibility is considered that changes in nuclear volume may regulate not only the amount of RNA made in the nucleus but also the areas of chromatin on which it is made...|$|E
40|$|A non-histone {{chromosomal}} 95 K protein (of mol. wt. 95 000) from hen oviduct {{was isolated}} and purified for antibody induction in the rabbit. Immuno-micro-complement-fixation and biochemical techniques {{were used to}} probe the presence of 95 K protein in the oviduct chromatin of the embryonic and immature chick and the hen. The antiserum against 95 K protein did not react with high-mobility-group proteins 1 and 2 obtained from oviduct, brain and liver, nor with histones. After limited digestion of chromatin with nucleases, until 10 % DNA was hydrolysed, {{a small amount of}} 95 K protein was released. Thus the 95 K protein is probably not located in the region of chromatin that is sensitive to nuclease digestion. The amount of 95 K protein in immature chick oviduct chromatin is less than that in the <b>mature</b> <b>hen</b> oviduct. However, the amount of 95 K protein in the immature chick oviduct was increased after oestrogen administration. The presence of 95 K protein in embryonic oviduct was detected in the 10 -, 12 -, 15 - and 18 - day chick embryo. The quantity of this protein increased with the age of the embryo and reached its highest value in the chromatin of the hen oviduct...|$|E

The respective roles of the calcium needs for shell formation and of the reproductive status in regulation of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 production were analysed. Plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 decreased 3 hr after suppression of shell formation following premature egg expulsion and remained lower than that of hens laying hard-shelled eggs when premature expulsion of the eggs was continued for several days. Circulating 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 tended to increase progressively when shell formation was resumed. Ablation of the parathyroid glands abolished this increase. In hens laying hard-shelled eggs, the plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 was higher during the period of shell secretion. Feeding hens a low calcium diet (1. 2 %) caused a marked increase in the plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. Ionized calcium levels tended to show reciprocal changes to plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 decreasing when calcification took place and increasing after its suppression. In hypercalcemic hens laying shell-less eggs and fed a 3. 5 % Ca diet, the plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 was at a high level 4 hr after ovulation and diminished thereafter. This additive stimulation does not, therefore, involve the parathyroid gland and may involve hormonal changes induced by ovulation. Vitamin D binding protein (DBP) in the plasma was at a high level in <b>mature</b> <b>hens</b> and was not affected by shell formation. Consequently, the free 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 index fluctuated in parallel with total level of this hormone in <b>mature</b> <b>hens.</b> It is concluded that the calcium demand for shell formation modulates, in the short term, plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, via the homeostatic regulation of blood calcium by PTH, but that a large part of its increase is independent of PTH and is associated with the endocrine events concomitant with ovulation. status: publishe...|$|R

Chicks and reproductive groups were kept either on station under improved management conditions or in rural environment. In rural environment, the birds were divided in two groups. The birds pertaining to the first group were treated against parasitic diseases, whereas those in the second one (control group) received no treatment. Under station conditions, the feed conversion ratio and the daily weight gain were 8. 8 and 5. 7 g/day respectively. Mean body weight at six months of age were 1151 g and 1085 g for males and females, respectively. Sexual maturity was reached at 36 weeks of age.

40|$|AbstractIn {{search for}} yet uncharacterized {{proteins}} involved in lipid metabolism of the chicken, we have isolated a hitherto unknown protein from the serum lipoprotein fraction with a buoyant density of ≤ 1. 063  g/ml.

As determined by SDS-PAGE, the major circulating {{form of the}} protein, which we designate apolipoprotein-VLDL-IV (Apo-IV), has an apparent Mr of approximately 17  kDa. Northern Blot analysis of different tissues of laying hens revealed Apo-IV expression mainly in the liver and small intestine, compatible with an involvement of the protein in lipoprotein metabolism. To further investigate the biology of Apo-IV, we raised an antibody against a GST-Apo-IV fusion protein, which allowed the detection of the 17 -kDa protein in rooster plasma, whereas in laying hens it was detectable only in the isolated ≤ 1. 063  g/ml density lipoprotein fraction. Interestingly, estrogen treatment of roosters caused a reduction of Apo-IV in the liver and in the circulation to levels {{similar to those in}} <b>mature</b> <b>hens.</b> Furthermore, the antibody crossreacted with a 17 -kDa protein in quail plasma, indicating conservation of Apo-IV in avian species.

40|$|Infectious {{bronchitis}} virus (IBV) {{causes a}} costly respiratory viral disease of chickens. The role of wild {{birds in the}} epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. We detected diverse coronaviruses by PCR in wildfowl and wading birds in England. Sequence analysis showed some viruses {{to be related to}} IBV. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a group 3 coronavirus, causes a costly viral disease of chickens that is found worldwide (1). It can cause respiratory disease in chickens of all ages and a loss of production and egg quality in <b>mature</b> <b>hens</b> (2). Some strains are nephropathogenic, resulting in renal-induced mortality rates of up to 25 % for susceptible flocks (1). Currently, the poultry industry controls disease through the use of vaccines. However, IBV continuously generates antigenic variants; current vaccines offer no protection against some of them (3). Wild birds may play a role as both reservoirs and long-distance vectors of IBV. Recently, group 3 coronaviruses genetically similar to IBV were detected in healthy galliform and nongalliform birds (4, 5). This finding may suggest that wild birds are able to carry IBV-like viruses asymptomatically. Other studies have detected coronaviruses that are genetically distinct from IBV in wild birds, including graylag geese (Anser anser), rock doves (Columba livia), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), Chinese bulbuls (Pycnonotus sinensis), red-whiskered bulbuls (Pycnonotus jocosus), gray-backed thrushes (Turdus hortulorum), blackbirds (Turdus merula), white-rumped munias (Lonchura striata), and scaly-breasted munias (Lonchura punctulata) (6, 7).

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{egg yolk}} {{precursors}} are synthesized by the liver, secreted {{into the blood}} and transferred into oocytes, to provide nutrients and bioactive molecules for the avian embryo. Three hundred and sixteen distinct proteins {{have been identified in}} egg yolk. These include 37 proteases and antiproteases, which are likely {{to play a role in}} the formation of the yolk (vitellogenesis), as regulators of protein metabolism. We used a transcriptomic approach to define the protease and antiprotease genes specifically expressed in the hen liver in relation to vitellogenesis by comparing sexually mature and pre-laying chickens showing different steroid milieu. Results Using a 20 K chicken oligoarray, a total of 582 genes were shown to be over-expressed in the liver of sexually <b>mature</b> <b>hens</b> (1. 2 to 67 fold-differences). Eight of the top ten over-expressed genes are known components of the egg yolk or perivitelline membrane. This list of 582 genes contains 12 proteases and 3 antiproteases. We found that “uncharacterized protein LOC 419301 /similar to porin” (GeneID: 419301), an antiprotease and “cathepsin E-A-like/similar to nothepsin” (GeneID: 417848), a protease, were the only over-expressed candidates (21 -fold and 35 -fold difference, respectively) that are present in the egg yolk. Additionally, we showed the 4 -fold over-expression of “ovochymase- 2 /similar to oviductin” (GeneID: 769290), a vitelline membrane-specific protease. Conclusions Our approach revealed that three proteases and antiproteases are likely to participate in the formation of the yolk. The role of the other 12 proteases and antiproteases which are over-expressed in our model remains unclear. At least 1 / 3 of proteases and antiproteases identified in egg yolk and vitelline membrane proteomes are expressed similarly in the liver regardless of the maturity of hens, and have been initially identified as regulators of haemostasis and inflammatory events. The lack of effect of sex steroids on these genes expressed in the liver but the products of which are found in the yolk suggests that these may be passively incorporated into the yolk rather than actively produced for that purpose. These results raise the question of the biological significance of egg yolk proteases and antiproteases, and more generally of all minor proteins that have been identified in egg yolk. </p...|$|R

Flaxseed, rich in the essential omega- 3 fatty acid (FA) linolenic acid (LNA; C 18 : 3 n- 3), can be included in laying hen rations for the production of omega- 3 FAenriched shell eggs. In addition to being a rich source of LNA, flaxseed is also the most abundant food source of the plant lignans secoisolariciresinol-diglycoside (SDG) and matairesinol, which serve as precursors for the bacterial synthesis of lignans in mammals. Lignans are known to possess weak estrogenic/antiestrogenic characteristics due to their structural similarity to endogenous estrogens. In the current study, dietary flaxseed (I 5 %) was included in poultry rations to evaluate the influence of flaxseed on the reproductive performance and health of 18 to 28 -week-old laying hens. Serum estradiol concentrations, body, liver, reproductive organ weights, and follicular (Fl to F 5) weights and diameters, were determined during regular sample periods. Changes in reproductive organ characteristics were accompanied by a significant reduction in circulating estradiol in response to 15 % dietary flaxseed, suggesting that flaxseed lignans may influence the avian endocrine environment. Although many studies have confirmed the bacterial synthesis of lignans in mammals, these phytocheniicals have never before been studied in a non-mammalian model. A further study was conducted to determine-nine the capability of the hen cecal microflora to convert SDG and matairesinol to lignan compounds. The production of "avian lignans" was verified in vitro after exposing pullet cecal microflora to the lignan precursors of flaxseed. As the SDG content, and therefore lignan production capability, varies between cultivars, different strains namely Flanders (low SDG/high LNA) and Linola 947 TM (high SDG/low LNA) were evaluated for their influence on laying hen estradiol. Reductions in serum estradiol were not observed as in earlier experiments, indicating that another mechanism may also {{play a role in the}} hormonal modulation in young laying hens. In conclusion, dietary flaxseed may influence the avian endocrine environment and thus laying hen reproductive parameters. This influence may impact production consistency in the egg industry. It is possible that this effect may be circumvented by supplementing diets with a lower level of a flaxseed or by using reproductively <b>mature</b> <b>hens...</b>|$|R

Proteins embedded in the superficial phospholipid monolayer (apolipoproteins) facilitate the receptor mediated binding of lipoproteins, serve as activators of hydrolytic enzymes, and possess direct lipid transfer activities that allow for the lipid exchange of lipids. <b>Mature</b> <b>hens</b> assemble small diameter (range 25 - 35 nm) apolipoprotein-B (Apo-B) containing triacylglycerol-rich very low density lipoproteins (VLDLy) for yolk formation in response to estrogen. Assembly coincides with the expression of a critical protein, apolipoprotein VLDL-II (Apo-VLDL-II), which is aassociated with the ability of VLDLy responsible for its to resistance to intravascular hydrolipolysis, apolipoprotein VLDL-II (Apo-VLDL-II). Hens with non-optimally sized VLDL diameter distributions stop laying eggs indicating, a strong structure/function relationship within this class of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. It has been hypothesized, but not proven, that Apo-VLDL-II, unique to avian species, is also responsible for regulating the size of the yolk-targeted lipoprotein particles. Two complementary techniques were employed in these studies, size exclusion chromatography and dynamic laser light scattering, were used to first separate lipoproteins VLDL into subfractions of different diameters and dynamic laser light scattering (DLLS) to then measure the actual diameters of those subfractionsseparated lipoproteins. The apoprotein content of the subfractions was determined using electrophoretic and immuno-chemical techniques in order to calculate the molar Apo-VLDL-II:Apo-B and determine its relationship to VLDLy diameter. Results showed that in normal laying hens aApo-VLDL-II:aApo-B did not differ significantly among size separated VLDLy whose diameters varied two-fold (48 to 20 nm). Hens fed diets supplemented withcollected after this study showed feeding corn oil and with cholesterol experienced increased plasmathe concentration, cholesterol content, and VLDL diameter of VLDL. Despite this increase, VLDLThe diameter distributions remained of lipoprotein populations within the range associated with VLDLy did, however, remain within the range positively associated with egg production. However, despite maintaining a physiologically optimal diameter distribution for egg production, cholesterolIn addition, feeding with cholesterol altered the relationship between the apolipoproteins associated with VLDLy as the Apo-VLDL-II:molar concentration of Apo-B increased disproportionately to Apo-VLDL-IIsignificantly decreased due to increased Apo-B content of VLDL. In cholesterol supplemented hens, Apo-VLDL-II:Apo-B was greatest The highest molar ratio of Apo-VLDL-II to Apo-B was observed in particles with a diameter within the range most closely associated with continued egg production, i. e. those fitting the functional definition of VLDLy. If Apo-VLDL-II controls VLDLy diameter, its degree of control is not stringent. There was {{a significant difference in the}} Apo-VLDL-II:Apo-B ratio in particles separated from hens fed a standard and lipid supplemented diet...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The kinetics, mineral {{dependency}}, and pH dependency of phytate hydrolysis by preparations {{of chicken}} small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles were determined. Substantial phytate hydrolysis {{occurred over the}} pH range from 5 to 6. 5 with a maximum hydrolysis at pH of 6. Inclusion of 25 mM MgCl 2 in the media doubled the rate of phytate hydrolysis. The brush border was shown to have no nonspecific acid phosphatase activity and excess phytate {{had no effect on}} alkaline phosphatase activity at pH 11. Under optimal conditions of pH 6 plus 25 mM MgCl 2, a kinetic model of a single Michaelis-Menten type of enzymatic activity with a Km of 0. 160 ± 0. 008 mM and a Vmax of 42. 5 ± 1. 0 nmol/mg vesicle protein per min plus a small unsaturable component converged to the data (P < 0. 05). The specific and total activities of intestinal brush border phytase were highest in the duodenum (P < 0. 05) and decreased progressively {{down the length of the}} gut. Intestinal brush border vesicles prepared from broiler chicks and <b>mature</b> laying <b>hens</b> had comparable specific phytase activity. However, the total activity of brush border phytase was 35 % higher in the small intestine of laying hens (P < 0. 05). Intestinal brush border phytase could contribute to phytate-phosphorus digestibility and may be subject to regulation in response to the dietary phosphorus and vitamin D status of the chicken...|$|R
40|$|We have {{monitored}} the differential nuclease sensitivity of defined {{regions of the}} chicken genome in different cells using a method which combines restriction enzyme digestion and blotting to diazobenzyloxymethyl (DBM) -paper (see Ref. 11). By using different specific probes and by scanning the bands on the autoradiograms, {{it is possible to}} compare on the same blot the digestion patterns of similar-sized fragments from different regions of the genome corresponding to "active" and reference "inactive" genes. We have demonstrated the preferential sensitivity to DNaseI and micrococcal nuclease digestion of the ovalbumin gene region in hen oviduct chromatin. The beta-globin gene region (containing both an adult and an embryonic gene) is also preferentially digested by DNaseI in <b>hen</b> <b>mature</b> erythrocyte nuclei, but at a lower rate than the ovalbumin gene region in oviduct. These observations raise the possibility that there may be several types of preferential nuclease sensitivities, all characterized by increased rates of digestion but to different levels, the highest corresponding to the very actively transcribing genes...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} {{characterization}} of local chicken eco-type for functional traits and production system {{was conducted at}} Fogera woreda of the Amhara National Regional state. Fogera woreda {{is one of the}} eight woredas bordering Lake Tana and it is predominantly classified as woinadega ecology while the annual temperature ranges form 22 ºC to 29 ºC. The survey report based on 72 household having chickens revealed that the flock size rage from 1 to 39. The nutritional management practices in the study area were of scavenging (main practice) and supplementary feeding. Wells and tap were the major sources of water. Most of the respondents (59. 7 %) used separate houses constructed exclusively for poultry. The flock management was without separation of sex or age groups and mating was random and nonseasonal. The prices of live chickens were affected by plumage color, comb type and seasonal demands (holidays and fasting seasons). Disease and shortage of supplementary feeds were the two major production barriers of expanding poultry production. Out of the 100 birds studied, the following plumage color pattern was observed in their respective proportions: complete white (Netch) (23 %), complete black (Tikure) (7 %), complete red (key) (39 %), white with black or red tips (Netch Teterma) (4 %), grayish mixture (Gebsima) (5 %), red with white trips (key teterma) (2 %), black with white tips (Tikure teterma) (2 %) white with Brest part golden color (Libework) (8 %), multi color (Anbsema) (2 %), white with red strips (seran) (4 %), and red brownish (Kokima) (4 %). In term of body shape, most of the chicken population observed had a body shape of wedge and a crest (Gutya) head profile. Almost all of the male chicken had spur, while only half of the female chicken had spur. No shank feather was observed both in Male and Female chicken. For <b>mature</b> <b>hens</b> and cocks, the average shank length was 7. 25 cm and 9. 32 cm, respectively. The average body length was 17. 75 cm and 21 cm for female and male, respectively. The ratio of cock to hen was found to be 1 : 3. 21. On the other hand, the effective population size (Ne) and rate of change in inbreeding coefficient (F) per year were 3. 9 and 1. 95, respectively. The monitoring data revealed that average number of eggs laid per clutch per hen was 13. 19, while the average number of eggs incubated was 12. 97, average number of chicks hatched was 10. 23, the average number of chicks weaned was 7. 63, the average of hen’s age was 19. 20 months and average weight of hens was 1. 21 kg. The performance of egg production characters egg weight, yolk color, yolk weight albumin weight, shell weight and shell thickness were, 44. 89 m, 9. 06, 16. 28 gm, 22. 13 gm, 5. 52 gm, and 0. 45 cm, respectively. On the other hand, the dressing percentage was found to be 58. 5 % for male and 49. 38 % for Female. All these findings indicated that the local eco-type, despite the relatively high temperature (it goes up to 30 ºC) and the swampy (wet land) Fogera plain have good potential for egg and meat production. Thus they could be used in other places with similar weather and environmental conditions. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{aflatoxin}} on egg production, fertility, hatchability, and progeny performance were investigated by feeding dietary aflatoxin at dose levels of 0, 5, and 10 mug/g to <b>mature</b> broiler breeder <b>hens</b> for 4 weeks. Sixteen hens {{were used for}} each dietary dose level. Egg production decreased significantly during weeks 3 and 4 after initiation of toxin feeding for hens fed 10 and 5 mum of aflatoxin per g of diet respectively. Whereas fertility was not affected by dietary aflatoxin, hatchability of fertile eggs decreased significantly within week 1 of toxin feeding. Hatchability of fertile eggs collected during week 1 of the treatment period was 95. 1, 68. 9, and 48. 5 % for the control, 5 - and 10 -mug/g groups, respectively. At the dose levels used in this study, no latent effects of the aflatoxin or its metabolites were observed {{on the performance of}} surviving chicks. Six hens from each experimental groups were necropsied {{at the end of the}} 4 -week treatment period. These birds exhibited typical symptoms of aflatoxicosis, including enlarged, fatty and friable livers, and enlarged spleens...|$|R
40|$|Free range {{feeding pattern}} puts the {{chicken in a}} mixture of growth {{materials}} and enteric bacteria excreted by nature, while it is typically unique condition materials and enteric bacteria in commercial caged hens production. Thus, the gastrointestinal microflora in two feeding patterns could be various. However, it remains poorly understood how feeding patterns affect development and composition of layer hens’ intestinal microflora. In this study, the effect of feeding patterns on the bacteria community in layer hens’ gut was investigated using free range and caged feeding form. Samples of whole small intestines and cecal digesta were collected from young hens (8 -weeks) and <b>mature</b> laying <b>hens</b> (30 -weeks). Based on analysis using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing of bacterial 16 S rDNA gene amplicons, the microflora of all intestinal contents were affected by both feeding patterns and age of hens. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria were the main components. Additionally, uncultured environmental samples were found too. There were large differences between young hens and adult laying hens, the latter had more Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and bacterial community is more abundant in 30 -weeks laying hens of all six phyla than 8 -weeks young hens of only two phyla. In addition, the differences were also observed between free range and caged hens. Free range hens had richer Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Most of strains found were detected more abundant in small intestines than in cecum. Also the selected Lactic acid bacteria from hens gut were applied in feed and they had beneficial effects on growth performance and jejunal villus growth of young broilers. This study suggested that feeding patterns have an importance effect on the microflora composition of hens, which may impact the host nutritional status and intestinal health...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Six {{branched}} {{and straight}} chain secondary or tertiary amines with chain lengths of 12 to 18 carbons and two azasteroids, 25 -aza- 5 a-cholestane and 25 -azacoprostane, were fed to <b>mature</b> White Leghorn <b>hens,</b> and their effectiveness was compared with 20, 25 -diazacholesterol dihydrochloride (SC- 12937), an azasteroid known to lower egg cholesterol. Feed consumption, body weight, egg production, egg and plasma cholesterol and desmosterol, and plasma total lipid were measured. The 6 amines were fed at 200 ppm, {{and only the}} C l 2 branched chain amine N,N, 3, 7,ll-pen-tamethyldodecanamine reduced plasma and egg cholesterol with a concomitant increase in des-mosterol. After 4 weeks, plasma desmosterol was 0, 13, 60, and 75 % of total sterol for control, 200 ppm C,j branched chain amine, 5 ppm diazacholesterol, and 5 ppm azacholestane, respectively. Egg production was severely reduced to 6 and 0 % by feeding 5 ppm azacholestane for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, and to 69 and 36 % by feeding 5 ppm diazacholesterol. After 4 weeks egg cholesterol was 79 and 36 % of the total sterol for the 200 ppm C 12 branched chain amine and 5 ppm diazacholesterol, respectively. Concomitant increases in desmosterol accompanied all re-ductions in cholesterol...|$|R
40|$|In vivo and {{in vitro}} bile pigment {{metabolism}} was studied in embryos, chicks, and <b>mature</b> White Leghorn <b>hens.</b> Biliverdin and bilirubin pigments {{were present in}} bile of embryos from the earliest stage examined (14 d). Bilirubin accounted for 2. 5 - 11. 5 % of total bile pigments, with the higher percentages in the early embryo. Biliverdin was exclusively in unesterified form. In contrast, bilirubin was almost entirely (> 98 %) in esterified form. Glucosides consistently predominated over glucuronides and xylosides (6 : 3 : 1). In serum, bilirubin and biliverdin were undetectable at all embryonic stages and after hatching. Bilirubin UDP-glycosyltransferase activities with UDP-glucuronic acid, UDP-glucose, and UDP-xylose were detectable in chick embryo liver and averaged 67, 72, and 102 %, respectively, of the corresponding adult mean values, without significant change throughout development. We conclude that multiple bilirubin esterification systems mature early in the avian embryo. This is {{in marked contrast to}} the development of bilirubin metabolism in the mammalian fetus in which detoxication of this potentially toxic pigment is achieved by placental clearance, and bilirubin esterification matures only after delivery. These contrasting developmental patterns are consistent with an adaptive response to the different requirements in the avian embryo and mammalian fetus for self-protective detoxification of unconjugated bilirubin. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper treats {{about the}} impact fuels from biomass wastes and coal {{combustion}} on a small boiler operation and the emission of pollutants in this process. Tests were performed in laboratory conditions on a water boiler with retort furnace and the capacity of 10 kW. Fuels from sewage sludge and agriculture wastes (PBZ fuel) and a blend of coal with laying <b>hens</b> <b>mature</b> (CLHM) were taken into account. The results in emission changes of NOx, CO 2, CO and SO 2 and operating parameters of the tested boiler during combustion were investigated. The obtained results were compared with corresponding results of flame coal (GFC). Combustion of the PBZ fuel {{turned out to be}} a stable process in the tested boiler but the thermal output has decreased in about 30 % compared to coal combustion, while CO and NOx emission has increased. Similar effect was observed when 15 % of the poultry litter was added to the coal. In this case thermal output has also decreased (in about 20 %) and increase of CO and NOx emission was observed. As a conclusion, it can be stated that more effective control system with an adaptive air regulation and a modified heat exchanger could be useful in order to achieve the nominal power of the tested boiler...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{salmonellosis}} {{has been on}} the rise as a food related illness worldwide. Causing over 24 % of all non-typhoidal Salmonellosis cases, SE is the most frequently isolated serovar of Salmonella. Increased isolation of SE from eggs has paralleled {{an increase in the number}} of transovarian infections associated with laying hens in the poultry industry. This route of infection is a fairly new line of study when compared to the more traditional path where SE originates from fecal contamination through the shell. Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) is another concern for the egg industry. ST has caused 23. 5 % of all non-typhoidal salmonellosis cases. Understanding these two egg pathogens requires an in depth look at the mechanisms by which an egg may support infection and bacterial growth. Eggs were inoculated with both SE and ST onto the vitelline membrane and incubated for 24 hours. It was hoped that by gathering samples from the interior of the egg membrane, the albumen of the egg, and the membrane itself, some clarification as to when Salmonella is allowed to grow within the egg could be gathered. Albumen and membrane were found to be more hospitable environments to bacterial growth with increased storage times. In order to better understand the movement of bacteria into pre-ovulatory tissues, samples were gathered from <b>mature</b> laying <b>hens.</b> Follicular tissues were separated into divisions based on maturity, and bacteria were added to an in vitro cell culture broth containing the follicles. The point of this experiment was to determine if either species of Salmonella preferentially moved into follicles of different maturity when inoculated in vitro. A third experiment looked into the role of developmental stages of the vitelline membrane in exclusion of bacteria from the nutrient rich yolk. Tissues were gathered in the method described above. The follicular sack was removed from half of these samples and left intact for the other half. Another treatment group included was the yolks of eggs which had been laid by the same flock of birds. Results showed that follicles with intact follicular sacks were more susceptible to bacterial colonization than other treatment groups...|$|R
