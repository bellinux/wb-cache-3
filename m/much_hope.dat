25|$|The early jet fighters, {{such as the}} F-80 Shooting Star and F-84 Thunderjet, lacked {{all-weather}} {{capability and}} were deemed useless for air defense purposes. <b>Much</b> <b>hope</b> was placed on two jet-powered interceptors, the XP-87 Blackhawk and the XP-89 Scorpion. (Designations changed to XF-87 and XF-89.) They, in turn, also proved to be inadequate: the XF-87 was cancelled and the Scorpion underwent extensive redesign.|$|E
25|$|The rumours were false about Águila - he {{was only}} four miles from the fort, hoping to relieve the {{defenders}} {{the next day and}} take the besiegers by surprise.

Using it, Maldonado and Marcos resumed their dialog, and made agreements {{in accordance with the}} law to start the formal peace talks. Marcos convinced the Zapatista movement to put aside their arms and begin the talks to reach a peace agreement.|$|E
25|$|After a year hiatus, the Greys {{returned}} with a short bench and started the rebuilding process. Not <b>much</b> <b>hope</b> of a competitive season was ever tossed Owen Sound's way. But what makes the return a success isn't the season record—it {{was the lack of}} a mass exodus of players at the Christmas Break. Players bought into the rebuilding process and stuck it out which earned a tremendous amount of respect from around the league and left the Greys in a good position with a solid nucleus to build on for next season.|$|E
25|$|In July Spinola himself {{made another}} attempt to relieve Sluis under orders from the Archduke saying that Spain {{could not afford to}} lose another Flemish port. On the 28th he encamped between Bruges and Damme, with 10,000 men and 600 wagons laden with {{supplies}} and ammunition. He thence advanced passing Ardenburg towards the quarters of Van der Node. His objective was to reach the town by a wide causeway which was still open. Maurice however saw the plan and set a large force to work, and in forty-eight hours he had dug a trench across, which effectually stopped the passage. He then mounted several guns between the quarters of Van der Node and Count William, and opened a heavy and continuous fire on the camp of Spinola. By now hunger and infectious diseases took their toll on the civilians and soldiers alike in Sluis, but eventually news of the Spanish relief force was on the way and <b>much</b> <b>hope</b> was somewhat restored.|$|E

25|$|The Italian Grand Prix at the Monza Autodrome near Milan {{sealed the}} end of two things: Gerhard Berger's terrible season (he scored a second place on both the grid and in the race) and Prost's {{relationship}} with McLaren. Having become progressively distanced from the team due to his conflict with Senna, he announced his switch to Ferrari for 1990, and after inheriting the race win when Senna retired from the lead late on, he proceeded to give the trophy he had won to the tifosi. McLaren boss Ron Dennis' usual composure was shattered and he hurled his trophy at his driver's feet, storming off (Dennis was unhappy with Prost giving the trophy to the tifosi as contractually all trophies won were {{the property of the}} team). Prost later said it was an unsatisfactory win and that he did not hold out <b>much</b> <b>hope</b> for the championship despite his points lead as he felt Honda were clearly favouring Senna. Boutsen inherited third for Williams. The final points went to Patrese, who finished fourth, followed by Brit Martin Brundle for Brabham and Jean Alesi in the Tyrrell.|$|E

500|$|President Quezon officially conferred {{the title}} of field marshal on MacArthur in a {{ceremony}} at Malacañan Palace on 24 August 1936, and presented him with a gold baton and a unique uniform. The Philippine Army was formed from conscription. Training was conducted by a regular cadre, and the Philippine Military Academy was created {{along the lines of}} West Point to train officers. MacArthur and Eisenhower found that few of the training camps had been constructed and the first group of 20,000 trainees did not report until early 1937. Equipment and weapons were [...] "more or less obsolete" [...] American cast offs, and the budget of six million was completely inadequate. MacArthur's requests for equipment fell on deaf ears, although MacArthur and his naval advisor, Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff, persuaded the Navy to initiate the development of the PT boat. <b>Much</b> <b>hope</b> was placed in the Philippine Army Air Corps, but the first squadron was not organized until 1939.|$|E

Digital Spy named the moment [...] "the bombshell of all bombshells".

Lindsay believed that in the weeks following the scene, viewers would [...] "laugh at Babe and Abi, cry for them, feel for them, root for them and scream furiously at them while throwing plates at [...] televisions." [...] Fitzgerald enjoyed Babe and Abi's friendship and said she [...] "loved" [...] working with Badland, while Badland also liked working with Fitzgerald, saying that she thought Babe and Abi had [...] "genuinely connected" [...] but their friendship was [...] "inevitably soured with all the shenanigans". Lindsay praised the show for [...] "recognising the qualities this insane partnership has" [...] and suggested the portmanteau [...] "Babi" [...] for their pairing.

The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built <b>much</b> <b>hope,</b> was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [...] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth." ...|$|E
