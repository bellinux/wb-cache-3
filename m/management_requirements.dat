This leads to a portable <b>requirements</b> <b>management</b> meta-model {{which can be used}} with various system modeling languages. The meta-model also focuses on temporal aspects of <b>requirements</b> <b>management</b> during development process, such as states of requirements and changing requirements. Hence, the goal is to capture the whole <b>requirements</b> <b>management</b> process, not just the concepts needed for requirements specification.

2500|$|Photoluminescent fire {{extinguisher}} signs {{are made with}} nontoxic photoluminescent phosphor that absorbs ambient light and releases it slowly in dark conditions—the sign [...] "glows in the dark". Such signs are independent of an external power supply, and so offer a low-cost, reliable means of indicating the position of emergency equipment in dark or smoky conditions. The luminance performance for life safety appliance location signs should {{meet the requirements of}} International Standard ISO 17398 so that the sign is not only excited at very low ambient light levels (25 lux), but also has effective luminance intensity and longevity, making the life-safety message conspicuous in the event of power failure, or if smoke obscures emergency ceiling lights.

40|$|Communication on {{a network}} can be {{described}} by codes specifying {{the behavior of the}} network nodes s i. e the relationships between the signals on each node's incoming and outgoing links. Link failure recovery may require some of these relationships to change. The network management information needed to effect the appropriate changes in network behavior for recovery can be quantified by the number of different codes needed. In this paper, we focus on linear codes for delay-free acyclic networks, with a single receiver node and one or more source nodes. We consider two formulations for quantifying network management. The first is a centralized formulation where network behavior is described by an overall code determining the behavior of every node s and the <b>management</b> <b>requirement</b> is taken as the log of the number of such codes that the network may switch among. For this formulation s we give tight upper and lower bounds on network management for receiver-based and network-wide recovery from all single link failures, assuming they are recoverable. The second is a node-based formu- lation where the <b>management</b> <b>requirement</b> is taken as the sum over all nodes of the log of the number of different behaviors for each node. We show that the minimum node-based <b>management</b> <b>requirement</b> for terminal link failures and the no-failure scenario is achieved with receiver-based schemes...|$|R
