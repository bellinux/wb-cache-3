40|$|Paper is a complex, disordered porous media. The {{complexity}} {{makes it}} difficult to obtain more than empirical knowledge of the relationship between papermaking variables and the resulting paper structural properties. It is known that the alteration of the paper structure is decisive for many paper properties, but the appropriate tools for visualising and assessing the changes to the paper structure after varying physical treatments of the paper have until recently not been available. Scanning electron microscope in backscatter mode (SEM-BEI) and X-ray microtomography allows acquisition of respectively cross-sectional and 3 D images of the detailed paper structure with sufficient contrast and resolution to clearly discern the structural constituents. The access to detailed images of the paper structure allows quantification of the changes made to the detailed paper structure through application of suitable image analysis routines. The microscopy techniques combined with image analysis thus provide the tools needed to improve the knowledge of how various papermaking variables may improve the paper properties through alteration of the paper structure. Improvement of the knowledge of the structural mechanisms governing the paper properties may help to give a more knowledge based operation of the paper machines and may be applied for process and product optimization. This thesis work has considered different aspects of how the physics governing the SEM-BEI technique, image acquisition and sample preparation may affect the quality of the cross-sectional images of the paper structure with regard to the subsequent image analysis. The effect of the applied filtering and segmentation routines to obtain the binary representation needed for image analysis are also considered. It was found that the applied methodology yielded realistic binary cross-sectional representations of the paper structure and thus representative structural assessments. However, to obtain assessments that are representative for the paper grade and not only the small cross section, at least 15 independent cross-sectional images were needed. Then umber of necessary replicates varied somewhat depending on the structural characteristics. This study involved improvement of existing image analysis techniques. The main contribution from this work in this aspect is the application of the rolling ball algorithm for an objective surface definition of the physically small and often uneven paper cross sections. The objective surface definition enables the division of the structure into locally uniformly thick layers, for which the material distribution in the z-direction of the paper can be determined. The material distributions that may be determined include solid/void fractions, fillers and fines content. The improved image analysis routines also include measurement of local thickness, density and basis weight, pore chords and specific surface area. The practical application of the SEM technique for obtaining new knowledge of papermaking variables: paper structure: paper properties relationships included assessment of the pore geometry and the material distribution in the z-direction. The z-directional material distribution was determined in order to assess the effect of temperature gradient calendering on a SC-paper grade. The results obtained for the z-directional material distributions combined with surface topography techniques revealed that the temperature gradient effect was concentrated to the very few outermost micrometers of the paper structure. The pore geometry was assessed by both the 2 D and 3 D techniques. The determined pore chord distributions followed the theoretically derived pore height distribution of Dodson for the z-direction. The pore chord distribution for any spatial direction appeared to follow a log-normal distribution, when including all pore chord sizes to allow a “continuous” distribution. The mean and standard deviation were proven to be proportional, as earlier observed from physical pore size measurements and theoretical deductions. The width of the pore chord distributions for the different spatial directions changed with the structural anisotropy. The wider the pore height distribution, the more different are the pore chord mean and standard deviation. Most of the information obtained for the pore geometry from assessment of pore chords can be summarized in the equivalent pore representation. The ellipsoid shape of the equivalent pore, constructed as a warped surface of the mean pore chords for all spatial directions, was confirmed from the assessments of 3 D images of three different paper grades having distinctly different structural properties. The ellipsoid shape was also found for the pore chord standard deviation. Additionally, {{it was found that the}} ellipsoid constructed for the solid phase had the same shape as for the porous phase and their relative size was proportional to the solid fraction of the assessed paper structure. The equivalent pore ellipsoid thus contain all information about the pore/fibre chord distributions in all spatial directions in addition to the structural anisotropy. The studies of the pore geometry prove that the solid fraction and the structural anisotropy are the major determinants for the pore geometry. The results reveal that there is clear differences between the pore size distribution determined by image analysis and physical assessments like mercury porosimetry, which is affected by narrow pore necks limiting the intrusion from the surfaces. This thesis work have applied three different applications of X-ray microtomography. The three different applications include both phase contrast and absorption mode contrasting for high resolution synchrotron source X-ray microtomography and low resolution X-ray microtomography provided by a stationary source commercial scanner. The experiences from this work have proven that the synchrotron source X-ray microtomography can be applied successfully to obtain high quality digital representations of the 3 D paper structure with sufficient contrast and resolution to detect and quantify the details of the fibre network. The current technology at the applied beam lines at the ESRF, France, allows spatial resolution down to approximately 1 µm. This resolution is sufficient for obtaining realistic structural assessments that are suited for determining how the paper structure is affected by papermaking variables and itself influences the paper properties. The high resolution also provides insight into the detailed paper characteristics from visualization of the 3 D paper structure. The resolution provided by the stationary X-ray source is not sufficient to preserve the fibre network topology. However, the signal is of sufficient quality to make comparative structural assessments possible, although the numerical results from the structural assessments are not physically reasonable. This thesis work have considered different aspects of how the working principles, image acquisition, sample preparation, sample mounting and volume reconstruction of the three applied X-ray microtomography techniques may affect the quality of the 3 D images of the paper structure with regard to the subsequent image analysis. It was found that the sample mounting for the high resolution absorption mode images was clearly affecting the digital representation of the paper structure. An alternative sample mounting, avoiding the <b>melt</b> <b>glue</b> penetrating into the paper structure, is recommended for future application of X-ray microtomography. However, it must be emphasized that restricting sample movement during the image acquisition is of outmost importance to obtain 3 Dimages with a minimal content of noise. The applied routines for image filtering and segmentation to obtain binary representations are presented and the quality of the resulting binary structures are evaluated. The results prove that the applied image processing preserves most of the information provided by the greyscale images. However, the applied routines are not optimised. Exploiting more of the three-dimensional connectivity in the images and applying edge preserving filtering techniques may improve the image processing for future experiments. The image processing of the phase contrast images is difficult, semi-automatic, laborious and computationally demanding due to the relatively low contrast and the contrasting technique detects only the phase borders. The image processing of the absorption mode images is considerably more straightforward. The quality of the binary absorption mode images is almost as good as the binary phase contrast images, despite the lower resolution. The absorption mode is therefore recommended for the future application of high resolution X-ray microtomography. Additional benefits of the absorption mode imaging is the ability to discern mineral particles and coating and that it has no principal problems in acquiring images of high density paper grades. A benefit only provided by the phase contrast technique is that it provides sufficient contrast between wood fibres and water to acquire 3 D images of soaked paper samples. This study has applied and looked into the details of many image analysis routines and transport simulations to determine the characteristics of the imaged paper structures. Most of these routines have already been applied to low resolution 3 D images of paper or to 3 D images of geological samples. The main contribution from this study regarding the analysis of the structure is thus modification of some of the image analysis routines to include the surface layers after defining the surface using the rolling ball algorithm. The practical application of the X-ray microtomography technique showed that calendering of a newsprint-like paper grade had a dominating effect on the paper structure compared to addition of reinforcement pulp, addition of retention aid and alteration of the head box consistency. The calendering resulted in a denser sheet having smaller pores and a higher resistance against transport through the porous phase, especially for the z-directional flow. The analysis of the applied factorial design yielded indicative results for the other papermaking variables. The few significant effects revealed that the addition of reinforcement fibres yielded slightly larger average pores and the addition of retention aid resulted in a slightly more complex structure. The alteration of the head box consistency seemed to have an insignificant effect on the small paper volumes. Additionally, the assessments showed that the standard deviation for the assessed structural characteristics were less than ± 10 % of the mean value. The mean values for the determined transport properties showed a higher standard deviation. However, the size of the 3 D digital paper volumes render division of the volumes into sufficiently large sub volumes to maintain representative scales possible. Assessment of the transport properties of a number of sub volumes enabled a determination of the transport property: porosity relationship instead of a single mean value. In this way more information was extracted from the volume and the results were less affected by normal variation. The results from the practical study of X-ray microtomography confirm the hypothesis that the density/solid fraction of the paper structure is a major determinant of the paper properties. An important part of this study has been to consider which is the right technique of the 2 D and 3 D methods for various structural characterization applications. There is a clear differentiation between the practical applications of the techniques. The SEM technique is the preferred technique for more repetitive and routine type assessments, for characterizations where the 3 D extension of the objects are not of crucial interest or for assessments where the nature of fines and fibrils are of high importance. The X-ray microtomography is a natural choice for more complex structural assessments where the extension of the fibres and pores are of high interest, as for e. g. assessment of transport properties. The 3 D extension of the structure may also be needed to obtain a better knowledge of how the paper structure influences the bulk paper performance properties than provided by the cross-sectional approach. X-ray microtomography is thus a powerful research tool that can provide information which is difficult or impossible to access applying other methods. However, the technique has its clear limitations when it comes to availability, representativity and resolution. It is also important keep in mind that the technique will not in the near future be an everyday technique that many scientists will have access to. This study have helped establishing the SEM-BEI and X-ray microtomography microscopy combined with image analysis for paper structure characterisation. The tools provide many possible applications for the paper researchers that see the available possibilities. However, the results from application of the techniques for determining relationships between papermaking variables and paper structure characteristics, and possible relationships between structural characteristics and paper properties, are never better than the applied experimental scheme. Future application of the techniques for structural characterisation will hopefully add to the knowledge of the detailed properties of the paper material and thus assist in product and process optimization. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The laminates and adhesives used are generally cheaper to manufacture than cold roll laminates, often as much as half the cost depending on the comparison made. As the materials are non-adhesive until exposed to heat, they are much easier to handle. The glue is solid at room temperature, so lamination of this type is less likely to shift or warp after its application than pressure activated laminates, which rely on a highly viscous, adhesive fluid.|$|R

40|$|Studies of the {{internal}} structure of asteroids, which are crucial for understanding their impact history and for hazard mitigation, {{appear to be in}} conflict for the S-type asteroids, Eros, Gaspra, and Ida. Spacecraft images and geophysical data show that they are fractured, coherent bodies, whereas models of catastrophic asteroidal impacts, family and satellite formation, and studies of asteroid spin rates, and other diverse properties of asteroids and planetary craters suggest that such asteroids are gravitationally bound aggregates of rubble. These conflicting views may be reconciled if 10 – 50 km S-type asteroids formed as rubble piles, but were later consolidated into coherent bodies. Many meteorites are breccias that testify to a long history of impact fragmentation and consolidation by alteration, metamorphism, igneous and impact processes. Ordinary chondrites, which are the best analogs for S asteroids, are commonly breccias. Some may have formed in cratering events, but many appear to have formed during disruption and reaccretion of their parent asteroids. Some breccias were lithified during metamorphism, and a few were lithified by injected impact melt, but most are regolith and fragmental breccias that were lithified by mild or moderate shock, like their lunar analogs. Shock experiments show that porous chondritic powders can be consolidated during mild shock by small amounts of silicate <b>melt</b> that <b>glues</b> grains together, and by friction and pressure welding of silicate and metallic Fe,Ni grains.

40|$|Electrical {{interfaces}} {{with the}} nervous system are critical for enabling neurally-controlled prostheses and for creating better therapies for neurological disorders. Microelectrodes that penetrate into brain tissue to record extracellular electrical activity are one such neural interface technology known for their unparalleled spatial and temporal signal resolution. However, a major challenge with reliable chronic recording with such interfaces is tissue reaction, wherein a sheath of glial cells encapsulates the neural probe, electrically insulating the probe from the surrounding neurons. This work presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of a thin polymer probe whose body can be deflected and locked prior to insertion via a glue, storing mechanical energy in the device. After inserting into the brain {{and waiting for the}} initial glial sheath to form, the device can be deployed by <b>melting</b> the <b>glue,</b> causing the recording tip of the device to penetrate into fresh tissue. It is hypothesized that small tip dimensions (10 - 20 [mu]m) should prevent the formation of an additional glial sheath post-deployment and thus enable chronic recording. Four successive generations of devices were fabricated, characterized in benchtop tests, and subsequently tested in the rat model and in the optogenetic Thyl-ChR 2 -YFP mouse model. The electrical and mechanical functionality of the probe was confirmed under acute in vivo conditions in the medial prefrontal cortex of optogenetic Thyl-ChR 2 -YFP mice. Neural activity was successfully recorded from the probe immediately after insertion using laser stimulation of the mouse brain. Applying saline to the water-soluble glue caused the probe to deploy and neural activity was successfully recorded post-deployment. These results demonstrate the first in vivo deployment and electrical recordings from a reconfigurable neural probe with small dimensions (< 20 [mu]m) and hold promise for the creation of chronic recording neural interfaces. by Aalap Dighe.

60|$|The pocket {{apparatus}} {{is similar}} to one originally made and used by Sir William J. Herschel (see Plate 3, Fig. 4, in which the roller and its bearings are drawn {{of the same size}} as those I use). A small cylinder of hard wood, or of brass tube, say 1-3/4 inch long, and 1/2 or 3/4 inch in diameter, has a pin firmly driven into each end to serve as an axle. A piece of tightly-fitting india-rubber tubing is drawn over the cylinder. The cylinder, thus coated with a soft smooth compressible material, turns on its axle in two brackets, each secured by screws, as shown in Plate 2, Fig. 4, to a board (say 6 × 2-1/2 × 1/4 inch) that serves as handle. This makes a very fair and durable roller; it can be used in the heat and damp of the tropics, and is none the worse for a wetting, but {{it is by no means}} so good for delicate work as a cylinder covered with roller composition. These are not at all difficult to make; I have cast them for myself. The mould is a piece of brass tube, polished inside. A thick disc, with a central hole for the lower pin of the cylinder, fits smoothly into the lower end of the mould, and a ring with a thin bar across it, fits over the other end, the upper pin of the cylinder entering a hole in the middle of the bar; thus the cylinder is firmly held in the right position. After slightly oiling the inside of the mould, warming it, inserting the disc and cylinder, and fitting on the ring, the melted composition is poured in on either side of the bar. As it contracts on cooling, rather more must be poured in than at first appears necessary. Finally the roller is pushed out of the mould by a wooden ramrod, applied to the bottom of the disc. The composition must be <b>melted</b> like <b>glue,</b> in a vessel surrounded by hot water, which should never be allowed to boil; otherwise it will be spoilt. Harrild's best composition is more than twice the cost of that ordinarily used, and is expensive for large rollers, but for these miniature ones the cost is unimportant.

Ash components determined the ash thermodynamic behaviour at high temperature, and each component had different effects.

Both the bed ash and fly ash, collected from an industrial PFBC plant, consisted of limestone/lime particles with different extent of sulphation, and coal ash particles.

Tom, hears this, and, with the other cats, raid the feast, trapping the toys (the Nutcracker March plays through this scene). Jerry, Paulie, and Nelly try to stop this, but are stuffed into a can and shot out of a cannon, ending up worlds away (the Battle Scene play through this scene). Tom as the Captain of the Cat Guards traps the Ballerina in a cage, then brings her to the Cat King, who asks her to dance for him but is shot down. The Cat King tells the Ballerina there is nothing she can do about it. Later on, Tom is called to gather other cats and stop Jerry, and sing a song (Mother Giongne with their own lyrics / The Old Lady plays through this scene) as they march away from the castle. Tuffy gives the Ballerina a string attached to a ring of keys. He then goes to warn Jerry and stop the cats. Meanwhile, Jerry, Paulie, and Nelly decide to follow a very bright star to a man called the Toy Maker. They stop in front of a frozen river (the Journey Through The Snow plays through this scene). All make it safely, except Jerry who falls from a frozen waterfall and through the ice, becomes tangled in a weed and seemingly drowns. He is revived and freed by the magic, and is pulled up by Nelly and Paulie. This makes Paulie unravel by <b>melting</b> the <b>glue</b> that keeps him together. Tuffy gets to Tom, and dresses up as an angel, with a white dress, wings, a halo and a harp, and a devil, with horns, a cape, a trident and a tail, to convince him not to harm Jerry. His cover is blown when he has his dress, wings, tail and trident at the same time, and ends up sticking the trident in Tom's eye, causing the tower of cats to fall off of a cliff (Tom screams the Wilhelm Scream). Tuffy continues on to Jerry, warning him of the cats. Tom and his friends, disguised as Christmas trees, surround Jerry, but Tom gets attacked by squirrels, and shredded in a tree shredder (Toy Flutes plays through this scene). The cats attack, but the heroes escape, inside a tree. The cats beat up Tom by mistake. [...] The heroes then come to a hill, where Paulie's head is sent flying into another hole. They go into the hole, only to find a fiery world with lava pits and dragons (the Arabian Dance plays through this scene). A flame fairy gives Paulie his head back. A dragon wakes up, but is hypnotised by Jerry into lifting them out of the pit.|$|R
