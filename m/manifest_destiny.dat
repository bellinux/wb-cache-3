5|$|In August 1844, in {{the midst}} of the campaign, Tyler withdrew from the race. The Democratic Party was by then {{unequivocally}} committed to Texas annexation, and Tyler, assured by Polk's envoys that as President he would effect Texas annexation, urged his supporters to vote Democratic. Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in the November election. The victorious Democrats were poised to acquire Texas under President-elect Polk's doctrine of <b>Manifest</b> <b>Destiny,</b> rather than on the pro-slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun.|$|E
5|$|In response, Tyler, already {{ejected from}} the Whig party, quickly began to {{organize}} a third party in hopes of inducing the Democrats to embrace a pro-expansionist platform. By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance {{from a number of}} northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of <b>Manifest</b> <b>Destiny,</b> James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.|$|E

The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations.

Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to <b>manifest</b> <b>destiny,</b> the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West.

5|$|The Republic of Texas {{separated}} from Mexico in 1836; Tyler, {{a firm believer}} in <b>manifest</b> <b>destiny,</b> saw its annexation as providing an economic advantage to the United States, and worked diligently to make it happen. He initially sought election to a full term as president, but after failing to gain the support of either Whigs or Democrats, he withdrew in support of Democrat James K. Polk, who favored annexation. Polk won the election, and Tyler signed a bill to annex Texas three days before leaving office. Under Polk, the process was completed. After the American Civil War began in 1861, Tyler won election to the Confederate House of Representatives shortly before his death. Although some have praised Tyler's political resolve, his presidency is generally held in low regard by historians. He is considered an obscure president, with little presence in American cultural memory.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they were}} illegal, {{filibustering}} {{operations in the}} late 1840s and early 1850s were romanticized in the United States. The Democratic Party's national platform included a plank that specifically endorsed William Walker's filibustering in Nicaragua. Wealthy American expansionists financed dozens of expeditions, usually based out of New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco. The primary target of <b>manifest</b> <b>destiny's</b> filibusters was Latin America but there were isolated incidents elsewhere. Mexico was a favorite target of organizations devoted to filibustering, like the Knights of the Golden Circle. William Walker got his start as a filibuster in an ill-advised attempt to separate the Mexican states Sonora and Baja California.

40|$|AbstractFreedom's Journal and El Clamor Público: African Americanand Mexican American Cultural Fronts in Nineteenth-Century NewsprintbyArturo Romero Nunez Doctor of Philosophy in EnglishUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Marcial González, ChairBoth Freedom's Journal and El Clamor Público {{represent}} nineteenth-century milestones {{because they}} historically demarcate the inception and terminal points of <b>Manifest</b> <b>Destiny's</b> progress across the continental United States. As such, this project chronicles the cumulative effects of Anglo-based racism on African and Mexican American communities [...] {{a fact that}} remained not only consistent but also remarkably comparable in these two cases, even though each journal is separated by three thousand miles, twenty-six years, and a different language. Such similarities speak to the numerous and interconnected nineteenth-century practices that collectively undermined the agency and survivability of communities of color, including slavery, Anglo-based free labor, Southern and Southwestern lynching, and filibustering expeditions. Yet Freedom's Journal and El Clamor Público are more than mere reflexive reactions to Anglo-based bigotry; they are historical manuscripts that reflect extraordinary self-determination, and this was revealed within the content of each journal through their coverage of militancy, assimilation-based strategies, and an ever-present insistence on authorial autonomy. Both journals represent what scholars today regard as the respective historic origins for African and Mexican American political and cultural consciousness, and are likewise surprisingly radical [...] even by today's standards. By ceaselessly drawing attention to the United States Constitution's guaranteed civil rights, Freedom's Journal and El Clamor Público founded their radicalness on the instinctive supposition that such liberties extended equally and naturally to persons of color. It was this journalistic daring that mostly distinguishes Freedom's Journal and El Clamor Público as not only ahead of their time, but also as relevant texts for the present [...] as contemporary reminders of how their struggle for civil rights remain as unresolved today as they did then...|$|R

40|$|<b>Manifesting</b> <b>Destiny</b> {{tells the}} story of the Narciso López's {{filibustering}} attempts in Cuba (18481851) set against the backdrop of long-term American interest in the island and discusses the fluid economic and social contexts in early nineteenth century Cuba and the United States. The study focuses on the importance given Cuba by the collective American consciousness and highlights the various arguments made for the necessity and permissibility of annexation of the island. Beyond just a sectional Southern concern as traditionally posited by many analysts of the period, the annexation of Cuba was an abiding and obsessive national American concern that reflected deeply-held beliefs about the nature and magnanimity of American democracy as well as the nation's destinarian exceptionalism. Incorporation of Cuba and Cubans, set apart in the American imagination from the rest of South America and the Caribbean, promised a conservative transfer of power and fulfillment of the reserved revolution that many believed was the hallmark of American exceptionalism. Americans took a paternalistic view of the Cuban people - reduced to political dependence by the Spanish - and offered political and moral guidance to the island's population. The Northern and Southern American business class along with elite Cuban creoles saw in their annexation plans a means to strengthen the longstanding and lucrative economic ties between the two societies. The presence of an aggressive British abolitionary influence in the Caribbean coupled with attendant fears of racialized revolution in Cuba energized the annexation movement and encouraged filibustering activities as expedient alternatives to lethargic official negotiations for purchase of the island. Despite filibustering's seemingly chaotic planning and destabilizing repercussions, those intellectually and economically guiding the effort saw in their efforts an easily controllable leader in Narciso López, a willing and receptive Cuban population, and an agreeable American public bolstered by a robust business class' encouragement. All of these attributes augured well for a quick, limited, and manageable annexation with no disruption to either Cuba's slavery system or the domestic society built upon it. This study explores these themes and their implications by examining the literary, economic, and political landscapes of both the United States and Cuba contained within the pages of diplomatic and popular literary sources of the period. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R

25|$|<b>Manifest</b> <b>Destiny</b> was {{the idea}} that it was God’s will for the United States to expand because it is Protestant, democratic, and white.

O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. <b>Manifest</b> <b>destiny</b> soon became an important element of American political rhetoric. It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of <b>manifest</b> <b>destiny</b> to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state.
