Primroses are next, both in beauty and abundance; and they are accompanied by yellow cowslips, three feet high, purple polyanthus, and pink large-flowered dwarf kinds nestling in the rocks, and an exquisitely beautiful blue miniature species, whose blossoms sparkle like sapphires on the turf. Gentians begin to unfold their deep azure bells, aconites to rear their tall blue spikes, and fritillaries and Meconopsis burst into flower. On the black rocks the gigantic rhubarb forms pale pyramidal towers a yard high, of inflated reflexed bracts, that conceal the flowers, and over-lapping one another like tiles, {{protect them from the}} wind and rain: a whorl of broad green leaves edged with red spreads on the ground {{at the base of the}} plant, contrasting in colour with the transparent bracts, which are yellow, margined with pink. This is the handsomest herbaceous plant in Sikkim: it is called [...] "Tchuka," [...] and the acid stems are eaten both raw and boiled; they are hollow and full of pure water: the root resembles that of the <b>medicinal</b> <b>rhubarb,</b> but it is spongy and inert; it attains a length of four feet, and grows as thick as the arm. The dried leaves afford a substitute for tobacco; a smaller kind of rhubarb is however more commonly used in Tibet for this purpose; it is called [...] "Chula." ...|$|E

5000|$|The genus is {{represented}} by about 60 extant species. Among species found in the wild, those most commonly used in cooking are the garden rhubarb (R. rhabarbarum) and the so-called false rhubarb (R. rhaponticum), which is actually a true rhubarb. [...] The many varieties of cultivated rhubarb more usually grown for eating are recognised as Rheum x hybridum in the Royal Horticultural Society's list of recognised plant names. The drug rheum is prepared from the rhizomes and roots of another species, R. officinale or <b>medicinal</b> <b>rhubarb.</b> This species is also native to Asia, as is the turkey rhubarb (R. palmatum). Another species, the Sikkim rhubarb (R. nobile), {{is limited to the}} Himalayas.|$|E
5000|$|Though it {{is often}} {{asserted}} that rhubarb {{first came to the}} United States in the 1820s, John Bartram was growing <b>medicinal</b> and culinary <b>rhubarbs</b> in Philadelphia from the 1730s, planting seeds sent him by Peter Collinson. From the first, the familiar garden rhubarb was not the only Rheum in American gardens: Thomas Jefferson planted [...] R. undulatum at Monticello in 1809 and 1811, observing that it was [...] "Esculent rhubarb, the leaves excellent as Spinach." ...|$|R

In order to design appropriate conservation methods for the official species across their natural distributions, {{it is important}} to characterize their genetic diversity. Here, we describe the development of 10 new microsatellite loci for AC/TG/CCA in Rheum tanguticum. The microsatellites were enriched using the combined biotin capture method. The polymorphism of each locus was further assessed in 12 individuals from four geographically distinct populations of this species. The number of alleles ranged from three to seven and the expected heterozygosity ranged from 0. 53 to 0. 73. All markers have been checked in the other three species in the genus and two of them together comprise the official <b>medicinal</b> <b>rhubarb</b> resource with R. tanguticum. These microsatellite markers could provide a useful tool for genetic and conservation studies of the rhubarb species...|$|E

In organic farming, copper is used despite its persistence in soil and toxicity to soil organisms. To replace copper, suspensions of powders from three promising botanicals, including bark of buckthorn (Frangula alnus, FA), roots of <b>medicinal</b> <b>rhubarb</b> (Rheum palmatum) and galls of the nutgall tree (Galla chinensis), were tested in multi-year field experiments. The current study shows {{for the first time}} that botanicals could replace copper under field conditions and best PLB reduction on leaves was achieved with FA, reaching a level close to that of 2 to 3 kg copper per hectare and year. Better results than with copper were achieved with PhosfikÂ® (Ph), a phosphonate-based product. For both FA and Ph, the mode of action is based on induced resistance, for Ph also on direct fungicidal effects. A disadvantage of Ph is the accumulation of residues in potato tubers. Nevertheless, two to three applications with 2 to 3 L/ha of Ph would be feasible to not exceed a minimal risk level (MLR) of 20 mg/kg of phosphorous acid as proposed by the European Food Safety Authority. Due to an excellent environmental profile and a complex mode of action counteracting Pi resistance, phosphonate-based products would be most suitable for sustainable PLB management in integrated pest management (IPM) programmes...|$|E
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a common}} {{condition}} with slow build-up of plaque on the inside wall of arteries. This study was undertaken to investigate whether a herbal formula consisting of three traditional Chinese medicines, including leech (Shuizhi, Whitmania pigra Whitman), Dahuang (<b>medicinal</b> <b>rhubarb,</b> Rheum palmatum L., Polygonaceae), and Chinese cassia bark (Guipi, Cinnamomum cassia Blume, Lauraceae) had beneficial effects on diet-induced atherosclerosis in rabbits. This herbal formula has been traditionally used to treat symptoms presented in stroke and ischaemic heart disease by Chinese doctors for more than 2000 years. Experimental atherosclerosis was established by feeding New Zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) with a high-cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. The study demonstrated that the high-cholesterol diet resulted in significantly thickened aortic intima, enhanced intima area (with a total plaque area of 46. 87 %), marked apoptosis in plaques, elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and malonyldialdehyde (MDA), and significantly increased aortal ceramide content and sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity {{at the end of}} the 10 -week period. Treatment of the atheromatous rabbits with the compound herbal formula at 1. 5 g/kg significantly decreased the area of aortal plaque (to 28. 62 %) and apoptosis, and brought down the increased plasma MDA levels, aortal SMase activity and ceramide content to normal levels. These results suggest that the compound herbal formula has inhibitory effects on the development of atheromatous plaques in rabbits, probably through anti-oxidative effects and inhibition of apoptosis and ceramide production...|$|E
