50|$|<b>Mephentermine</b> {{appears to}} act by {{indirect}} stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors causing {{the release of}} norepinephrine from its storage sites. It has a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium. AV conduction and refractory period of AV node is shortened {{with an increase in}} ventricular conduction velocity. It dilates arteries and arterioles in the skeletal muscle and mesenteric vascular beds, leading to an increase in venous return.|$|E
50|$|Substituted amphetamines are a {{class of}} {{compounds}} based upon the amphetamine structure; it includes all derivative compounds which are formed by replacing, or substituting, one or more hydrogen atoms in the amphetamine core structure with substituents.

40|$|The circulatory {{effects of}} single {{intravenous}} injections of 0. 75 mg/kg <b>mephentermine</b> were investigated in five healthy volunteer subjects. Ninety min {{after the first}} injection, atropine 1 - 2 mg was administered i. v. and the injection of <b>mephentermine</b> repeated. Cardiac output was measured beat-by-beat with an analogue computer-ballistocardio-graph system, validated by dye-dilution cardiac outputs. The first injection of <b>mephentermine</b> increased mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular minute work, with {{no change in the}} other variables. The injection of atropine produced a sudden marked increase in heart rate, cardiac output, arterial pressure, and left ventricular work, and a fall in stroke volume. The repeat injection of <b>mephentermine</b> caused considerably smaller changes in the circulation than either previous injection. Atropine thus unmasked the beta-adrenergic stimulating effects of <b>mephentermine,</b> as well as a surprisingly prolonged action of the agent. It is suggested that the combina-tion of atropine plus <b>mephentermine</b> be investigated as an approach to improved pressor therapy. <b>Mephentermine</b> is relatively slow in onset, with prolonged peak effects.

40|$|The inotropic {{activity}} of the non-catechol sympathomimetic amine, <b>mephentermine</b> sulphate, on the failing dog heart-lung preparation, was 1 / 10 to 1 / 20 that of adrenaline. <b>Mephentermine</b> showed no inotropic effect on preparations from animals pretreated with reserpine. The chronotropic and “calorigenic” actions of <b>mephentermine</b> were tested on modified heart-lung preparations to permit a more accurate measurement of coronary flow, and {{were found to be}} greater than its inotropic effect relative to adrenaline. Furthermore, the action of <b>mephentermine</b> was longerlasting than that of adrenaline. If adrenaline was infused 15 min after the termination of <b>mephentermine</b> administration and when the action of the latter was still at a maximum, a further increase in heart rate and especially oxygen consumption was observed. In preparations from dogs treated with enough reserpine to deplete the heart of noradrenaline, <b>mephentermine</b> had only slight chronotropic and calorigenic actions. However, further addition of adrenaline after a 15 min pause caused a rise in heart rate, oxygen consumption, and coronary flow which almost duplicated the additive effects of both amines on the preparations not treated with reserpine. It would appear that adrenaline acted on its own and in addition “restored” the action of <b>mephentermine</b> on the reserpinized preparations. The action of adrenaline alone on reserpinized preparations was not increased compared with that on normal preparations. These observations are relevant to a consideration of the mechanism of action of non-catechol sympathomimetic amines on the heart, and are in harmony with the concept that <b>mephentermine,</b> a non-catechol amine, requires the presence of added or stored catechol amines for its action. Reserpine treatment did not alter the mechanical efficiency of the heart despite its depletion of noradrenaline...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: It is {{important}} to find an effective method to prevent and treat hypotension during subarachnoid block. Hence we compare the bolus doses of Phenylephrine and <b>Mephentermine</b> to treat hypotension post subarachnoid block. Methods: This randomized {{study was conducted in}} 100 patients of ASA I or II physical status undergoing infraumbilical surgeries under subarachnoid block. Patients were randomized into 2 groups of 50 each. Group P-Phenylephrine of 0. 1 mg I. V bolus and Group M-Mephenteramine 6 mg I. V bolus given when patient develops hypotension > 20 % basal respectively. Both the groups received 3 ml of 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine for subarachnoid block. Vital parameters like blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation were recorded. Any side effects observed were also recorded. Results: The demographic profile were comparable and statistically similar in both the groups. Both the vasopressors were able to maintain blood pressure above the hypotensive values in their respective groups successfully. The number of hypotension episodes was higher in Group P(34 %) than Group M(32 %) but statistically insignificant. The average number of drug doses required for recovery from hypotension was higher in the Group P(1. 41) than Group M(1. 25). The number of episodes of bradycardia was higher in the phenylephrine group(16 %) than in the <b>mephentermine</b> group(4 %). Conclusion: We conclude that intravenous bolus of phenylephrine and <b>mephentermine</b> are both effectve at maintaining intraoperative blood pressure during spinal anaesthesia in infraumbilical surgeries but mephenteramine is better than phenylephrine in maintaining BP persistently high and has lesser incidence of bradycardia...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hypotension {{following}} {{spinal anaesthesia}} (SA) {{is a common}} problem. Vasopressors {{play an important role}} in its management. The common approach in the routine clinical setting is immediate action after detection of hypotension rather than as a preventive measure. There are studies which compare bolus and intravenous (IV) infusion in the management of maternal hypotension, but literature about comparison of efficacy of intramuscular (IM) vasopressors is very limited. Hence, this study was planned in elective caesarean deliveries to compare the efficacy of IM phenylephrine, ephedrine, and <b>mephentermine</b> for the maintenance of arterial pressure during SA. Materials and Methods: A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted where 120 parturients belonging to American Society of Anaesthesiologists II undergoing elective caesarean section under SA were evaluated after being randomized into four groups receiving either preemptive phenylephrine 4 mg IM, ephedrine 45 mg IM, <b>mephentermine</b> 30 mg IM, or normal saline 0. 9 % 2 ml IM as placebo, immediately following SA. The mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were primarily evaluated and any other complications were also recorded. Results: It points toward significantly decreased incidence of hypotension in phenylephrine group compared to the other groups (P = 0. 034). The incidence of rescue IV ephedrine requirement was maximum with the placebo group, least with <b>mephentermine</b> compared to ephedrine and placebo group. However, there was no statistical difference between the groups with respect to doses of IV ephedrine used (P = 0. 08). Maternal nausea, vomiting, and newborn Apgar score were also comparable. Conclusion: All the vasopressors are effective in reducing the severity of hypotension, though phenylephrine was found to be better for the prevention of hypotension...|$|E

Nine parturients with CKD of various etiologies, who underwent elective Caesarean delivery, were included in this study. Spinal anest-hesia was administered in all parturients with normal coagulation profile through a 25 -gauze spinal needle (Quincke) with 0. 5 % (H) bupivacaine in L 2 - 3 space and T 6 level was achieved. Hemodynamics and side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and backache were record. The mean age was 28. 22 ± 4. 43 years. The mean levels of serum creatinine and serum potassium were 2. 78 ± 1. 29 mg/dl and 4. 11 ± 0. 46 meq/l, respectively. Mean baseline values of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate were higher which decreased after spinal anesthesia.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in which the {{adrenergic}} neurone blocking activity of xylocholine, bretylium and guanethidine was studied {{by the use of}} the inhibitory responses of the isolated rabbit ileum to lumbar sympathetic nerve stimulation, and the contractions of the nictitating membrane of the anaesthetized cat in response to stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerves. In both these preparations, after blockade of the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation had been produced with xylocholine, bretylium or guanethicdine, the sympathomimetic amines, dexamphetamine, <b>mephentermine,</b> hydroxyamphetamine, ephedrine and phenethylamine, reversed the blockade; if these amines were given first, then the adrenergic neurone blocking agents were ineffective. Tyramine and dopamine were effective on the isolated rabbit ileum but not on the cat's nictitating membrane. Effective antagonism of the adrenergic neurone blocking drugs was also shown by some substances which inhibit mono-amine oxidase but only those which in addition possess sympathomimetic effects. Thus phenelzine, pheniprazine and tranylcypromine were effective whereas iproniazid and nialamide were not. Since xylocholine, bretylium and guanethidine were all antagonized by the same agents, it seems likely that they all produce sympathetic blockade by a similar mechanism. The possibility is discussed that the sympathomimetic amines which antagonize the adrenergic neurone blocking drugs are competing with these substances for the same receptor sites...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Antihypertensive {{drugs are}} {{continued}} {{until the day}} of renal transplant surgery. These are associated with increased incidence of hypotension and bradycardia. Hence, {{this study was designed}} to evaluate perioperative haemodynamic and early graft functioning in renal recipients with discontinuation of antihypertensive drugs on the morning of surgery. Methods: This prospective, randomised, double-blind study recruited 120 patients. Group 1 patients received placebo tablet while Group 2 patients received usual antihypertensive drugs on the day of surgery. Perioperative haemodynamics and time for reinstitution of antihypertensives were the primary outcome measures. The secondary outcome measures were need for inotropic support and graft function. Perioperative haemodynamics were analysed using ANOVA and Student′s t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Fischer′s exact test was used for analysis. Results: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) declined, which was more in Group 2. Forty-one patients developed significant hypotension; a correlation was found between the maximum observed hypotension and number of antihypertensive medications (P = 0. 003). Four cases had slow graft function (one in Group 1 and three in Group 2). Twenty-eight patients in Group 2 required <b>mephentermine</b> boluses to maintain their SBP compared to 13 patients in Group 1 (P < 0. 001).

The mass detector, with a nominal resolving power of 100, 000 (FWHM at m/z 200), operated in full scan mode in ESI positive ionization mode. Analytes were identified by retention times, accurate masses and correspondence of experimental and calculated isotopic patterns. The limits of detection (LOD) obtained varied from 1 to 25 ngg(- 1) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were 50 ngg(- 1) for all compounds. The method was linear for all the analytes in the ranges from 50 to 2000 ng g(- 1), giving correlation coefficients> 0. 99.

40|$|Approximately 95 {{per cent}} of {{patients}} with patent ductus have characteristic maehinery imiurmiiurs. Five per cent have only systolic murmurs. In such patients, the intravenous or intramuscular administration of a pressor substance, <b>mephentermine,</b> may bring out a continuous murmur. This simple test is a useful adjunct in diagnosis. IN OUR EXPERIENCE about 95 per cent of patent ducti have the typical machinery murmur, and present no problem in diagnosis. A continuous murmur maximal in the second to third left intercostal space usually means patent ductus arteriosus. Other sites usually indicate other lesions. The typical machinery murmur reflects a systolic and diastolic pres-sure gradient between the aorta and pulmo-nary artery with left-to-right shunt in both systole and diastole. The intensity of the murmur {{may or may not}} parallel the size of the ductus and the degree of shunt. It is the atypical 5 per cent of ducti that cause difficulty in diagnosis. The diagnosis of atypical patent ductus can be most re-warding, as a seemingly hopeless and confus-ing situation may be resolved safely and defi-nitely at the operating table. In atypical patent ductus there may be no murmur, a pulmonic systolic flow murmur, or a late sys-tolic-early diastolic murmur overriding the pulmonic second sound having either a late systolic or early diastolic accentuation. 1 2 OC-casionally the murmur of pulmonary insuf-ficiency appears with severe pulmonary hyper-tension.

40|$|Context: The cost of {{anesthetic}} {{technique has}} three main components, i. e., disposable supplies, equipments, and anesthetic drugs. Drug budgets are an easily identifiable area for short-term savings. Aim: To assess and estimate {{the amount of}} anesthetic drug wastage in the general surgical operation room. Also, to analyze the financial implications to the hospital due to drug wastage and suggest appropriate steps to prevent or minimize this wastage. Settings and Design: A prospective observational study conducted in the general surgical operation room of a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: Drug wastage was considered {{as the amount of}} drug left unutilized in the syringes/vials after completion of a case and any ampoule or vial broken while loading. An estimation of the cost of wasted drug was made. Results: Maximal wastage was associated with adrenaline and lignocaine (100 % and 93. 63 %, respectively). The drugs which accounted for maximum wastage due to not being used after loading into a syringe were adrenaline (95. 24 %), succinylcholine (92. 63 %), lignocaine (92. 51 %), <b>mephentermine</b> (83. 80 %), and atropine (81. 82 %). The cost of wasted drugs for the study duration was 46. 57 % (Rs. 16, 044. 01) of the total cost of drugs issued/loaded (Rs. 34, 449. 44). Of this, the cost of wastage of propofol was maximum being 56. 27 % (Rs. 9028. 16) of the total wastage cost, followed by rocuronium 17. 80 % (Rs. 2856), vecuronium 5. 23 % (Rs. 840), and neostigmine 4. 12 % (Rs. 661. 50). Conclusions: Drug wastage and the ensuing financial loss can be significant during the anesthetic management of surgical cases. Propofol, rocuronium, vecuronium, and neostigmine are the drugs which contribute maximally to the total wastage cost. Judicious use of these and other drugs and appropriate prudent measures as suggested can effectively decrease this cost...|$|E
