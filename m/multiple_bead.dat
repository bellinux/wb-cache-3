Approaches that utilize localized magnetic fields to manipulate magnetic particles carrying biological entities are attractive owing to their sensitivity, selectivity, and minimally disruptive impact on biomaterials. Magnetic domain walls in magnetic tracks produce strong localized fields and can be used to capture, transport, and detect individual superparamagnetic microbeads. The dynamics of magnetic microbead transport by domain walls has been well studied. However, demonstration of more complex functions such as selective motion and sorting using continuously driven domain walls in contiguous magnetic tracks is lacking. Here, a junction architecture is introduced that allows for branching networks in which superparamagnetic microbeads can be routed along dynamically-selected paths by a combination of rotating in-plane field for translation, and a pulsed out-of-plane field for path selection. Moreover, experiments and modeling show that the select-field amplitude is bead-size dependent, which allows for digital sorting of <b>multiple</b> <b>bead</b> populations using automated field sequences.

Methods To investigate the relative contribution of different Th associated cytokine/chemokine responses, we used a <b>multiple</b> <b>bead</b> array to measure the levels of CXCL 10 (Th 1 marker), CCL 22 (Th 2 marker), IL- 17 (Th 17 marker) and CXCL 8 (general inflammation marker), in serum and in CSF from untreated patients with confirmed NB (n = 133), and non-NB patients (n = 96), and related the findings to clinical data. Samples from patients with possible early NB (n = 15) and possible late NB (n = 19) were also analysed, as well as samples from an additional control group with orthopaedic patients (n = 17), where CSF was obtained at spinal anaesthesia. Results The most prominent differences across groups were found in the CSF. IL- 17 was elevated in CSF in 49 % of the patients with confirmed NB, but was not detectable in the other groups. Patients with confirmed NB and possible early NB had significantly higher CSF levels of CXCL 10, CCL 22 and CXCL 8 compared to both the non-NB group and the control group (p Borrelia -antibodies. Conclusion Our results support the notion that early NB is dominated by a Th 1 -type response, eventually accompanied by a Th 2 response.

We utilized Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo NMR measurements of the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, D(t) of the xenon gas filling the pore space to study further the measurements of both the surface area-pore volume ratio, S/Vp, and the tortuosity (pore connectivity) of the medium. In uniform-size glass bead packs, we observed D(t) decreasing with increasing t, reaching an observed asymptote of ~ 0. 62 - 0. 65 D 0, that could be measured over diffusion distances extending over <b>multiple</b> <b>bead</b> diameters. Measurements of D(t) /D 0 at differing gas pressures showed this tortuosity limit was not affected by changing the characteristic diffusion length of the spins during the diffusion encoding gradient pulse. This {{was not the case}} at the short time limit, where D(t) /D 0 was noticeably affected by the gas pressure in the sample. Increasing the gas pressure, and hence reducing D 0 and the diffusion during the gradient pulse served to reduce the previously observed deviation of D(t) /D 0 from the S/Vp relation. The Pade approximation is used to interpolate between the long and short time limits in D(t). While the short time D(t) point lay above the interpolation line in the case of small beads, due to diffusion during the gradient pulse on the order of the pore size, it was also noted that the experimental D(t) data fell below the Pade line in the case of large beads, most likely due to finite size effects.

Industry had been reluctant to adopt this technology mainly due to high investment costs, and the unpredictable and nonlinear behavior of the process. However, the repair and refurbishment sector of production engineering is flourishing. Most engineering applications require high strength and corrosion resistant materials for long term reliability and performance of the components; consequently, laser cladding (LC) has been explored as a viable solution for an additive manufacturing (AM) approach. Laser cladding is one of the material AM processes used to produce a metallurgically well-bonded deposition layer and now it has been integrated into the industrial manufacturing lines to create a quality surface. To obtain a desired-quality resulting part, a deep understanding of the process mechanisms is required since laser cladding is a multiple-parameter-dependent process. Developing a bead shape to process parameter model is challenging due to the nonlinear and dynamic nature of the LC environment. This introduces unique predictive modeling challenges for both single bead and overlapping bead configurations. A set of cladding experiments have been performed for single and <b>multiple</b> <b>bead</b> scenarios, and the effects of the transient conditions on the bead geometry for these scenarios have been investigated. It is found that the lead-in and lead-out conditions differ, corner geometry influences the bead height, and when changing the input power levels, the geometry values oscillate differently than the input pulses. The dynamic, time varying heating and solidification, for multiple layer scenarios, leads to challenging process planning and real time control strategies. Models are developed for single and overlapping beads using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Generalized reduced gradient (GRG) approach along with regression analysis to determine the process trends and the best modeling approaches. Since laser cladding (LC) process has potential to make 3 D components; determination of the fill volume for the ‘near net shape’ and the appropriate fill rate is the primary challenge. Although the additive approach reduces many issues related to process planning, there are still issues related to accuracy, surface finish, and build time that require improvement...|$|E

Implications of this research lie in the fields of health and biomaterials. The aim of this work is to devise and validate protocols for using holographic optical tweezers to measure local and through-space viscoelasticity. Rather than using laser deflection to track particle motion, I use a high-speed camera and image analysis to track the simultaneous motion of <b>multiple</b> <b>beads.</b> This approach provides nanometer-scale resolution of particle position at sampling rates up to 2. 5 kHz.

In doing so, I learn about the limitations of each method, and how the viscous and elastic properties inferred from the data are affected by each measurement device. Finally, based on my numerical representations, I suggest a simple procedure to gain more accuracy in the viscous and elastic properties for both simple fluids (such as water) and complex fluids (such as collagen solutions) when using each method.

40|$|Magnetic biosensors detect {{magnetic}} beads that, {{mediated by}} a target, have bound to a functionalized area. This area is often {{larger than the}} area of the sensor. Both the sign and magnitude of the average magnetic field experienced by the sensor from a magnetic bead depends on the location of the bead relative to the sensor. Consequently, the signal from <b>multiple</b> <b>beads</b> also depends on their locations. Thus, a given coverage of the functionalized area with magnetic beads does not result in a given detector response, except on the average, over many realizations of the same coverage.

We determine the expected value and standard deviation of the sensor response for a given coverage, as well as the accuracy and precision with which the coverage can be determined from a single sensor measurement. We show that statistical fluctuations between samples may reduce the sensitivity and dynamic range of a sensor significantly when the functionalized area is larger than the sensor area.

A lot of research effort has been made to achieve better analytical sensitivities with single-molecule resolution as the ultimate goal. Such ultrasensitive detection platforms are extremely valuable for the early detection of low-abundance disease-relevant biomarkers as well as for screening heterogenic sample populations. In particular, bead-based microwell arrays have proven its potential for target detection with single-molecule resolution, by spatially confining individual targets in microwells. The success of ultrasensitive bead-based microwell array technology is exemplified by the commercial applications of Illumina (i. e. BeadArray™) and Quanterix (i. e. SiMoA™) for nucleic acid analysis and ultrasensitive protein measurements, respectively. High-efficiency seeding of magnetic beads is key for the success of these applications and can be enhanced by the creation of hydrophilic-in-hydrophobic (HIH) microwell arrays. However, the fabrication of HIH microwell arrays requires complex and labour-intensive procedures and consequently calls for simpler manufacturing methods. Additionally, current bead-based microwell array systems are restricted solely to target detection, not allowing subsequent manipulation of single beads with captured targets of interest. Although various bead-based trap-and-release systems have already been developed for manipulation of interesting targets at the single-molecule level, they either release all trapped beads at once or in a sequential manner. These platforms thus require an integrated sorting unit, which separates those beads that have captured an interesting target {{from the rest of the}} beads. Hence, there is a need for a multipurpose ultrasensitive bead-based trap-and-release system that would enable both detection and manipulation of interesting target molecules. Such platforms would be of special interest for single-cell applications, bacteria screening, drug discovery and antibody therapeutics. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation, is to (i) establish a multipurpose platform for both detection and manipulation of single molecules by integrating an optical manipulation tool (for retrieving single magnetic beads) with the digital microfluidic-based microwell array, and (ii) evaluate an innovative microwell array fabrication method for the swift manufacturing of HIH microwell arrays. The first part of this work focused on the integration of optical tweezers with an electrowetting-on-dielectric-based digital microfluidic microwell array system for the manipulation of single magnetic beads, seeded in a microwell array. Optical manipulation of seeded magnetic beads required their Brownian motion. To this end, the optimal experimental design approach was used for studying and identifying optimal buffer conditions, which generated high fractions of seeded beads with Brownian motion and thus enabled successful manipulation of single magnetic beads. Six different buffer parameters, including bead type, ionic buffer strength, pH, non-ionic surfactant type and concentration, were investigated in this experiment. The analysis of this optimal experimental design indicated different optimal buffer conditions for carboxylated and streptavidin-coated beads, with Tween 40 and Tween 60 as the best non-ionic surfactants. Using these optimized buffer conditions, <b>multiple</b> <b>bead</b> manipulations, including bead retrieval, trapping, transporting and repositioning in another microwell, were successfully demonstrated. In the second part, the potential of a novel hydrophobic off-stoichiometric thiol-ene-epoxy polymer formulation was explored for imprinting HIH microwell arrays, using a stamp-moulding technique. With this method, HIH microwell arrays were created with excellent dimensions and topological features, enabling highly efficient printing and seeding of superparamagnetic beads. Using streptavidin-biotin interaction and β–galactosidase as a reporter enzyme, a digital bioassay was performed. A detection limit of 17. 4 attomolar was obtained, demonstrating the potential of the imprinted microwell arrays to perform sensitive digital bioassays. Hence, it can be concluded that the novel hydrophobic Off-stoichiometric Thiol-Ene-Epoxy polymer and the integration of optical tweezers in the electrowetting-on-dielectric-based digital microfluidic microwell array system have a huge potential for the development of new commercial digital ELISA and bead-based trap-and-release system, respectively. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) is {{a relatively}} new technology that is labelled to be innovative, disruptive, near-net shaping, enabling manufacturing of complex and customised products, for limitless number of applications, directly from the CAD model into real physical parts. For titanium alloys in aerospace applications, AM moreover stands for a reduced material cost, but also for large challenges when considering consistency and qualification of material properties and components in serial production. In the AM process the feedstock material is melted by a heat source that moves according to a building sequence defined by the CAD model. Layer-by-layer the material solidifies into the wanted shape and accordingly the microstructure forms,which determines the average mechanical properties of the manufactured component. However, even if the AM process seems to be very straight forward, the prediction of mechanical and metallurgical properties is complex, partly because of its building in layer nature which generates a complex thermal history dictating the mechanical properties, and partly {{because of the number of}} parameters involved during the AM process itself. The objective of the present work was to increase the fundamental understanding of the relationship between microstructure, defects and mechanicalproperties of AM:ed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Three AM techniques were investigated, namely laser metal-wire deposition (LMwD), electron beam melting (EBM), and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) wire feed AM, with the main focus on LMwD. The different techniques were evaluated with regard to microstructure and tensile and fatigue properties. In addition, the EBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V was tested in a hydrogen atmosphere to simulate the working environment for a certain engine application. One of the core findings in the present work was that AM:ed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V exhibited a columnar microstructure with elongated prior beta grains growing through several layers following the temperature gradient direction in the built material. To cover the different characteristics of the columnar microstructure, the mechanical properties were evaluated in two orientations of the built Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. The mechanical properties, both static and dynamic, were found to be anisotropic, which was further evaluated indetail with respect to the microstructure evolution and defects generated by the AM process. Among the results, when different process conditions were tested, it was concluded that the thickness of the grain boundary alpha along the prior beta grain boundary did not influence the level of anisotropy. However, the prior beta grain boundary was observed to be the weakest microconstituent when the load was applied perpendicular to its prevalence in both tensile and LCF testing. In order to get a better understanding of how the columnar microstructure influences the fatigue properties, the fatigue crack propagation characteristics were investigated with respect to the columnar prior beta grains and crystal orientation. An extensive fractographic study was carried out on all tested specimens. Lack of fusion (LoF) defects were concluded to be the individually most detrimental type of defect to the material properties. The influence of the LoF defects was further concluded to be very dependent on its prevalence in relation to the loading direction; the largest impact on the fatigue life was observed when the LoF defect wasperpendicular to the loading direction. Finally, a part of the aim of the present work was to support the development of a microstructure model that will be implemented in a thermo-mechanical model when simulating AM of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. In order to validate the material model developed, the alpha lath thickness and the fraction of grain boundary alpha were quantified atspecific locations in single and <b>multiple</b> <b>bead</b> walls of GTAW wire feed AM:ed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and compared with the results of the simulated AM process of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V.

40|$|The {{double helical}} nature of DNA links many {{cellular}} {{processes such as}} DNA replication, transcription, and repair to rotational motion and the accumulation of torsional strain. Magnetic tweezers (MTs) are a single-molecule technique that enables the application of precisely calibrated stretching forces to nucleic acid tethers and to control their rotational motion. However, conventional magnetic tweezers do not directly monitor rotation or measure torque. Here, we describe a method to directly measure rotational motion of particles in MT. The method relies on attaching small, non-magnetic beads to the magnetic beads to act as fiducial markers for rotational tracking. CCD images of the beads are analyzed with a tracking algorithm specifically designed to minimize crosstalk between translational and rotational motion: first, the in-plane center position of the magnetic bead is determined with a kernel-based tracker, while subsequently the height and rotation angle of the bead are determined via correlation-based algorithms. Evaluation of the tracking algorithm using both simulated images and recorded images of surface-immobilized beads demonstrates a rotational resolution of 0. 1 °, while maintaining a translational resolution of 1 – 2 nm. Example traces of the rotational fluctuations exhibited by DNA-tethered beads confined in magnetic potentials of varying stiffness demonstrate the robustness of the method {{and the potential for}} simultaneous tracking of <b>multiple</b> <b>beads.</b> Our rotation tracking algorithm enables the extension of MTs to magnetic torque tweezers (MTT) to directly measure the torque in single molecules. In addition, we envision uses of the algorithm in a range of biophysical measurements, including further extensions of MT, tethered particle motion, and optical trapping measurements.

40|$|A new mode of {{transport}} is described that was capable of high-resolution separation of superparamagnetic materials from complex mixtures based on their size. Laminar flow and a rotating external magnetic field were applied to superparamagnetic beads assembled on a semiperiodic micromagnet array. Beads {{at the edge of}} the micromagnet array oscillated in-phase with the external magnetic field with an amplitude that decreased with increasing frequency, omega, until they reached an immobilization frequency, omega(nu) where the beads stopped moving. Laminar flow along the edge of the array could be tuned to sweep the beads for which omega omega(i) undisturbed.

40|$|Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is {{a method}} of {{trapping}} micro- and nano-sized particles using non-uniform electric fields.

40|$|Laser {{cladding}} is successfully applied {{not only}} for the generation of wear and corrosion resistive coatings but also for the built-up of three-dimensional structures, e. g. in the repair of tools or turbine blades or in rapid manufacturing. Such structures consist of <b>multiple</b> single <b>beads.</b> The different thermal histories of the substrate and the various beads may lead to the development of high thermal stresses and sometimes even to the formation of cracks. The stresses depend on the properties of the materials involved and on the details of heat impact but also on the pattern of beads forming the structure. Inductive pre-heating appears as an appropriate tool to reduce the danger of cracking. Hence the development of thermal stresses and the thermal and mechanical interaction of overlapping beads within two- and three-dimensional structures during the induction-assisted laser cladding are studied with the aim to minimize dangerous tensile stresses...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a snapshot spectral imaging system which fits onto the side camera port of a commercial inverted microscope. The system provides spectra, in real time, from multiple points randomly selected on the microscope image. Light from the selected points in the sample is directed from the side port imaging arm using a digital micromirror device to a spectrometer arm based on a dispersing prism and CCD camera. A multi-line laser source is used to calibrate the pixel positions on the CCD for wavelength. A CMOS camera on the front port of the microscope allows the full image of the sample to be displayed and {{can also be used}} for particle tracking, providing spectra of multiple particles moving in the sample.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamic response of single cells to weak and local rigidities, applied at controlled adhesion sites. Using <b>multiple</b> latex <b>beads</b> functionalized with fibronectin, and each trapped {{in its own}} optical trap, we study the reaction in real time of single 3 T 3 fibroblast cells to asymmetrical tensions {{in the tens of}} pN · μm− 1 range. We show that the cell feels a rigidity gradient even at this low range of tension, and over time develops an adapted change in the force exerted on each adhesion site. The rate at which force increases is proportional to trap stiffness. Actomyosin recruitment is regulated in space and time along the rigidity gradient, resulting in a linear relationship between the amount of recruited actin and the force developed independently in trap stiffness. This time-regulated actomyosin behavior sustains a constant and rigidity-independent velocity of beads inside the traps. Our results show that the strengthening of extracellular matrix-cytoskeleton linkages along a rigidity gradient is regulated by controlling adhesion area and actomyosin recruitment, to maintain a constant deformation of the extracellular matrix...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to present a comparative analysis between theoretical and experimental thermal fields as well as a microstructural behaviour and residual stresses applying <b>multiple</b> weld <b>beads</b> in the joint of two API 5 L X 52 pipe sections. The thermal field, microstructural and residual stresses were numerically modelled through the finite element method (FEM) and compared to experimentally. The simulation conditions used in the FEM analysis were similar considerations to the underwater welding conditions. The finite element analysis was carried out, first by a non-linear transient thermal analysis for obtaining the global temperature history generated during the underwater welding process. Subsequently, a microstructural behaviour was determined using the temperatures distribution obtained in the pipe material by calculating the structural transformations of the material during the welding process, and finally a stress analysis was developed using the temperatures obtained from the thermal analysis. It was found that this simulation method can be used efficiently to determinate with accuracy the optimum welding parameters of this kind of weld applications...|$|R
