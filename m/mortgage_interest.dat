5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp {{to head a}} {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest,</b> but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax.|$|E
5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
25|$|The current {{federal income}} tax law allows {{individuals}} to deduct the home <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> costs from taxable income (unless the taxpayer {{is subject to the}} Alternative Minimum Tax). Home <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> {{is one of the few}} personal expenditures that is treated in this manner. Someone paying a 25% income tax rate would receive $250 back from the government for $1,000 expended in home <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest.</b> While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the income tax deduction for full benefit, this preferential treatment of <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> encourages households to spend relatively more of their income on housing than would otherwise be the case.|$|E

5000|$|While {{historically}} super jumbo mortgages {{were primarily}} short term adjustable rate principal & <b>interest</b> <b>mortgages,</b> <b>interest</b> only options and payment cap or negative amortization loans (currently called [...] "Option ARM" [...] mortgages) {{were introduced to}} the category in the early 1980s to counteract typical 12% rates of the time. While 30-year fixed rate mortgages are available in the super jumbo category, they do not represent the majority of super jumbo mortgages. 3/1 ARM, 5/1 ARM, 7/1 ARM and 10/1 ARM Adjustable Rate Mortgages are more popular among super jumbo mortgage applicants than with the general public, but the greatest increase in originations as a category has been so called [...] "exotic" [...] Super Jumbo <b>Mortgages.</b> Offering <b>interest</b> only and negative amortization features, these loans allow borrowers to choose a lower payment option than a conventional principal & <b>interest</b> <b>mortgage,</b> often 10 to 20% lower in the case of interest only amortization and up to 50% lower or more in the case of deferred interest options.|$|R

Following the model, loss rates are positively {{influenced by the}} house price level, the loan-to-value of <b>mortgages,</b> <b>interest</b> rates, and the unemployment rate. They are negatively influenced by the growth of house prices and the income level. The calibration of {{the model for the}} US and Switzerland demonstrates that it is able to describe the overall development of actual mortgage loss rates. In addition, we show potential applications of the model for different macroprudential instruments: stress tests, countercyclical buffer, and setting risk weights for mortgages with different loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios...|$|R

During the housing bubble from 2000 through 2006, the industry's revenue more than doubled. As the surge in real estate transactions drove up title insurance revenue—along with a greater incidence of claims—the economic downturn that started in 2007 pared back revenue significantly for several years. To compare, the industry reported nearly $17billion in title insurance premiums in 2005, but volume fell to $9.6billion in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Homeownership {{has been}} {{promoted}} as government policy using several means involving mortgage debt and the government sponsored entities Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, which fund or guarantee $6.5 trillion of assets {{with the purpose of}} directly or indirectly promoting homeownership. Homeownership has been further promoted through tax policy which allows a tax deduction for <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> payments on a primary residence. The Community Reinvestment Act also encourages homeownership for low-income earners. The promotion of homeownership by the government through encouraging mortgage borrowing and lending has given rise to debates regarding government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{determinants}} of <b>mortgage</b> loans <b>interest</b> rates in Colombia during the period January 2002 - June 2006. We find that the main macroeconomic determinant is public debt interest rates. At the micro level, we find that credit risk is the main determinant. We demonstrate and analyze the tight relationship between country risk and <b>mortgage</b> debt <b>interest</b> rates. This relationship has been growing over time, as banks have increased their share of long-term liabilities {{in an effort to}} reduce the maturity mismatch that characterized their balance sheets prior to the 1998 - 99 financial crisis. Nevertheless, the reduction in the maturity mismatch has left mortgage rates more exposed to country risk variations. Country Risk, <b>interest</b> rates, <b>mortgage</b> debt, credit risk...|$|R

5000|$|In a {{fixed rate}} <b>mortgage,</b> the <b>interest</b> rate, remains fixed {{for the life}} (or term) of the loan.

25|$|In many countries, {{it is not}} {{feasible}} for banks to lend at fixed rates for very long terms; in these cases, the only feasible type of mortgage for banks to offer may be adjustable rate mortgages (barring some form of government intervention). For example, the mortgage industry of the United Kingdom has traditionally been dominated by building societies. Since funds raised by UK building societies {{must be at least}} 50% deposits, lenders prefer variable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages to reduce potential interest rate risks between what they charging in <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> and what they are paying in interest for deposits and other funding sources.|$|E
25|$|In {{early summer}} 1915, the rent strikers were {{supported}} by mass demonstrations and by August, the rent strikers had found widespread support in Glasgow. Rent strikes spread from heavily industrialised {{areas of the city}} to artisanal areas and slum areas. Strikes ignited in Partick, Parkhead, Pollokshaws, Pollok, Cowcaddens, Kelvingrove, Ibrox, Govanhill, St Rollox, Townhead, Springburn, Maryhill, Fairfield, Blackfriars, and Woodside. In October 1915, 15,000 tenants were on rent strike and a demonstration led by women converged on St Enoch Square. By November, 20,000 tenants were on rent strike as violent resistance against evictions continued. Trade unions threatened factory strikes if evictions supported by the police continued and following demonstrations on 17 November, legal action against rent strikers was halted. State Secretary of Scotland McKinnon Wood asked the Cabinet to freeze all rents at pre-war levels and in December, the Rents and <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Interest</b> Restriction Act 1915 received royal assent.|$|E
25|$|Socially {{the island}} is highly diverse, with the {{creative}} sector (artists, musicians, scientists, writers, poets and actors) and eccentrics strongly represented. It has 1,206 businesses but around 1,000 people commute daily to Auckland as career opportunities are limited. 60.9 per cent of the residents are in employment. The main employment sectors are hospitality (23 per cent) and retail (15%) followed by education, agriculture/horticulture and healthcare (10% each). Gentrification and land speculation is having an impact, with high rates and <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> rates forcing some people on fixed incomes to relocate. New Zealand council rates are based on land and building valuations, which take into account potential value for redevelopment even if the owners live on the property and have no intention to sell or redevelop. The cost of living is higher compared to the mainland, due to the shipping-freight costs of most foodstuffs, fuel and amenities.|$|E

25|$|Housing was a {{major policy}} area under the first Wilson government. During Wilson's time in office from 1964 to 1970, more new houses were built than {{in the last six}} years of the {{previous}} Conservative government. The proportion of council housing rose from 42% to 50% of the total, while the number of council homes built increased steadily, from 119,000 in 1964 to 133,000 in 1965 and to 142,000 in 1966. Allowing for demolitions, 1.3million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970, To encourage home ownership, the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme (1968), which made low-income housebuyers eligible for subsidies (equivalent to tax relief on <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> payments). This scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes and enabling more people to become owner occupiers. In addition, house owners were exempted from capital gains tax. Together with the Option Mortgage Scheme, this measure stimulated the private housing market.|$|E
25|$|Despite departing under a cloud, Lamont {{defends his}} budget record to this day. The 1991 budget, {{in which he}} seized the {{opportunity}} presented by Thatcher's resignation to restrict <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> tax relief to the basic rate of income tax and also cut the rate of corporation tax by two percentage points, was greeted by positive coverage in The Economist which dubbed him a Nimble Novice. In the 1992 budget his proposal to advance to a 20% basic rate of income tax {{through a combination of}} a narrow initial band, a cut in tax on deposit interest and curtailment of tax allowances was hailed as an elegant way of combining populism with progressivism, though events were later to lend support to Nigel Lawson's view that this approach was strategically inept. His final budget in 1993 was more sympathetically received by financial specialists than John Major's 1990 budget or Kenneth Clarke's budget of November 1993. Lamont attributes the large public sector borrowing requirement (i.e. fiscal deficit) of these years to the depth of the recession triggered by his inability to cut interest rates sooner within the ERM.|$|E
25|$|The {{unemployment}} benefit should be increased and {{limited to one}} year. In this period, people would {{have to look for}} a job or education. If {{at the end of the}} year one should not succeed in finding a job, the government will offer one a job for the minimum wage. In order to create more employment, they want to implement the green tax shift which will lower taxes on lower paid labour. This would be compensated by higher taxes on pollution. In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one should get the right to a pension.
