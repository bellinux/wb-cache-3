40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this work was to prepare polysaccharide-based gels exhibiting liquid crystalline properties. Such systems {{may be used in}} some optical or in biomedical applications, where biodegradability is required. Chitosan is a derivative of chitin, widely used in a series of medical applications. Due to its rigid structure, chitosan or its derivatives may show lyotropic mesophases in certain conditions. In this work, chitosan solutions were prepared by mixing completely the polysaccharide with different concentration of formic, acetic and <b>monochloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> at room temperature. X-ray diffraction patterns of the gels did not show the existence of a crystalline structure. Finger-prints texture observed by polarised optical microscopy was attributed to a cholesteric liquid crystalline phase that usually develops in concentrated solutions. Values of the nematic chiral pitch (P) were determined in function of acid solution concentration. The critical concentrations (C*) to form a lyotropic liquid crystalline phase in formic, acetic and <b>monochloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> were determined, and the obtained values were confronted with the expected critical concentration based on the Flory formalism. The critical concentration values were found to be dependent upon the acid used...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} {{leading to}} the various mechanisms for acetal and glycoside hydrolysis is reviewed. A series of fourteen aryl di-O-acetyl-beta-D-gluco-furanosiduronolactones was prepared. The beta-naphthyl, phenyl,beta-cresyl and beta-methoxyphenyl compounds yielded the corresponding beta-D-glucofuranoside on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride. The attempted preparation of m- and beta-chlorophenyl beta-D-glucofuranoside by this method afforded the unsubstituted phenyl glucoside via removal of the halogen atom. beta-Nitrophenyl tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucofuranoside, prepared from a mixture of the penta-O-acetyl-D-glucofuranoses, decomposed during deacetylation attempts. a-Nitrophenyl di-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucofuranosidurono lactone also failed to yield beta-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucofuranoside on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride and sodium borohydride. Phenyl beta-D-galactofuranoside was prepared from phenyl tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactofuranoside. The hydrolyses of the aryl beta-D-glucofuranosides and phenyl beta-D-galactofuranoside were studied in aqueous perchloric acid solutions. The positive entropies of activation measured in 1. 00 M acid are consistent with a unimolecular process. The variation of rate constant with acid concentration is interpretable {{in terms of the}} Hammett-Zucker hypothesis for an A- 1 process. The hydrolysis of phenyl beta-D-glucofuranoside and of phenyl 2 -deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside were studied in a series of monochloroacetate and phosphate buffers. The results are consistent with a specific-acid catalysed mechanism, as are the solvent isotope effects for five glycosides studied. Series of 2 -aryloxytetrahydropyrans and tetra-hydrofurans were prepared and their hydrolysis studied in aqueous acid and in aqueous buffered solutions of acetic, formic and <b>monochloroacetic</b> <b>acids.</b> A general-acid term was observed in the rate-law for the hydrolysis of 2 -phenoxy-tetrahydrofuran in acetate buffers, 2 -(D-nitrophenoxy) -tetrahydropyran and 2 -(D-nitrophenoxy) -tetrahydrofuran in all three buffers but not for 2 -phenoxytetrahydropyran in acetate buffers. Possible A-S E 2 mechanisms are discussed and a concerted mechanism favoured. The catalytic coefficients are greater for the tetrahydrofurans than for the corresponding tetrahydropyrans, and an explanation of this is advanced. The hydronium-ion catalysed reactions for both series yielded small negative rho values and the deuterium solvent isotope effect decreased with basicity of the acetal oxygen.

40|$|Two in-line {{enrichment}} procedures (large volume sample stacking (LVSS) {{and field}} amplified sample injection (FASI)) {{have been evaluated}} for the capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) analysis of haloacetic acids (HAAs) in drinking water. For LVSS, separation on normal polarity by using 20 mM acetic acid-ammonium acetate (pH 5. 5) containing 20 % acetonitrile as BGE was required. For FASI, the optimum conditions were 25 s hydrodynamic injection (3. 5 kPa) of a water plug followed by 25 s electrokinetic injection (- 10 kV) of the sample, and 200 mM formic acid-ammonium formate buffer at pH 3. 0 as BGE. For both FASI and LVSS methods, linear calibration curves (r 2 > 0. 992), limit of detection (LOD) on standards prepared in Milli-Q water (49. 1 - 200 µg/L for LVSS and 4. 2 - 48 µg/L for FASI), and both run-to-run and day-to-day precisions (RSD values up to 15. 8 % for concentration) were established. Due to the higher sensitive enhancement (up to 310 -fold) achieved with FASI-CZE this method was selected {{for the analysis of}} HAAs in drinking water.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of alachlor by direct ozonation and advanced oxidation process O- 3 /H 2 O 2 {{was investigated in}} this study with focus on identification of degradation byproducts. The second-order reaction rate constant between ozone and alachlor {{was determined to be}} 2. 5 +/- 0. 1 M- 1 s(- 1) at pH 7. 0 and 20 degrees C. Twelve and eight high-molecular-weight byproducts (with the benzene ring intact) from alachlor degradation were identified during direct ozonation and O- 3 /H 2 O 2, respectively. The common degradation byproducts included N-(2, 6 -diethylphenyl) -methyleneamine, 8 -ethyl- 3, 4 -dihydro-quinoline, 8 -ethyl-quinoline, 1 -chloroacetyl- 2 -hydro- 3 -ketone- 7 -acetyl-indole, 2 -chloro- 2 &# 39;, 6 &# 39;-diacetyl-N-(methoxymethyl) acetanilide, 2 -chloro- 2 &# 39;-acetyl- 6 &# 39;-ethyl-N-(methoxymethyl) -acetanilide, and two hydroxylated alachlor isomers. In direct ozonation, four more byproducts were also identified including 1 -chloroacetyl- 2, 3 -dihydro- 7 -ethyl-indole, 2 -chloro- 2 &# 39;, 6 &# 39;-ethyl-acetanilide, 2 -chloro- 2 &# 39;, 6 &# 39;-acetyl-acetanilide and 2 -chloro- 2 &# 39;-ethyl- 6 &# 39;-acetyl-N-(methoxymethyl) -acetanilide.

40|$|The {{biorefinery}} is {{a system}} that uses as feedstocks biomasses and recover from these energy, fuel and chemicals. There are many processes considered in the biorefinery system, but in this thesis the biorefinery that uses as feedstock oil, in particular dedicated crops and waste vegetable oils were considered. 	 In {{the first part of this}} thesis the biodiesel production process was studied. One possible route to produce biodiesel from waste oils (carachetrized by high concentrations of Free Fatty Acids, FFAs), is the use of a two steps process: an esterification reaction of FFAs with glycerol and a successive transesterification reaction with methanol of the whole mixture using a basic catalyst. In this thesis the esterification step of FFAs with glycerol, in presence of a new acid heterogeneous catalyst based on sulfonated polymers with enhanced temperature resistance, was studied. The use of this type of catalyst has the advantage of using a relatively high temperature favouring the reaction by stripping of water formed during the esterification The use of an acid catalyst that is able to tranesesterify the glycerides and to esterify the FFAs is onther way to obtained biodiesel from waste or non edible oils. In this thesis the reactions of contemporany esterification of FFAs and tranesterification of glycerides were studied using new homogeneous or supported homogneous Zn(II) catalysts and a NbO 2 /SiO 2 heterogeneous catalyst. The second part of this thesis was devoted to study of new catalysts for chlorination reaction of glycerol recovered from biodiesel production process. The behavior of three series of homologous catalysts, chloroacetic acid series (acetic <b>acid,</b> <b>monochloroacetic,</b> dichloroacetic and trichloroacetic acid), glycolic acid series (glycolic acid, di‐glycolic acid and thio‐glycolic acid) and amminoacid series (glutamic acid, aspartic acid and cysteine), were investigated for their activity and selectivity to produce dichlorohydrins, important intermediates for epichlorohydrin production. In the present study we explored also a completely new class of catalysts for glycerol chlorination, represented by acyl chlorides, never reported in the literature. The catalysts studied are acetyl chloride, propanoyl chloride, adypoyl chloride, butandioil di-chloride, propandioil di-chloride and phenylacetyl chloride and more precisely it is reported a comparison between the acyl chlorides respect to corresponding carboxylic acid. The influence of some reaction parameters are studied as for example the effects of the pressure on activity and selectivity.
