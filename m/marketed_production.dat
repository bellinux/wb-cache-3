It is shown that when the existing gap in relative appropriative skills is being closed, more resources are allocated to appropriative activities in the economy. We are, in this case, more likely to see a reduction in market activities but an increase in home activities. A poorer party is a natural producer rather than a natural fighter, which is the usual characterization of a less endowed party in the conflict analysis. By conducting a welfare analysis, this paper shows that a market-output-maximizing initial distribution of resources endowment is such that when one party has a comparative advantage in <b>market</b> <b>production</b> over appropriation, its initial fraction of total resource endowment should be greater than its relative productivity in <b>market</b> <b>production.</b> Appropriation, <b>market</b> <b>production,</b> home production, initial distribution of resource endowment,...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a concise {{review of the}} process of regional development and the concomitant growing regional inequalities in Kenya. By focusing on Coast Province, it aims to verify statements which stress that the province has gradually moved to a marginal position in Kenyan society. Examining the post World War II period, findings indicate that a successful rooting of (smallholder) <b>marketed</b> <b>production</b> took place elsewhere in Kenya but such a development largely bypassed Coast Province. In the second section statistical sources are analysed which permit insight into the regional distribution of important welfare indicators such as education, health, water supplies and especially food security at household level. The overall conclusion is that large disparities have grown between provinces. Most serious poverty is located in the west of the country, in Western and Nyanza Provinces in particular. Average incomes at the Coast are not the lowest in the country. Also with regard to 'food poverty', the relative position of coastal households is not unfavourable compared to other regions in Kenya. Nevertheless, reviewing other basic household welfare indicators including child nutrition, child mortality, educational participation, health facilities and access to safe water leads {{to the conclusion that the}} Coast indeed finds itself in a disadvantaged situation...|$|E
40|$|For 2005, total United States {{natural gas}} {{consumption}} {{as reported by}} the US Energy Information Administration (USEIA) was just below 22 Tcf, which was about 1 Tcf less than the historic high of 23 Tcf reached in 2000. At roughly 19 Tcf, the total figure for <b>marketed</b> <b>production</b> reported by USEIA was lower than the recent high of 20. 6 Tcf reached in 2001 and substantially below the all-time high of 22. 6 Tcf reached in 1973.

A perennial "gap" between domestic production and demand became a feature of the US natural gas marketplace in 1988. After jumping a new hurdle of 2. 7 Tcf in 1995, the supply-demand gap has generally ranged between 2 and 3. 2 Tcf every year since then, except for 2000 when it achieved its widest point, reflecting a tightening of the US natural gas balance that was ultimately expressed in a sharp spike in prices set at Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the main US (and North American) trading point.

This paper explores the determinants of the labor force participation of children over ten years old within the context of the economic theory of household and <b>market</b> <b>production,</b> using micro-level data from 1880 Philadelphia. The father's income and unemployment, the presence of the mother or father, boarders, servants, older and younger siblings, parents' literacy, ethnicity, among other variables are used in a probit analysis of the labor force participation of children. The results validate the economic theory of household and <b>market</b> <b>production</b> demonstrating, in particular, substitution between mothers and their daughters and the role of comparative advantage in family decisions concerning the allocation of their members' time.

With the exception of Kenya, traditional cattle production systems based on indigenous breeds dominate milk production in the region, yet they contribute relatively little to <b>marketed</b> <b>production,</b> mainly because of poor access to major urban markets. Kenya, which has over 85 % of the dairy cattle population, dominates dairy production and marketing in the region.

The widespread adoption of dairy cattle in Kenya was stimulated by several interacting factors: the conducive policy and institutional environments provided by successive Governments; the presence of significant dairy populations (owned by settler farmers); a sub-tropical geography suitable for dairy cattle; and, smallholder communities who kept cattle and who had milk as an important part of their diet. Today most of Kenya’s 3 million dairy cattle are kept by smallholders in crop-livestock systems in areas of high and medium cropping potential. Generally 1 - 2 dairy cows (mostly Holstein Friesian or Ayrshire) comprise 50 % of the herd, the other half consisting of female calves and heifers.

Historical development of agricultural sector influenced the difference of Czechoslovakian and Polish agriculture. Despite the differences, governments of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland decided to provide public support for newly established producer groups after EU accession. Main aim of this analyses is to compare how money were provided to newly established producer groups in above mentioned countries and to assess efficiency of spend money. Main part of the theses {{is focused on}} measures provided during {{part of the first}} postaccession Programming Period 2004 when 2006. Between 2007 and 2013, support was provided only in Poland and Slovakia, the Czech Republic did not used the opportunity to open measure for new entities. Own analytical part is focused on measure evaluation through subject identification. Supported subjects were examined whether they follow main conditions of recognition or whether they fulfil main theoretical prerequisite for operation as marketing cooperative. Subject examination was based on own methodology that was developed on the bases of literature overview. Evaluation was based following indicators (i) share of <b>marketed</b> <b>production</b> on the total agricultural output of the country; (ii) market share on the relevant market and created value added. Results of the theses indicate, that part of supported producer groups were established solely in order to gain easy access to public money. Groups share on relevant market is negligible, goals of market concentration were not met. Groups value added is low. This fact is mainly caused by observed characteristics groups often does not own any investment assets, does not have any employees. After receiving last payment, groups were closed, transformed into other business activity or its ownership structure were changed In the Czech Republic. In Poland, established groups reach the lowest significant market share, subjects were closed and reestablished to source subsequent support.

40|$|Between World War II and {{the early}} 1970 s, Tanzania {{developed}} one of the world's largest cashew nut industries. In 1973 - 74, <b>marketed</b> <b>production</b> reached 145, 000 tons (about 30 percent of world production), with cashews providing {{an important source of}} income to some 250, 000 farmers and being the country's fourth largest source of foreign exchange. This trade was originally developed and organized by private traders (of Indian and Arab origin), although in the 1960 s a multitiered marketing system - involving local cooperative societies, regional cooperative unions, and a marketing board - was imposed, with private traders gradually removed from the market system. Despite a buoyant international market, Tanzania's cashew nut industry underwent a steady and massive decline through the 1970 s and 1980 s. The author examines the factors that contribute to this downward spin: Tanzania's village program, a decline in real producer prices, and inefficiencies in cooperative and marketing board crop collection and downstream activities. With the decline in production, living standards in the main cashew-growing regions worsened, and most of the large-scale, donor-funded, government-owned processing factories became"white elephants. "With the industry on the brink of collapse, in 1991 the government announced the liberalization of the cashew nut market, permitting private firms to once again buy and sell the nuts. According to the author, the reform process has been characterized by confusion, uncertainty, and latent government controls and interventions, though the industry shows some signs of recovery. Based on a recent survey, the author examines the liberalization process - including its implementation at the national and local levels, the private sector response to renewed trading opportunities, and the resultant patterns of competition, price discovery, and marketing channel formation. The liberalization experience in Tanzania's cashew nut industry offers interesting insights for other sub-Saharan African countries where uncertainty remains about the appropriate roles (if any) for marketing boards in liberalized markets, about the ability of cooperatives to compete in such markets, and about the ability of indigenous firms to take advantage of new trading opportunities. In Tanzania, neither the cooperatives nor the marketing board have fared well in the liberalized market. Although a relatively large number of private traders have recently entered into cashew buying and selling, successful entry into export marketing has proven viable only for a small number of companies. Their characteristics: medium to large in scale, diversified across commodities, involved in trading and agroindustry, not indigenous, and with strong financial and trading links abroad.

Today most of Kenya’s 3 million dairy cattle are kept by smallholders in crop-livestock systems in areas of high and medium cropping potential. Generally 1 - 2 dairy cows (mostly Holstein Friesian or Ayrshire) comprise 50 % of the herd, the other half consisting of female calves and heifers. In the high potential areas feeding is mainly cut-and-carry with planted Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and crop residues, especially from maize and bananas, supplemented by forage gathered from common properties around the farm. On average total daily milk output is 10 kg per farm, of which a quarter is for home consumption and the rest sold. In the late 1980 s, sales were mainly through local dairy co-operative societies, with some to neighbours. However, following market liberalisation in 1992, marketing channels have diversified. It is estimated that approximately 80 % of marketed milk is not processed or packaged, but instead is bought by the consumer in raw form. The factors driving the continued importance of the informal market are traditional preferences for fresh raw milk, which is boiled before consumption, and unwillingness to pay the costs of processing and packaging. Raw milk markets offer both higher prices to producers and lower prices to consumers. In Kenya, therefore, as elsewhere in the tropics, market-oriented smallholder dairy farms are concentrated close to urban consumption centres because the effects of the market over-ride many production factors. Less proximate production occurs only in those regions where there is an efficient market infrastructure. As infrastructure develops, markets become more efficient and urban consumers develop stronger preferences for pasteurised milk, the advantages of proximity will be reduced and production may well move away from intensive peri-urban systems and shift to more extensive systems (as the New Zealand dairy industry illustrates on a global scale). Until these infra-structural improvements occur, and because of the ready availability of cheap human capital (labour) and the relative expense of financial capital, smallholder dairy production and informal raw milk marketing are likely to predominate for the foreseeable future. Consequently it is anticipated that the industrialised model of dairy production, processing and marketing will remain a minor contributor in Kenya and elsewhere in the region.
