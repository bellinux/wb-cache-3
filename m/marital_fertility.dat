[...] "The 1945-1964 era produced a “heroic” flowering of Catholic family life in America. Although fertility rose for all American religious groups, it rose far more rapidly and stayed high longer among Catholics.... The total <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> rate for non-Catholics averaged 3.15 children born per woman in the early 1950s and 3.14 in the early 1960s.

50|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, there has been a change in family {{structure}} over the past few decades. For instance, in the West, there has been a trend of moving away from living arrangements that include the extended family to those which only consist of the nuclear family. There has also been a trend to move from <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> to non-marital fertility. Children born outside marriage may be born to cohabiting couples or to single women. While births outside marriage are common and fully accepted {{in some parts of the}} world, in other places they are highly stigmatized, with unmarried mothers facing ostracism, including violence from family members, and in extreme cases even honor killings. In addition, sex outside marriage remains illegal in many countries (such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Yemen).|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{recently}} published data and life table analysis {{to describe the}} <b>marital</b> and <b>fertility</b> behavior of women on a country level. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the changes in nuptiality and fertility in the Soviet Union and the associated changes in women's lives. Soviet women differ greatly from women in Western Europe in their early start of <b>marital</b> and <b>fertility</b> careers. One-third of females are married before their 20 th birthday. The age at which women have their first child is decreasing. Fifteen percent have at least one child at age 20, and 65 percent have one or more children at age 25. In the first part of the paper, multistate life table analysis is introduced to generate complete marital histories (biographies) of women as they pass through the reproductive ages (16 - 50).

50|$|There {{are several}} social {{consequences}} of an imbalanced sex ratio. High ratios of males {{make it easier}} for women to marry, but harder for men. In parts of China and India, there is a 12-15% excess of young men. These men will remain single and will be unable to have families, in societies where marriage is regarded as virtually universal and social status and acceptance depend, in large part, on being married and creating a new family. Analyses of how sex ratio imbalances affect personal consumption and intra-household distribution were pioneered by Gary Becker, Shoshana Grossbard-Shechtman, and Marcia Guttentag and Paul Secord. High ratios of males {{have a positive effect on}} <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> and women's share of household consumption and negative effects on non-marital cohabitation and fertility and women's labor supply. It has been shown that variation in sex ratio over time is inversely related to married women's labor supply in the U.S.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps Coale's major {{scientific}} {{contribution was}} {{to the understanding of}} the demographic transition. The Demographic Transition, as stated by Coale, occurs when a country develops a strong economy, and within the society, low fertility and mortality will start to reflect based upon the economic standpoint. [...] Coale was the pioneer of the European Fertility Project, which examined the decline in <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> in Europe. The European Project's goal was to correlate the fertility rates within married couples, and also the rate of infant mortality. Coale established three pre-conditions to fertility decline. The first one is [...] "within the conscious of choice". In other words, it is up to the individual and within their own decision to have children. The second one would be if a society sees not having children as advantageous, then fertility will decline. The third pre-condition is to have contraception methods ready. It is important to emphasize that a society will start to shows signs of fertility decline if these three pre-conditions are met. [...] Initiated in 1963, the project eventually resulted in the publication of nine major books summarizing the change in childbearing over a century in the 700 provinces in Europe. The Project findings eventually lead to the conclusion that even though economical factors can play a role in fertility decline, this is not the absolute determinant of fertility decline. The European Project lead to a better understanding that infant mortality and fertility decline do not necessarily follow each other. With a long-time interest in the population of Russia, which first found outlet in Coale's work on the life tables that he constructed for Frank Lorimer's classic The Population of the Soviet Union (1946), Coale also later co-authored a volume on Russia for the European Fertility Project series.|$|E

Likewise, a new index for measuring <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> (known as the Navarre Index) is presented which takes into account women’s average age at marriage as well as their mortality rate during their reproductive period...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is whether the {{transition}} from high to low fertility reveals continuity or discontinuity with the past. Our analyses of districts of England and Wales over time reveal an overall picture of continuity. Specifically, we show that (1) a substantial proportion of districts experienced pretransition variations in <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> that were so large that they are suggestive of deliberate fertility control; (2) the changes over time in the distributions of <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> levels and the relative importance of <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> levels to the determination of overall fertility levels were gradual and smooth; (3) the proportion of districts dominated by marital fertiliity variation, as opposed to nuptiality variation, increased gradually over time, and both <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> and nuptiality variations were present in all periods considered; and (4) there are important relationships between changes over time in <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> and socio-economic variables in periods {{both before and after the}} transition. The last conclusion is based on our estimated equations from the pooled cross-sectional, time-series data. Moreover, these estimated equations reveal relationships between changes in specific explanatory variables and changes in <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> that are very similar both before and after the onset of the transition...|$|E
40|$|The rise in <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> in East Asian {{societies}} {{with very}} low fertility {{has been reported}} through analyses using the age-specific <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> rate (AMFR). Though the measure is often considered related to {{the average number of}} children married women have (CMF), we demonstrated that such an interpretation is often erroneous (AMFR problem) and valid only under limited conditions in more or less controlled fertility, a fact that has been known by some researchers. We conducted numerical simulations based on a simple mathematical model. Holding completed <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> (CMF) constant, tempo changes in the age-specific marriage rate and in the duration-specific <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> produce a parallel and opposite change in the AMFR, respectively. Note that the former is in the opposite direction of demographic translation. This means that a change in the AMFR caused by such tempo changes may cancel the change in the CMF thus leading to an erroneous interpretation. We should be careful in using the AMFR when the age at marriage or the tempo in duration-specific <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> changes or differs notably. Hence, the observed rise in the AMFR should be interpreted after subtracting the enormous effect by such tempo changes so as to avoid exaggeration of the marriage rate decline and negligence of <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> decline. This problem may even apply to some developing countries or Western societies. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> {{transition}} in Europe have found religious differentials.

The results provide some evidence of relatively low levels of parity-dependent fertility control among Jews before the transition and among Catholics during the transition. Religious ideology probably accounts for the low level of fertility control among Catholics. The ultimate reason for the relatively high <b>marital</b> <b>fertility</b> among Jews before the transition remains unclear.

40|$|Extending working life, and {{enabling}} {{and encouraging}} people to work longer, is a key policy area. That {{women are more likely}} than men to work beyond state pension age indicates that factors other than the state pension age play a role in extending working life. Financial factors are likely to be a key reason why women, and especially divorced women, are {{more likely than men to}} extend working life. It is well documented that women are less able to build a pension income due to their role as carer within the family, with their <b>marital</b> and <b>fertility</b> histories impacting upon work history. It therefore follows that gender inequalities over the life course continue into older age to influence need, capacity and desire to undertake paid work after state pension age. This paper explores how work, <b>marital</b> and <b>fertility</b> history impact upon the likelihood of working beyond state pension age, focusing upon differences between men and women. It uses the British Household Panel Survey’s retrospective data from the first 14 waves to summarise work-family histories, and logistic regression to understand the impact of work and family histories on working beyond state pension age. Findings show that, for women, family history is important for explaining a greater propensity to work beyond state pension age, with short breaks due to caring, lengthy marriages, and late divorce and remaining single with children all being important. However, lengthy dis-attachment (due to caring) from the labour market, and thus lowered negotiating power, makes working longer more difficult. For men, even short periods out of the labour market reduce their odds of working longer. This indicates that, on the one hand, policy needs to focus upon reducing the financial need to work longer by tackling gender inequalities in the labour market. On the other, to enable those most in financial need to work longer, more help needs to be given to increase their negotiating power in the labour market...|$|R
