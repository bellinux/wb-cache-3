Use {{of common}} parts for {{different}} products (commonality) is important methods for managing product variety and preserving competitiveness {{in the age}} of mass customization and supply chain competition. In literature, the advantages of inclusion of common components in a product family are well established. Unfortunately, most of the works have been conducted via simulation or conceptual thinking. The mathematical models in the premises are not adequate for production, planning and control in multistage production. This paper focuses on the advancement of venerable manufacturing resources planning models by incorporating the part commonality concept in a multiproduct, multi-period and multistage manufacturing system under a deterministic situation. The models are validated with established MRPII models. The <b>material</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>schedule</b> for the basic MRP II and proposed models are compared. It is really a good matching shown between the two schedules. The later bearing additional information of the location where to be available the parts in a time frame. The effects of commonality on cost, capacity and requirement schedule are discussed based on the outcomes of the mathematical models executed with the available live data...|$|E

Decision problems regarding inventory management and production planning are tactical and have a mid-term planning horizon. Operative decision problems, as disassembly planning, <b>material</b> <b>requirement</b> plans, <b>scheduling</b> and routing in the remanufacturing shop have a short-term planning horizon [4, 5, 7, 28].|$|R

The synchronization of the diverse partners involved in the Supply Chain (SC) requires a Collaborative Planning {{with the purpose of}} work coordinated to be able to satisfy the demands of a more and more competitive market. In this work papers with respect to the collaborative planning in the supply chain are revised analyzing strategic aspects, like they can be the types, forms, relationships or benefits of the collaboration and tactical such aspects as the planning, <b>material</b> <b>requirement</b> and <b>scheduling.</b> The different models proposed to formalize the collaborative planning among the different partners in the SC are analyzed...|$|R

To improve the efficiency and precision of emergency goods scheduling, a model is established for the multi-depot and multi disaster places, single category <b>material</b> <b>requirement</b> emergency <b>scheduling</b> problem. The objective of the model includes minimizing task complete time and relief participated vehicles. The model is under {{the constraints of the}} relief vehicle number and the specified time by disaster places. Genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the routes, to determine the number of participated vehicles and routes of varied emergency relief centers, thus the minimum emergency time and vehicles can be obtained. Finally an example is employed to validate the validity of the model and algorithm. Harbin Univ Commerce, China Soc Comod Sci, IEEE Harbin Sec...|$|R
40|$|System {{nervousness}} in <b>material</b> <b>requirements</b> planning (MRP) {{systems has}} been receiving considerable attention recently. Several strategies are suggested to reduce MRP system nervousness. This paper examines {{one of these}} nervousness-reduction methods, dampening procedures. Dampening procedures are non-inventory-oriented, which screen out insignificant rescheduling messages generated by MRP systems so as to reduce schedule disruptions. The cost of rescheduling is incorporated {{as a component of}} total cost {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} alternative dampening procedures by a simulation experiment under such operating environments as the presence of production uncertainty, different capacity utilization, and different rescheduling efforts. The dampening procedures tested are the static dampening procedure, automatic rescheduling procedure, and cost-based dampening procedure. The results indicate that the static and cost-based dampening procedures outperform the automatic rescheduling procedure under most operating conditions considered in the study. Furthermore, the relative performance of the static and cost-based procedures depends on the difficulty of rescheduling efforts involved and the lot-sizing rule used. <b>material</b> <b>requirements</b> planning production <b>scheduling</b> dampening procedure...|$|R
50|$|By using many {{variables}} as inputs the MPS will generate {{a set of}} outputs used for decision making. Inputs may include forecast demand, production costs, inventory money, customer needs, inventory progress, supply, lot size, production lead time, and capacity. Inputs may be automatically generated by an ERP system that links a sales department with a production department. For instance, when the sales department records a sale, the forecast demand may be automatically shifted to meet the new demand. Inputs may also be inputted manually from forecasts that have also been calculated manually. Outputs may include amounts to be produced, staffing levels, quantity available to promise, and projected available balance.

40|$|Manufacturing {{concepts}} such as Just-in-Time, Lean and Six-Sigma, Japanese 5 S, <b>Materials</b> <b>Requirement</b> Planning, <b>Scheduling</b> and Capacity Management have been applied in the Healthcare industries in the West {{for the last decade}} and has yielded positive results. In this study, these concepts and philosophies have been applied to an Indian Multi-speciality Hospital to improve its OPD process flow and increase patient satisfaction. The Outpatients Department (OPD) is usually the most crowded sector in a hospital. The frequent problems encountered include the waiting period for consultation, an unpredictable number of Walk-in patients, insufficient and operationally deficient OPD reception staff and unattended appointment patients. This study aims at, identifying methods to standardise OPD operations management. It has made the process more efficient through optimum resource utilisation. This will increase patient satisfaction by meeting and exceeding their expectations while maintaining quality of care. This research was conducted by mapping the process flow and using the data that was collected through an observational, cross-sectional, non-interventional study. Though there were a comprehensive set of recommendations {{at the end of the}} study, only a few could be implemented due to the introduction of a new Hospital Information System (HIS) software putting the implementation plan on hold...|$|R

40|$|The Wagner-Whitin dynamic {{economic}} lot-sizing {{technique has}} not been widely applied to real-world production scheduling problems. A frequently quoted reason is the extreme sensitivity of the solution {{to changes in the}} estimates of future values of the problem's parameters, especially future demand. This "nervousness" has been of great concern to users of MRP (<b>Material</b> <b>Requirements</b> Planning) systems. A solution procedure which incorporates the cost of changing the current production schedule alleviates this nervousness by considering its economic effect. Thus updated parameter forecasts can be effectively used, and the schedule will be changed only when the joint consideration of setup, inventory holding, and schedule change costs indicates that it is economically beneficial to do so. <b>material</b> <b>requirements</b> planning, <b>material</b> <b>requirements</b> planning: lot sizing...|$|R
