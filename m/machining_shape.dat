40|$|Abstract: Input shaping is {{a method}} of {{reducing}} residual vibrations in computer-controlled <b>machines.</b> <b>Shaped</b> command profiles are generated by convolving asequence of impulses, an input shaper, with the desired command signal. The shaped command profile will move the system without residual vibration. The performance of several types of input shapers is compared to the time-optimal flexible-body control in terms of maneuver speed, amplitude of transient deflection, robustness to modeling errors, excitation of unmodeled high modes, and ease of implementation. To facilitate the comparison, time-optimal flexible-body control is treated as a special case of input shaping...|$|R
