5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to sing and play the improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned to sing and play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to <b>musical</b> <b>expression.</b> All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E

The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. <b>Musical</b> <b>expression</b> is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is {{more than the sum of}} measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.|$|E

25|$|The stile recitativo, as {{the newly}} created style of monody was called, proved to be popular not only in Florence, but {{elsewhere}} in Italy.

Caccini's achievement was to create a type of direct <b>musical</b> <b>expression,</b> as easily understood as speech, which later developed into the operatic recitative, and which influenced numerous other stylistic and textural elements in Baroque music.|$|E
25|$|Expression on {{instruments}} can {{be closely}} related {{to the role of the}} breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions.

The emotional content of <b>musical</b> <b>expression</b> is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{refers to}} minorities’ <b>musical</b> <b>expressions</b> and their {{treatment}} and articulation {{in the school}} curriculum, this being considered as part of social discourse and therefore embedded in power relations. We deal with two main aspects: the first one refers {{to the way in}} which traditional popular music is included at school; specifically, the way minority groups’ <b>musical</b> <b>expressions</b> are treated in everyday school practices and the meaning that is built about these artistic practices considered as ‘alterity’. The second aspect refers to the diverse arguments that justify the presence of popular traditional music in the curriculum from two different perspectives: the ‘nationalist’ discourse in contrast with the one of ‘education for democracy’. The Critical Pedagogy perspective revels the positivist treatment of folk music as an ‘artifact’ in schools. The analysis of institutions and educational practices in the Argentinean context show an attitude about Art oriented towards the construction of a national being blended with Eurocentric features, in wich education for democracy is still in process...|$|R
