40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the European Union has {{struggled}} to increase integration in the sovereignty sensitive areas of justice and home affairs and foreign policy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to enhance our understanding of what patterns of cooperation have been established between the member states, and why. I do so by analysing the case of short-stay visa policy. Visas are a corner stone of EU’s border control, regulating access to the Union’s area of freedom, security and justice. It is moreover an instrument used in foreign and diplomatic relations. As a field where the member states’ cooperation is particularly intense it is an ‘extreme case’ well-suited for drawing out empirical patterns and developing theoretical concepts. The paper is based on a network analytical approach and a new dataset of all the EU/Schengen member states’ <b>mutual</b> <b>consular</b> visa <b>assistance</b> agreements. This I use to document the extent and pattern of cooperation from 2005 to 2010. I show that the member states rely intensively on each other’s consular services. They mainly share sovereignty in four distinct regional clusters – a Nordic, Benelux, Southern European and an emerging Central Eastern. France and Germany are at the centre of the network. To explain this structure of cooperation I discuss the relative merits of realist, liberal intergovernmentalist and constructivist approaches. I show how they each identify important dynamics but emphasise the relative merits of a constructivist perspective. I put forward a new concept of ‘regional imagined communities’ which explains cooperation by the existence of shared identities owing to regional commonalities in language and state-building histories. I argue that the concept improves our understanding of European integration in visa policy, and suggest it might hold wider potential for explaining dynamics of collaboration in other sovereignty sensitive policy areas.

40|$|The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963 {{outlined}} {{the rights of}} a state to exercise its obligation to protect the interests of its nationals abroad. The protection given by states to their nationals is {{commonly referred to as}} <b>consular</b> <b>assistance.</b> The main objective of <b>consular</b> <b>assistance</b> is to help nationals facing difficulties abroad. In the event of an arrest, the aim of the provision of <b>consular</b> <b>assistance</b> is to protect the inalienable rights of a foreign detainee.

40|$|The {{provision}} of <b>consular</b> <b>assistance</b> {{is critical to}} nationals who face criminal proceedings abroad which may result in the death penalty. In recent years {{the importance of a}} detained foreign national accessing consular authorities from their home state has been recognised as both a human right and an individual right in international law. Despite this, the question of whether there is an obligation on the national’s home state to provide <b>consular</b> <b>assistance</b> has yet to be answered. This article makes a case for the emergence of such a right to <b>consular</b> <b>assistance</b> in capital cases for nationals of states which have abolished the death penalty. With reference to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, the article locates this emerging right within a state’s positive obligation to protect life. It is recognised that for any such emerging right to be meaningful it must be capable of being enforced. The article therefore addresses the particular challenges of extraterritorially applying a right to <b>consular</b> <b>assistance</b> and proposes the return to a previous, more flexible, understanding of extraterritorial human rights obligations on consular agents...|$|R

25|$|On January 7, 1982, {{brothers}} Karl-Heinz (1963-1999) and Walter Bernhard LaGrand (1962-1999) bungled {{an armed}} bank robbery in Marana, Arizona, United States, killing {{a man and}} severely injuring {{a woman in the}} process. They were subsequently charged and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The LaGrands were German nationals, having been born from a German mother in Germany. While they had both lived in the United States since they were four and five, respectively, neither had officially obtained U.S. citizenship. As foreigners the LaGrands should have been informed of their right to <b>consular</b> <b>assistance,</b> under the Vienna Convention, from their state of nationality, Germany. However the Arizona authorities failed to do this even after they became aware that the LaGrands were German nationals. The LaGrand brothers later contacted the German consulate of their own accord, having learned of their right to <b>consular</b> <b>assistance.</b> They appealed their sentences and convictions {{on the grounds that they}} were not informed of their right to <b>consular</b> <b>assistance,</b> and that with <b>consular</b> <b>assistance</b> they might have been able to mount a better defense. The federal courts rejected their argument on grounds of procedural default, which provides that issues cannot be raised in federal court appeals unless they have first been raised in state courts.|$|R

50|$|Article 4d {{provides}} that neither marriage nor {{dissolution of marriage}} shall automatically affect the nationality of either spouse, nor shall a change of nationality by one spouse during marriage automatically affect the nationality of their spouse. Common practice among states {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century was that a woman was to have the nationality of her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the nationality of her husband, and lose her previous nationality. Even after the nationality of a married woman was no longer dependent on the nationality of her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to <b>consular</b> <b>assistance</b> (since <b>consular</b> <b>assistance</b> cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations.
