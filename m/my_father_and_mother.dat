I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E

His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before.

When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: [...] "Threatening <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> Smith to burn them and the house over them." [...] Newton's mother had three children from her second marriage.|$|E

Lord John was much taken with the Lodge– [...] "an asset that could hardly be equalled, certainly not surpassed in England". Earl Russell (as he had become) died there on 28 May 1878; Fanny, his second wife, in 1898.

2500|$|He {{was five}} feet nine {{inches tall and}} was always very slender so that he {{appeared}} taller than he was actually…he had been a gymnast and the muscles of his arms and back stood out like ropes. [...] He was soft spoke and agreeable, yet, {{there was always a}} certain reserve. He was modest, honest, and true. He spoke well of others. As a boy he had gone to church twice on Sundays, once in the morning and once in the evening. He visited the sick and aged. [...] He loved games. He was an avid hunter and fisherman. [...] He was first a cavalryman before he became a flyer and he enjoyed riding and polo. In San Antonio, he had three polo ponies. I was never allowed to ride them, presumably because I would spoil them. He did, however, teach me to ride other horses, to swim, to golf, and to play baseball. [...] He enjoyed music and we sang on long automobile trips when he changed station from one Army post to another, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> in the front seat and my sister, Barbara, and I in the back. [...] His posture was firmly erect and he possessed a cold courage that was remarkable. Beneath the calm exterior lay the competitiveness and combativeness fostered by the severe training at West Point.|$|E

When the fever developed he directed Abu Bakr to go to the war following Usama who was 18. When Muhammad died Muslims gathered in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and there were suppressed sobs and sighs. Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh (a village) on a horse where he had been with his new wife. He dismounted and entered the Prophet's Mosque, but did not speak to anyone until he entered upon 'Aa'isha. He went straight to Muhammad who was covered with Hibra cloth (a kind of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered Muhammad's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept, saying, [...] "Let <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> be sacrificed for you.

2500|$|In June 1970, {{after one}} season at Miami, Bo Schembechler offered Burton an {{assistant}} coaching position at Michigan, and Burton accepted.

[...] Burton was the position coach for All-American receivers Jim Smith and Anthony Carter and to running back Jamie Morris. [...] In 1990, Burton said that Morris was favorite Michigan player. Morris gave credit to Burton for his development: [...] "Tirrel was everything to me. He was like <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother.</b> He always was in my corner. Bo would get on me, and he would take some of the blame for me. He handled each individual the way he needed to be handled."
