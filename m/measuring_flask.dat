5000|$|A {{volumetric}} flask (<b>measuring</b> <b>flask</b> or graduated flask) {{is a piece}} of laboratory glassware, a type of laboratory flask, calibrated to contain a precise volume at a particular temperature. Volumetric flasks are used for precise dilutions and preparation of standard solutions. These flasks are usually pear-shaped, with a flat bottom, and made of glass or plastic. The flask's mouth is either furnished with a plastic snap/screw cap or fitted with a joint to accommodate a PTFE or glass stopper. The neck of the {{volumetric flask}}s is elongated and narrow with an etched ring graduation marking. The marking indicates the volume of liquid contained when filled up to that point. The marking is typically calibrated [...] "to contain" [...] (marked [...] "TC" [...] or [...] "IN") at 20 °C and indicated correspondingly on a label. The flask's label also indicates the nominal volume, tolerance, precision class, relevant manufacturing standard and the manufacturer’s logo. The volumetric flasks are of various sizes, containing from 1 to 20 000 mL of liquid.|$|E

The hexane layer in the bottle was then transformed to a test tube with a cap, to which anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to dry the hexane layer overnight at room temperature. The butyl levulinate in the hexane layer was analyzed by gas chromatography using a GC- 2010 unit (SHIMADZU). Quantification was performed by external calibration curves based on peak areas of pure standards. The production rate of butyl levulinate was obtained by dividing the amount of butyl levulinate produced by the amount of butyl levulinate theoretically produced, as estimated from the original amount of cellulose powder (0.28  g).|$|E

These data are unusual, exhibiting higher short-term variability, and seasonal cycles not in phase with other sampling stations. The unique nature of atmospheric data from Samoa has been noted previously from measurements of CO 2, methyl chloroform, and ozone. With our O- 2 data, we observe greater magnitude in the short-term variability, but, in contrast, no clear seasonal pattern to this variability. This we attribute to significant regional sources and sinks existing for O- 2 in both hemispheres, and a dependence on both the latitudinal and altitudinal origins of air masses. We also hypothesize that some samples exhibit a component of "older'' air, demonstrating recirculation of air within the tropics.

CO 2 mixing ratios and stable isotope ratios of CO 2 were <b>measured</b> on <b>flask</b> samples taken in two heights within the canopy. Simultaneously, soil and leaf samples were collected and analysed to derive the 18 O/ 16 O ratio of the respective water reservoirs and the 13 C/ 12 C ratio of the leaf tissue.

Via exchange of oxygen isotopes with associated liquid water reservoirs, leaf CO 2 assimilation fluxes generally enrich while soil CO 2 respiration fluxes generally deplete the 18 O/ 16 O ratio of atmospheric CO 2. In the model, we parameterised intra canopy transport by exploiting soil-borne 222 Rn as a tracer for turbulent transport. Our approach showed that, in principle, a net ecosystem CO 2 flux can be separated into assimilation and respiration fluxes using oxygen isotopes.

A 10 -ml portion of sample water was put into a 50 -ml Kjeldahl flask with 0. 3 g of mercury(II) sulfate and several pieces of boiling stone, and 25 ml of the reagent-mixture was added. The solution was boiled at 160 ℃ for 30 min, setting a cooling finger inside the neck of the flask. The contents of the flask was transferred into a 50 -ml <b>measuring</b> <b>flask</b> and was diluted with water to the mark. The absorbance of the solution was measured at the wavelength of 630 nm with a 50 -mm glass cell. Beer's law was obeyed over the range of 0 〜 1000 ppm COD. The calibration curves using glycine, glucose, ethanol and starch, as the reference, gave their slope of 7. 05 × 10 ^ as the mean.

The surface morphology of nano-structured silver films and the grain sizes of silver agglomerates were analyzed by atomic force microscope (AFM).

40|$|We {{established}} and evaluated a flask air sampling system on a cargo C- 130 H aircraft, {{as well as}} a trace gas measurement system for the flask samples, as part of a new operational monitoring program of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Air samples were collected during each flight, between Kanagawa Prefecture (near Tokyo) and Minamitorishima (an island located nearly 2000 km southeast of Tokyo), from the air-conditioning system on the aircraft. Prior to the operational employment of the sampling system, a quality assurance test of the sampled air was made by specially coordinated flights at a low altitude of 1000 ft over Minamitorishima and comparing the flask values with those obtained at the surface. Based on our storage tests, the flask samples remained nearly stable until analyses. The trace gas measurement system has, in addition to the nondispersive infrared (NDIR) and vacuum ultraviolet resonance fluorescence (VURF) analyzers, two laser-based analyzers using wavelength-scanned cavity ring-down spectroscopy (WS-CRDS) and off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS).

40|$|Small scale shaken bioreactors (e. g. shake flasks) {{traditionally}} {{equipped with}} {{different types of}} sterile closures are very useful tools in biotechnology. The gas transfer coefficient of the sterile closures (kplug) {{plays an important role}} in aeration of shaken bioreactors. The value of kplug depends on the average diffusion coefficient of oxygen (DeO 2) and different lengths or/and diameters of the neck of flask. Therefore, in this study, a series of pipes with different lengths or/and diameters filled with cotton for a special shake flask, so-called ventilation flask, were employed. The gas transfer through the sterile closure of the ventilation flasks was characterized. Constant values of CO 2 and O 2 diffusion coefficient were found in all of the ventilation flasks. Considering these values and the neck geometry, a variety of kplug in ventilation flasks were obtained. Since, decreasing kplug causes a reduction of O 2 concentration and an accumulation of CO 2 in the gas phase of the shaken bioreactors, a realistic understanding and estimation of gas transfer in shaken bioreactors is advantageous to avoid oxygen limitation or carbon dioxide inhibition of a microbial culture. In this study, an unsteady state gas transfer model for shake flasks was developed and experimentally investigated for a wide range of gas transfer coefficients (kplug). The introduced approach is based on the model of Henzler and Schedel [23], which describes the spatially-resolved gas partial pressures inside the sterile closure, affected by the local gas diffusion coefficients and convective Stefan flow. For further easy processing, the resulting total mass transfer coefficient (kplug) is described as a function of the mass flow through the sterile plug (OTRplug) by an empirical equation. This equation is introduced into a simulation model which calculates the gas partial pressures in the head space of the flask. Additionally, the gas transfer rates through the sterile closure and gas-liquid interface inside the flask are provided. Simulations indicate that neglecting the oxygen in the head space volume of the flask at initial conditions (simple steady state assumption) may lead to an underestimation of the oxygen transfer into the liquid phase. The extension of error depends on the conditions. A good agreement between the introduced unsteady state model and experimental results for the sulfite and biological system confirmed the validity and usefulness of the proposed unsteady state approach. Moreover, a novel and easy method for quantification of CO 2 -sensitivity of microorganisms in ventilation flask was investigated, using the properties of ventilation flasks. The differences between the values of accumulated CO 2 and concentration of oxygen in a culture system in ventilation flasks confirmed the validity of method. The effect of aeration on the removal of CO 2 from the fermentation broth has been documented. Additionally, based on the data of the oxygen transfer rate (OTR), obtained by a Respiratory Activity Monitoring System (RAMOS) under a variety of specific aeration rates, the purposed new method was developed as an online monitoring method for CO 2 sensitivity of microorganisms in shaken bioreactors. A maximum accumulated CO 2 concentration of 12 % was derived in both above methods, provided that the cultivation system is carried out under optimal conditions (e. g. the same filling volume (15 m 1), appropriate media and buffer capacity to control the pH, the suitable OTR (0. 05 mol/l/h), operating under non oxygen limitation and RQ¡Ö 1). The proper operation condition could be predicted using the unsteady state model. Applying these mentioned method, a significant effect of accumulated CO 2 on the biomass concentration, growth rate and lysine product in the fermentation of C. glutamicum DM 1730 was found. Furthermore, the experimental results on Arxula adeninivorans LS 3 and Hansenula polymorpha (WT ATCC 34438 and RB 11 -FMD-GFP) indicated that the CO 2 had no effect on these microorganisms. Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 50090 on yeast extract + glucose and Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC WT 13032 on L-lactate were found to be especially sensitive to CO 2, which agree with literature. Some of the important advantages of the new methods are simplicity, lower cost and time consumption, easy of handling and producing similar results as large scale fermentation. Besides, a new aeration strategy from the ventilation flasks to an aerated fermentation system (e. g. <b>measuring</b> <b>flask</b> and stirred tank fermentor) was developed, based on the same concentration of gas compounds (O 2 and CO 2) in the headspace of these vessels. By applying this method, the concentrations of CO 2 and O 2 in the gas phase obtained from measuring (aerated) flasks and stirred tank bioreactors were comparable to those obtained from ventilation flasks. Finally in this study a new scale up method from shake flasks to stirred tank bioreactors, concerning the aeration strategy, was investigated based on the effect of CO 2 ventilation. Even for different sets of aerations, similar trends were found for the values of the biomass concentration, L-lysine formation, maximum OTR and specific growth rate for fermentation of C. glutamicum DM 1730 as a model organism, in the both scales. Thus, the possibility of scaling up from ventilation flasks to stirred tank bioreactors based on CO 2 ventilation criterion was demonstrated...|$|E

The experimental solubility of GLZ was <b>measured</b> by shake <b>flask</b> method and resulting data was correlated with the modified Apelblat model at each temperature studied. Good correlation was observed between the experimental data of GLZ and calculated one with absolute relative deviation in the range of (0. 050 to 5. 680) %. The correlation coefficients were observed in the range of 0. 9966 to 0. 9995 which indicated good fitting of experimental solubility data. The lowest mole fraction solubility of GLZ was observed in pure water (1. 9 × 10 – 6 at 298. 15 K) whereas the highest one was observed in pure Transcutol (11. 9 × 10 – 3 at 298. 15 K). The enthalpies and entropies for GLZ dissolution were observed as positive values in the range of (15. 742 to 40. 551) kJ mol– 1 and (52. 801 to 121. 721) J mol– 1 K– 1, respectively in all sample matrices.

50|$|Although {{forms of}} {{pre-packaged}} paper cartridges {{go back to}} the Middle Ages, their extra cost and small benefit to civilian users discouraged wide-spread adoption of them except for militia duty. For example, on April 19, 1775, in Lexington and Concord, paper cartridges were routinely used by many civilians on the opening day of the American Revolutionary War. Similarly, the British soldiers there carried cartridge boxes holding 36 paper cartridges. The advantage of paper cartridges was speed; 3 to 4 rounds a minute were possible using paper cartridges. Measuring each charge before firing reduced the rate of fire to about one round per minute. There were other methods, including small cloth bags containing the correct amount of powder for a single shot, that might be carried on a bandolier (again requiring a container for a supply for refilling). An important safety concern was that when reloading a muzzle-loading gun soon after a shot there might be small pieces of wadding burning in the muzzle, which would cause the new load of powder to ignite as a flash. So long as no part of the loader faced the end of the barrel this was not dangerous in itself, but if a spark reached the main supply in the powder flask a fatal explosion was likely. Various precautions were taken, both in the design and use of powder <b>measures</b> used with <b>flasks,</b> or in the flasks themselves, to prevent this from happening. The inside and outside of a powder horn were often polished to make the horn translucent so that the soldier would be able to see how much powder he had left.|$|R
40|$|Thermo-mechanical (TMP) and chemo-thermo-mechanical pulps (CTMP) were {{prepared}} from pine wood and from UF-bonded MDF made from pine wood. For preparing TMP pine chips {{as well as}} UF-bonded MDF were digested under pressure at 170 degrees C. Thereafter, the digested chips and MDF were defibrated at 170 degrees C using a single disc refiner. CTMP was prepared from pine wood with 0. 25 % NaOH (based on dry wood) under the conditions set forth above. CTMP was also made from MDF under two conditions using 0. 15 % sodium hydroxide (% based on dry MDF) and a mixture of sodium sulphite (1 %) and sodium hydroxide (0. 25 %). The pulps show distinct differences in their properties: TMP from UF-bonded MDF shows lower extractive content in cold and hot water, lower pH-value and higher buffering capacity towards alkali of the cold water extractives than the CTMP counterpart. Moreover, CTMP prepared by using sodium hydroxide alone as a pulping agent increases the content of formate and acetate ions in the cold water extractives. The use of a mixture of sodium sulfite and sodium hydroxide as a pulping agent decreases, however, significantly the content of formate and acetate ions in the cold water extractives. This {{may be due to}} the buffering action of sodium sulfite. In general, CTMP decreases the formaldehyde release of the fibres, as <b>measured</b> by the <b>flask</b> method. In presence of sodium sulfite as a pulping agent for recycled MDF, the formaldehyde release is slashed to almost 30 % of its original value. The formaldehyde release of CTMP from UF-bonded boards seems to be in the same range as that of TMP from virgin wood...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{emissions}} from Tatun volcanic group, northern Taiwan, were studied {{for the first}} time using a multi-component gas analyser system (Multi-GAS) in combination with Giggenbach flask methods at fumaroles and mud pools at Da-you-keng (DYK) and Geng-tze-ping (GZP). CO 2 /S molar ratios observed at DYK ranged from 3 - 17, similar ratios were observed using a Multi-GAS sensor box of 8 - 16. SO 2 at GZP was low, higher concentrations were observed at DYK where SO 2 /H 2 S ratios were close to 1 for both methods. A lower CO 2 /H 2 S ratio was <b>measured</b> via Giggenbach <b>flask</b> sampling (7. 2) than was found in the plume using the gas sensor at GZP (9. 2). This may reflect rapid oxidation of H 2 S as it mixes with background air. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) levels were observed in the fumarole gases using a portable mercury spectrometer. These are the first such measurements of mercury at Tatun. Mean GEM concentrations in the fumarole plumes were ∼ 20  ng m- 3, with much higher concentrations observed close to the ground (mean [GEM] 130 and 290  ng m- 3 at DYK and GZP, respectively). The GEM in the fumarole plume was elevated above concentrations in industrial/urban air in northern Taiwan and the increase in GEM observed when the instrument was lowered suggests high levels of mercury are present in the surrounding ground surface. The GEM/CO 2 (10 - 8) and GEM/S (10 - 6) ratios observed in the fumarole gases were comparable to those observed at other low-temperature fumaroles. Combining the Hg/CO 2 ratio with a previous CO 2 flux value for the area, the annual GEM flux from the Tatun field is estimated as 5 - 50  kg/year. © 2008 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the rising}} amounts of {{greenhouse}} gases in the atmosphere, preventing CO 2 emissions has become increasingly important. The combustion of fossil fuels for energy production and transportation is a large contributor to the problem. One {{of the ways to}} reduce the amounts of CO 2 being released from combustion is carbon capture and storage (CCS). Post-combustion is the capturing method which has been deemed the easiest to apply to existing power plants {{in a short period of}} time. Absorption of CO 2 by MEA is the most common method used in post-combustion carbon capture, but there are still many aspects of the process that are not fully understood. Understanding the absorption mechanisms will make it easier to make more economical and environmentally friendly choices in the future. In this thesis the oxidative degradation of monoethanolamine (MEA) has been studied using an open batch setup. The stability of MEA has been studied under different temperatures and concentrations of oxygen in the gas stream. These experiments give a matrix of experiments performed at 55, 65 and 75 &# 176;C, with oxygen concentrations of 6, 21, 50 and 98 % in the gas stream. To monitor how well the experimental results could be trusted, the water balance was maintained throughout the experiments, and the pH was <b>measured</b> in the <b>flasks</b> capturing volatile degradation compounds. To get a detailed picture of the degradation, the weight percent of nitrogen and the CO 2 concentration has been found in the end samples, and the alkalinity and MEA concentration was found for all the samples. 11 known degradation compounds have been monitored for the different experiments, and the conditions these compounds are formed at have been compared with the suggested reaction mechanisms. 4 of the products were analyzed as anions using Ion chromatography (IC), and 7 secondary reaction products were analyzed as part of a degradation mix in LC-MS. The dependency of these compounds to temperature and oxygen conditions has been discussed. The primary degradation compounds seems to show a more direct correlation to oxygen flow or temperature, while the secondary degradation reaction shows a bigger variation of temperature and oxygen dependency relative to the conditions of the experiments. Various analytical methods for determination of the known compounds were used to determine the concentration of the degradation compounds in the experiments. The accuracy of these methods was investigated, and the results investigated for both LC-MS, GC-MS and IC-EC, showed large variations. Mixing experiments were performed to investigate the unknown mechanism of N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) glycine. </p...|$|R
40|$|Filamentous or {{biopolymer}} producing microorganisms {{are currently}} gaining importance {{due to their}} huge potential regarding worldwide sustainability issues. An economic industrial screening of these organisms is essential for determining the best producing microbial strains or fermentation conditions. It is known that filaments and biopolymers massively influence viscosity of the fermentation broth, thereby affecting the oxygen supply for microorganisms. In literature, the influence of viscosity is well documented for the oxygen transfer in stirred tank fermentations, however, {{little is known about}} the influence of viscosity on gas/liquid oxygen transfer in shake flask cultures. Even the effective shear rate in shake flasks was never systematically investigated, although it influences the apparent viscosity, mixing as well as mass and heat transfer. Since unknown oxygen transfer rates and unknown effective shear rates pose the risk of screening and producing under unfavorable conditions, this work addresses this lack of knowledge. Four objectives were pursued within this study. First, measurements and numerical simulations of the oxygen transfer in liquid films adhering on shake flask walls were conducted as a function of viscosity and film thickness. Thereby, the suitability of the widely applied film theory of Higbie was studied. It was demonstrated that Higbie’s film theory does not apply for cultivations which occur at viscosities up to 10 mPa·s. For the first time, it was experimentally shown that the maximum oxygen transfer capacity OTRmax counter-intuitively increases in shake flasks when viscosity is increased from 1 mPa·s to 10 mPa·s, leading to an improved oxygen supply for microorganisms. Additionally, the OTRmax at viscosities of up to 80 mPa·s is not significantly lower than the OTRmax at waterlike viscosities. This is contrary to stirred tanks, where the oxygen supply is steadily reduced to only 5 % at 80 mPa·s. Second, a first shear rate correlation for shake flasks – valid for a wide range of pseudo-plastic flow behaviors, shake flask sizes and operating conditions – was developed as a function of viscosity on the basis of Buckingham’s π-theorem and experimental data. It was found that effective shear rates in shake flasks commonly cover a range from 20 1 /s to 2000 1 /s. The precise applicability of the developed shear rate correlation was demonstrated for three different shake flask fermentations. Depending on the broth’s flow behavior, the effective shear rate in shake flasks is at least 1. 55 times higher than that in stirred tank reactors operated at the same volumetric power input, leading to a potentially 50 % lower apparent viscosity in shake flasks. Third, a novel concept of microtiter plates (MTP) in 96 -well, 48 -well and 24 -well format was developed preventing spill-out of the rotating liquid even at high shaking frequencies and high filling volumes. In spite of the fact that high filling volumes per well are often desirable for offline analytics during screening procedures, as yet, low filling volumes per well have to be adjusted to prevent spill-out and to overcome insufficient oxygen transfer in conventional MTPs. In prototypes of the newly developed MTP, preliminary measurements of the OTRmax were conducted using a sulfite system. With respect to the OTRmax, the advantages of the novel MTP could clearly be displayed for ranges of filling volume and shaking frequency where conventional MTPs spill out: Whereas extreme shaking conditions are needed for the novel 96 -well type to reach a higher OTRmax compared to the conventional one, the novel 48 -well and 24 -well formats are already advantageous at moderate shaking conditions. This is due to the influence of the surface tension which becomes less dominant the larger the well diameter is. The biocompatibility of the novel MTP type was proven by Escherichia coli fermentations. Due to higher achievable oxygen transfer rates and, thus, faster C-source consumption compared to cultures in the conventional MTP, the new MTP even showed the potential of shortening the fermentation time. Hence, a suitable MTP concept was found for applications in high-throughput screenings where high sample volumes are required. Fourth, a scale-down was conducted requested by an industrial collaboration partner. To achieve time and cost efficient high-throughput for strain screening, an established shake flask protocol was scaled down into MTP. An approach based on an oxygen-consuming sulfite system was applied to ensure equal OTRmax-values in MTPs and shake flasks. Obtained sulfite datasets were used to identify operating conditions leading to the same oxygen supply for the model organism Trichoderma reesei in shake flasks and 24 -well MTPs. For 24 -well MTPs, the shake flask OTRmax of 20 mmol/L/h of the industrial protocol was obtained under the following optimal operating conditions: 1 mL filling volume per well, 200 rpm shaking frequency and 50 mm shaking diameter. With the identified operating conditions almost identical oxygen transfer rates and product concentrations were <b>measured</b> in shake <b>flasks</b> and 24 -well MTP cultures as a function of fermentation time. The proposed sulfite approach is a fast and accurate means to scale-down established screening procedures into MTPs to achieve high-throughput. The obtained insights into oxygen transfer and effective shear rates in viscous systems are valuable for explaining existing deviations in screening and production results. Ultimately, by means of consistent scale-up and scale-down procedures, economic bioprocess development is facilitated with the results of this study...|$|R
