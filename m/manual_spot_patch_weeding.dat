50|$|The {{segment of}} I-264 from Dixie Highway to the {{northwest}} I-64 interchange opened in segments from 1970 to August 1974 and received no more than emergency or <b>spot</b> <b>patching.</b> After several years of planning, in early 2003, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet began a rehabilitation project on this segment of Interstate Highway stretching from the Dixie Highway interchange northwest to just east of Bank Street.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{potential}} use of multi-spectral high-spatial resolution QuickBird imagery to detect cruciferous <b>weed</b> <b>patches</b> in winter wheat fields. In the present study, {{research was conducted}} on six individual naturally infested fields (field-scale study: field area ranging between 3 and 52 ha) and on a QuickBird-segmented winter wheat image (broad-scale study: area covering approximately 263 winter wheat fields, approximately 2 656 ha) located {{in the province of}} Cordoba (southern Spain). To evaluate the feasibility of mapping cruciferous <b>weed</b> <b>patches</b> in both the field-scale and broad-scale studies, two supervised classification methods were used: the Maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and vegetation indices. Then, the best classification methods were selected to develop in-season site-specific cruciferous <b>weed</b> <b>patch</b> treatment maps. The analysis showed that cruciferous <b>weed</b> <b>patches</b> were accurately discriminated in both field-scale and broad-scale scenarios. Thus, considering the broad-scale study, classification accuracies of 91. 3 and 89. 45...|$|R

5000|$|Spot seeding {{requires}} less seed than {{broadcast seeding}} {{and tends to}} achieve more uniform spacing, albeit sometimes with clumping. The devices used in Ontario for <b>manual</b> <b>spot</b> seeding are the [...] "oil can" [...] seeder, seeding sticks, and shakers. The oil can is a container fitted with a long spout through which a predetermined number of seeds are released with each flick of the seeder.|$|R

40|$|Fluorescent protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (F 1 -SpA) acts on the IgG receptors of {{guinea-pig}} lymphocytes (GPL) {{and human}} lymphoid cells (Seraphina) to induce a redistribution pattern (multiple <b>spots,</b> <b>patches,</b> expelled material, caps) {{similar to the}} membrane staining of some living cells with anti-IgG. No ring staining was observed, which implies that F 1 -SpA acts as a multivalent cross-linking agent on IgG receptors. A prozone effect dependent on F 1 -SpA concentration was observed...|$|R

30|$|This study {{concerns}} the detection and localization of <b>weed</b> <b>patches</b> {{in order to}} improve the knowledge on weed-crop competition. A remote control aircraft provided with a camera allowed to obtain low cost and repetitive information. Different processings were involved to detect <b>weed</b> <b>patches</b> using spatial then spectral methods. First, a shift of colorimetric base allowed to separate the soil and plant pixels. Then, a specific algorithm including Gabor filter was applied to detect crop rows on the vegetation image. <b>Weed</b> <b>patches</b> were then deduced from the comparison of vegetation and crop images. Finally, the development of a multispectral acquisition device is introduced. First results for the discrimination of weeds and crops using the spectral properties are shown from laboratory tests. Application of neural networks were mostly studied.|$|R

40|$|Through use of <b>manual</b> <b>spot</b> {{densitometry}} values {{derived from}} multitemporal 1 : 24, 000 color infrared aircraft photography, areas {{as small as}} one hectare in the Cumberland Plateau in Kentucky were accurately classified into one of eight ground cover groups. If distinguishing between undisturbed and disturbed forest areas is the sole criterion of interest, classification results are highly accurate if based on imagery taken during foliated ground cover conditions. Multiseasonal imagery analysis was superior to single data analysis, and transparencies from prefoliated conditions gave better separation of conifers and hardwoods than did those from foliated conditions...|$|R

50|$|Kentucky warblers nest on {{the ground}} hidden {{at the base of}} a shrub or in a <b>patch</b> of <b>weeds</b> in an area of ample vegetation. The female will lay between 3 and 6 eggs, which are white or cream-colored and {{speckled}} with brown. Incubation is done by the female only, and lasts for about 12 days. The young Kentucky warblers usually leave the nest about 10 days after hatching.|$|R
50|$|Weed infestations are {{concentrated}} in areas of previous disturbance, particularly in past grazing areas, and along current agricultural boundaries. The reserves contain limited discrete <b>patches</b> of <b>weeds</b> including Patersonâ€™s curse (Echium plantagineum) and horehound (Marrubium vulgare). Bridal creeper (Myrsiphyllum asparagoides) occurs along roadsides adjacent to Ingalba Nature Reserve. There have also been minor occurrences of bathurst burr (Xanthium spinosum), galvanised burr (Scerolaena birchii), saffron thistle (Carthamus lanatus) and of pasture species.|$|R
