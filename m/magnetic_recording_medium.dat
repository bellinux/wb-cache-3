40|$|Graduation date: 2016 In {{the past}} few decades, <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> {{has been used as}} a {{dominant}} solution for massive data storage due to its large capacity, excellent reliability and low cost. Nowadays, exponentially increasing user-generated information is creating a huge demand as well as great challenges for high density data storage solutions. For high density <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording,</b> or more specifically, for hard disk drives, the bit size of the <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> has to be reduced. This requires the medium to have an increased coercivity to avoid data loss due to thermal instability. However, data recording in a high coercivity medium is challenging due to the limited practicable write field. Therefore, the requirements of high coercivity for data stability and low coercivity for writeability are conflicting. During the last 15 years, enormous research and engineering efforts have been invested in heat-assisted <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> and bit-patterned media, endeavoring to solve this contradiction. In this dissertation we take an alternative approach and demonstrate that acoustic wave, or strain wave, could be used to address the tradeoff between writeability and stability. This technique is called acoustically assisted <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording.</b> The physics behind this technique is based on the inverse magnetostriction effect or Villari effect, by which the coercivity of a magnetostrictive material can be modified by strain. In operation, a surface acoustic wave is applied to a <b>recording</b> <b>medium,</b> where the resulting acoustic strain temporarily lowers the coercivity (thus makes it magnetically soft), enabling data to be recorded with a lower write field. The medium regains its high coercivity after the acoustic wave is removed and thus becomes magnetically hard for data stability. An experimental device consisting of an interdigitated transducer is designed and fabricated on a piezoelectric quartz substrate for generating the surface acoustic wave. Galfenol film with high magnetostriction is deposited as the <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> on the same substrate. The acoustic wave propagates in the galfenol film and the resulting strain is measured by laser interferometry. In the proof-of-principle experiments for acoustically assisted <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording,</b> data are recorded in a strained magnetostrictive medium with a smaller write field than when it is unstrained. The required write field strength is lowered by 10...|$|R
