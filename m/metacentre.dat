50|$|When a ship heels, {{the centre}} of {{buoyancy}} of the ship moves laterally. It might also move up or down {{with respect to the}} water line. The point at which a vertical line through the heeled centre of buoyancy crosses the line through the original, vertical centre of buoyancy is the <b>metacentre.</b> The <b>metacentre</b> remains directly above {{the centre of}} buoyancy by definition. In the diagram, the two Bs show the centres of buoyancy of a ship in the upright and heeled conditions, and M is the <b>metacentre.</b> The <b>metacentre</b> is considered to be fixed for small angles of heel; however, at larger angles of heel, the <b>metacentre</b> can no longer be considered fixed, and its actual location must be found to calculate the ship's stability.The <b>metacentre</b> can be calculated using the formulae:Where KB is the centre of buoyancy (height above the keel), I is the Second moment of area of the waterplane in metres4 and V is the volume of displacement in metres3. KM is the distance from the keel to the <b>metacentre.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>metacentre</b> is {{the point}} where the lines {{intersect}} (at angle φ) of the upward force of buoyancy of φ ± dφ. When the ship is vertical, the <b>metacentre</b> lies above the centre of gravity and so moves in the opposite direction of heel as the ship rolls. This distance is also abbreviated as GM. As the ship heels over, the centre of gravity generally remains fixed with respect to the ship because it just depends on the position of the ship's weight and cargo, but the surface area increases, increasing BMφ. Work must be done to roll a stable hull. This is converted to potential energy by raising the centre of mass of the hull with respect to the water level or by lowering the centre of buoyancy or both. This potential energy will be released in order to right the hull and the stable attitude will be where it has the least magnitude. It is the interplay of potential and kinetic energy that results in the ship having a natural rolling frequency. For small angles, the <b>metacentre,</b> Mφ, moves with a lateral component so it is no longer directly over the centre of mass.|$|E
5000|$|There is also {{a similar}} {{consideration}} in {{the movement of the}} <b>metacentre</b> forward and aft as a ship pitches.

50|$|Sailing yachts, {{especially}} racing yachts, {{are designed}} to be stiff, meaning the distance between the centre of mass and the <b>metacentre</b> is very large in order to resist the heeling effect of the wind on the sails. In such vessels, the rolling motion is not uncomfortable because of the moment of inertia of the tall mast and the aerodynamic damping of the sails.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metacentre</b> is {{determined}} by the ratio between the inertia resistance of the boat and the volume of the boat. (The inertia resistance is a quantified description of how the waterline width of the boat resists overturning.) Wide and shallow or narrow and deep hulls have high transverse metacenters (relative to the keel), and the opposite have low metacenters; the extreme opposite is shaped like a log or round bottomed boat.|$|E
5000|$|Stable {{floating}} objects have {{a natural}} rolling frequency, just like a weight on a spring, where the frequency is increased as the spring gets stiffer. In a boat, {{the equivalent of the}} spring stiffness is the distance called [...] "GM" [...] or [...] "metacentric height", being the distance between two points: [...] "G" [...] the centre of gravity of the boat and [...] "M", which is a point called the <b>metacentre.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1816 Beaufoy {{published}} another extensive article {{based on}} his experimental work. On the Stability of Vessels was based on 23 different hull forms tested for their resistance to rolling. The article includes an illustration of his apparatus showing a hull form being subjected to a controlled heeling force with a plumb bob and scale to measure the inclination. The various tables of results show the <b>metacentre.</b> The dichotomy between resistance to rolling and sea keeping is discussed.|$|E
50|$|The {{metacentric}} height (GM) is a {{measurement of the}} initial static stability of a floating body. It is calculated as {{the distance between the}} centre of gravity of a ship and its <b>metacentre.</b> A larger {{metacentric height}} implies greater initial stability against overturning. The metacentric height also influences the natural period of rolling of a hull, with very large metacentric heights being associated with shorter periods of roll which are uncomfortable for passengers. Hence, a sufficiently, but not excessively, high metacentric height is considered ideal for passenger ships.|$|E
50|$|The righting {{couple on}} the ship is {{proportional}} to the horizontal distance between two equal forces. These are gravity acting downwards at the centre of mass and the same magnitude force acting upwards through the centre of buoyancy, and through the <b>metacentre</b> above it. The righting couple {{is proportional to the}} metacentric height multiplied by the sine of the angle of heel, hence the importance of metacentric height to stability. As the hull rights, work is done either by its centre of mass falling, or by water falling to accommodate a rising centre of buoyancy, or both.|$|E
50|$|Many {{witnesses}} {{testified that}} the ship had a very long roll (a reluctance to right herself after leaning into a swell). One passenger on her maiden voyage said that when in the Southern Ocean she developed a list to starboard {{to such an extent}} that water would not run out of the baths, and she held this list for several hours before rolling upright. This passenger, physicist Professor William Bragg, concluded that the ship's <b>metacentre</b> was just below her centre of gravity. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.|$|E
50|$|The {{summation}} {{of all the}} weights is {{an important aspect of}} the stability of a ship. Fixtures, fittings, masts, rigging, crew, ballast, etc., will have affect on a ships stability based on their individual moments about the centreline of the ship. These weights will act as a downward force on the vertical centreline (imagining a line drawn through the centre of the ship and the <b>metacentre</b> is the point in the middle). The centre of the submerged part of the hull, acts as an upward force on the vertical centreline, and so these two forces have to be balanced with the sea at the waterline of the ship when it is at rest.|$|E
5000|$|However Saw Swee Hock, a {{statistician}} and demographer {{quoted in}} the Straits Times in 2008, argued the demographic transition [...] "was rapid because of the government's strong population control measures," [...] but also admitted that, [...] "even without the Stop at Two policy, the fertility rate would have gone below 2.1 due to demographic transition." [...] When demographic transition statistics are examined - in 1960, the total fertility rate was approximately ~6 - Asian <b>MetaCentre</b> researcher Theresa Wong notes that Singaporean birth rates and death rates fell dramatically in a period that occurred over [...] "much shorter time period than in Western countries," [...] yet {{such a short time}} frame is also seen in other Southeast Asian countries, where family planning campaigns were much less aggressive. According to Saw Swee Hock, [...] "the measures were comprehensive and strong, but they weren't reversed quickly enough".|$|E

5000|$|The <b>metacentre</b> has {{a direct}} {{relationship}} with a ships rolling period. A ship with a small GM will be [...] "tender" [...] - have a long roll period. An excessively low or negative GM {{increases the risk of}} a ship capsizing in rough weather, for example HMS Captain or the Vasa. It also puts the vessel at risk of potential for large angles of heel if the cargo or ballast shifts, such as with the Cougar Ace. A ship with low GM is less safe if damaged and partially flooded because the lower metacentric height leaves less safety margin. For this reason, maritime regulatory agencies such as the International Maritime Organization specify minimum safety margins for seagoing vessels. A larger metacentric height on the other hand can cause a vessel to be too [...] "stiff"; excessive stability is uncomfortable for passengers and crew. This is because the stiff vessel quickly responds to the sea as it attempts to assume the slope of the wave. An overly stiff vessel rolls with a short period and high amplitude which results in high angular acceleration. This increases the risk of damage to the ship and to cargo and may cause excessive roll in special circumstances where eigenperiod of wave coincide with eigenperiod of ship roll. Roll damping by bilge keels of sufficient size will reduce the hazard. Criteria for this dynamic stability effect remain to be developed. In contrast, a [...] "tender" [...] ship lags behind the motion of the waves and tends to roll at lesser amplitudes. A passenger ship will typically have a long rolling period for comfort, perhaps 12 seconds while a tanker or freighter might have a rolling period of 6 to 8 seconds.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the current method for calculating a ship's vertical centre of gravity following inclining experiments is limited when considering magnitude of applied heel angle and accuracy achieved for certain hull-forms due to the assumption of unchanged <b>metacentre</b> position when the vessel is heeled. New methods for calculating the have been proposed, notably the Generalised and the Graphical methods. This paper aims to test these methods {{on a range of}} vessels, as well as present and contrast a new method named, the Polar method. The test will establish the error potential for each method using a purely technical software-simulated inclining experiment. Using the established error potential, a corrected is calculated from actual inclining values, which have been evaluated against the loading conditions for each vessel to see if the stability margins have been compromised. The study confirms the Classical method's dependency on applied heel angle magnitude, the change in waterplane area and that it compromises safety in some cases. The other methods, especially the Generalised and the Polar, produce very accurate results for any floating position of the vessel, highlighting the need to tear down the wall-sided assumption implicit in the Classical method and replace it with the better and more flexible methods...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEven {{though the}} {{buoyancy}} force (also {{known as the}} Archimedes force) {{has always been an}} important topic of academic studies in physics, its point of application has not been explicitly identified yet. We present a quantitative approach to this problem based on the concept of the hydrostatic energy, considered here for a general shape of the cross-section of a floating body and for an arbitrary angle of heel. We show that the location of the point of application of the buoyancy force essentially depends (i) on the type of motion experienced by the floating body and (ii) on the definition of this point. In a rolling/pitching motion, considerations involving the rotational moment lead to a particular dynamical point of application of the buoyancy force, and for some simple shapes of the floating body this point coincides with the well-known <b>metacentre.</b> On the other hand, from the work–energy relation it follows that in the rolling/pitching motion the energetical point of application of this force is rigidly connected to the centre of buoyancy; in contrast, in a vertical translation this point is rigidly connected to the centre of gravity of the body. Finally, we consider the location of the characteristic points of the floating bodies for some particular shapes of immersed cross-sections.

40|$|AbstractA {{completely}} simple subsemigroup K of {{a completely}} simple semigroup S {{is a normal}} subsemigroup of S, or S is a normal extension of K, if x− 1 Kx ⊆ K (x ϵ S). A normal extension S of K is an essential extension if each non-trivial congruence on S restricts to a non-trivial congruence on K. For any completely simple semigroup S, the union Φ(S) of the automorphism groups of the maximal subgroups of S is endowed with a semigroup structure such that the mapping θs of each element of S to the associated inner automorphism of the maximal subgroup containing it is a homomorphism of S into φ(S). It is shown that S has a maximal essential extension {{if and only if}} the <b>metacentre</b> of S (that is, the union of the centres of the maximal subgroups) is simply the set of idempotents of S. When such a maximal essential extension T exists, θs is one-to-one and there exists a monomorphism of T onto Φ(S) extending θs. A related semigroup ∑(S) whose elements are transformations of S with certain special properties (such as H-class preserving, isomorphisms on ℘-classes) is introduced and studied. A homomorphism of S into the product of ∑(S) and its left-right dual is constructed which induces the same congruence on S as θs...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{different}} sources of uncertainty in population forecasting, uncertain {{changes in the}} structure of heterogeneous populations have received little attention so far, although they can have significant impacts. Here we focus on the effect of changes in the educational composition of the population on the overall fertility of the population in the presence of strong fertility differentials by education. With data from India we show that alternative paths of future female enrolment in education result in significantly different total fertility rates (TFR) for the country over the coming decades, even assuming identical fertility trends within each education group. These results from multi-state population projections by education are then translated into a fully probabilistic population projection for India in which the results of alternative education scenarios are assumed to expand the uncertainty range of the future TFR in the total population. This first attempt to endogenize structural change with respect to education - which is the greatest measurable source of fertility heterogeneity in Asia - has resulted from a larger exercise of the Asian <b>MetaCentre</b> for Population and Sustainable Development Analysis to collect empirical information, scientific arguments as well as informed opinions about likely future population trends in Asia from a large number of population experts in the region. In this process, future changes in the educational composition of the population have been identified as a key driver of future fertility. The actual probabilistic population projections for India show that with high certainty, the Indian population will continue to grow to about 1. 3 billion over the next quarter of a century. After that the uncertainty will get much wider, ranging from a continued strong increase to the beginning of a population decline in India...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} point of {{application}} A of the buoyancy force (also known as the Archimedes force) by using two different definitions of {{the point of}} application of a force, derived one from the work-energy relation and another one from the equation of motion. We present a quantitative approach to this issue based {{on the concept of}} the hydrostatic energy, considered for a general shape of the immersed cross-section of the floating body. We show that the location of A depends on the type of motion experienced by the body. In particular, in vertical translation, from the work-energy viewpoint, this point is fixed with respect to the centre of gravity G of the body. In contrast, in rolling/pitching motion there is duality in the location of A; indeed, the work-energy relation implies A to be fixed with respect to the centre of buoyancy C, while from considerations involving the rotational moment it follows that A is located at the <b>metacentre</b> M. We obtain analytical expressions of the location of M for a general shape of the immersed cross-section of the floating body and for an arbitrary angle of heel. We show that three different definitions of M viz., the ?geometrical? one, as the centre of curvature of the buoyancy curve, the Bouguer's one, involving the moment of inertia of the plane of flotation, and the ?dynamical? one, involving the second derivative of the hydrostatic energy, refer to one and the same special point, and we demonstrate a close relation between the height of M above the line of flotation and the stability of the floating body. Finally, we provide analytical expressions and graphs of the buoyancy, flotation and metacentric curves as functions of the angle of heel, for some particular shapes of the floating bodies.
