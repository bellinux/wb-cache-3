5|$|Some {{types of}} dive profile have been named. An {{analysis}} of dive profiles logged by dive computers by the Divers Alert Network used categorization rules which {{were based on}} the fraction of the dive time spent in four depth zones: descent, bottom, <b>multilevel,</b> and decompression. The descent zone was defined as the part of the dive between the surface and first reaching 85% of the maximum depth. The bottom zone is the part of the dive deeper than 85% of maximum depth. The <b>multilevel</b> zone is ascent from 85% to 25% of maximum depth, and the decompression zone is less than 25% of maximum cepth. A square dive was defined as having more than 40% of the total dive time in the bottom zone and not more than 30% in the <b>multilevel</b> and decompression zones. A <b>multilevel</b> was defined as having at least 40% of the total dive time in the <b>multilevel</b> zone. All other dives are considered to be intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Numerically {{controlled}} oscillators offer {{several advantages}} over {{other types of}} oscillators in terms of agility, accuracy, stability and reliability. NCOs are used in many communications systems including digital up/down converters used in 3G wireless and software radio systems, digital PLLs, radar systems, drivers for optical or acoustic transmissions, and <b>multilevel</b> FSK/PSK modulators/demodulators.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} evolutionary synthesis (EES) is {{an extension}} of the Modern Synthesis of evolution which revisits the relative importance of different factors at play in evolutionary theory. EES includes concepts and mechanisms such as <b>multilevel</b> selection theory, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, niche construction and evolvability.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} from the US Navy tables is that the repetitive group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment. The Huggins repetitive group indicates {{a percentage of the}} M0 for the most saturated tissue, and this is intended to make the tables more applicable to <b>multilevel</b> diving procedures.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 1996, the Seattle City Council {{designated}} the exterior and {{roof of the}} original 1931 building as a Seattle city landmark, having approved a recommendation from the Landmarks Preservation Board. The move was prompted by a long-term proposal from The Seattle Times Company to redevelop their land in South Lake Union, {{at a cost of}} $150 million while preserving the historic character of the two buildings. The plans included two 10-story office buildings, a larger printing plant, and a <b>multilevel</b> parking garage.|$|E
5|$|The Theater District is a 17-block area in {{the center}} of {{downtown}} Houston that is home to the Bayou Place entertainment complex, restaurants, movies, plazas, and parks. Bayou Place is a large <b>multilevel</b> building containing full-service restaurants, bars, live music, billiards, and Sundance Cinema. The Bayou Music Center stages live concerts, stage plays, and stand-up comedy.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the dive}} site and {{underwater}} topography permit, divers often prefer to descend to maximum depth and slowly ascend throughout the dive. A slow ascent, and therefore slow pressure reduction, {{is a good}} decompression practice. When using a dive computer this type of profile may not require additional decompression stops. Dive computers, unlike decompression tables, measure depth and time at short intervals during the dive and calculate the exact decompression indicated by the decompression model, which for a <b>multilevel</b> profile will be less than for the square profile with the same maximum depth and duration.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, {{more than}} half a century after the modern synthesis, Massimo Pigliucci called for an {{extended}} evolutionary synthesis to incorporate aspects of biology that had not been included or had not existed in the mid-20th century. It revisits the relative importance of different factors, challenges assumptions made in the modern synthesis, and adds new factors such as <b>multilevel</b> selection, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, niche construction, and evolvability.|$|E

25|$|I/O {{researchers}} employ quantitative statistical methods. Quantitative {{methods used}} in I/O psychology include correlation, multiple regression, {{and analysis of}} variance. More advanced statistical methods employed in I/O research include logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; also known as <b>multilevel</b> modeling). I/O research has also employed meta-analysis. I/O psychologists also employ psychometric methods including methods associated with classical test theory, generalizability theory, and item response theory (IRT).|$|E
25|$|The {{rapid and}} {{sustained}} increases in computing power {{starting from the}} second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical algorithms, caused an increased interest in nonlinear models (such as neural networks) as well as the creation of new types, such as generalized linear models and <b>multilevel</b> models.|$|E
25|$|In August 2016, {{media reports}} based on {{briefings}} by Western intelligence agencies suggested that ISIL had a <b>multilevel</b> secret service known in Arabic as Emni, established in 2014, {{that has become}} a combination of an internal police force and an external operations directorate complete with regional branches. The unit was believed to be under the overall command of ISIL's most senior Syrian operative, spokesman and propaganda chief Abu Mohammad al-Adnani until his death by airstrike in late August 2016.|$|E
25|$|The three-level {{air system}} was a {{significant}} improvement, but better results were required. Use of CFD models offered a new insight of air system workings. The first {{to develop a new}} air system was Kvaerner (Tampella) with their 1990 <b>multilevel</b> secondary air in Kemi, Finland, which was later adapted to a string of large recovery boilers. Kvaerner also patented the four level air system, where additional air level is added above the tertiary air level. This enables significant NOx reduction.|$|E
25|$|Saint Phalle's friend, {{architect}} Mario Botta, built a fortress-like protective {{wall and}} a porthole-shaped gateway {{at the entrance}} to the garden, marking a distinctive separation from the outside world. The entry structure also houses a ticket office, a gift shop, and rest rooms for visitors. Within the park there are fountains, courtyards, a <b>multilevel</b> tower, and many larger-than-life mythical creatures. Saint Phalle designed a brochure containing a map and other information for visitors to the garden, which is open seasonally.|$|E
25|$|The Strong Star Property is an {{alternative}} to the *-Property, in which subjects may write to objects with only a matching security level. Thus, the write-up operation permitted in the usual *-Property is not present, only a write-to-same operation. The Strong Star Property is usually discussed in the context of <b>multilevel</b> database management systems and is motivated by integrity concerns. This Strong Star Property was anticipated in the Biba model where it was shown that strong integrity in combination with the Bellâ€“LaPadula model resulted in reading and writing at a single level.|$|E
25|$|The stadium, {{designed}} by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, was built within an artificial landfill (over the refuse) {{to eliminate the}} need for <b>multilevel</b> ramps. As a result, construction took just nine months and cost approximately $2.3million. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars was contributed by the Autzen Foundation, headed by Thomas E. Autzen, son of Portland lumberman and philanthropist Thomas J. Autzen (1888â€“1958), for whom the stadium was named. Ironically, Autzen was an alumnus of archrival Oregon State University. The foundation's donation was linked to his son, a UO alumnus from the class of 1943.|$|E
25|$|Bilevel cars {{may not be}} usable in {{countries}} or older railway systems with low loading gauges. With the exception for Bombardier <b>MultiLevel</b> Coaches, this includes much of the rail network in the North East of the USA, which includes the North East Corridor of Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, Metro North and the Long Island Railroad as well as almost the entire British rail network. In some countries such as the UK new lines are built to a higher than the existing structure gauge to allow the use of double-deck trains in future.|$|E
25|$|Statistical methods {{commonly}} used {{in other areas of}} psychology are also used in OHP-related research. Statistical methods used include structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; also known as <b>multilevel</b> modeling). HLM can better adjust for similarities between employees and is especially well suited to evaluating the lagged impact of work stressors on health outcomes; in this research context HLM can help minimize censoring and is well-suited to experience sampling studies. Meta-analyses have been used to aggregate data (modern approaches to meta-analyses rely on HLM), and draw conclusions across multiple studies.|$|E
25|$|Hierarchical {{linear models}} (or <b>multilevel</b> regression) organizes the data into a {{hierarchy}} of regressions, for example where A is regressed on B, and B is regressed on C. It is often used where the variables of interest have a natural hierarchical structure such as in educational statistics, where students are nested in classrooms, classrooms are nested in schools, and schools are nested in some administrative grouping, such as a school district. The response variable might be a measure of student achievement such as a test score, and different covariates would be collected at the classroom, school, and school district levels.|$|E
25|$|Tajin Chico is a <b>multilevel</b> {{portion of}} the site that {{stretches}} north-northwest from the older {{parts of the city}} up a hill. Much of this section was created by using massive amounts of landfill. It is an immense acropolis composed of numerous palaces and other civil structures. There are relatively few temples here. It is also more easily defended than other parts of the city. Tajin Chico is so named because it was initially thought to be a separate but related site. It is now known that it belonged {{to the center of the}} city. However, as the term was already in the literature about the site, it has stuck.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1930s, {{railroads and}} carbuilders were debuting carbody and {{interior}} styles that could only be dreamed of before. In 1937, the Pullman Company delivered the first cars equipped with roomettesâ€”that is, the car's interior was sectioned off into compartments, much like the coaches that were still in widespread use across Europe. Pullman's roomettes, however, were designed with the single traveler in mind. The roomette featured a large picture window, a privacy door, a single fold-away bed, a sink and small toilet. The roomette's floor space was barely larger than the space taken up by the bed, but it allowed the traveler to ride in luxury compared to the <b>multilevel</b> semiprivate berths of old.|$|E
25|$|Geladas live in {{a complex}} <b>multilevel</b> society {{similar to that of}} the hamadryas baboon. The {{smallest}} and most basic groups are the reproductive units, which are made up of one to twelve females, their young and one to four males, and the all-male units, which are made up of two to fifteen males. The next level of gelada societies are the bands, which are made up of two to 27 reproductive units and several all-male units. Herds consist of up to 60 reproductive units that are sometimes from different bands and last for short periods of time. Communities are made of one to four bands whose home ranges overlap extensively. A gelada can typically live to around 20 years old.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{languages}} support {{breaking out}} of nested loops; in theory circles, these are called multi-level breaks. One common use example is searching a multi-dimensional table. This can be done either via <b>multilevel</b> breaks (break out of N levels), as in bash and PHP, or via labeled breaks (break out and continue at given label), as in Java and Perl. Alternatives to <b>multilevel</b> breaks include single breaks, together with a state variable which is tested to break out another level; exceptions, which are caught at the level being broken out to; placing the nested loops in a function and using return to effect termination of the entire nested loop; or using a label and a goto statement. C does not include a <b>multilevel</b> break, and the usual alternative {{is to use a}} goto to implement a labeled break.
