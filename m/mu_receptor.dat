2500|$|Morphine, {{the archetypal}} opioid, and other opioids (e.g., codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, dihydromorphine, pethidine) all exert a similar {{influence}} on the cerebral opioid receptor system.

Naloxone pretreatment was also investigated. Noise stress was produced by a sound source, nociception was measured by the hot-plate test and binding characteristics were evaluated by a radioligand binding technique using membrane preparation from the total frontal cortex.

40|$|Opium, {{the dried}} resin {{obtained}} from the unripe seedpods of the poppy flower, {{has been used for}} medicinal and euphoric purposes since ancient times. Morphine, the main active ingredient of opium, and other clinically useful opioid analgesics all mediate their effects through activating the <b>mu</b> opioid <b>receptor.</b> Studies involving the <b>mu</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> knockout mice showed that the interaction with the <b>mu</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> is also responsible for many notorious side effects associated with these drugs including dependence and addiction. Therefore, selective antagonists for the <b>mu</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> are needed to study its function in drug abuse and addiction. Previously, based on molecular modeling studies and the “message-address” concept, a series of 14 -O-substituted naltrexone derivatives were designed and synthesized. These compounds carried an ester-linked heteroaromatic substitution at the 14 -position of naltrexone which was designed to interact with the putative “address” site, that was identified in the <b>mu</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> through molecular modeling studies. The lead compound of this series was determined to have a high affinity and selectivity for the <b>mu</b> opioid <b>receptor.</b> Because the 14 -O-substituted naltrexone derivatives were not very stable, the ester linkage in these compounds was replaced by an amide one and a series of 14 -N-substituted naltrexone derivatives were synthesized. The affinity and selectivity of these novel naltrexone derivatives were determined in a competitive radioligand binding assay. Interestingly, the 14 -N-substituted naltrexone derivatives did not maintain the high selectivity of the 14 -O-substituted series. It was hypothesized that the conformational constraint introduced by the amide linker was detrimental to the <b>mu</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> selectivity. Therefore, three 14 -N-substituted naltrexone derivatives which carried more flexible linkages were synthesized and evaluated.

40|$|Down-regulation of opiate receptors is {{demonstrated}} more easily in vitro than in vivo. The possible role of endogenous opiate-modulating peptides in preventing such down-regula-tion was investigated by addition of Tyr-W-MIF- 1 to an in vitro preparation, the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY 5 Y, in which down-regulation of opiate receptors has been demon-strated previously. Although both morphine and Met-enkepha-lin down-regulated <b>mu</b> and delta <b>receptors</b> after chronic (24 h) exposure in serum-free medium, Tyr-W-MIF- 1, at doses {{of up to}} 100 mM, did not affect receptor number when administered alone. This lack of effect could not be attributed to degradation of the peptide during chronic treatment because high-perfor-mance liquid chromatography showed that 79 % of the peptide remained intact after a 24 -h incubation. When coadministered with 3 mM morphine, Tyr-W-MIF- 1 dose-dependently attenu-ated morphine-induced down-regulation of both <b>mu</b> and delta <b>receptors.</b> Down-regulation of <b>mu</b> <b>receptors</b> by the selective agonist PL 017 was also attenuated by Tyr-W-MIF- 1, but down-regulation of delta receptors by the selective agonist DPDPE was not. These studies indicate that endogenous opiate mod-ulators {{may play a role}} in opiate tolerance at the level of receptor down-regulation. Differences between in vivo and in vitro preparations in studies of receptor down-regulation may help explain some mechanisms of opiate tolerance. Down-regulation has been easier to demonstrate in vitro than in vivo (Zadina et al., 1995). For example, delta agonists down-regulate receptors in cell lines containing only delta receptors (Chang et al., 1982; Law et al., 1982, 1983), and morphine and <b>mu</b> agonists down-regulate <b>receptors</b> in cell lines containing <b>mu</b> <b>receptors</b> (Werling et al., 1989). Down-regulation of both <b>mu</b> and delta <b>receptors</b> has been demonstrated in the human neuroblas-toma cell lines SH-SY 5 Y and SK-N-SH in response to chronic morphine and selective agonists (Carter and Medzhiradsky...|$|R
