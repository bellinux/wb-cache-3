50|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow {{the damage done to}} the world’s coral, {{artificial}} reefs have been built since the 1950s out of materials ranging from concrete blocks to discarded tires. However, most of these plans have failed to provide a new coral habitat. Most notoriously, the attempt using tires off the shore of Fort Lauderdale has become an environmental disaster. There have been some successes with artificial reefs, but most remain relatively barren compared with natural reefs. The one notable exception is the work of architect/marine scientist Prof. Wolf Hilbertz (born 1938, died 2007) and marine biologist Dr. Thomas J. Goreau (born 1950).Biorock technology arose from experiments in the 1970s when Hilbertz was studying how seashells and reefs grow, by passing electric currents through salt water. In 1974, he found that as the salt water electrolyzes, calcium carbonate (aragonite) combines with magnesium, chloride and hydroxyl ions to slowly form around the cathode, eventually coating the electrode with a material similar in composition to complex <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxychloride</b> <b>cements</b> and as strong as concrete. Over time cathodic protection replaces the negative chloride (Cl-)ion with dissolved bicarbonate (HCO3-) to harden the coating to a hydromagnesite-aragonite mixture with gaseous oxygen being evolved through the porous structure. Later experiments showed that the coatings can thicken at the rate of 5 cm per year. As long as current flows, the structure continues to get larger and stronger. It can also heal itself if damaged, making it particularly useful as a replacement for concrete in hard-to-access locations. High levels of dissolved oxygen make it particularly attractive to marine organisms, particularly fin fish.|$|R

40|$|The {{renovation}} of concrete structures has become popular and necessary in Hong Kong. Innovative cement based repairing materials {{are needed to}} be developed due to the limitations of conventional repairing materials. For instance, polymer-modified cementitious mortar and resin-based mortar are common materials as patch repair for concrete structures. However, drying shrinkage of these repair materials can promote further corrosion of steel reinforcement. Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) has an excellent performance in structural renovation. However, it can fail under high temperature. Because of this, expansive mortar and fire-resistant cement matrix are needed. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>Oxychloride</b> <b>Cement</b> (MOC) {{may be a good}} candidate to be utilized as innovative material because it can harden in air and has very high bond strength with other substances, as well as excellent fire resistance. The objective of this research is to develop <b>Magnesium</b> <b>Oxychloride</b> <b>Cement</b> (MOC) as repairing material of concrete structures. The thesis will firstly discuss some key factors affecting the material properties of MOC. Secondly, two applications of MOC, patch repair mortars and fiber reinforced cement developed in this research, will be introduced. Their mechanical behaviors and effectiveness have been systematically studied. The bond strength of MOC is high enough to rehabilitate the damaged concrete structures. Carbon fiber reinforced cement (CFRC) can increase the flexural capacity of reinforced concrete beams by bonding externally on the bottom surface of concrete. The flexural capacity of RC beams can be enhanced by about 30 %. The experimental results show that the dosage of Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate, the amount of fly ash replacement, molar ratios of magnesium oxide and magnesium chloride, the activity of magnesium oxide and the water content can influence both early and long term behaviors of MOC such as setting times, water resistance, compressive strength, expansion capability, hydrated phases and bond strength.

Then the complex was further {{used as a}} single-source precursor to prepare nearly monodisperse palladium sulfide (PdS) nanoparticles through the high-temperature-induced decomposition in diphenyl ether. Secondly, the influence of dodecanethiol on the product distribution upon heating a Pd(II) -octylamine system was investigated. The molar ratio of octylamine to Pd(II) was fixed at 20 : 1, and the concentration of dodecanethiol was changed systematically. Without thiol ligand, only aggregated Pd(0) particles were obtained due to the reduction of Pd(II) by octylamine. When the molar ratio of dodecanethiol to Pd(II) was increased to 0. 5, highly monodisperse sulfurized palladium nanoparticles with diameter 7. 55 [plus or minus] 0. 73 nm were generated. When the molar ratio reached to 2, only a thiolate complex-[Pd(SC[subscript] 12 H[subscript] 25) [subscript] 2][subscript] 6 was found as the final product. Thirdly, we report a facile method to prepare nearly monodisperse Pd nanoparticles by heating Pd(II) ions in 4 -tert-butyltoluene solvent, {{in the presence of}} oleylamine and trioctylphosphine (TOP) ligands. It has been found the concentration of TOP ligand was highly pivotal for the formation of Pd nanoparticles. Without TOP, only aggregated Pd particles were obtained due to the reduction of Pd(II) by oleylamine. When the molar ratio of TOP to Pd(II) was less than two, well-protected Pd nanoparticles were obtained. However, when the molar ratio reached to two, only Pd(II) -TOP coordination complexes were obtained as the final product.

Compared with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening systems, a FRIP strengthening system possesses improved fire resistance but its performance depends largely on appropriate inorganic paste selection. This paper presents a comparative study of four typical inorganic pastes, made from the following: (1) magnesium phosphate cement (MPC), (2) <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxychloride</b> <b>cement</b> (MOC), (3) geopolymer (GP) cement (i. e., alkali-activated slag cement), and (4) polymer-modified mortar (PMM).

40|$|In {{the most}} {{general sense of}} the word, a cement is a binder, a {{substance}} which sets and hardens independently, and can bind other materials together. The name "cement " {{goes back to the}} Romans who used the term "opus caementitium " to describe masonry which resembled concrete and was made from crushed rock with burnt lime as binder. The volcanic ash and pulverized brick additives which were added to the burnt lime to obtain a hydraulic binder were later referred to as cementum, cimentum, cäment and cement. Cements used in construction are characterized as hydraulic or non-hydraulic. The most important use of cement is the production of mortar and concrete- the bonding of natural or artificial aggregates to form a strong building material which is durable in the face of normal environmental effects. Hydraulic vs. non-hydraulic cement Hydraulic cements are materials that set and harden after being combined with water, as a result of chemical reactions with the mixing water, and that, after hardening, retain strength and stability even under water. The key requirement for this strength and stability is that the hydrates formed on immediate reaction with water be essentially insoluble in water. Most construction cements today are hydraulic, and most of these are based on Portland cement, which is made primarily from limestone, certain clay minerals, and gypsum in a high temperature process that drives off carbon dioxide and chemically combines the primary ingredients into new compounds. Non-hydraulic cements include such materials as (non-hydraulic) lime and gypsum plasters, which must be kept dry in order to gain strength, and <b>oxychloride</b> <b>cements,</b> which have liquid components.

The {{wide range}} of {{applications}} of zirconia based ceramics is due to stabilization of its tetragonal and cubic structures at room temperature, by controlled adding of dopants such as yttria, magnesia, calcia, ceria and some rare earth oxides.
