40|$|Shinji Tanishima, Yasuo MorioDepartment of Orthopedic Surgery, Misasa Onsen Hospital, Misasa, Tottori, JapanAbstract: <b>Minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> hydrate was {{the first}} bisphosphonate {{developed}} and approved for osteoporosis treatment in Japan. With regard to inhibition of bone resorption, <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> hydrate is 1000 times more effective than etidronic acid and 10 &ndash; 100 times more effective than alendronic acid. Clinical trials conducted to date have focused on postmenopausal female patients suffering from primary osteoporosis. In these trials, 1 mg of oral <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> hydrate was administrated once daily, and a significant increase was observed in lumbar-spine and hip-joint bone density 1 &ndash; 2 years after administration. All markers of bone metabolism urinary collagen type 1 cross-linked N-telopeptide, urinary free deoxypyridinoline, serum bone alkaline phosphatase, and serum osteocalcin were decreased. The incidence rate of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures was also decreased. Therefore, effectiveness in fracture prevention was confirmed. A form of <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (50 mg) requiring once-monthly administration has been developed and is currently being used clinically. A comparative study between this new formulation and once-daily <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (1 mg) showed {{no significant differences between}} the two formulations in terms of improvement rates in lumbar-spine and hip-joint bone density, changes in bone metabolism markers, or incidence of side effects. This indicates the noninferiority of the monthly formulation. Side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures were not reported with other bisphosphonates, although it is believed that these side effects may emerge as future studies continue to be conducted. On the basis of studies conducted to date, <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> hydrate is considered effective for improving bone density and preventing fractures. We anticipate further investigations in the future. Keywords: osteoporosis, <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> hydrate, treatment, bisphosphonat...|$|E

30|$|Ito et al. {{found that}} CK release was induced by 3  mmol/L incadronate, {{but not by}} alendronate, in a rabbit {{osteoclast}} culture on a plastic plate (Ito et al. 1998). In contrast, CK was released in culture with 10 – 30 μmol/L of alendronate in this study. We and others have shown antiresorptive activity at 3 – 30  μmol/L alendronate in rabbit osteoclasts cultured on bovine cortical bone slices (Halasy-Nagy et al. 2001). The concentration of alendronate required for antiresorptive action and CK release on bone slices was 1000 times lower than that used by Ito et al., the culture condition of the osteoclasts may cause significant difference of results. The decrease in osteoclast number occurred at 1  μmol/L, while the IC 50 of <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> for CTX- 1 release in a rabbit pit assay is 0.11  μmol/L (Nozaki et al. 2008); therefore, the concentration of <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> required to decrease the osteoclast number was roughly 10 {{times higher than the}} IC 50 for CTX- 1 release. The alendronate and risedronate concentrations required to decrease the osteoclast number were also roughly 10 times higher than the respective IC 50 values for CTX- 1 release (Halasy-Nagy et al. 2001). These results suggest that the dose ratios for antiresorptive action and decrease of osteoclast number are similar for all N-BPs.|$|E
30|$|The {{intracellular}} pathway for the antiresorptive {{effect of}} N-BPs occurs via prenylation of small G proteins like Rab (Nishida et al. 2003; Coxon et al. 2001), while that for apoptosis involves extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Bim, Bcl- 2 homology 3 (BH 3)-only protein (the ERK/Bim axis) (Matsumoto et al. 2011). The CK release {{is related to}} cellular damage such as that due to apoptosis, but the N-BPs concentration for CK release was 0.3  μmol/L for <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is 3 times lower than that required for a decrease of osteoclast number. However, histological changes related to osteoclasts apoptosis was observed at 0.1  μmol/L of <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (Additional file 1). Since the decrease in osteoclast number {{is considered to be}} a consequence of osteoclast apoptosis (Ito et al. 1999), the parameter may be less sensitive for cellular damage and thus a high concentration of N-BPs is needed to decrease the osteoclast number. CK release from osteoclasts also had a 1 -day lag time and occurred during days 1 to 3 of culture, with a maximum from days 2 to days 3. Morphological changes of osteoclasts are sequential, with initial actin ring disruption related to an antiresorptive effect within 1  day after treatment, and subsequent nuclear condensation after an approximately 1 -day lag time, with maximum apoptosis on day 3 (Halasy-Nagy et al. 2001; Tsubaki et al. 2013). Hence, all examined N-BPs induced CK release at micromolar to tens of micromolar concentrations in association with osteoclast apoptosis and bone resorption. The 1 -day lag time and maximum response on day 3 (as N-BPs induced apoptosis) indicates that CK release is an osteoclast apoptosis-related event.|$|E
30|$|The {{most potent}} antiresorptive N-BPs {{in the test}} was <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{followed}} in order by risedronate and alendronate. These findings {{are similar to the}} order of potency for inhibition of FPP synthase (Dunford et al. 2001; Ohno et al. 2011) and effects in rabbit osteoclast cultures (Halasy-Nagy et al. 2001; Nozaki et al. 2008). Contrary to N-BPs have different hydroxyapatite binding affinities (Ebetino et al. 2011), antiresorptive potency on bone slices was same orders to the FPP synthase inhibition. This suggests that the influence on binding affinities to hydroxyapatite may be smaller than difference of antiresorptive activities. Despite there is difference on antiresorptive potency in N-BPs, the minimum concentration for induction of CK release was approximately that required over 60 % inhibition of CTX- 1 release for all three N-BPs.|$|E

30|$|An {{increase}} in the serum CK level has been observed in clinical studies of N-BPs. The frequency of CK elevation was between 1 % and less 5 % in a trial of 5  mg alendronate (in Japanese package insert), while increases of CK-BB and CK-MB were found in single and multiple oral dose phase I studies of risedronate in Japanese healthy adult male subjects (Ogura et al. 2004). <b>Minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment at 1  mg {{has been found to}} elevate CK at a frequency of less 1 % (in Japanese package insert). Thus, many reports have shown CK elevation during N-BP treatment, but the mechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that CK is released from osteoclasts, but not from other cells present in bone. To test this hypothesis, we examined CK release induced by N-BPs from rabbit bone-derived cells in vitro, and we assessed the effect of bafilomycin A 1 on CK release to determine the source of CK. We also examined the time course of CK release after treatment with N-BPs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (YM 529) is {{a third-generation}} bisphosphonate (BP) {{that has been}} shown to {{directly}} and indirectly prevent proliferation, induce apoptosis, and inhibit metastasis of various types of cancer cells. In this study, we have investigated the therapeutic efficacy of YM 529 against bladder cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. YM 529 inhibited geranylgeranylation as well as farnesylation and reduced the growth of all seven bladder cancer cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner in vitro. YM 529 demonstrated a good synergistic or additive antiproliferative effect when administered in combination with cisplatin or paclitaxel. Immunohistochemical study revealed YM 529 inhibited the prenylation of Rap 1 A in vivo. YM 529 administered systemically did not markedly inhibit the growth of visceral metastases but it showed a significant anticancer effect on bone metastases monitored by an in vivo imaging system. Moreover, intravesical YM 529 demonstrated significant growth inhibition in a bladder cancer orthotopic model. No adverse effects were associated with the systemic as well as the intravesical treatment regimens. In conclusion, our study suggests that YM 529 may be a potent anticancer agent for bladder cancer. The efficacy and safety of this BP as an agent for combination chemotherapies against bladder cancer should be verified by early-phase clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Bisphosphonates (BPs) {{are widely}} used to treat bone {{diseases}} and also appear to possess direct antitumour activity. We have previously reported that third-generation BPs such as zoledronic acid (ZOL) and <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (YM 529) synergistically augment the effects of anticancer agents in various cancer cells. Recently, we have also reported the antitumour effects of YM 529 on murine osteosarcoma cells. As YM 529 has not been clinically available, we herein focused on the anti-osteosarcoma effects of ZOL which is clinically available. In addition to ZOL alone, we evaluated the concurrent or sequential combined effects of ZOL with other anticancer agents against murine osteosarcoma cell lines. ZOL showed almost same anti-osteosarcoma activity compared with YM 529 and more sensitive growth inhibitory effects against osteosarcoma cells than normal cells. Moreover, ZOL acted synergistically in vitro when administered concurrently with paclitaxel (PAC) or gemcitabine (GEM), not only in wild-type osteosarcoma cells but also in P-glycoprotein (P-gp) -overexpressing osteosarcoma cells, which were much less sensitive against each anticancer agent. Furthermore, 24 [*]h of ZOL pretreatment significantly augmented the sensitivity of doxorubicin (DOX), PAC or GEM against osteosarcoma cells. These findings suggest that combined administration of ZOL with other anticancer agents may improve the osteosarcoma treatment...|$|E
30|$|Mature osteoclasts {{create an}} {{isolated}} microenvironment {{between themselves and}} the bone surface, into which the cells secrete protons via vacuolar H+-ATPase and the lysosomal protease cathepsin K. Bone-bound N-BPs are eluted by acid during bone resorption and may be incorporated into osteoclasts, and osteoclasts-incorporate N-BPs show antiresorptive activity and cause apoptosis. All pharmacological action of <b>minodronic</b> <b>acid,</b> inhibition of CTX- 1 release, reduction of osteoclast number and CK release were abrogated by the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A 1. The antiresorptive action and CK release induced by alendronate and risedronate were also eliminated by bafilomycin A 1 (data not shown). Because acid release from osteoclasts was inhibited by bafilomycin A 1, N-BPs were not released from bone slices and not incorporated into osteoclasts in bafilomycin A 1 treated condition. Besides osteoclasts, stromal cells and bone marrow cells {{were present in the}} culture system, but these cells are not sensitive to bafilomycin A 1. Bafilomycin A 1 also blocked vesicle trafficking with sufficient inhibition at approximately 50  nmol/L or more, but the effect was minimal at our used condition around 10  nmol/L (Johnson et al. 1993). In addition, Sistermans et al. reported no CK-BB was found in both osteocyte and cartilage, and general CK-BB expression in bone was negative (Sistermans et al. 1995). Therefore, these results suggest that CK is released from osteoclasts via the pharmacological effect of N-BPs. We did not identify CK isoenzymes because of the limited CK activity, and this is a limitation of the study. However, expression of CK except CK-BB was tissue specific. The ubiquitous CK-BB is strongly expressed in osteoclasts and it is likely that CK-BB was released from damaged osteoclasts into extracellular fluid due to N-BP treatment. The serum CK level increases in some patients treated with N-BPs and serum CK-BB might be a useful marker for osteoclast damage in N-BP treatment.|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{protocols}} involving easy handling process, atom economy, ambient reaction conditions, short reaction times, {{inexpensive and}} less hazardous catalyst {{always have been}} attractive. Multi-component reaction is a chemical reaction, in which three or more starting materials react to form the product in an atom economy manner and ease of access to complex molecules in one-pot certainly belong to this class. A contemporary challenge {{in the world is}} environmental pollution. Multi component reactions are certainly one of the solutions for this problem due to the less release of chemical wastage compared with classical bicomponent reaction protocols and it is being considered as one of the green technology. I have also tried to use water as a reaction solvent to synthesize heterocyclic compounds because water is cheaper, green solvent and highly abundant in nature. I have synthesized various valuable heterocyclic compounds using multicomponent reactions. Compounds possessing pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone backbone have been used to control the cell proliferation in breast cancer and p 38 kinase inhibitors. Wang Le et. al., also have reported molecules having pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone backbone as BRD 4 receptor inhibitors to control breast cancer. Considering the importance of these molecules, we have demonstrated an efficient, mild and multicomponent protocol for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds possessing pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone backbone by using Ugi four component reaction and post condensation of Ugi adduct. This method offers several advantages such as easy handling procedure, atom economy, short reaction time and huge molecular library can be synthesized by changing the substituents on four independent starting materials. In previous reported methods for pyrrolo[2, 3 - c]pyridones, expensive metal catalysts were used, where as in present method we used inexpensive PTSA catalyst. Various anilines substituted with Iodo, bromo, chloro, methyl, methoxy at different positions on aniline were used in Ugi 4 CR. And also phenyl glyoxylic acids substituted with methoxy, ethoxy, methyl and chloro were used in combinations with t-butyl and cyclohexyl isocyanides. In all cases the reaction proceeded smoothly and yielded the corresponding pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone derivatives in good to excellent yields. Considering these advantages we hope this methodology will be useful for medicinal chemists in drug discovery process. All the products were characterized by using NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy and FAB mass. One of the products was further characterized with X-ray diffraction analysis. Coumarin analogs having both coumarin and furan heterocycles have gained the considerable attention of researchers due to their significant properties as anti-leishmania panamensis, dyes and fluorescent sensors. Coumarin analogs with furan heterocycle isolated from the plants origin such as microminutin, micromelin, psoralen, 8 -methoxypsoralen have important properties in medicinal chemistry and bio photochemistry. It is well documented that by introducing a heteroaromatic substituent at 3 -position the absorption and emission maxima of coumarin scaffold can be improved because of extended πconjugation and consequently their optoelectronic properties can be improved. Based on this phenomenon a variety of 3 -heteroaryl coumarin derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for their optoelectronic properties. Considering the broad range of applications of furyl coumarin derivatives, we have demonistrated an efficient and facile synthesis of 3 -furyl coumarin derivatives by reaction of 4 - chloro- 3 -formylcoumarin, secondary amines, dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates and diversely substituted isocyanides using four component one pot reaction. All the products were isolated as yellow color fluorescent solids by column chromatography in quantitative yield and characterized with 1 H NMR, C 13 NMR, IR and FAB mass. Spiro compounds having dipyrrole namely Amathaspiramide A, Mytraginine psuedoindoxyl as shown below was proven to have prominent antiviral and anticancer properties. Very few reports were there in the literature for the synthesis of spiro [indole- 2, 2 ’- pyrroles] bearing spiro carbon at C- 2 position. Considering this as an opportunity, we have developed an efficient and facile method for the synthesis of novel spiro[indole- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -pyrroles] from N-methyl- 3 -isatin imines, t-butyl isocyanide and dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate has been achieved by [3 + 2] cyclo addition reaction. The notable advantages of this protocol are operational simplicity, easily available starting materials, available diversity of each component, catalyst free and easy work procedure employed. We believed in this protocol will help in developing novel spiro heterocyclic compounds using C- 2 carbon atom of isatin. All the products were purified by column chromatography as yellow solids and confirmed with 1 H NMR, 13 CNMR, FAB mass, IR. One of the compound was further confirmed with X-ray analysis. Imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines have been valuable to organic and medicinal chemists due to the interesting structure and numerous applications in pharmaceutical Industry. The molecules possessing imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine core structure have been used as anticancer, antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antiprotozonal and antiviral agents. Additionally, they were also used for the treatment of gastric disease and heart disease. They have been found in drug candidates such as <b>Minodronic</b> <b>acid</b> used for the treatment of osteoporosis, Zolpidem used for the treatment of insomnia and some brain disorders, Zolmidine used for the treatment of peptic ulcers and gastro esophageal reflux disease and Olprinone used for the treatment of acute heart failure. Considering these applications, New coumarin derivatives having imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine heterocycle moiety were synthesized by the condensation of 4 -morpholino- 3 -formyl coumarin, diversely substituted 2 -amino pyridine and isocyanides under catalyst free, water mediated reaction conditions. All the products were characterized by using IR, NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy and HRMS spectrometry. Product 4 b was further characterized with X-ray diffraction analysis. All the products have showed UV-Visible absorbance in between 234 nm to 248 nm and emissions were observed in between 412 nm to 544 nm. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 436 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 3 月 24 日 1.
