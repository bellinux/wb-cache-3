50|$|Functionality and {{structure}} of an EAI solution are completely deﬁned by using the language building blocks, ports, tasks, decorator, slots and integration links. Guaraná's tasks {{are based on the}} Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP Patterns) by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. It is possible to design the internal structure of all kinds of building blocks (wrappers and integration processes) and its communication ports (entry port, exit port, solicitor port and responder port) by using tasks; it is also possible, to create integration ﬂows that allow applications to collaborate by connecting these building blocks by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> links. Applications that participate in the integration solution are documented using decorators as well as its layers being used as communication interface.|$|E
50|$|In {{the study}} of {{differential}} equations, and commonly those occurring in physics, one has {{the idea of a}} set of infinitesimal displacements that can be extended to obtain a manifold, or at least, a local part of it, by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration.</b> The general concept is of using the exponential map to take the vectors in the tangent space and extend them, as geodesics, to an open set surrounding the tangent point. In this case, it is not unusual to call the elements of the tangent space the generators of the manifold. When the manifold possesses some sort of symmetry, there is also the related notion of a charge or current, which is sometimes also called the generator, although, strictly speaking, charges are not elements of the tangent space.|$|E

This was observed by Prince Charles at the inauguration of Spirit and Life, an exhibition of the Aga Khan Museum collection that was held at the Centre: [...] "I can only applaud your emphasis on intellectual and cultural exploration as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration,</b> and your determination to discharge your obligations as citizens of this country without losing your own distinctive traditions," [...] he said of the Ismaili community in his inaugural remarks.

5000|$|A {{variety of}} tools and {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} {{in recent years to}} collect such information. However, unless data is easily accessible and is presented in a user-friendly format, decision makers commonly do without the information. One alternative that has been designed to manage large volumes of data and to enable a user-friendly presentation is to use geo-referenced datasets, which provide a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> of data from different sources at any point on the globe. Within such a framework, for any specific point on the map (identified by its grid reference) detailed and accurate data of different nature can be linked in an integrated way. Mapping therefore involves the presentation of certain information in a spatial context, and this enables policy planners to identify the geographic areas and communities in which to focus their efforts for maximum impact.

[...] "I don't need an accurate understanding of theatre, but simply form the experience of pleasure when viewing a spectacle." [...] The writers of the journal held idealistic views about serving an audience of proletarian background. Among the discussion on the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> of the proletariat into revolutionary culture, was the conversation on the general discrimination against uneducated viewers from theatre, which had previously been reserved for the bourgeois audience. In [...] "About polite and impolite audience," [...] a writer narrated the conception of the working-class audience as being late and eating during the performance, and argued that to the contrary, true [...] "vulgarity is the sister of riches." ...|$|E
