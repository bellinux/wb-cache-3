5|$|Apart from Zagreb and Varaždin, the A4 <b>motorway</b> runs near {{a number}} of Croatian cities, and connects {{to the rest of}} the Croatian <b>motorway</b> network east of Zagreb. The <b>motorway</b> route was {{completed}} in 2008. The motorway's national significance is reflected in the positive economic impact on the cities and towns it connects, as well as its importance to tourism in Croatia. The genuine importance of the <b>motorway</b> as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node, since the A4 represents an integral part of the RijekaZagrebBudapest transport route.|$|E

50|$|The {{improved}} {{safety and}} fuel economy of <b>motorways</b> are common justifications for building more <b>motorways.</b> However, the planned capacity of <b>motorways</b> is often exceeded in a shorter timeframe than initially planned, {{due to the}} under estimation {{of the extent of}} the suppressed demand for road travel.

5|$|Construction of the <b>motorway</b> {{along its}} Split–Dubrovnik sector started once the <b>motorway</b> sectors north of Split were complete, and the section between Split (Dugopolje {{interchange}}) and Šestanovac interchange opened on 27 June 2007. The last sections {{to be completed}} to date are Šestanovac–Ravča, opened on 22 December 2008, Ravča-Vrgorac section opened on 30 June 2011, and the Vrgorac-Ploče section opened on 20 December 2013. In the 2000s, as the <b>motorway</b> construction works were gradually progressing further south, the <b>motorway</b> earned its unofficial, yet widely used name—Dalmatina in Croatian press because it connected Zagreb to Dalmatia. In 2010, Donja Zdenčina interchange was opened between Lučko and Jastrebarsko interchanges, and in June 2012, Novigrad interchange opened bringing number of <b>motorway</b> exits to 33.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the <b>motorway</b> {{began in}} 1990, lbut a decade-long hiatus between the mid-1990s and 2004 caused by funding {{issues and the}} setting up of a {{separate}} company to develop and operate the <b>motorway</b> meant it was not completed until 2007. As of July 2011, the entire <b>motorway</b> route is completed, consisting of a dual-carriageway and four traffic lanes, except for a relatively short segment which is still a single carriageway road. The <b>motorway</b> is currently operated by Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj.|$|E
5|$|The A1 <b>motorway</b> was {{originally}} {{designed in the}} early 1970s, albeit along a different route than the present Zagreb–Split <b>motorway</b> route. After suppression of the Croatian Spring and removal of the Croatian leadership that proposed and adopted the construction plan in 1971, all the work related to the Zagreb–Split <b>motorway</b> was cancelled. The plans were revived in the 1990s and new designs were developed to include a <b>motorway</b> section built between Zagreb and Karlovac into the design so that the section could be shared between Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways. Construction work started in 2000 and the <b>motorway</b> reached Split by 2005 and was extended towards Dubrovnik later on. Both in the 1970s and in the 2000s, construction of the Zagreb–Split <b>motorway</b> was perceived to symbolize rebuilding of national unity.|$|E

5|$|The A2 <b>motorway</b> is an {{important}} north–south <b>motorway</b> in Croatia, connecting {{the capital of the}} country, Zagreb, to Graz, Austria, via Maribor, Slovenia, as well as Vienna and other destinations along the Pyhrn route. The <b>motorway</b> follows a route through the Hrvatsko Zagorje region. Part of the road network of Croatia, the <b>motorway</b> is also part of European route E59 Zagreb–Graz–Vienna–Prague. The <b>motorway</b> is of major importance to Croatia in terms of economic development, especially for tourism and as a transit transport route. The road carries significant transit and tourist traffic as it connects to the Zagreb bypass segment of the A3 <b>motorway,</b> which serves as a hub distributing the southbound traffic to either eastbound A3 or southbound A1, and vice versa. As of the June 1997 Pan-European Transport Conference in Helsinki, the <b>motorway</b> is part of the Pan-European Corridor Xa.|$|E
5|$|The A4 <b>motorway</b> is a {{significant}} northsouth <b>motorway</b> in the northern Croatia connecting the nation's capital, Zagreb, to the Hungarian M7 <b>motorway</b> at the Goričan border crossing The southern terminus of the A4 <b>motorway</b> at the interchange in Ivanja Reka represents its junction {{with the rest of}} the Croatian <b>motorway</b> network via the A3 <b>motorway.</b> As a part of the road network of Croatia, the <b>motorway</b> is a part of European route E65 and European route E71. The <b>motorway</b> is of major importance to Croatia in terms of the development of its economy, notably tourism, as it represents the shortest and the most comfortable route between Budapest, Hungary and the Adriatic Sea. This particularly applies to tourist resorts on the Istria and Kvarner Gulf islands and to the Port of Rijeka, but it is also true for resorts in the Dalmatia region, served via the A1 <b>motorway.</b> The genuine importance of the <b>motorway</b> as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of the proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node. This expansion is planned to encompass the growth of the Port of Rijeka's cargo handling capacity, improved railroad links and a new Rijeka bypass <b>motorway</b> linking the A6, via a new interchange, to the present routes of the A7 and A8 motorways. The project is, among other goals, aimed to increase traffic along the Croatian part of Pan-European corridor Vb, of which the A4 <b>motorway</b> is a part.|$|E
5|$|The A6 <b>motorway</b> runs near {{a number}} of Croatian cities, {{provides}} access to Risnjak National Park and indirectly to numerous resorts, notably in the Istria and Kvarner Gulf regions. The <b>motorway</b> route was completed in 2008. The <b>motorway</b> is nationally significant because of its positive economic impact on the cities and towns it connects, and because of its contribution to tourism in Croatia. The importance of the <b>motorway</b> as a transit route will be further increased upon completion of a proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node.|$|E
