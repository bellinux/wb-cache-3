40|$|Plasma {{focus and}} Z-pinches {{are known to}} be {{intensive}} sources of K-ion radiation. This radiation is observed in two different regimes of compression: column and <b>micropinch.</b> Appearance of these regimes depends on combination of discharge circuit parameter and element composition of plasma. Column regime is typical for low current discharges operating in low Z gases. <b>Micropinch</b> regime, which represents a development of "neck" type instabilities in a presence of strong radia- tion loam, is typical for heavy ion plasma, i. e. vacuum spark or plasma focus with admixture of heavy gases. Transition from column to <b>micropinch</b> mode has been investigated experimentally. It was found that appearance of either regime can be quantitatively described by a distinction parameter depending on pinch current, particle density and used element...|$|E

Its accuracy characteristics have been determined by numerical simulations. Much {{attention has been}} paid to the peculiarities of preliminary processing of the projection images from physical experiment. Algorithm is used for the reconstruction of the local emission coefficients in a <b>micropinch</b> discharge plasma.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the results of {{studying}} the impact of discharge current rate on electrode surface area of high-current low-inductance vacuum spark. Iron electrodes were utilized for research. It was discovered that the size of periodic structure cells on a cathode surface decreased from 600 nm (63 kA) to 150 nm (180 kA) as the discharge current rate grew along with switching to the <b>micropinching</b> mode. The discharge current rate exerted no significant impact on the size of structure elements on anode surface (the structure size at all currents was ∼ 400 nm) ...|$|R

This report presents absolute measurements of the brightness and the energy emitted in the wavelength interval 7 - 14 Aaand in the water window between 24 - 27 Aa. Elements were Mg, Al, Ti, and Cu.

40|$|A unique {{feature of}} high-current vacuum spark {{discharges}} is {{the occurrence of}} {{one or a few}} extremely hot and dense <b>micropinches,</b> which are intense emitters of radiation in the x-ray region. We report on investigations of such hot plasma points of Al, Fe and Mo and on a comparison of their parameters with predictions by a radiative collapse model. The agreement is good. The origin of the K#alpha#-radiation in the case of high atomic number elements is discussed, and the potential as a subnanosecond high-brightness x-ray source is pointed out. (orig.)

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of the soft-X-ray emission of a Mg- <b>micropinch</b> plasma in a vacuum spark device has been recorded {{as a function of}} time, by employing a streak camera. The emission from the He-like ions occurs in two bursts - a very intense one of 200 ps duration and a second one of lower intensity but with a duration of 400 ps. The observations support the radiative-collapse model as explanation of the micropinching process and of the formation of the tiny hot plasmas of subnanosecond lifetimes...|$|E
40|$|In plasma focus devices {{operated}} {{with pure}} nitrogen, neon or argon (Z equal or smaller than 18) with pinch current from 200 to 400 kA the emitting region is a column with several 100 mym {{in diameter and}} several mm in length (column mode). For Z equal or bigger than 18 micropinches are observed. Usually micropinches and column emission is examined independently. Small Plasma Foci feature both modes simultaneously. In this paper the transition regime between column and micropinches is investigated with particular regard to Z = 18 (argon). Peculiarities in the emitted spectra are interpreted by the interaction of simultaneous existing column and <b>micropinch</b> plasma...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{spectral}} {{characteristics of}} a vacuum discharge plasma with the storage energy lower than 30 J initiated on an Al or a Fe cathode by a 1012 W/cm 2 neodymium laser were studied in the 30 – 300 Å wavelength range. It is shown that both the spectral composition and intensity of radiation of a <b>micropinch</b> plasma produced in the cathode jet of the discharge are determined by parameters of the discharge and laser pulse. These parameters were optimized to achieve a regime in which a considerable part of radiation energy was concentrated in the long-wavelength band of the quasi-continuum (230 - 270 Å and 160 - 200 Å for Al and Fe, respectively), which makes this discharge a source of narrowband X-ray radiation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{experiments}} with a plasma <b>micropinch</b> device performed at the Electrodynamics Laboratory Proton- 21 which include the track registration of fast particles emitted from the hot spot sparked inside a metal target. In the ion pinhole camera, a magnetic analyzer and a Thomson mass-spectrometer were mounted in order to derive images of the hot spot and to define the spectra of fast particles. On the track detectors in the pinhole camera, we have obtained specific split images which have a form of three or more track stripes stretched in parallel to the diode axis. The “average etching rate ratio versus track length ” locus for the groups of tracks is depicted {{by means of the}} asymptotic method of squared diameters. Our...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{emission}} from pinch plasma devices with pinch currents {{ranging from}} 200 to 400 kA operated with pure high-Z gases are investigated with temporal spatial and spectral resolution. If operated using elements Z less than 18 (e. g., nitrogen or neon) K-shell emission is observed from column-like volumes several 100 micrometer {{in diameter and}} several mm in length (bulk or column mode). For Z greater than 18. (e. g., krypton or xenon) emission with hv grater than 1 keV is only observed from micropinches. For argon (Z = 18) both modes of operation can be observed. The occurrence of a specific mode depends on the initial gas pressure. In this paper the transition regime between column and micropinches is investigated with particular regard to argon. A criterion is proposed to decide whether column mode or <b>micropinch</b> mode is expected...|$|E
40|$|Small pinch plasma {{devices are}} intense sources of pulsed XUV-radiation. Because of their low costs and their compact sizes pinch plasmas seem {{well suited to}} {{supplement}} research ac- tivities based on synchrotrons. With correct optimisation, both continuous radiation and narrowband line radiation can be tailored for specific applications. For the special demand of optimising narrowband emission from these plasmas the scaling of K-shell line emission of intermediate atomic number pinch plasmas with respect to device parameters has been stud- ied. Scaling laws, especially {{taking into account the}} transient behaviour of the pinch plasma, give design criteria. Investigations of the transition between column and <b>micropinch</b> mode of- fer predictable access to shorter wavelengths and smaller source sizes. Results on proximity x-ray lithography, imaging and contact x-ray microscopy, x-ray fluorescence (XFA) micros- copy and photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) were achieved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} two {{important}} characteristics of high density and high temperature plasmas formed in axial discharges are studied. In {{the first part}} an experimental investigation of the structure and {{the dynamics of the}} current sheath and its effects on targets in a 3. 3 kJ plasma focus are presented. Shadowgraphs are recorded {{in the presence of a}} flat disc target placed downstream of the anode. These shadowgraphs reveal that the disc target does not affect the dynamics of the focus when it is at the distance of 10 mm (the radius of the anode in our case) from the anode end. However, the shadowgraphs recorded with the disc target at a distance of 7 mm exhibit the sequential focusing phenomenon, i. e., the current sheath moves over the disc and forms a pinch beyond it, with the disc acting as a new anode. This sequential focusing is also confirmed by recording the voltage probe signal, neutron pulses and neutron flux. The shadowgraphs are also recorded in the presence of a wire target (1 -mm diameter) inserted along the pinch axis. The strong focusing of the current sheath onto the I-mm wire indicates that this small plasma focus machine can be used for focus-fiber experiments. In the second part the dynamics of a collapsing plasma column and the properties of micropinches formed in the collapsed plasma column in a low-inductance vacuum-spark discharge are studied. Time integrated single shot x-ray spectra of He-like and H-like ions and their corresponding n = 2, Li-like and He-like satellites of elements (S, Cl, Ca, Cr, and Fe) are recorded. The experimental spectra are compared with simulated spectra (using the code FL V), and the electron density and the temperature of the <b>micropinch</b> plasma are estimated. The dependence of electron density and temperature of the <b>micropinch</b> plasma on atomic number Z shows a fair agreement with the available data in the literature obtained using different diagnostic techniques. The electron temperature estimated from the spectra of H-like ions is higher than that from He-like ions which indicates that the plasma is ionizing. Vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy of elements (Ti, Fe, and Mo) indicates that the transitions from the ionization stages (Ti XI, Ti XII, Fe XV, Fe XVI, Mo XIV, Mo XV, Mo XVI) are prominent. However, in the Ti spectrum strong transitions from lower ionization stages (Ti VII, Ti VIII) emerge when the spectrum is recorded in the presence of a small superposed axial magnetic field. The presence of this external magnetic field reduces the compression...|$|E
