40|$|CPUs, network interfaces, and {{networks}} are improving, providing higher bandwidths and lower latencies. System software overhead {{makes it impossible}} for a user application to achieve bandwidths and latencies near the hardware limits. This is especially true for <b>remote</b> <b>handler</b> invocation. Typically, the remote node has to trap into the kernel and perform an expensive context switch to the handler. This hampers global communication operations and runtime systems, such as the one for Cilk and Split-C for example. Executing the untrusted <b>remote</b> <b>handler</b> inside the operating system kernel eliminates the overhead of context switches and disrupted cashes. Several methods to execute untrusted user code in a privileged environment exist. The research proposed in this paper compares these methods and attempts to prove that a kernel embedded interpreter has the necessary performance and safety characteristics t...|$|R

40|$|Informal {{communication}} between work team members {{is critical for}} collaborative tasks, building relationships and coordinating group activities. Achieving informal communication and collaboration is particularly challenging in in offshore outsourced projects. Supporting informal communication is difficult for most collaboration technologies. One approach is the adoption of <b>mobile</b> <b>remote</b> presence technologies (MRP). Such systems comprise a video conferencing system mounted on a user-controlled, mobile robotic base. This paper seeks to design the deployment of an MRP system in an offshore-outsourced software development team (located between Germany and India). The design process involved observing the use a MRP system in a distributed team in Germany. We observed {{the influence of the}} <b>mobile</b> <b>remote</b> presence system on types and frequency of team interaction over a 12 -month period. It supported a wide range of collaborative interaction, including planned and unplanned meetings and social interactions. After an adjustment period of several weeks, local and remote users worked almost as if they were co-located. The paper concludes with plans for deploying the <b>mobile</b> <b>remote</b> presence system in an offshore outsourced team, which include an extended adjustment period and daily scheduled meetings to ensure usage and enable a range of interaction types. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an initial {{analysis}} {{of economic and}} market issues {{in the development and}} deployment of <b>mobile</b> <b>remote</b> physiological monitoring services for medical patients through wireless wearable sensors and actuators. Examining the characteristics of the service technologies and related industries, this study focuses on the structure, participants and roles of standardisation of the layers within the emerging <b>mobile</b> <b>remote</b> physiological monitoring industry. The study concludes that the structure of the emerging <b>mobile</b> <b>remote</b> physiological monitoring industry will be oriented about service provision, be integrated with other personal / patient data storage services and be heavily influenced by the interplay of technological developments, the health market structure, existing players and regulation. Additionally, the keys players are likely to be the system integrators and service providers concentrating on large institutional customers. A focus of the paper is analysing both the causes and implications of a modular, horizontally layered industry structure likely to result from the mix of technologies, suppliers and customers as this market develops. The paper discusses why, although horizontal specialisation is the most likely outcome, there is little risk of key layers becoming commoditised. The paper also discusses the appropriate types and levels of standardisation and equipment certification activities that should be encouraged, along with from which groups and industries the pressure for these will com...|$|R

One set of technologies that are emerging on the commercial market is <b>mobile</b> <b>remote</b> presence (MRP) systems, physically embodied videoconferencing systems that remote workers use to drive through a workplace, communicating with locals there. Our interviews, observations, and survey results from people, who had 2 - 18 months of MRP use, showed how remotely-controlled mobility enabled remote workers {{to live and work}} with local coworkers almost as if they were physically there. The MRP supported informal communications and connections between distributed coworkers.

40|$|There {{are more}} than 5. 6 billion mobile phone users worldwide, making mobile phones more common than PCs. Mobile {{technology}} is a modern phenomenon with {{a great impact on}} industries and our society. Mobile phones began as very limited devices that provided only voice services. Today, these devices also provide a myriad of data services that allow us to browse the Internet, send text messages, check emails, watch movies, listen to music, take pictures, record videos, play video games and read documents. Mobile can also be used for payments, thus adopted by merchants in such a way to provide a new way for their customers to make their purchases. 	Different systems and business models have been developed for enabling Mobile Payments such as "Proximity" systems based on NFC technology and "Remote" systems that use the Mobile Operator's network and mostly widely adopted technologies such as SMS, WAP and <b>Mobile</b> Internet. <b>Mobile</b> <b>remote</b> payment systems {{are one of the most}} popular technologies for transactions today, especially across the media and online industries. 	Prior research mostly focuses on technology innovation or consumer-centric view while there is still less knowledge related to supply-side perspective and merchant attitude towards adoption of Mobile Payments. Literature is even more scarce when it comes to understanding the merchant adoption of specific Mobile Payment Systems such as "Remote Payment" systems based on carrier billing technologies. Typically, these systems have been widely adopted by merchants around the world and for some have become a phenomenal tool of success. There is also scarcity of research describing the operative factors affecting the deployment and management of Mobile Payments. 	This research is an exploratory research of the merchant adoption of Carrier Billed <b>Mobile</b> <b>Remote</b> Payments. This qualitative study was based on in depth interviews conducted on executives and managers from 15 international companies that operate globally in the digital space and that have made a successful use of <b>Mobile</b> <b>Remote</b> Payments. 	The results of this research are divided into two parts. In the first one, which is dedicated to the "Strategic Phase", the research aims to understand what enables, drives and inhibits the adoption of <b>Mobile</b> <b>Remote</b> Payment systems by merchants. In the second part, the “Operative Phase”, the research instead outlines the factors driving or inhibiting the successful deployment and management of such systems by merchants. Both parts are organized into descriptive frameworks where the factors identified are analyzed in great detail and explained also through direct quotes of the interviewees. 	What emerges from the “Strategic” part of this study is that in order for merchants to adopt <b>Mobile</b> <b>Remote</b> Payments, they must operate within very strict limitations, such as offering mainly digital goods and services and within a micro-transaction based business model. Furthermore, these merchants have to bear incredibly high commissions if compared to credit card or other payment tools. However it emerges that this tool is so simple and secure to use, and immediately available to anybody with a mobile phone that it produces key beneficial factors for the merchants that really drive their adoption. These factors include addressing unbanked users (Young people, emerging markets), increasing impulse purchases and the possibility of developing new business models. 	The result of the study of the operative phase shows that 4 macro factors clearly need to be considered when merchants deploy and manage a <b>Mobile</b> <b>Remote</b> Payment system. These are 1) Purchase Experience; 2) Payment System Reputation; 3) Merchant – Provider Relationship; 4) Price Structure and Billing Policies...|$|R

The track switches allow the vehicle to travel in two orthogonal directions over the truss structure which coupled with the bidirectional drive, allow movement in four directions on one plane.
