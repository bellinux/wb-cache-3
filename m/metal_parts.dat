40|$|A {{process for}} bonding {{elastomeric}} material to a <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> includes coating a heat curable adhesive on {{the surfaces of}} the <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> to be bonded. The <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> is placed in a mold, a bottom plate and an upper transfer pot of a transfer molding machine is preheated to a predetermined cure temperature. A predetermined quantity of uncured elastomeric material is loaded into the transfer pot. The mold containing the adhesive coated <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> is clamped to the bottom plate, and almost contemporaneously, the uncured elastomeric material is pressed into the mold while maintaining heat and pressure in the mold for a time sufficient to vulcanize and thereby cure the elastomeric material simultaneously with the adhesive, whereby contacting surfaces of the <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> are strongly bonded to the vulcanized elastomeric material...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for providing hermetic sealing within an optical fiber feed-through or high-performance fiber attachment to a <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> is presented. The system utilizes {{a specially designed}} heat concentrator surrounding the <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> and <b>metal</b> coated fiber that is heated to above 800 C using an induction heating method to achieve melting of a high-temperature brazing material used to join the two parts. The strength of the bond and sealing between the fiber and <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> is evaluated by constructing a simple extrinsic Fabry-Perot pressure transducer subjected to temperature and pressure variations {{in the range of}} 20 - 350 C and 0 - 15, 000 psi, demonstrating the expected spectral responses from the transducer...|$|R

To {{realize the}} target of having a precise feature size {{measurement}} of multihole sheet <b>metal</b> <b>part,</b> this paper based on HALCON, first calibrates the camera with HALCON's calibration assistant. After acquiring {{the image of the}} multihole sheet <b>metal</b> <b>part,</b> the image coordinates of the center of fitting ellipse and the length of the long and short half shaft (pixel unit) can be gotten by proceeding a series of operations like thresholding, subpixel-precise contour extraction, fitting ellipses and so on. At last, the point coordinates in image are transformed into the plane Z= 0 of the world coordinate system through translation and rotation, and the value of each feature size of the sheet <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> can be calculated...|$|R
