5|$|The {{film was}} loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and drew heavily from the {{conventions}} of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), and John Sturges' film The Magnificent Seven (1960). Sholay was also influenced by the westerns of Sam Peckinpah, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973); and by George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery {{was inspired by a}} similar scene in North West Frontier (1959), and a scene showing the <b>massacre</b> <b>of</b> Thakur's family has been compared with the <b>massacre</b> <b>of</b> the McBain family in Once Upon a Time in the West. Some plot elements were borrowed from the Indian films Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971) and Khote Sikkay (1973).|$|E

5|$|After the US Army stopped alcohol {{trading with}} the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton started a whiskey trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post's {{nickname}} became Fort Whoop-Up.

5|$|Also, Theodoric Strabo, whose {{hatred of}} the Isaurian Zeno had {{compelled}} him to support Basiliscus' revolt, left the new Emperor's side.

Finally, the support of Illus was most likely wavering, given the <b>massacre</b> <b>of</b> the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.|$|E

5|$|By July 1990 the {{government}} began to distribute weapons to civilians in turn, to Krahn and Mandingo who wished to protect themselves. These hastily enlisted civilians became known as '1990 soldiers.' A '1990 soldier' which the President had personally picked, Tailey Yonbu, led a <b>massacre</b> <b>of</b> refugees, mostly Gio and Mandingo civilians, {{on the night of}} July 29/30, 1990 at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Sinkor, Monrovia. Some 600 were killed. Because of the previous ethnic purges carried out by Doe's forces, the conflict took on characteristics of an ethnic pogrom.|$|E

During post-war questioning, Horthy insisted that he had not wished to invade Yugoslavia, but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the <b>massacre</b> <b>of</b> Hungarians in Bačka, but these claims have been dismissed by Tomasevich.|$|E

5|$|In 1965 a {{retrospective}} of Berni's work was organized at the Instituto Di Tella, including the collage Monsters.

Compositions such as Ramona en la caverna (Ramona in the Cavern), El mundo de Ramona (Ramona's World), and La masacre de los inocentes (<b>Massacre</b> <b>of</b> the Innocent) were becoming more complex. The latter was exhibited in 1971 at the Paris Museum of Modern Art. By the late 1970s Berni's Juanito and Ramona oil paintings had evolved into three-dimensional altar pieces.|$|E

The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a preceding <b>massacre</b> <b>of</b> Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.|$|E

McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.|$|E
