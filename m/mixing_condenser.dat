40|$|Cloud {{convection}} of a CO 2 atmosphere {{where the}} major constituent condenses is numerically investigated under a setup idealizing a possible warm atmosphere of early Mars, utilizing a two-dimensional cloud-resolving model forced by a fixed cooling profile {{as a substitute}} for a radiative process. The authors compare two cases with different critical saturation ratios as condensation criteria and also examine sensitivity to number <b>mixing</b> ratio of <b>condensed</b> particles given externally. When supersaturation is not necessary for condensation, the entire horizontal domain above the condensation level is continuously covered by clouds irrespective of number <b>mixing</b> ratio of <b>condensed</b> particles. Horizontal-mean cloud mass density decreases exponentially with height. The circulations below and above the condensation level are dominated by dry cellular convection and buoyancy waves, respectively. When 1. 35 is adopted as the critical saturation ratio, clouds appear exclusively as intense, short-lived, quasi-periodic events. Clouds start just above the condensation level and develop upward, but intense updrafts exist only around the cloud top; they do not extend {{to the bottom of the}} condensation layer. The cloud layer is rapidly warmed by latent heat during the cloud events, and then the layer is slowly cooled by the specified thermal forcing, and supersaturation gradually develops leading to the next cloud event.

A cross-sectional molecular area of 210 Å 2 /molecule, a surface potential of 4. 2 fV/molecule and a high stability of the film were deducted from pure M 1 monolayers.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of the DNA-bases thymine, adenine und uracil was {{studied at}} the mercury and the Au(111) electrode by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The behaviour of mixtures of these bases was {{studied at the}} mercury electrode. The DNA-bases undergo a first order phase transition dependent of the electrode potential. The potential of maximum adsorption Em and the potential of zero charge PZC of solutions of the DNA bases were determined by measuring inverted current transients. Information about {{the orientation of the}} molecules at the interface could be obtained from these results. It was found that thymine and adenine reorient during the phase transition. There was found coadsorption in a mixture of the complementary bases thymine and adenine, but not cocondensation. A condensed phase is formed dependent on the mixing ratio of the bases. The condensed phase in a solution containing both bases is less stable than a condensed phase in a solution containing only a pure substance. The different orientation of thymine and adenine at the electrode prevents stronger attractive interactions between both bases. Coadsorption was also found for the noncomplementary bases thymine and uracil. Here it cannot be decided whether the condensed phase of the mixtures is composed of only one substance, or domains of both bases exist. A <b>mixed</b> <b>condensed</b> phase is not formed. Furthermore the kinetics of the phase transitions were studied using the DNA-bases as an example. The phase transition of a non-ordered adsorbate of low density to an ordered adsorbed phase of higher density takes places via a nucleation and growth mechanism. Evidence was supplied for the first time for the existence of athermal clusters at a solid electrode. Up to now these clusters were only found at the mercury electrode. For the first time a complete set of current transients, the shape of which was already theoretically predicted, could be measured at the mercury electrode. The oscillation transient as well as the doubly inverted shape of the transient have not been measured before. The finding of these transients confirms the model of the coupled processes of adsorption, nucleation and growth. The influence of the electrolyte resistance on the different shapes of transients was examined by the variation of the cell constant RC by an additional external resistor. The value of the cell constant RC in the experiment determines whether the studied process takes place at a constant or non-constant double layer potential...|$|R

Precursors for the carbon nitride (cyanamide) and silica (TEOS) are <b>mixed</b> and <b>condensed</b> simultaneously.

As both precursors are liquids this approach allows convenient shaping into thin and thick films or monoliths of mesoporous carbon nitrides.

Values of d 18 O, monthly measured on rain samples collected during the period 2002 – 2004 in a rain-gauge network composed of 10 stations, were compared with meteorological and DEM data. Air temperature, controlled by the local orographic structure, was identified as the main factor influencing rain isotopic composition. Another important role is played by orographic clouds, whose condensation {{over the top of}} Mt.

A spatial model of rain isotopic composition, based on a 3 D distribution of temperature derived by a 1 9 1 km DEM, was implemented and used for calculating the theoretical isotopic signature of seepage, further compared with data measured in the groundwater monitoring network. The analysis evidenced the role of local meteoric recharge as the main source feeding Mt. Vesuvius aquifers.
