5|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 April, {{elements}} of the SS <b>Motorised</b> Infantry Division Reich, under command of XLI <b>Motorised</b> Corps crossed the Danube in pneumatic boats and captured Belgrade without resistance. About the same time, most {{of the elements of}} XLVI <b>Motorised</b> Corps that were approaching Belgrade from the west were redirected away from the capital, but part of the 8th Panzer Division continued their thrust to capture the Sava bridges to the west of Belgrade, and entered the city during the night. The rest of the 8th Panzer Division turned southeast and drove towards Valjevo to link up with the left flank of the First Panzer Group southwest of Belgrade. The 16th <b>Motorised</b> Infantry Division was redirected south across the Sava, and advanced toward Zvornik.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians began {{mobilisation}} on 25 August 1939 and by May 1940 {{mounted a}} field army of 18 infantry divisions, two divisions of partly <b>motorised</b> Chasseurs Ardennais and two <b>motorised</b> cavalry divisions, a force totaling some 600,000 men. Belgian reserves {{may have been}} able to field 900,000 men. The army lacked armour and anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|The French 7th Army was {{assigned}} to protect the northernmost part of the Allied front.

50|$|The first {{customer}} {{received his}} Type C {{in the summer}} of 1934, and the Bumblebee soon became the best-selling motorcycle in Denmark, sold by an efficient dealer network. The Danish Post Office, Army, and Police became customers. In 1939, as World War II loomed, the Danish government spent DKK 50 million on <b>motorising</b> the army - which bought many Type Cs.|$|R
5000|$|In World War II {{the draft}} horse {{was still the}} most common source of motive power in many armies. [...] Most nations were {{economically}} and industrially unable to fully <b>motorise</b> their forces. One compromise was to produce general purpose vehicles {{which could be used}} in the troop transport, logistics and prime mover roles, with heavy artillery tractors to move the heaviest guns.|$|R
5|$|The XLVI <b>Motorised</b> Corps {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating. About 23:00, German 2nd Army headquarters directed the 8th Panzer and 16th <b>Motorised</b> Infantry Division {{to drive to the}} north of Belgrade to link up with the First Panzer Group which was thrusting to towards Belgrade from the east. At midnight, 2nd Army headquarters declared that the Yugoslav northern front had been decisively defeated, and tasked corps engineer units to consolidate bridging across major rivers. The main body units of the XLVI <b>Motorised</b> Corps moved forward to Virovitica and Slatina. At midnight, the corps commander, General der Panzertruppe Heinrich von Vietinghoff issued orders for the 8th Panzer Division to continue towards Belgrade via Osijek, but directed the 16th <b>Motorised</b> Infantry Division to thrust west as far as Sremska Mitrovica then turn south to drive towards Sarajevo via Zvornik.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} JNA and TO forces deployed {{opposite the}} Posavina OG comprised approximately 13,500 troops, subordinated to the JNA 5th (Banja Luka) Corps. In the area, the corps had {{at its disposal}} a battlegroup of the 265th Mechanised Brigade, the 6th and the 10th Partisan Brigades, and the 16th <b>Motorised</b> Brigade, supported by the SAO Western Slavonia TO. In {{the second half of}} December, the Banja Luka Corps was reinforced by the addition of three <b>motorised</b> battalions and an armoured battalion, drawn from the 84th <b>Motorised</b> Brigade (from Bitola), and the 125th <b>Motorised</b> Brigade (from Titova Mitrovica). In addition, the 134th Light Infantry Brigade was brought in as a reinforcement from Titovo Užice on 31 December. The corps was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel General Nikola Uzelac.|$|E
5|$|The main Axis {{opposition}} was Kampfgruppe von Herff, positioned {{on the desert}} plateau. It included 30–50 tanks of the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment 5, an Italian <b>motorised</b> infantry battalion of the Trento Division, and supporting arms. The front line area around Halfaya Pass was defended by two companies of Bersaglieri—well trained Italian <b>motorised</b> infantry—with artillery support.|$|E
50|$|In 1946 Van der Schuyt and Van den Boom decided tot {{cooperate}} and in 1948 {{the two companies}} fully merged, also involving Reederij Stanfries. The company was based in Rotterdam and had a share capital of 1.5 million Dutch guilder. S.B.S. invested heavily in <b>motorising</b> its fleet, almost completing that by 1955. That year the company owned 44 motor ships, next to 5 steamers scheduled for a refit and 19 smaller vessels.|$|R
50|$|The Swift first flew in October 2006 and was {{developed}} into two versions. The first, designated K-10(02) Swift or ULM (ultra leger <b>motorise),</b> {{is aimed at}} the French ultralight market and gained French approval in 2009. The second version is targeted at the North American market and designated K-10(01) or LSA (for the US Light Sport Aircraft category). This has a wingspan increase of 600 mm, greater fuel capacity and a higher maximum take-off weight.|$|R
50|$|Experiments with {{front-wheel-drive}} cars date to {{the early}} days of the automobile. According to various sources, sometime between 1895 and 1898 Gräf & Stift built a voiturette with a one-cylinder De Dion-Bouton engine fitted in the front of the vehicle, powering the front axle. It was thus arguably the world's first front-wheel-drive automobile, but it never saw mass production, with only one copy ever made. In 1898, Latil, in France, devised a front-wheel-drive system for <b>motorising</b> horse-drawn carts.|$|R
5|$|The 1st Battalion of the ZNG's 110th Infantry Brigade {{blockaded}} {{the barracks}} on 19 September {{to contain the}} JNA and prevent the removal of weapons. The blockade was poorly organised, allowing a pair of tanks to leave the barracks and raid a nearby settlement two days later; however, according to Croatian sources one tank was destroyed during the raid. To relieve blockaded garrisons in the Karlovac area the JNA redeployed the 169th <b>Motorised</b> Brigade from Loznica and three detachments of the TO from Vojnić, assigning them to Operational Group 1 (OG-1). OG-1 attacked Croatian defences on 4 October, reaching the east bank of the Korana River on 8 October. The 169th <b>Motorised</b> Brigade collapsed due to inadequate manpower, {{and was replaced by}} the 9th <b>Motorised</b> Brigade (brought in from Serbia) on 15 October.|$|E
5|$|The JNA's Stjepan Milašinčić-Seljo {{barracks in}} Logorište, south of Karlovac, {{was one of}} the largest weapons-storage {{facilities}} in Croatia. The barracks contained weapons and equipment for the 8th Proletarian <b>Motorised</b> Brigade, the 471st Mixed Antitank Artillery Brigade, elements of the logistics battalion of the 580th Mixed Artillery Brigade, an armoured battalion of the 236th Proletarian <b>Motorised</b> Brigade and 200 tonnes of fuel and stockpiled food assigned to the 944th Logistics Base. During the summer of 1990, a mechanised battalion of the 4th Armoured Brigade was moved from Jastrebarsko to the Logorište barracks. When the battalion was deployed to Lika in late March 1991, about 40 men remained at the barracks (whose fortifications were improved). The barracks commander was Lieutenant Colonel Boro Ercegovac, who was also commanding officer of the 8th Proletarian <b>Motorised</b> Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the situation}} deteriorated significantly when the German XLI <b>Motorised</b> Corps crossed the Yugoslav-Romanian border into the Yugoslav Banat and struck the 6th Army, halting its withdrawal and disrupting {{its ability to}} organise a coherent defence behind the Danube. Also on 10 April, {{the main thrust of}} the XLVI <b>Motorised</b> Corps of the 2nd Army, consisting of the 8th Panzer Division leading the 16th <b>Motorised</b> Infantry Division crossed the Drava at Barcs in the 4th Army sector. The 8th Panzer Division turned southeast between the Drava and Sava rivers, and meeting almost no resistance and with strong air support, had reached Slatina by evening, despite poor roads and bad weather.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, the 2 Corps d'Armée <b>Motorisé</b> was one {{of three}} corps of the Ninth Army and {{consisted}} of the 4th Light Cavalry Division and 5th Motorized Division. In 1944-45, the 2nd Army Corps was subordinated to the First Army. During the campaigns in France and Germany, many divisions served with the corps but the 1st March Infantry Division, the 3rd Algerian Infantry Division, and the 9th Colonial Infantry Division spent several months under 2nd Army Corps command.|$|R
30|$|The soleckshaw {{technology}} {{was an important}} juncture in the public transport domain in India, as it allowed {{for the creation of}} a new market base of manufacturers. In the last 5  years, there has been a knowledge diffusion associated with <b>motorising</b> a conventional rickshaw leading to surprisingly the market acceptance of a higher value product in the form of electric rickshaws. This has been made possible with the intervention of the developers and the feedback of the users. This demanded a subsequent policy change.|$|R
25|$|The Saintoise, {{a fishing}} boat which is used in all the Lesser Antilles due to its {{reliability}} and its manoeuvrability.
