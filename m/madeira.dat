5|$|The Hadoram Shirihai {{expeditions to}} the <b>Madeira</b> {{archipelago}} in 2008, 2009 and 2010 each had sightings of a Pterodroma petrel (possibly the same bird) with largely white underwings, but upperwings like Zino's or Fea's. This plumage does {{not correspond to}} any known Pterodroma species. It {{may have been an}} unusual variant of Zino's but this is unlikely since no similar bird has been seen amongst the more than 100 caught at the nest. It may alternatively be a single aberrant individual, a hybrid or an unknown taxon from <b>Madeira</b> or elsewhere. No conclusion is possible on current knowledge.|$|E
5|$|A genetic {{study in}} 2012 found clear {{differences}} between various {{populations of the}} Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Pantanal; <b>Madeira</b> River basin; Rio Negro basin) and these are apparently isolated from each others, leading to the suggestion {{that it may be}} a cryptic species complex.|$|E

5|$|Charles and Zita {{temporarily}} resided at Castle Tata, {{the home}} of Count Esterházy, until a suitable permanent exile could be found. Malta was mooted as a possibility, but was declined by Lord Curzon, and French territory was ruled out due {{to the possibility of}} Zita's brothers intriguing on Charles's behalf. Eventually, the Portuguese island of <b>Madeira</b> was chosen. On 31 October 1921, the former Imperial couple were taken by rail from Tihany to Baja, where the Royal Navy monitor HMS Glowworm was waiting. They finally arrived at Funchal on 19 November. Their children were being looked after at Wartegg Castle in Switzerland by Charles's step-grandmother Maria Theresa, although Zita managed to see them in Zurich when her son Robert needed an operation for appendicitis. The children joined their parents in <b>Madeira</b> in February 1922.|$|E

5|$|In late October, {{a highly}} unusual {{tropical}} cyclone {{formed in the}} far eastern Atlantic, first detected to the southwest of <b>Madeira</b> on October 24. On October 26, a ship near <b>Madeira</b> recorded a barometric pressure of , suggesting a hurricane of Category 2 intensity. The hurricane passed just north of <b>Madeira</b> on October 27, producing heavy damage in Funchal. After brushing the northwestern coast of Morocco {{on the night of}} October 28–29, the hurricane moved ashore over southwestern Spain and likely became extratropical shortly thereafter. As a result of the extratropical transition, damaging winds extended far from the storm center and affected much of inland Spain. Dozens of ships, including three belonging to the Spanish Navy, were lost or severely damaged in the storm. Two bridges were washed away in Cádiz and homes were destroyed in Seville. Hurricane-force winds reached as far inland as Madrid, and thousands of trees were uprooted in the province of Badajoz. This storm serves as an important historical analogue for Hurricane Vince, which followed a similar course in October 2005.|$|E

5|$|The gadfly petrels in {{the genus}} Pterodroma are seabirds of {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance {{have caused the}} taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on <b>Madeira,</b> Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but mitochondrial DNA analysis, and differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. mollis, and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino's petrel on <b>Madeira</b> and Fea's petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.|$|E

On 2 March, he departed Saint-Malo with a 192-man crew to cruise off Bengal. On 9 March 1807, while en route, off <b>Madeira,</b> Revenant captured the British slave ship Aun, of sixteen 12-pounders, recently departed from Liverpool, which Surcouf let go for a ransom, after throwing her guns overboard, wetting her gunpowder and destroying some of her sails.|$|E
5|$|Bretagne was modernised in 1931–32; her torpedo {{tubes and}} four more 138mm guns were removed while four more 75mm {{anti-aircraft}} guns were added. In 1934, Bretagne and Provence {{were assigned to}} the 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic. There, they joined fleet exercises off the Azores, <b>Madeira</b> and Morocco. The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936. In August, they were involved in non-intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; these patrols lasted until April 1937.|$|E
