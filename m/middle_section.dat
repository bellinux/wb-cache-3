5|$|Due to {{encroaching}} Interstate highways—especially Interstate 35—the <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of {{the route}} through Norman, Moore, and Oklahoma City was decommissioned in 1979 for reasons of redundancy. However, some maps show SH-74 as concurrent with I-35, I-240, and I-44, thus linking the two sections.|$|E

5|$|The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr concludes {{from the}} {{autograph}} {{that only the}} <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of movement 3 and the chorale were composed in 1723 with certainty. The other parts may rely on a former unknown secular or church cantata, according to the conductor John Eliot Gardiner and the musicologist Tadeshi Isoyama.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} modification is {{expansion of the}} original material. The expansions frequently repeat preceding measures or consist of rests or left-hand figurations without the melody, providing a pause in the motion. This is especially noticeable in the Adagio, minuet and finale of the C minor Sonata, the <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of the Andantino in the A major Sonata, and the first movement of the B-flat Sonata.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{portion of}} Key Biscayne {{is home to}} Crandon Park, a county park. The <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of the island consists of the incorporated Village of Key Biscayne.

5|$|A map of Vilnius {{published}} in 1942, while {{the city was}} under Nazi rule, shows {{the northern part of}} Žirmūnai as Paneriškės, the <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> as Kareiviškės ("place of soldiers") and the southern part, close to the Tuskulėnai Manor, as Mantiškės ("a place named in honour of Mantas"). One of the streets in the area, Enriko Manto Street, referred to Herkus Mantas (Herkus Monte), a hero of the Great Prussian Uprising; today H. Manto Street is a short street in the Šnipiškės elderate ending at the boundary of Žirmūnai.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the new era until 140 AD two local groups existed in northwest Poland. The Gustow group (named after Gustow on Rügen) people lived in the area settled in the past by the Oder group, and south of there, by the <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of the Oder River was the Lubusz group, in the area previously inhabited by the Gubin group. Those were of an intermediate character, between the Elbe cultural circle to the west, and the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures to the east (the last one replaced the Oksywie culture after 30 AD).|$|E
5|$|Members {{are able}} to sit {{anywhere}} in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers {{sit in the front}} row, in the <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of the chamber.

50|$|Consonant {{clusters}} can {{be found}} in initial and <b>middle</b> <b>sections</b> of words. The first consonant must be a plosive, a fricative, or a liquid consonant. The second consonant must be a semi-vowel or a liquid consonant.|$|R
5|$|Most of the overtures are {{in three}} sections: a lively introduction, a slow <b>middle</b> <b>section,</b> and a {{concluding}} allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself {{did not always}} follow this pattern. The overture to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to Utopia Limited is dominated by a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route391 (NY391) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} in Erie County, New York, in the United States. The route is signed as north–south; however, it follows more of a southeast–northwest {{alignment}} between NY277 in the hamlet of North Boston and U.S. Route62 (US62) {{in the village of}} Hamburg. NY391 meets the Southern Expressway (US219) just north of North Boston. Both ends of NY391 are located in residential areas; however, the <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of the route passes through more rural areas of the towns of Boston and Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{finale of}} the A major Sonata, uses as its main theme, a {{transformation}} of an earlier theme from the second movement of the Piano Sonata in A minor, D. 537. Schubert introduced some changes to the original melody, which make it conform better with the sonata's basic motifs, {{in accordance with the}} cyclical scheme of the sonata. Another allusion to an earlier piano work appears {{in the middle of the}} sonata's slow movement: after the climax in the <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of the Andantino, appears a passage (bars 147–158) that closely recalls bars 35–39 from the Impromptu in G-flat major, D. 899.|$|E

5|$|The first verse of {{the text}} {{is used for the}} opening and final {{sections}} of the aria; the second verse for the <b>middle</b> <b>section.</b> Both verses have an identical rhyming scheme. The form of the verses is based on the style perfected by Metastasio, including the placement of poetic stress. Each line has seven sung syllables; the first two lines of each verse close with the stress on the penultimate syllable (versi piani), the final line of each with stress on the last syllable (verso tronco).|$|E
5|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of the column, {{forming a}} type of capital, is a high-relief {{sculpture}} {{of the head of}} a bat executed in the curved lines of the Maya style, with small eyes and eyebrows formed by two small volutes. The leaf-shaped nose is characteristic of the Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus). The mouth is open, exposing the partly preserved fangs, and a prominent tongue extends downwards. A band of double triangles runs around the sculpture with a carved cord or rope and may symbolise the bat's wings.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Tabsor the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut) and 75th Divisions {{attacked}} the entrenched Ottoman Empire Eighth Army defending the Tabsor defences. These defences {{were located in}} the <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of the front line, assigned to the XXI Corps. On their left the Battle of Tulkarm was being fought with the Battle of Arara fought on their right. Together with the cavalry phase, these battles make up the Battle of Sharon, which, with the Battle of Nablus, fought by the XX Corps and Chaytor's Force, have {{become known as the}} Battle of Megiddo. Megiddo developed into a major set piece offensive, when large formations of the Allied EEF, attacked and responded to the reactions of three Ottoman armies, each time following a predetermined plan. The offensive resulted in defeat for Ottoman forces in Palestine, Syria and the Transjordan.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} the highway {{like all other}} state trunkline highways under its jurisdiction. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its highways. These surveys are expressed using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the traffic counts for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that 692vehicles a day used the segment near the state park. Through the <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> in Garden, the peak volume was 892vehicles daily which dropped to 878at the USjunction. The commercial AADT was 54trucks for the entire highway. M-183 has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper <b>middle</b> <b>section</b> of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E
