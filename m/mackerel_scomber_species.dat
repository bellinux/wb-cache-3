40|$|Restriction-site {{associated}} DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) {{and related}} methods are revolutionizing {{the field of}} population genomics in non-model organisms as they allow generating an unprecedented number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) even when no genomic information is available.

Using the Atlantic <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> scombrus L.) and a close relative, the Atlantic chub <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> colias), as case study, here we explore the sensitivity of population structure inferences to two crucial aspects in RAD-seq data analysis: {{the maximum number of}} mismatches allowed to merge reads into a locus and the relatedness of the individuals used for genotype calling and SNP selection.

40|$|Low-salt {{restructured}} {{fish products}} from Atlantic <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> scombrus) with texture resembling turkey breast MJ Martelo-Vidal, JM Mesas and M Vázquez Atlantic <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> scombrus) is a pelagic and migratory species {{that is usually}} caught with other fish as bycatch. The aim of this work was to obtain low-salt restructured fish products from Atlantic mackerel resembling turkey breast using transglutaminase (0. 2 U/g) as binder. NaCl concentration (0 – 20 g/kg), tem-perature (25 – 40 C) and time of incubation (30 – 90 min) were assayed. The texture parameters (Warner– Bratzler force and Warner–Bratzler work) and expressible water were compared to those of turkey breast. Mathematical models were obtained {{to determine the effect}} of these variables on the texture of Atlantic mackerel restructured products. Optimal conditions to obtain a similar texture than turkey breast were found. The overall optimization point out that the treatment at 31. 8 C for 63. 35 min using a NaCl concentration of 8. 45 g/kg allowed to obtain restructured products from Atlantic mackerel with texture and expressible water similar to those of turkey breast.
