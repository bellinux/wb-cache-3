She {{and the other}} three women in the program maintained a friendly competition with the male students which, she said, [...] "put us on our mettle to prove that we, too, were serious students and competitors.

[...] Michael Billington wrote that Pinter saw Daniel's name change as [...] "a largely pragmatic move on Daniel's part designed to keep the press... at bay." [...] Fraser told Billington that Daniel [...] "was very nice to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when it would have been only too easy for him to have turned on me... simply because he had been the sole focus of his father's love and now manifestly wasn't." [...] Still unreconciled {{at the time of his}} father's death, Daniel Brand did not attend Pinter's funeral.|$|E
500|$|A preview {{screening}} of Sweet Smell of Success was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were {{expecting him to}} play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> party after the preview. He said, 'You didn't have to leave – you could have made this a much better picture. I ought to beat you up.' I said, 'Go ahead – I could use the money.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Scheduled for a January 2008 release, Popular was {{promoted}} with {{five months of}} concert performances by Hunt, press coverage, {{and the release of}} promotional copies, including the four-song EP The Popular Machine (2007) and advance CDs for the media and radio people. However, weeks before its scheduled release, the album was shelved by Blue Note, with whom Hunt had been experiencing differences, and they subsequently parted ways. Blue Note had felt that the album was not profitable enough to release. Hunt could not release Popular himself without repaying the project's costs back to EMI and obtaining rights to the album's master recordings. According to him, EMI requested twice the original costs, and in his opinion, the money for promoting Popular was not [...] "strategically spent well" [...] by the label. Hunt discussed the situation in an interview for Creative Loafing, saying that [...] "They opted to not sell it to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> price that I could afford. They've got it and I'm sure they'll come out with it when they deem it necessary and profitable."

500|$|In 1961, Cardinale portrayed a sultry nightclub {{singer and}} young mother in Valerio Zurlini's Girl with a Suitcase. As {{a result of}} her own {{experience}} of early motherhood, Cardinale naturally conveyed the concerns of a teenaged mother, identifying fully with the character of Aida. Such was her psychological involvement that she needed several months to overcome her apprehensions and prepare for the part. Zurlini chose her for such a difficult role against everyone's advice, as she was not yet considered a [...] "real" [...] actress, nor was she (yet) one of the most celebrated Italian beauties. However, he was very close and supportive of Cardinale during the production, and a true friendship developed between the two, based on a deep mutual understanding. Cardinale remarked: [...] "Zurlini {{was one of those who}} really love women: he had an almost feminine sensitivity. He could understand <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> glance. He taught me everything, without ever making demands on me. ... He was really very fond of me." [...] Cardinale was warmly praised by the critics for her performance in Girl with a Suitcase, Dennis Schwartz considering her to have been at her [...] "charming best". Later in 1961, Cardinale starred as a brothel owner opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in Bolognini's La Viaccia. Both Girl with a Suitcase and La Viaccia were presented at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. At the time, Cardinale was not considered comparable to the two divas of Italian cinema, Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, but several newspapers and magazines including Paris Match began to consider her to be a credible young rival to Brigitte Bardot. Cardinale's 1961 appearances also included Henri Verneuil's French comedy Les Lions sont lâchés, and Auguste in which she had a cameo role.|$|E

Snyder flew out to San Francisco, California to screen several episodes, and told Lucas the only place he wanted to see the show was on Cartoon Network. Snyder wished to create an action/adventure block of shows on Friday night in an attempt to rejuvenate Cartoon Network. Snyder expressed confidence that the shows would help boost ratings: [...] "You catch <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time where I have {{a smile on my face}} because of our internal results".

2500|$|The first {{performance}} of MacHomer {{was at the}} Montreal Fringe Festival in 1995. At the time, the play [...] "was a very basic version with a few slides and <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> mike stand." [...] Miller began touring the following year. He has consistently changed parts of the play since its premiere. Until 2000, MacHomer was mainly a sketch comedy routine, but that year he expanded it into more of a theatrical production. The overhaul was Miller's effort [...] "to {{turn it into a}} play I could feel comfortable touring the world with, as opposed to just playing the odd college." [...] In 2006, for the 10th anniversary tour, Miller further revamped the play, adding new songs and characters, and incorporating videos. As of 2011, MacHomer is presented by WYRD Productions and directed by Sean Lynch. The lighting and stage design are by Beth Kates.|$|E
2500|$|SFGate {{described}} the [...] "show-tune- style songs" [...] as [...] "pleasant but forgettable", adding that [...] "the singing by Short, Belushi, Curry and Broadway belter Golden {{is the best}} thing about the film". It also noted that [...] "One of the obvious obstacles was how to color a film whose natural shadings tend toward black, white and degrees of gray. The result is a lot of odd but fascinating colorations -- the sky might turn up yellow at times, or the sea a deep maroon". The Spokesman-Review wrote [...] "in an era when G-rated movies are as rare as Hollywood humility, any attempt at family entertainment should be lauded", adding [...] "let us salute Don Bluth and his team of animators". In a rare case, The Daily Gazette gave the film 4 stars. The Animated Movie Guide said the film was an [...] "utter waste of talent and resources", due to interference from external forces.

2500|$|During early production, Age of Empires Online was {{originally}} called Age of Empires IV. The development team {{had noticed that}} many other RTS game developers had {{moved away from the}} [...] "economic game". The team felt that [...] had blended the economic and military aspects of the game perfectly, so they decided to play test it with hindsight. They noticed that many features had been lost or changed over time. It was during this time the team decided to do an [...] "Age of Kings style gameplay in an Age of Empires setting". The designers were surprised that fans of the series were most fond of the simpler aspects of the previous titles. Former Age of Empires II lead designer Ian M. Fischer stated, [...] "When we started floating some of the early [...] out to people other pieces fell into place – I cannot tell you how many times I have had someone email me or talk to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> show and mention how much they loved the villagers carrying big hunks of meat in the original Age or the priest [...] "wololo"". From that point on, one of the goals was to invoke nostalgia from fans of the series when playing the game, despite the newer and updated features.|$|E

[...] The twenty-five-year-old Alexandre Dumas, père, {{who was about to}} embark on a major career as a novelist and dramatist, was in the audience and found the performance revelatory, [...] "far surpassing all my expectations". The French composer Hector Berlioz was also present at that opening night performance and later wrote: [...] "The lightning flash of that sublime discovery opened before <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> stroke the whole heaven of art, illuminating it to its remotest depths.

Sharapova stated, [...] "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life.

There are more flexible ideas, more artistic flourishes, more colors. I've probably been influenced in that direction by people like Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew and David Torn. I'm more interested in using guitar sounds as textures and using effects in a more textural fashion. To paraphrase Robert Fripp, I'm more interested in painting a soundscape like he and Adrian Belew do in King Crimson, on Bowie records and in Fripp's solo stuff.
