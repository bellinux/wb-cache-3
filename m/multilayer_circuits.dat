40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel circuit fabrication process using UV laser direct-write lithography {{in combination with}} conventional mask photolithography to produce a dense, multilayer, resin-coated-foil (RCF) build-up substrate. Using this process, a multilayer HDI substrate was produced featuring an FR 4 layer with two RCF build-up layers. The top RCF circuit was patterned with a 10 x 10 array of pads at 250 micron pitch, fully connected through all layers of the substrate to a larger pitched periphery pad pattern, demonstrating a chip-scale package interconnect capability. The fine-line features of the top layer include 30 micron traces, which are patterned on conventional dry film negative photoresist using a tripled-YAG, UV laser drilling system (Electro Scientific Industries 5100) with highly attenuated output, after conventional mask exposure of larger trace features.

40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} concerned with the development of fabrication techniques and novel designs for self-packaged, <b>multilayer</b> <b>circuits</b> using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) materials exclusively, given the favourable characteristics this material has for microwave circuits. Fabrication techniques are aimed at the production of miniature, low-profile filters. Advanced techniques for production of interlayer via connections are investigated and new methods proposed, with special attention at the lamination process and production of vertical, inter-layer transitions. Results obtained demonstrate the fabrication process is reliable for producing multilayer filters, with up to four metal layers, and via transitions in the region of 0. 2 mm diameter. The fabrication process has been developed during this work is applied to novel filter designs, covering dual-band filters and lowpass filters. A new structure for dual- band filter is proposed, using folded multimode resonators (FMSIR). This structure is validated through the fabrication of two different filters with passbands 1. 2 / 2. 4 GHz, and 2. 4 / 5 GHz, showing deep off-band rejection. Low pass structure covered in this thesis is based on the principle of destructive interference and aims at low insertion loss and out-of-band rejection higher than 40 dB. Fabricated samples validate the design showing a rejection in the region of 42 dB, with a cuto frequency of 3 GHz. Its small footprint and low insertion loss allows this type of lters to be used as cleanup filters.

40|$|New {{interconnect}} technologies {{continue to}} shrink feature size, increase routing complexity and component density in multilayer rigid and rigid-flex printed circuits. Printed circuit fabricators have choices on the technology required {{to build the}} <b>multilayer</b> <b>circuits</b> based {{on the level of}} the technology required. One innovative technology is sequential lamination where multilayer boards are formed by laminating together plated double-sided or multilayers with blind and buried via interconnections. The sequential lamination manufacturing technique can yield even more significant benefits in performance and circuit processing when combined with embedded resistor features within the printed board. Embedded passive technology allows the resistors to be placed on the same layer as the routed traces reducing the need for microvias. This technology also enables resistors to be placed at an optimum location to reduce the inductance impact of pads, stubs, and coupling. The sequential lamination process in combination with thin film embedded resistors requires a different processing sequence than conventional multilayer manufacturing with thin film embedded resistors. Materials for embedded resistor can be either stand-alone resistor foil or a resistor laminate. For sequential lamination applications copper foil with a resistive alloy is preferred rather than a resistor laminate material. The copper/resistor foil has very low profile, and small circuit features can be achieved. Consequently, resistors can be fabricated in signal or power ground layers with multiple resistor values and good finished tolerances. The resistor alloys are robust and have low thermal coefficient of resistivity. The resistors maintain their initial values and reliability through the multiple lamination steps and subsequent thermal excursions required by the sequential lamination process...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{automated}} fabrication of flexible, electrically conductive patterns on cloth substrates has been demonstrated. Products developed using this method, or related prior methods, are instances of a technology known as 'e-textiles,' in which electrically conductive patterns ar formed in, and on, textiles. For many applications, including high-speed digital circuits, antennas, and radio frequency (RF) circuits, an e-textile method should {{be capable of}} providing high surface conductivity, tight tolerances for control of characteristic impedances, and geometrically complex conductive patterns. Unlike prior methods, the present method satisfies {{all three of these}} criteria. Typical patterns can include such circuit structures as RF transmission lines, antennas, filters, and other conductive patterns equivalent to those of conventional printed circuits. The present method overcomes the limitations of the prior methods for forming the equivalent of printed circuits on cloth. A typical fabrication process according to the present method involves selecting the appropriate conductive and non-conductive fabric layers to build the e-textile circuit. The present method uses commercially available woven conductive cloth with established surface conductivity specifications. Dielectric constant, loss tangent, and thickness are some of the parameters to be considered for the non-conductive fabric layers. The circuit design of the conductive woven fabric is secured onto a non-conductive fabric layer using sewing, embroidery, and/or adhesive means.

40|$|This work {{is related}} to the {{development}} of terminal antennas for satellite communications in Ka-band (down-link 19. 70 - 20. 20 GHz and up-link- 29. 50 - 30. 0 GHz). Innovative designs are called for {{in order to meet the}} stringent requirements of ATM-Sat terminal antenna like high frequency operating band, compactness, light weight and above all low cost. A multilayer active array antenna appears to be the most suitable option for this application. Basically, it would consist of a passive patch elements array and several circuit layers with passive feeding networks and active circuit layers. To make this planar structure operate in a proper way, the indispensable transfer of power between adjacent layers must rely on robust and highly efficient 3 D transitions. Further, for ease of mounting of active elements and due to their less dispersive behaviour at high frequencies, coplanar waveguides are chosen as transmission line media. The present work is concentrated on this aspect of 3 D transition between coplanar lines. An extensive survey was carried out to collect information on different types of coplanar waveguides (CPW), modes of operation, parasitic modes and suppression techniques, CPW discontinuities, <b>multilayer</b> <b>circuits,</b> application of CPWs in antenna and MMIC circuits. Apart from these topics, thorough literature survey was carried out for 3 D CPW transitions.

After literature survey, work was concentrated on software simulation study. Initially a few examples from literature were simulated to build the confidence and check the applicability of the simulation tools. After gaining enough experience, the structures of interest like conductor-backed coplanar waveguides (CBCPW) -to-cover-shielded-CBCPW transitions by direct electrical contact and electromagnetic coupling were studied in detail.

Specifically, this dissertation discusses aberration and attenuation due to the skull as sources of image degradation and presents a prototype system for simultaneous 3 D bilateral imaging via both temporal acoustic windows. This system uses custom sparse array transducers built on flexible <b>multilayer</b> <b>circuits</b> that can be positioned for simultaneous imaging via both temporal acoustic windows, allowing for registration and fusion of multiple real-time 3 D scans of cerebral vasculature. I examine hardware considerations for new matrix arrays [...] transducer design and interconnects [...] in this application. Specifically, it is proposed that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may be increased by reducing the length of probe cables. This claim is evaluated {{as part of the}} presented system through simulation, experimental data, and in vivo imaging. Ultimately, gains in SNR of 7 dB are realized by replacing a standard probe cable with a much shorter flex interconnect; higher gains may be possible using ribbon-based probe cables. In vivo images are presented depicting cerebral arteries with and without the use of microbubble contrast agent that have been registered and fused using a search algorithm which maximizes normalized cross-correlation. The scanning geometry of a brain helmet-type system is also utilized to allow each matrix array to serve as a correction source for the opposing array. Aberration is estimated using cross-correlation of RF channel signals followed by least mean squares solution of the resulting overdetermined system. Delay maps are updated and real-time 3 D scanning resumes. A first attempt is made at using multiple arrival time maps to correct multiple unique aberrators within a single transcranial imaging volume, i. e. several isoplanatic patches. This adaptive imaging technique, which uses steered unfocused waves transmitted by the opposing or "beacon" array, updates the transmit and receive delays of 5 isoplanatic patches within a 64 °× 64 ° volume. In phantom experiments, color flow voxels above a common threshold have increased by an average of 92 % while color flow variance decreased by an average of 10 %. This approach has been applied to both temporal acoustic windows of two human subjects, yielding increases in echo brightness in 5 isoplanatic patches with a mean value of 24. 3 ± 9. 1 %, suggesting such a technique may be beneficial in the future for improving image quality in non-invasive 3 D color flow imaging of cerebrovascular disease including stroke. Acoustic window failure and the possibility of overcoming it using a low frequency, large aperture array are also examined. In performing transcranial ultrasound examinations, 8 - 29 % of patients in a general population may present with window failure, in which {{it is not possible to}} acquire clinically useful sonographic information through the temporal acoustic window. The incidence of window failure is higher in the elderly and in populations of African descent, making window failure an important concern for stroke imaging through the intact skull. To this end, I describe the technical considerations, design, and fabrication of low-frequency (1. 2 MHz), large aperture (25. 3 mm) sparse matrix array transducers for 3 D imaging in the event of window failure. These transducers are integrated into the existing system for real-time 3 D bilateral transcranial imaging and color flow imaging capabilities at 1. 2 MHz are directly compared with arrays operating at 1. 8 MHz in a flow phantom with approximately 47 dB/cm 0. 8 /MHz 0. 8 attenuators. In vivo contrast-enhanced imaging allowed visualization of the arteries of the Circle of Willis in 5 of 5 subjects and 8 of 10 sides of the head despite probe placement outside of the acoustic window. Results suggest that the decrease from approximately 2 to 1 MHz for 3 D transcranial ultrasound may be sufficient to allow acquisition of useful images either in individuals with poor windows or outside of the temporal acoustic window by untrained operators in the field.
