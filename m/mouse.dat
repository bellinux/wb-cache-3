5|$|Crypsis, or the {{inability}} of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive lemurs (Lepilemur) and <b>mouse</b> lemurs (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of <b>mouse</b> lemurs, the gray <b>mouse</b> lemur (M. murinus), golden-brown <b>mouse</b> lemur (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's <b>mouse</b> lemur (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|During a 2003 {{biological}} {{inventory of}} the Mikea Forest, a forest region of southwestern Madagascar, a single specimen of the rodent genus Macrotarsomys was collected. This animal {{turned out to be}} distinct from both previously known species of the genus—bastard big-footed <b>mouse,</b> which is widespread in western Madagascar, and the larger greater big-footed <b>mouse,</b> known only from the Ankarafantsika National Park. Accordingly, Steven Goodman and Voahangy Soarimalala named it in 2005 as a new species, Macrotarsomys petteri. The specific name, petteri, honors French zoologist Francis Petter for his contributions to the study of Malagasy rodents. Petter's big-footed <b>mouse,</b> the largest species in the genus, is most similar to greater big-footed <b>mouse,</b> which may be its closest relative.|$|E
5|$|Giant <b>mouse</b> lemurs {{are about}} three times larger than <b>mouse</b> lemurs, {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to <b>mouse</b> lemurs within Cheirogaleidae, a family of small, nocturnal lemurs. Giant <b>mouse</b> lemurs sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage alone at night for fruit, tree gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of torpor during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant <b>mouse</b> lemurs are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital scent gland.|$|E

5|$|Giant <b>mouse</b> lemurs {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with <b>mouse</b> lemurs, such as M.murinus, {{though they are}} typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (<b>mouse</b> lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Like other <b>mouse</b> lemurs, {{the gray}} <b>mouse</b> lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown <b>mouse</b> lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray <b>mouse</b> lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray <b>mouse</b> lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown <b>mouse</b> lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E

40|$|Vitamin K is a {{fat-soluble vitamin}} that plays {{important}} roles in blood coagulation and bone metabolism. One of its functions is as a co-factor for c-glutamyl carboxylase (Ggcx). Conventional knockout of Ggcx causes death shortly after birth in homozygous <b>mice.</b> We created Ggcx-floxed <b>mice</b> by inserting loxP sequences at the sites flanking exon 6 of Ggcx. By mating these <b>mice</b> with albumin-Cre <b>mice,</b> we generated Ggcx-deficient <b>mice</b> specifically in hepatocytes (GgcxDliver/Dliver <b>mice).</b> In contrast to conventional Ggcx knockout <b>mice,</b> GgcxDliver/Dliver <b>mice</b> had very low activity of Ggcx in the liver and survived several weeks after birth.

To assess the mechanisms of decrease in LDH elevation in SCID <b>mice</b> infected with LDV, virus replication was compared in SCID and BALB/cCrSlc <b>mice.</b> The infectivity titre of plasma in SCID <b>mice</b> was higher (more than 10 times) than that in BALB/cCrSlc <b>mice.</b> Moreover, the percentage of virus antigen positive Kupffer cells was higher in SCID <b>mice</b> than that in BALB/cCrSlc <b>mice.</b> The level of endogenous LDH release {{as a result of}} carbon tetrachloride treatment was similar in the SCID and BALB/cCrSlc <b>mice.</b> The clearance rate of endogenous LDH was greater in SCID <b>mice</b> than in BALB/cCrSlc <b>mice</b> with or without LDV infection. The rate of clearance of intravenously injected porcine LDH- 5, but not porcine LDH- 1, was enhanced in SCID <b>mice</b> as compared with that in BALB/cCrSlc <b>mice.</b> Furthermore, carbon clearance was higher in SCID <b>mice</b> than that in BALB/cCrSlc <b>mice.</b> These results suggest that the smaller increase of plasma LDH after infection might be due, at least in part, to the enhanced LDH- 5 clearance function by macrophages in SCID <b>mice...</b>|$|R
