40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of crosstalk on single victim due to multiple aggressors in the same metal layer is studied. We develop here a crosstalk fault model based on the consideration of usual distributed coupling capacitance and RLGC parasitics of interconnects in addition to <b>mutual</b> <b>conductance</b> (resistive bridging) {{in order to deal}} the crosstalk influence. Here, we estimate the crosstalk influence for worst case input signal combinations on aggressors, which induce more crosstalk on single victim. Our model helps the System-on-Chip (SoC) designers by providing sufficient insights into Signal Integrity problems. Experimental simulations with our crosstalk model, carried out using Philips CMOS 12 (130 nm) technology parameters, further validated with PSPICE simulations reveal that coupling capacitance’s effect is more on crosstalk glitch and signal delay on victim’s output whereas, the <b>mutual</b> <b>conductance</b> affects more on the final steady state value of the victim’s output signal.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the properties and potential applications {{of a novel}} hybrid varistor device originating from biased voltage induced modified nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Single crystal of an oxide semiconductor in the family of iron-titanates with the chemical formula of Fe 2 TiO 5 (pseudobrookite) {{has been used as}} substrate for the varistor. The modifications of the varistor characteristics are achieved by superimposition of a bias voltage in the current path of the varistor. These altered I-V characteristics, when analyzed, reveal the existence of embedded transistors coexisting with the varistor. These transistors exhibit <b>mutual</b> <b>conductance,</b> signal amplification and electronic switching which are the defining signatures of a typical transistor. The tuned varistors also acquire the properties of signal amplification and <b>mutual</b> <b>conductance</b> which expand the range of applications for a varistor beyond its traditional use as circuit protector.

Two effects causing the output <b>conductance</b> <b>variation</b> with frequency, namely self-heating and source-to-drain coupling through the substrate, are discussed and qualitatively compared. Notwithstanding the use of ultra-thin BOX, which allows for improved heat evacuation from the channel to the Si substrate underneath BOX, a self-heating-related transition clearly appears in the output conductance frequency response. Furthermore, {{the use of an}} ultra thin BOX results in an increase of the substrate-related output <b>conductance</b> <b>variation</b> in frequency.

Combined experimental and theoretical analyses confirm that the <b>conductance</b> <b>variation</b> with strain {{is because of the}} transition from sp(2) to configurations that are promoted by the interaction of walls in the nanotubes. The intrawall interaction is the reason for the monotonic increase in the conduction, while the oscillations are attributable to interwall interactions.
