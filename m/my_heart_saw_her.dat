6000|$|I {{knew her}} at once when I {{went down to}} the drawing-room. There were three other strange women there, but I knew {{she was the only one}} who could be Mrs. Rennie. I felt such a horrible queer sinking feeling at <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> when I <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> Oh, she was {{beautiful}} ... I had never seen anyone so beautiful. And Sidney was standing beside her, talking to her, with a smile on his face, but none in his eyes ... I noticed that at a glance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The grief which I {{experienced}} at this intelligence {{was such that}} at dusk I went away {{to the edge of}} the harbour, intending to put an end to myself there and then. But I had been told that crabs had been found clinging to the dead faces of persons who had fallen in thereabout, leisurely eating them, and the idea of such an unpleasant contingency deterred me. I should state that the marriage of my Beloved concerned me little; it was her departure that broke <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> I never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again.|$|R
50|$|Sharissa Dawes (born 1976) is an American singer. She {{released}} a debut album No Half Steppin through Motown Records in 2002 which earned two charting singles. Her second album Every Beat of <b>My</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>saw</b> a Japan-only release in 2005 through Virgin Records. Sharissa has {{started working on}} her third album, All or Nuth'n.|$|R
50|$|When {{his father}} Louis died February 5, 2004 of acute pancreatitis, {{he left behind}} several {{unfinished}} projects behind - including an unpublished manuscript and lyrics for a planned follow-up to Read <b>My</b> <b>Heart.</b> Anthony <b>saw</b> this {{as a sign that}} he should get serious about filmmaking.|$|R
50|$|In May 2010, Hannah {{released}} her debut EP, Hold <b>My</b> <b>Heart,</b> which reached number 6 in the iTunes Singer-Songwriter album charts. Off {{the back of}} the success of Hold <b>My</b> <b>Heart</b> Hannah <b>saw</b> out 2010 by playing sold out shows at London Scala, Birmingham O2 and Manchester Academy whilst touring in support of Boyce Avenue on their 2010 Fall Tour.|$|R
60|$|The old {{soldier was}} not one easily discouraged. During ten minutes more he {{continued}} his efforts, now moving the stick to and fro, and again giving to it an up-and-down motion, and then, {{at the very moment}} when all hope had fled from <b>my</b> <b>heart,</b> I <b>saw</b> the man straighten himself suddenly, as he shaded his eyes with his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "David," [...] she said, [...] "could you {{not tell}} that I loved you, {{that you were}} he {{who has been in}} my mind for so many years, and in <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> since I <b>saw</b> you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Your poor {{mother has}} been {{constantly}} in my thoughts since I saw the quiet bravery {{with which she}} preserved her composure. The beauty of her ministration sank into <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> when I <b>saw</b> him {{for the last time}} on earth. May God be with her, and with you all, in your great loss.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I wept because Hope had rent her starry garment and in {{darkness}} I must seek for light. And while I still wept, you {{rose out of}} the sea and sat before me in the boat. I had never seen you before, and still I felt that I had known you always. You did not speak, and I did not speak, but you looked into <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> and <b>saw</b> its trouble. Then I looked into your heart, and read what was written. And this was written: ...|$|R
60|$|In fact, Tom Gates, on sober reflection, {{knew that}} the girl could not be Lucy, yet he could not still the yearning in his <b>heart</b> {{whenever}} he <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> His <b>heart</b> declared that she was Lucy, and his head realized {{that she could not}} be.|$|R
60|$|Major Bellenden, who {{had done}} the honours of the table, {{laughing}} and chatting with the military guests who were at that end of the board, was now, by {{the conclusion of the}} repast, at liberty to leave his station, and accordingly took an opportunity to approach Claverhouse, requesting from his niece, at the same time, the honour of a particular introduction. As his name and character were well known, the two military men met with expressions of mutual regard; and Edith, with a beating <b>heart,</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> aged relative withdraw from the company, together with his new acquaintance, into a recess formed by one of the arched windows of the hall. She watched their conference with eyes almost dazzled by the eagerness of suspense, and, with observation rendered more acute by the internal agony of her mind, could guess, from the pantomimic gestures which accompanied the conversation, the progress and fate of the intercession in behalf of Henry Morton.|$|R
6000|$|So {{fearful of}} {{losing sight of}} her that it almost stops my breath while I tell it, I went down-stairs faster than I ever moved {{in all my life}} and only tapped with my hand at the Major's door in passing it and {{slipping}} out. She was gone already. I made the same speed down the street and when I came to the corner of Howard Street I saw that she had turned it and was there plain before me going towards the west. O with what a thankful <b>heart</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> going along! ...|$|R
60|$|Eve for {{a moment}} sat quite still; she, too, seemed nervous. I was looking away again at the {{retreating}} figures of Mr. Parker and Mr. Moss. Suddenly <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> sank. I <b>saw</b> the old gentleman spring {{to his feet and}} hurry after them; and I saw, too, {{at the end of the}} line of stalls, Mr. Cullen and a companion standing, waiting. I rose quickly to my feet.|$|R
60|$|There was a breathless moment, {{when the}} blood of the undaunted Esther flowed {{backward}} to <b>her</b> <b>heart,</b> as she <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> sons push aside the matted branches of the thicket and bury themselves in its labyrinth. A deep and solemn pause succeeded. Then arose two loud and piercing cries, in quick succession, which were followed by a quiet, still more awful and appalling.|$|R
60|$|Within {{himself he}} was frankly taken aback at Gilda's ready acquiescence--nay obvious desire to parley with the foreigner. A sharp pang of jealousy had shot through his <b>heart</b> when he <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> glowing eyes, her eagerness {{to defend the}} knave. The {{instinct}} that guided his fierce love for Gilda, had quickly warned him that here was a danger {{of which he had}} never even dreamed.|$|R
60|$|We {{reached the}} bottom, {{and the long}} file turned and hurried silently northward, searching for a crossing. I try to recall my {{feelings}} as I trotted beside the tall forms that loomed above me in the night. The sense of protection they gave me stripped me of fear, and I was not troubled with that. My thoughts were chiefly on Polly Ann and the child we had left in the fort now so far {{to the south of}} us, and in my fancy I <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> cheerful, ever helpful to those around her, despite the load that must rest on <b>her</b> <b>heart.</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> simple joy at our return. But should we return? My chest tightened, and I sped along the ranks to Harrod's company and caught Tom by the wrist.|$|R
50|$|A new solo-album {{is in the}} {{pipeline}} but held back by {{the release of a}} Best Of-album; the expected Doe Maar-revival never happened, and in early 1992 Mijn Hart Slaapt Nooit (<b>My</b> <b>Heart</b> Never Sleeps) <b>saw</b> the light of day. As with Geen Ballade the album received minimal promotion. At {{the end of the year}} all Doe Maar-members reunited to support 1960s outfit CCC Inc. (featuring Ernst Jansz and Joost Belinfante) at their 25th anniversary concert. Only few people notice.|$|R
60|$|From all {{of which}} it will be seen that d'Aguilar had quickly succeeded in the plan which only {{presented}} itself to him a few hours before. Betty was already half in love with him. Not that he had any desire to possess this beautiful but foolish woman's <b>heart,</b> who <b>saw</b> in <b>her</b> only a useful tool, a stepping-stone by means of which he might draw near to Margaret.|$|R
60|$|If {{this journey}} {{had taken place}} during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people {{for the sake of}} the {{information}} they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> I <b>saw</b> an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.|$|R
50|$|A countryman's favour {{was usually}} a plait of three straws and tied into a loose knot to {{represent}} a heart. It is reputed {{to have been made}} by a young man with straws picked up after the harvest and given to his loved one. If she was wearing it next to <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> when he <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again then he would know that his love was reciprocated. Three straws can be plaited using the hair plait or a cat's foot plait. Favours can be made with two, three, four or more straws.|$|R
50|$|One of them lied, {{claiming}} to be fifteen and her sister twenty, and the king decided to marry her. She {{said that she had}} never seen a ray of sun since she was born, and being touched would turn her black; the king had to send a carriage. He did, she went, heavily veiled, and they married. Their wedding night, he saw the old woman he had married and threw her out the window, where she caught on a hook. Four fairies <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> there and mischievously gave her youth, beauty, wisdom, and a tender <b>heart.</b> The king <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> the next morning, thought he must have been blind, and had her rescued.|$|R
6000|$|... "And when I <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> though I spake not to her, nor she to me, yet {{straightway}} <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> {{knew that}} she would love me not." ...|$|R
5000|$|These sights sickened Loftis {{who was a}} harsh {{critic of}} the Tibetan people's Buddhist traditions. He wrote, [...] "It struck chills to <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> when I <b>saw</b> these deluded wretches groping so blindly {{in the dark for}} help from a higher power." [...] Loftis had further {{opportunities}} to see the religious practices of the Tibetan people within the [...] "Holy City" [...] of Lhasa. It was there where Loftis became one of the [...] "first foreigners" [...] to ever visit and stay at the Litang monastery and to enter their Holy Temple. Loftis became one of the few westerners who interacted with an abbot at the Holy City who was said to be [...] "a Living Buddha" [...] and from whom Loftis learned about the Kangyur.|$|R
60|$|When Jo {{came home}} that spring, {{she had been}} struck with the change in Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too {{gradually}} to startle those who <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> daily, but to eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo's <b>heart</b> as she <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> sister's face. It was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression {{lost much of its}} power, for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo for a time forgot her fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Susan," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{may as well}} {{speak out}} now as at another time." [...] He too was looking towards the ground, and clearly {{did not know what}} to do with his hands. [...] "The truth is just this. I--I love you dearly, with all <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> I never <b>saw</b> any one I ever thought so beautiful, so nice, and so good;--and what's more, I never shall. I'm not very good at this sort of thing, I know; but I couldn't go away from Saratoga for six weeks and not tell you." [...] And then he ceased. He did not ask for any love in return. His {{presumption}} had not got so far as that yet. He merely declared his passion, leaning against the door, and there he stood twiddling his thumbs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{was afraid}} that the Watcher-by-Night would be {{watching}} by night; also the dog ran up to me, but he knew me and I sent him back again. Now while I was coming home, thoughts entered <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> I <b>saw,</b> as one sees by a lightning flash, all that I had done. The king and his people were {{not sure that the}} Master was hiding white folk here and would never have sent back to kill them on the chance. I had made them sure, as indeed, being mad, I meant to do. Moreover, in throwing spears at the kites I had killed my own dove, since it was on the false Inkosazana who had caused them to declare war and brought the land to ruin, that they wished to be avenged, and perchance on him who taught her her part, not on one or two wandering white men. I saw that when Cetewayo's people came, and there were many more of them outside, several hundreds I think, they would shave the whole head and burn the whole tree. Every one in the kloof would be killed.|$|R
6000|$|Wi' glowrin een, {{and lifted}} han's [...] Poor Hughoc like a statue stan's; [...] He <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> days were near-hand ended, [...] But, wae's <b>my</b> <b>heart!</b> he could na mend it! [...] He gaped wide, but naething spak, [...] At langth poor Mailie silence brak.|$|R
5000|$|During her January 8, 2017, {{acceptance}} {{speech at the}} Golden Globe Award ceremony, actress Meryl Streep referred to the incident as [...] "one performance this year that stunned me". Streep said:It sank its hooks in <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> Not because it was good; there was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking {{to sit in the}} most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> when I <b>saw</b> it, and I still can’t get it out of my head, because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life. And this instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked so}} attentively and anxiously at me (I even <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> tremble), that I felt now, more than ever, {{that she had}} {{followed}} my late thoughts. I summoned all the resolutions I had made, in all those many days and nights, and all those many conflicts of <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{she passed}} {{on over the}} edge of the world, seeking her own place. Thus, my father, for the third and last time did my eyes see the Inkosazana-y-Zulu, or mayhap <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> dreamed that I <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> Soon I shall see her again, but it will not be here.|$|R
6000|$|And up to yonder {{hill was}} I her guide; [...] Alas, and there I took of her my leave; [...] Yonder I <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> to her Father ride, [...] For very grief of which <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> shall cleave;--95 [...] And hither home I came {{when it was}} eve; [...] And here I dwell an outcast from all joy, [...] And shall, unless I see her soon in Troy.|$|R
60|$|And {{one night}} as I came {{near the village}} of Rosses on the road from Sligo, a fire blazed up on a green bank at my right side seven or eight feet above me, and another fire {{suddenly}} answered from Knock-na-rea. I hurried on doubting, and yet hardly doubting in <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> that I <b>saw</b> again the fires that I had seen by the river at Ballisodare. I began occasionally telling people that one should believe whatever had been believed in all countries and periods, and only reject any part of it after much evidence, instead of starting all over afresh and only believing what one could prove. But I was always ready to deny or turn into a joke what was for all that my secret fanaticism. When I had read Darwin and Huxley and believed as they did, I had wanted, because an established authority was upon my side, to argue with everybody.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, Teuta darling? Is {{there any}} trouble? And {{why did you}} bolt the door? Has {{anything}} happened to Rupert?" [...] When she looked up I <b>saw</b> that <b>her</b> beautiful black eyes, with the stars in them, were overflowing with tears not yet shed. But she smiled through them, and the tears did not fall. When I <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> smile <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> was eased, and I said without thinking: [...] "Thank God, darling, Rupert is all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sung [...] As if {{her song}} could have no ending; [...] I <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> singing at her work, [...] And o'er the sickle bending; [...] I listen'd till I had my fill; [...] And, as I mounted up the hill, [...] 30 [...] The music in <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> I bore, [...] Long {{after it was}} heard no more.|$|R
6000|$|Silent, {{only for}} a moment. As the sails rose to the wind, and the ship began to move, there broke from all the boats three resounding cheers, which those on board took up, and echoed back, and which were echoed and re-echoed. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> burst out when I heard the sound, and beheld the waving of the hats and handkerchiefs--and then I <b>saw</b> <b>her!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|And yonder with joy-smitten heart have I [...] 50 [...] Heard my own Cresid's laugh; {{and once}} at play [...] I yonder <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> eke full blissfully; [...] And yonder once she unto me 'gan say-- [...] Now, my sweet Troilus, love me well, I pray! [...] And there so graciously did me behold, [...] 55 [...] That hers unto the death <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> I hold.|$|R
