Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00pm and 11:00pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in ants, the hind-wings and fore-wings are {{of equal}} length. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> alates are poor flyers; their {{technique}} is to launch {{themselves in the}} air and fly in a random direction. Studies show that in comparison to larger termites, smaller termites cannot fly long distances. When a termite is in flight, its wings remain at a right angle, and when the termite is at rest, its wings remain parallel to the body.|$|E

For example, a rutting male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male. Female deer often open their glands while caring for their young.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{was careful}} with his fitness, {{following}} an ankle injury in 1964 {{kept him from}} the first seven games of the season. Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois inners and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut away all the padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was that he liked to feel the ball in his palm and if taking the ball correctly <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> bruising wasn't too troublesome. This can be contrasted with Knott who preferred plenty of padding on his palms.|$|E
25|$|The Grant's gazelle is a gregarious, territorial, and migratory species. The home {{ranges of}} does overlap {{with those of}} the bucks. Only male gazelles are territorial. Male gazelles will herd all females that cross their territories. When the females are in estrus, they are {{strongly}} guarded by the dominant male, which prevents other males from mating with them. Any doe that tries to leave is aggressively herded back. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> buck’s simple stance in relation to her is enough to keep the female from leaving.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two modes}} of play: free mode and career mode. The free mode lets the player import and fly through cities {{of their own}} {{or any of the}} 30 cities {{supplied}} with the game. However, user cities sometimes need to be designed with SimCopter in mind, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> player must increase the number of police stations, fire stations, and hospitals to allow for speedier dispatches. The second mode—the heart of the game—is the career mode. This puts the player in the shoes of a pilot doing various jobs around the city.|$|E
25|$|For <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> railway's steam {{locomotives}} have burnt coal. The {{requirement for}} the locomotives to have a hot fire burning efficiently for a solid hour has led to problems when best Welsh steam coal has not been readily available. During 1978 Nos.2 and 8 ran with oil burners. To hold the fuel oil, a tank was fitted {{to the roof of}} each locomotive. The tanks were thin and followed the profile of the roof. In 2000, No.2 was again fitted with an oil burner in an attempt avoid the increasing problems of obtaining suitable coal.|$|E

According to Leila Shahid for La Marseilleise, Syria is a great cultural nation, a pluricultural leader of artistic creation. Journalist Alain Laurens commented that the Syrian cultural caravan’s involvement makes the public forget during the performance about all the bombings in Aleppo and Damascus and {{make room for a}} humane and fraternal communion. It is a way of showing that the Syrian cultural scene and its artists is alive and thriving. Finally, the road trip allows the Cultural Caravan to make art and culture come to the people, therefore going upstream of artistic and cultural centralisation. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> exhibition is set up outside, making it accessible to a greater number.|$|E
