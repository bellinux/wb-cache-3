The ECOMATION project aims at solving this problem by developing methods to measure and illustrate energy consumption and save energy in manufacturing processes. A holistic approach enables operators to continuously monitor a factory's energy consumption, based on two control loops: one at the shop floor level (including main processes and peripheral systems) and the other at the factory level, the two loops being interlinked in an additional step. The approach allows for the bidirectional exchange of data between the resources of both <b>main</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> peripheral processes and the higher management level. Classical approaches usually consider only the main process at machine level, even though {{a significant percentage of}} energy is required by the peripheral systems.

40|$|Abstract—Verification of {{distributed}} software systems by model checking {{is not a}} straightforward task due to interprocess communication. Many software model checkers only explore the state space of a single multi-threaded process. Recent work has proposed a technique that applies a cache to capture communication between the <b>main</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> its peers, and allows the model checker to complete state-space exploration. Although previous work handles non-deterministic output in the main process, any peer program is required to produce deterministic output. This paper introduces a process checkpointing tool. The combination of caching and process checkpointing {{makes it possible to}} handle nondeterminism on both sides of communication. Peer states are saved as checkpoints and restored when the model checker backtracks and produces a request not available in the cache. We also introduce the concept of strategies to control the creation of checkpoints and the overhead caused by the checkpointing tool.

Although {{there are a number}} of factors that guide the development of models in Web Services, the goal of this thesis is to provide the notation to model both the internal business processes defined as executable business processes and the external business interactions defined in the business protocols. Moreover, this form of modeling is made to be easily understandable by both business participants and software developer participants so that it can be smoothly transferred to Business Process Executable Language (BPEL) to implement in a Web Service environment. By studying the current methods such as Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) for Web service modeling, I have developed a method to model the Web Services with ContextMaps which bridge the gap between technical users and business users, between the abstract external design and the detail internal design and also exhibits the relationship between Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and BPEL. Furthermore, the 4 P (pattern-able, plug-able, process-able and perform-able) abilities of ContextMap notation can show the optimal solutions for Web Service. Finally, a model is given to ensure the consistency of system modeling between the <b>main</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> its sub processes, and also between different system domains...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, work of {{engineers}} {{has moved into}} integrated product modeling systems at the leading industries. In order to establish high level and comprehensive support of product related engineering activities, engineering software has been concentrated in product lifecycle management (PLM) systems. Product development applies object modeling techniques where objects, their parameters, and relationships with other objects are defined for very complex products. Product model increasingly serves as a medium in communication between engineers. This great achievement requires information about the background of decisions on the objects those are received by engineers who must coordinate new decisions with earlier ones. The authors of this paper proposed a new modeling method for {{the definition of the}} above background at the definition of product objects. Moreover, definition of product objects is done by human intent based control using the background definition. The new modeling is an extension to the current product modeling in industrial PLM systems. In this paper, the <b>main</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> the related model entities are introduced, explained ad discussed. The proposed modeling called as information content based modeling relies upon model entities for human intent, engineering objective, contextual connections, and decisions.

(A lingual prominence is a characteristic in herbivorous animals.) The external form and connective tissue core (CTC) of the filiform papillae of koalas consist of one large <b>main</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> several smaller accessory processes. (These are similar to carnivorous animals.) Fungiform CTC have a thick dome-like structure, with several taste buds on the top. There are three vallate papillae: one central midline and two laterally located vallate papillae. The central vallate papilla has a posterior pouch lined with ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells. Long conical papillae are distributed in the posterior lateral area where foliate papillae are distributed in many other animal species. (Finger-like papillae are seen in dog and cat instead of foliate papillae.) It may be suggested that the tongue of the koala evolved in a special environment in Australia. Even though it has still retained special features similar to those of carnivorous cats and dogs it has evolved to resemble the tongues of herbivorous animals.

Pretreatment has been viewed {{as one of the}} most expensive and energy intensive processing steps in the lignocellulosic biomass-to-fermentable sugars conversion process. The objective of this work is to develop multiscale models of hydrothermal pretreatment methods, starting from the microscale level where chemical reaction takes place followed by the mesoscale level in which the diffusion in lignocellulosic material is the <b>main</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> finally the macroscale level where the mixing and bulk diffusion are important. At microscale level, a new mechanism for hydrolysis of hemicellulose has been proposed in which the bond breakage is function of position in the hemicellulose chain and all the bonds with same position undergo the breakage at the same time. The result of model prediction showed a high correlation with the experimental data, moreover it was found that the probability of xylooligomer breakage from the middle of the chain is higher than the probability of the breakage from the sides. At the mesoscale level a model for diffusion of water into wood and diffusion of soluble sugars out of the wood in aqueous media has been developed. Finally, a general model for considering water diffusion into the biomass, hydrolysis reaction and diffusion of soluble sugars out of the wood simultaneously has been proposed. © 2009 The Institution of Chemical Engineers...|$|E

40|$|The {{deposition}} flux of O 3 to a Douglas fir {{forest in}} the Netherlands was monitored by eddy correlation during nine months. At {{the same time the}} concentration gradients of NO, NO 2 and O 3 were determined over the forest. The canopy resistance to O 3 uptake was calculated from the measurements ant it compared well with model estimates. The sensitivity of the stomatal resistance to humidity calculated in the model was adapted to improve the comparison. A multi-layered model of canopy exchange which included the influence of chemical reactions between NO and O 3 and soil emissions was used to interpret the results for NO 2. The observed fluxes of NO 2 away from the surface into the atmosphere were probably caused by soil emissions of NO. The soil-emitted NO was converted to NO 2 in the trunk space and vented into the atmosphere. The model showed that the NO 2 flux above the canopy was either away or towards the canopy depending on the strength of the soil emission and the amount of NO 2 taken up in the canopy. A 'canopy compensation' point for NO 2 could be established above which deposition was the <b>main</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> below which emission was observed.
