40|$|We {{report on}} the {{successful}} implementation of an adaptive pre-amplification pulse shaping technique in a high-power, coherently combined fiber laser system to achieve sub- 300 -fs pulse durations at 320 W average power and 3. 2 mJ pulse energy. The pulse shaper is utilized to impose a gain flattening mask to increase the spectral width of the amplified pulse by 60 %. Simultaneously, it pre-compensates the spectral phase acquired in the <b>multi-stage</b> <b>amplification</b> and subsequent compression including the eight-channel, coherently combined main amplification stage. This result does significantly enhance {{the performance of the}} fiber laser system and the subsequent nonlinear compression stages...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{localize}} (polarize) {{internal components}} to specific locations {{in response to}} external signals such as spatial gradients. For example, yeast cells form a mating projection toward the source of mating pheromone. There are specific challenges associated with cell polarization including amplification of shallow external gradients of ligand to produce steep internal gradients of protein components (e. g. localized distribution), response over {{a broad range of}} ligand concentrations, and tracking of moving signal sources. In this work, we investigated the tradeoffs among these performance objectives using a generic model that captures the basic spatial dynamics of polarization in yeast cells, which are small. We varied the positive feedback, cooperativity, and diffusion coefficients in the model to explore the nature of this tradeoff. Increasing the positive feedback gain resulted in better amplification, but also produced multiple steady-states and hysteresis that prevented the tracking of directional changes of the gradient. Feedforward/feedback coincidence detection in the positive feedback loop and <b>multi-stage</b> <b>amplification</b> both improved tracking with only a modest loss of amplification. Surprisingly, we found that introducing lateral surface diffusion increased the robustness of polarization and collapsed the multiple steady-states to a single steady-state at the cost of a reduction in polarization. Finally, in a more mechanistic model of yeast cell polarization, a surface diffusion coefficient between 0. 01 and 0. 001 µm 2 /s produced the best polarization performance, and this range is close to the measured value. The model also showed good gradient-sensitivity and dynamic range. This research is significant because it provides an in-depth analysis of the performance tradeoffs that confront biological systems that sense and respond to chemical spatial gradients, proposes strategies for balancing this tradeoff, highlights the critical role of lateral diffusion of proteins in the membrane on the robustness of polarization, and furnishes a framework for future spatial models of yeast cell polarization...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a V band single balanced mixer to be employed in the front end of an on-board receiver for space applications. The V band receiver is a demonstrator for the use of different monolithic processes and interconnection/assembly technologies in space applications at such high frequencies. The receiver front-end consists of a <b>multi-stage</b> LNA <b>amplification</b> followed by an image reject filter, the mixer and a frequency doubler for the local oscillator. All the chips are mounted over an LTTC substrate using bumps/hot vias technology. Chip to chip interconnection is provided by coplanar wave guide on LTTC. The mixer employs a rat race 180 ° hybrid to balance the local oscillator and a couple of Schottky diodes as mixing elements. The technology employed is a 0. 15 μm pHMET process that offers diodes with a cut off frequency higher that 300 GHz. The choices made for the mixer type and topology starting from the system specifications are covered in the paper along with the actual description of the circuit design...|$|R
