5|$|Generally, Crawley's inland and southerly {{position}} within the UK means temperatures in summer are amongst {{the highest in the}} British Isles, Charlwood recording 36.3C (97.3F) and Gatwick recording 36.4C (97.5F) on 19 July 2006, just 0.2C and 0.1C lower, respectively, than the UK <b>monthly</b> <b>record</b> for that day set at Wisley, 20 miles to the west. The overall maximum stands at 36.5C (97.7F) at Charlwood, set on 10 August 2003. The absolute record for Gatwick is the aforementioned 36.4C. Before this, the highest temperature recorded at Gatwick was 35.6C (96.1F), also in August 2003. The maximum temperature was 25.1C (77.2F) or higher on 15.9 days of the year on average (1971-00) and the warmest day will typically rise to 29.4c (84.9f).|$|E
5|$|While Ophelia {{was still}} {{impacting}} Newfoundland, forecasters in the United Kingdom warned residents that {{the remnants of}} the storm would bring unsettled weather to the nation within a few days. In the midst of a record-breaking heat wave, with temperatures reaching an all-time <b>monthly</b> <b>record</b> high of 86 °F (29.9 °C), the storm was expected to bring much cooler weather across the region. Strong winds and heavy rains were also anticipated, leading to the cancellation of ferry services. Plummeting temperatures in association with {{the remnants of the}} storm were expected to produce snowfall across the United Kingdom as well. In Donegal the first snows of the season fell, leaving hundreds of residents without electricity.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the Atlantic season featured Alex, the first hurricane observed in June since 1995's Hurricane Allison. One tropical storm, Bonnie, and a tropical depression formed {{in the month of}} July. August featured five cyclones – a tropical depression, tropical storms Colin and Fiona, as well as hurricanes Danielle and Earl (both of which further intensified into major hurricanes). In accordance with climatological norms, September was the most active month of the season, featuring eight tropical cyclones: tropical storms Gaston, Hermine, Matthew, and Nicole, as well as hurricanes Igor, Julia, Karl, and Lisa. This tied 2002 for the most tropical storms observed throughout the month. Igor attained peak winds of 155mph (250km/h) on September15, cementing its status as the most intense storm of the season. Well above-average activity continued into October, with the formation of hurricanes Otto, Paula, Richard, Shary, and Tomas, one hurricane short of the <b>monthly</b> <b>record</b> set in 1870. Tomas persisted into the subsequent month before dissipating on November7, heralding the end of the season's tropical cyclone activity.|$|E

25|$|With 81tornadoes {{touching}} down, {{the outbreak}} {{ranks as the}} second-largest January outbreak since records began in 1950, {{second only to the}} January 21–23, 1999, tornado outbreak (during which 129 tornadoes touched down). It also ranks as the third-largest winter outbreak, just behind the 2008 Super Tuesday outbreak which produced 86tornadoes. More than half of the tornadoes occurred in Georgia. With 42 confirmed in the state, the outbreak ranks as the largest on record for Georgia, surpassing the previous highest of 25 during Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Of the 42tornadoes, 27 touched down within the county warning area of the Atlanta National Weather Service Office, the most for a two-day period. This surpassed the previous highest of 16 during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Additionally, it shattered the record for January tornadoes in the state, bringing the monthly total to 52; the previous <b>monthly</b> <b>record</b> was just 15 in 1972.

40|$|In this study, genetic {{parameters}} for <b>monthly</b> <b>records</b> of egg production, collected from weeks 24 to 55 on 16, 830 hens during nine generations from a pedigreed commercial broiler female line, were estimated with single-trait, multiple-trait and repeated records animal models, using restricted maximum likelihood procedures. With and without age at sexual maturity as a covariate, two models were fitted {{to the data}} for each analysis. From the weekly productions, eight <b>monthly</b> <b>records</b> on a 28 -day basis were created. The estimate of heritability from single-trait analysis for the first month’s record was relatively high (0. 428), decreased to 0. 150 and 0. 092 {{in the second and}} third months, respectively, and then, with minor fluctuations, remained constant. Age at sexual maturity had a substantial influence only on heritability of the first month (0. 192) and, to some extent, of the second month (0. 103). Estimates of heritability and repeatability decreased from 0. 067 and 0. 379 to 0. 029 and 0. 251, respectively, owing to age at sexual maturity. Genetic correlations were generally positive, being relatively high to very high between adjacent <b>monthly</b> <b>records,</b> ranging from 0. 725 (between the first and second month) to 0. 986 (between the fourth and fifth month). These estimates between <b>monthly</b> <b>records</b> decreased as the time interval of the ages increased. The effect of age at sexual maturity on reduction of heritability of the first month’s record and of its genetic correlations with all other <b>monthly</b> <b>records</b> suggests that it is essentially necessary to be included in the model or that the analysis is carried out without the first month’s record...|$|R
