25|$|Dimethyl ether (DME), {{also known}} as <b>methoxymethane,</b> is the organic {{compound}} with the formula CH3OCH3, simplified to C2H6O. The simplest ether, it is a colorless gas that is a useful precursor to other organic compounds and an aerosol propellant that is currently being demonstrated {{for use in a}} variety of fuel applications. It is an isomer of ethanol.|$|E
2500|$|In 1866, August Wilhelm von Hofmann {{suggested}} systematizing nomenclature {{by using}} the whole sequence of vowels a, e, i, o and u to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the hydrocarbons [...] CnH2n+2, CnH2n, CnH2n−2, CnH2n−4, CnH2n−6. Now, the first three name hydrocarbons with single, double and triple bonds; [...] "-one" [...] represents a ketone; [...] "-ol" [...] represents an alcohol or OH group; [...] "-oxy-" [...] means an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that <b>methoxymethane</b> is the IUPAC name for dimethyl ether.|$|E

5000|$|Ethers (R-O-R) {{consist of}} an oxygen atom {{between the two}} {{attached}} carbon chains. The shorter of the two chains becomes {{the first part of}} the name with the -ane suffix changed to -oxy, and the longer alkane chain becomes the suffix of the name of the ether. Thus, CH3OCH3 is <b>methoxymethane,</b> and CH3OCH2CH3 is methoxyethane (not ethoxymethane). If the oxygen is not attached to the end of the main alkane chain, then the whole shorter alkyl-plus-ether group is treated as a side-chain and prefixed with its bonding position on the main chain. Thus CH3OCH(CH3)2 is 2-methoxypropane.|$|E
40|$|Reaction of Ag(p-MeC 6 H 4 SO 3) with 2, 6 -bis(bis(2 -pyridyl) <b>methoxymethane)</b> {{pyridine}} (PY 5) in CH 2 Cl 2 gave [Ag I 2 (PY 5) 2](p-MeC 6 H 4 SO 3) 2 (1). Treatment of 2, 6 -bis(bis(2 -pyridyl) hydroxymethane) pyridine (PY 5 -OH) with AgNO 3 in MeOH gave [Ag I 2 (PY 5 -OH) 2](NO 3) 2 (2); in {{the presence}} of PPh 3, this reaction afforded [Ag I(PY 5 -OH) (PPh 3) ]NO 3 (3). The structures of 1 - 3 have been determined by X-ray crystal analysis, revealing four-coordinate Ag I ions in these complexes. Both 1 and 2 feature a quadruply branched 28 -membered C 16 N 10 M 2 metallamacrocycle fused to 10 pyridyl groups. On the basis of 1 H NMR measurements, the dinuclear 1 and 2 dissociate into a mononuclear complex upon dissolving in MeCN but in MeOH an equilibrium between the mono- and dinuclear species can be detected. © 2008 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
