2500|$|In {{the course}} of this journey, he met Mark Twain in Elmira, New York, and was deeply impressed. Kipling arrived unannounced at Twain's home, and later wrote that as he rang the doorbell, [...] "It {{occurred}} to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> that Mark Twain might possibly have other engagements other than the entertainment of escaped lunatics from India, be they ever so full of admiration." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Time, Richard Corliss called The Passion of the Christ [...] "a serious, handsome, excruciating film that radiates total commitment." [...] New York Press film critic Armond White praised Gibson's direction, comparing him to Carl Theodor Dreyer in how he transformed art into spirituality. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "the most violent film [...] ha ever seen" [...] as well as reflecting on how the film personally impacted him as a former altar boy saying [...] "What Gibson has provided for <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in my life, is a visceral {{idea of what the}} Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message -- that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus -- is, I suppose, not the point. This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. Take it or leave it." [...] In a negative review, Slate magazine's David Edelstein called it [...] "a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie", while Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News felt it was [...] "the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II". Writing for the Dallas Observer, Robert Wilonsky said he found the movie [...] "too turgid to awe the nonbelievers, too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously, with its demonic hallucinations that look like escapees from a David Lynch film; I swear I couldn't find the devil carrying around a hairy-backed midget anywhere in the text I read." ...|$|E
60|$|The temptation took a form {{which now}} tried <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
60|$|I never enjoyed {{myself in}} my life as much as I did at that ball. Lady Desborough {{introduced}} {{a good many of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> comers to me, and Percy brought up more. He had engaged <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> waltz, and he presently asked <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> polka after supper; and my card was soon quite full <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole evening.|$|R
5000|$|... 1984: [...] "You Hurt Me" [...] ("You Hurt Me"), ("You Hurt <b>Me</b> <b>For</b> <b>The</b> <b>First</b> Time") and ("You Hurt <b>Me</b> <b>For</b> <b>The</b> Last Time") (Totenkopf Schallplatten, Düsseldorf) ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Bob {{never paid}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> draft. I lay he'll never pay <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second. 'Twill cost the King nothing if I re-draw it," [...] I says.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> with some spice of coquetry in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke to}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> He spoke slowly and formally, and his accent {{struck me as}} being a little foreign.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned toward}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> I saw a last {{vanishing}} trace of doubt {{in his eyes}} as they looked into mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You're quite right,' says she, 'that's {{just what}} happened. And then he kissed <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and last time, and now he's {{on his way}} to America.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{we shall}} get on. When Philip {{came to our}} town here, and saw <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time--Do you object to my {{speaking}} familiarly of him, by his Christian name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talking of guitars," [...] spoke <b>the</b> woman, {{addressing}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time; [...] "while we {{are waiting}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> maté, perhaps you will sing us a ballad. The guitar is lying just behind you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{end of the}} year!" [...] I cried, {{the predicament}} {{striking}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in its fulness. [...] "Say, you've got a crust!" ...|$|E
60|$|The reading completed, Mr. Bruff {{addressed}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> {{since we}} had been shut up together in the seclusion of his own room.|$|E
60|$|I started, in ungovernable agitation, to my feet. The lawyer's {{question}} reminded <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> since I {{had left}} England, that something HAD happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, {{turning to}} his guest, [...] "that {{this has been}} a very dull evening for you. To tell you the truth, this club is not exactly the haunt of pleasure-seekers. It {{generally}} oppresses <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> hour or so. Would you like a hand at bridge, or a game of billiards? I am wholly at your service--until twelve o'clock." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Nun hast du mir den ersten Schmerz getan" [...] ("Now You Have Caused <b>Me</b> Pain <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Time") ...|$|R
5000|$|Heastie is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> African American {{elected to}} the post. One of his first New York City {{appearances}} after assuming the powerful post was at Al Sharpton's rally in Harlem where he told the crowd [...] "This is a tremendous opportunity for our community, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, {{to have one of}} us sit at the table," [...] and added [...] "All of {{you are going to be}} sitting at that table with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time".|$|R
60|$|It struck <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> that {{possibly}} many other of my friend's arguments might be only blank cartridges, {{and used to}} frighten off other trespassing intellects.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you very little. It began with Mrs. Hudson being unjust to <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in her life. And now I am already better!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hesitated for}} a moment. It {{was clear that the}} man {{wanted to get rid of}} <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> the idea of {{remaining}} in the hotel occurred to me.|$|E
60|$|So I thought {{no more of}} succour or {{sympathy from}} any one of my friends. As a {{stranger}} I had been driven from my home, and as a stranger I was resigned to live, until I had learnt how to conquer my misfortune by my own vigour and endurance. Firm in this determination, though firm in nothing else, I now looked around <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> shelter I could purchase from strangers--the humbler the better.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drunk," [...] I said aloud, whereon the servant, who {{understood}} <b>me,</b> spoke <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, {{saying in a}} frightened voice in Dutch-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm keen on dancing," [...] said Mr. Pogis. [...] "I hope they'll {{give us a}} {{dance on}} board. Will you put <b>me</b> down <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> dance?" ...|$|R
60|$|We rose, {{left the}} hotel, and parted {{from each other}} in the street with a warm handshake, just as he began to {{interest}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in our intercourse.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{noticeable}} {{change in the}} lawyer's manner. It had lost its usual confidence and spirit. He shook hands with <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in his life, in silence.|$|E
60|$|An idea now {{occurred}} to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> Many men would long ere now have asked their mothers to chaperon them. It flashed across me that I had a mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, count, but I should {{prefer to}} leave as soon as possible. I {{do not think that}} there is really any fear of my being recognized. If they search at all along the Vienna road, it is not likely that they will do so as far as this; and {{certainly}} they could obtain no news of <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> forty miles, and would not be likely to push their inquiries as far, for a dismounted field officer could not but have attracted attention, at <b>the</b> <b>first</b> village through which he passed." ...|$|R
60|$|The more I knew of {{the inmates}} of Moor House, the better I liked them. In a few days I had so far {{recovered}} my health that I could sit up all day, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary in all their occupations; converse with {{them as much as}} they wished, and aid them when and where they would allow me. There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time--the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.|$|R
60|$|And {{wherefore}} did {{you enter}} so keenly {{into such a}} mad frolic? says my wise counsellor.--Why, I think, upon the whole, that as a sense of loneliness, and a longing for that kindness which is interchanged in society, led me to take up my temporary residence at Mount Sharon, the monotony of my life there, the quiet simplicity of the conversation of the Geddeses, and the uniformity of their amusements and employments, wearied out my impatient temper, and prepared <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> escapade which chance might throw in my way.|$|R
60|$|Now Montezuma {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> then opened a picture scroll {{that one of}} the {{counsellors}} handed to him, and read in it, glancing at me from time to time.|$|E
6000|$|She gave me {{a startled}} glance quite unusual with her, more than {{wonderful}} to me; and suddenly {{as though she had}} seen <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> she exclaimed in a tone of compunction: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did at first, sir, but not afterwards. Not {{his full}} mind. Perhaps he has {{something}} else upon it--some young lady, perhaps." [...] His bright dark eyes glanced at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought, sir," [...] Cuthbert said, [...] "that if {{you could}} lend me a party of say four men-at-arms to ride with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> day I could then trust to myself, {{especially}} {{if you could}} procure me one honest man to act as guide and companion. Doubtless they suppose that I should travel by the main road south; but by going <b>the</b> <b>first</b> day's journey either east or west, and then striking some southward road, I should get a fair start of them, throw all their plans out, and perchance reach Marseilles without interruption." ...|$|R
5000|$|Neil Friedman, who {{was then}} {{president}} of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, [...] "When you played with <b>Me</b> Elmo <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ormond saw her, {{and he had}} {{probably}} forgotten <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> {{there was a great}} longing in his voice as he said huskily: [...] "Will you kiss <b>me,</b> Grace, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and last time since we were innocent children?" ...|$|R
