40|$|Abstract—Microwaves are {{non-ionizing}} electromagnetic radiation. With {{the growth}} of technology and increase in demand of cellular services day by day; the presence of <b>microwaves</b> in environment is also increasing. Mostly these services are operated at 945 MHz. The wavelength of <b>microwaves</b> spans from one meter to one millimeter, covering the spectrum from 300 MHz to 300 GHz. These frequencies may {{affect the quality of}} the <b>microwaves</b> treated plant seeds and may reduce their fertility. This paper presents the results of some investigations carried out using <b>microwaves</b> treated Brassica seeds on IR (Infra-Red) irradiation. The spectrum of both <b>microwaves</b> treated and untreated seeds was studied under visible and IR radiation. It was observed that increasing the duration or power of the <b>microwaves</b> significantly affected the irradiated spectrum. Increasing the <b>microwaves</b> exposure decreases the IR absorption coefficient of the seeds. Further, <b>microwaves</b> reduce the fluid content of the seeds, which may affect the fertility of the seeds. The results may be useful for the development of an automatic quality assessment system for seeds. Index Terms—Microwaves, IR, Brassica Juncea...|$|R
30|$|<b>Microwaves</b> {{are high}} {{frequency}} waves ranging between 300 and 300, 000  MHz and are called <b>Microwaves</b> {{because of their}} shorter wavelength. <b>Microwaves</b> {{can also be used}} for heating the reservoir for EOR (Sahni et al. 2000). Normally <b>microwaves</b> are either transmitted by a material, absorbed or reflected. In majority of the cases <b>microwaves</b> interact with the water molecules as they are polar in nature. Hence, when <b>microwaves</b> are applied these polar water molecules are set into circulatory motion and they collide speedily with other molecules with the frequency collisions equal to the frequency of applied micro waves which in result produces much heat (Okassa et al. 2010). This rise in temperature reduces the viscosity of oil and hence causes it to flow towards the production well from where it can be extracted.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Microwaves</b> produce various {{detrimental}} changes {{based on}} actions of heat or non-specific stress, although {{the effects of}} <b>microwaves</b> on pregnant organisms has not been uniform. This {{study was designed to}} clarify the effect of exposure to <b>microwaves</b> during pregnancy on endocrine and immune functions. METHODS: Natural killer cell activity and natural killer cell subsets in the spleen were measured, as well as some endocrine indicators in blood [...] corticosterone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) as indices of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [...] beta-endorphin, oestradiol, and progesterone in six female virgin rats and six pregnant rats (nine to 11 days gestation) exposed to <b>microwaves</b> at 10 mW/cm 2 incident power density at 2450 MHz for 90 minutes. The same measurements were performed in control rats (six virgin and six pregnant rats). RESULTS: Skin temperature in virgin and pregnant rats increased immediately after exposure to <b>microwaves.</b> Although splenic activity of natural killer cells and any of the subset populations identified by the monoclonal antibodies CD 16 and CD 57 did not differ in virgin rats with or without exposure to <b>microwaves,</b> pregnant rats exposed to <b>microwaves</b> showed a significant reduction of splenic activity of natural killer cells and CD 16 +CD 57 -. Although corticosterone and ACTH increased, and oestradiol decreased in exposed virgin and pregnant rats, <b>microwaves</b> produced significant increases in beta-endorphin and progesterone only in pregnant rats. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Microwaves</b> at the power of 10 mW/cm 2 produced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increased oestradiol in both virgin and pregnant rats, suggesting that <b>microwaves</b> greatly stress pregnant organisms. These findings in pregnant rats suggest that [...] with exposure to <b>microwaves</b> [...] pregnancy induces immunosuppression, which could result in successful maintainance of pregnancy. This enhancement of adaptability to heat stress with pregnancy may be mediated by activation of placental progesterone and placental or pituitary beta-endorphin...|$|R

30|$|<b>Microwaves</b> EOR is {{the optimum}} case of EEOR {{in many cases}} and helps to extract the best {{possible}} quantity of oil within less time as compared to other EEOR methods. It {{is because of the}} dielectric heating effect of <b>Microwaves,</b> when <b>microwaves</b> are applied to a material medium, it directly interacts with the polar molecules. Since the frequency of applied <b>microwaves</b> is very high, they produce electric and magnetic fields alternating at <b>microwaves</b> frequency. When these alternating electric and magnetic fields interact with the polar molecules, these polar molecules are set into vibrations at the frequency of applied <b>microwaves.</b> Because of this change in polarity, vibrations and collisions with the other molecules at such a high frequency, a great deal of energy is produces which helps in raising the temperature of the environment (Okassa et al. 2010). When <b>microwaves</b> are applied to the hydrocarbons reservoir, this increase in temperature helps in reducing the viscosity of oil and enabling the oil to flow towards the production well from where it can be extracted.|$|R

40|$|In 1982, Prof. Sik'Ko and {{co-workers}} found {{that human beings}} have energetic channels where a circulation of coherent millmeter <b>microwaves</b> takes place. Each individual has frequencies specific to the individual (Eigenfrequencies) situated between 40 and 70 GHz. Administration of coherent <b>microwaves</b> of frequencies on biologically active points of the channels (at the acupuncture points of the meridians) restores normal function and health by creating maximal vasodilation, restoration of immunologic parameters and balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. A large amount of diseases can be treated, even preventively. As the intensities of these <b>microwaves</b> become very low and approach the quantum level, side effects are rare and contra- indications are very few. Coherent <b>microwaves</b> reflect at extremities, creating microsystems of holographic projections. Contrary to this, exposure to high intensity <b>microwaves</b> is potentially very harmful.

However, cooking may affect antioxidant content due to antioxidant release, destruction or creation of redox-active metabolites.

Cooking water was also tested. For all cooked vegetables, antioxidant content was highest in steamed > boiled > <b>microwaved,</b> and decreased with longer cooking time, regardless of method.

The animals in groups B, C and D were all fed ad libitum with porridge yam, porridge beans and jellof rice with meat/fish reheated for 2  min, 4  min and 6  min for groups B, C and D respectively for 42 days.
