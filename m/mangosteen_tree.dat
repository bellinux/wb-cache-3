One branch from each sector was labeled with 13 CO 2 in December 2003. Immediately after labeling, 13 C concentration in leaves from middle sectors was higher than that in leaves from other positions. 13 C concentration in all leaves decreased rapidly for 24 h after 13 C feeding, followed by a gradual decrease. In contrast, 13 C concentration increased over time in the pericarp and aril of fruits. Translocation of 13 C-photosynthates into fruit was high in Sectors 4 and 5, and in top positions (Sectors 7 to 9). At 96 h after 13 C feeding, the highest distribution ratio of 13 C-photosynthates was observed in stems, followed in descending order by pericarp, leaf, and aril. 13 C distribution ratio in the aril was generally highest in fruits from inner and center positions.

In addition, the natural soils in mangosteen orchards was strong acid to very strong acid (pH 4. 62 - 4. 93, soil:water = 1 : 5). <b>Mangosteen</b> <b>trees</b> might take high amounts of nutrients from the surface soils (0 - 15 cm) as follows: N, K, Mg and S for growth in the preflowering period; N, K, S and B in the flowering period; K, Ca and Mg in the 1 st half of fruit development period (bloom to 7 th week of fruit development) and P in the 2 nd half of fruit development period (7 th week of fruit development to harvest) compared to other growth periods.

Each treatment was replicated six times. The experiment of sanitation (SNT) and yellow fluorescent sticky trap (YST) application was designed in a completely randomized design with six replications, except for the control which was replicated only three times.

The experiment was conducted using <b>mangosteen</b> <b>trees</b> grown in commercial orchard in Bogor, Indonesia during May to October 2010. <b>Mangosteen</b> <b>trees</b> of 3 different ages, young (20 -year-old), middle (35 -year-old), and old (50 -year-old), each of five trees, were selected for study, and the canopy of each tree was divided into 9 sectors based on height (bottom, middle, top) and width (inner, center, outer). The light intensity on sunny days was higher in Sector 9, it was 8. 1, 7. 5, and 7. 7 μmol・M(− 2) ・s(− 1) in young, middle-aged and old trees, respectively, whereas in Sector 1 it was low, resulting 0. 5, 0. 4, and 0. 5 μmol・M(− 2) ・s(− 1) in young, middle-aged and old trees, respectively. Regardless of tree age, light intensity in outer position in canopy was higher than in the inner, and also it was higher in taller than in lower positions in canopy. In 2010, the phenological aspects of mangosteen orchard markedly changed because of irregular rainfall. In spite of tree age, SPAD value of leaves in upper parts such as Sectors 5 - 9 was high comparing with lower ones such as Sectors 1 - 4. In young trees, carbohydrate content of leaves was higher in top positions such as Sectors 7 - 9 than in bottom ones such as Sectors 1 - 3, whereas in middle-aged and old trees, no significant difference of carbohydrate content was observed among sectors. Regardless of month and tree age measured, nitrogen content of leaves was higher in lower positions in canopy such as Sectors 1 - 4 than in upper ones such as Sectors 5 - 9. Consequently, the C-N ratio of leaves was higher in the upper part of canopy compared to the lower.

Thesis, University of Leicester). Its most famous member is the fruit <b>tree,</b> <b>mangosteen</b> (G. mangostana). Taxonomic revision of section Garcinia reduces {{the number of species}} from 43 to 16 with five varieties, with distribution from eastern India to Malesia. A total of nine species are excluded, 19 species are reduced to synonyms and five species are insufficiently known to be classified. Within sect. Garcinia, G. acuticosta, G. discoidea, G. exiguous, G. ochraceus and G. sangudsangud are newly described, G. diospyrifolia var. arborea, G. diospyrifolia var. minor and G. malaccensis var. pseudomangostana are new varieties, and G. cataractalis, previously unassigned to any section by Jones (1980) is newly included. Species limits are defined on the basis of combinations of characters such as shape of stamens and presence of pistillode, fruit type, and leaf characters such as shape, size, venation pattern and type of glandular lines. A total of 83 accessions representing 42 Garcinia species were sequenced for the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, while 50 accessions (30 spp.) and 24 accessions (16 spp.) were sequenced for the chloroplast non-coding regions trnS-G and trnD-T respectively. Of these, 30 accessions or ten spp. (ITS), 23 accessions or nine spp. (trnS-G) and 17 accessions or nine spp. (trnD-T) belong to sect. Garcinia. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses show that the ITS data are more phylogenetically informative and provide better resolution for sectional and species relationships compared to trnS-G and trnD-T. Most of the sections delimited by Jones (1980) proved to be monophyletic but sect. Garcinia is not. Garcinia maingayi, G. trianii and G. costata, assigned to sect. Garcinia by Jones, are in a separate clade that is strongly supported as sister to sect. Brindonia. These species have significantly different morphological characters from sect. Garcinia, and should be excluded from it. Characters that are important for sectional delimitation are inflorescences that are simple cymes, stamen bundles that are 4 -angled or 4 -lobed, and fruits with a smooth surface. Four major clades in sect. Garcinia are supported by the shape of the stamen bundles, the shape of the fruit and the stigma, and fruit wall characters. ITS trees are significantly incongruent with plastid trees because of the placement of G. rigida, which could reflect a hybrid origin. Another hybrid species, the cultivated mangosteen, could be the product of hybridisation events between varieties of G. malaccensis if mangosteen is proven to be an obligate agamosperm. However, if mangosteen is a facultative agamosperm, G. malaccensis {{is likely to be the}} female parent, but any other Garcinia species could be the putative paternal species. Phylogenetic trees of ITS show that most Garcinia species from east of Wallace’s Line are nested within species from the west. This might reflect dispersal of species across this biogeographic division from west to east when the Sahul and Sunda shelves converged (c. 20 MY). This hypothesis is supported by the estimated divergence of accessions of G. rigida from the east of Wallace’s Line, from their most recent common ancestor to the west of the line, not later than 21. 58 +/- 2. 90 MY...|$|R
