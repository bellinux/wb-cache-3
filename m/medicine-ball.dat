40|$|Subjects were 15 female {{university}} {{track and}} field athletes. In an attempt to improve athletic performance， subjects were instructed to throw a medicine ball and put a shot with and without vocalization. In addition，grip strength was measured in order to clarify the effects of vocalization on throwing. The results showed that significant differences between with and without vocalization were observed for the standing shot put，front <b>medicine-ball</b> throw，and chest medicine ball throw. A significant difference between with and without vocalization was observed for the grip strength of the nondominant hand. Furthermore，among the subjects with shot put and medicine ball throwing distances shorter than the median value，there was a correlation between grip strength and distance: the greater the grip strength，the longer the throwing distance. These findings suggest that vocalizing during routine practices improves athletic performance...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to find}} out and to compare general and {{specific}} physical performance level of sport class pupils (athletics, football) and non-sport class pupils from elementary schools of Pilsen. For finding the general and specific physical performance level, we have used the following tests: free start 50 m run, standing broad jump, both hands <b>medicine-ball</b> throw, long jump, one-handed ball throw, 1500 m run. The highest level of general and specific physical performance has been found in pupil groups of sport class with focus on athletics. Physical performance level of sport class pupils (athletics, football) is higher than physical performance level of Czech population of 70 's and Slovak population of 80 's. Because of higher number of pupils in sport classes nowadays, the level of their physical performance is little bit lower than the level of sport class pupils of 70 's and 80 's.

40|$|BACKGROUNDː This study {{quantified}} {{the degree}} of game-induced muscular fatigue in amputee soccer players. METHODSː Thirty-three male amputee soccer players performed muscular tests (push up test [PUT], countermovement jump test [CMJ] and <b>medicine-ball</b> throw [MBT]) before and after a competitive match. Five players served as a control group. The rating of perceived exertion was recorded after each battery. RESULTSː Control group demonstrated no {{differences between the two}} testing batteries (p > 0. 05, effect size [ES]: 0. 1 - 0. 4). However, match group illustrated markedly lower performances for PUT (- 17 %, p < 0. 01, ES: 0. 9) with less pronounced declines in MBT (- 8 %, p < 0. 01, ES: 0. 7) and CMJ (- 5 %, p < 0. 01, ES: 0. 3) compared to pre-match values. The rating of perceived exertion were higher after the match compared to baseline values (+ 60 %, p < 0. 01, ES: 2. 4). CONCLUSIONː The data demonstrate that the fatigue experienced after amputee soccer matches causes impairments in muscular performance and this could be different to able-bodied players...|$|E
40|$|Os benefícios do desenvolvimento da aptidão física sobre a saúde estão bem evidenciados na {{literatura}} científica. O objetivo do presente estudo foi descrever a aptidão física relacionada ao desempenho motor de crianças e adolescentes e examinar as diferenças de acordo com sexo, idade, tipo de escola (pública ou privada) e região geográfica da escola (urbana ou rural). Uma bateria de cinco testes motores foi aplicada a 526 alunos entre sete e 15 anos do ensino fundamental de Rio Grande, RS: salto em distância parado, arremesso de "medicine-ball", barra modificada, corrida de 20 metros e quadrado. Os resultados apontam que o desempenho em todos os testes foi superior para os rapazes e aumentou diretamente com a faixa etária. Estes foram os principais preditores da aptidão física dentre as variáveis examinadas. O tipo de escola só teve influência sobre o desempenho no teste de arremesso de "medicine-ball", em que alunos da rede privada obtiveram valores médios maiores. Escolares da zona urbana atingiram um melhor desempenho em todos os testes, exceto no teste de barra modificada (sem diferença por região geográfica). A realização de pesquisas com o mesmo enfoque em outras regiões do Brasil permitirá explorar a consistência destes achados e compreender possíveis diferenças. There {{is strong}} evidence regarding {{the benefits of}} physical fitness development upon health. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the physical fitness related to motor performance in children and adolescents, and to examine if there are differences according to sex, age, type of school (public or private) and geographic region (urban or rural). A battery comprising of five motor tests were administered to 526 students aged seven to 15 years from elementary schools of Rio Grande, Brazil: stationary long jump, <b>medicine-ball</b> throw, modified pull-up, 20 -meter run and 4 -meter shuttle-run. The results indicate that the performance in all tests were higher among boys and increased directly with age group. These two factors (sex and age) were the main predictors of physical fitness amongst the investigated variables. Type of school influenced only the performance in the <b>medicine-ball</b> throw, being higher for students from private schools. Students from urban zone achieved a better performance in all tests, except in the modified pull-up, in which there was no difference between geographic regions. The development of researches with the same approach in other Brazilian regions will allow evaluating the consistency of these findings and understanding possible differences...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: a) to evaluate indicators of physical fitness {{in children and adolescents}} according to chronological age and gender; b) to classify their performance using the PROESP-BR normative tables. A total of 3145 randomly selected school children (1590 boys and 1555 girls), ranging in age from 7 to 16 years, were submitted to the following tests: distance covered in a 9 -minute run, standing long jump test, <b>medicine-ball</b> throw, and 60 -s situp test to measure abdominal muscle endurance. Significant differences were observed between genders at all chronological ages and also between boys of different chronological ages. In girls, no significant differences were observed between chronological ages, with performance tending to stabilize at 11 / 12 years of age. Classification of the participants according to the PROESP-BR normative tables showed that more than 50 % of all subjects were below the 40 th percentile in all tests, especially girls. The same tendency was observed when compared to other Brazilian studies. Considering mean values, it can be concluded that the school children studied, especially girls,presented a low level of physical fitness, thus indicating the need for health promotion programs in the midwest region of São Paulo City addressing physical activity...|$|E
40|$|Aim Very {{few studies}} have {{investigated}} the temporal specificity of melatonin (MEL) ingestion upon short-term maximal athletic performances. The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore the effect of morning MEL ingestion on cognitive and physical performances measured in the afternoon. Methods Twelve soccer players from a Tunisian squad (17. 9 ± 1. 3 years, 1. 74 ± 0. 06 m and 62. 0 ± 8. 8 kg) participated in the present study. They performed two testing sessions at 08 : 00 h, 12 : 00 h and 16 : 00 h after either MEL (5 mg) or placebo (PLA) ingestion, in a randomized order. During each period, the participants performed the following cognitive and physical tests: reaction time and vigilance tests, <b>medicine-ball</b> throw (MBT), five jumps, handgrip strength (HG), and agility tests. Results cognitive and physical performances were significantly higher at 16 : 00 h compared to 08 : 00 h during the two conditions (p < 0. 05). Moreover, performances of MBT and HG were lower in the morning with MEL in comparison to PLA (p < 0. 05). However, MEL ingestion did not affect physical and cognitive performances measured at 12 : 00 h and 16 : 00 h. Conclusion morning MEL ingestion has no unfavourable effect on afternoon physical and cognitive performances in soccer players...|$|E
40|$|This {{intervention}} {{aimed to}} improve Badminton-specific functional performance {{of an elite}} under- 19 player (18 years) via a single-weekly resistance and plyometric training (RPT) session for 8 -weeks. The athlete’s ‘response-to’ and ‘withdrawal-from’ the RPT were assessed. The athlete (stature: 1. 77 m, mass: 81. 5 kg) completed the RPT intervention throughout a competitive season. Performance testing was conducted at; baseline, post-intervention (8 -weeks) and after withdrawal-from the RPT (16 -weeks). Jump height and throwing distance were assessed via countermovement jump (CMJ), standing long-jump (SLJ) and one-arm (1 -MBT) and two-arm (2 -MBT) <b>medicine-ball</b> throws respectively. Speed and agility were assessed by 5 m and 10 m sprints and ‘sideways’ and ‘four-corner’ tests respectively. A positive change from baseline to post-intervention (8 -weeks) was observed in: CMJ (+ 0. 07 m), SLJ (+ 0. 13 m), 1 -MBT (+ 2. 25 m) and 2 -MBT (+ 0. 26 m). Observed changes in speed and agility were minimal. At the 16 -weeks, small declines in CMJ, SLJ, 1 -MBT and 2 -MBT (0. 04 m, 0. 04 m, 0. 52 m and 0. 05 respectively) existed. Small improvements in 5 and 10 m sprint times (- 0. 12 s to - 0. 09 s) and side-ways agility were observed (- 0. 11 s to - 0. 39 s), possibly explained by conditioning effects of training and competition. An 8 -week Badminton-specific RPT programme provided favourable increases in jumps and MB throws. However, such positive changes were not sustained following the withdrawal period...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Most of the {{literature}} related {{to the effects of}} Ramadan fasting on physical performance has focused on adults, and only three studies have examined its impact on children's physical performance. Aims: To examine the effects of Ramadan fasting on first-time fasting boys’ performance in short-term explosive exercises [vertical and horizontal jump tests (VJT and HJT), 20 -m and 30 -m sprints and <b>medicine-ball</b> throw (MBT) ], as well as in sub-maximal endurance [6 -min walking distance (6 MWD) measured during the 6 -min walk test (6 MWT) ]. Methods: Eighteen Tunisian boys [mean±standard deviation (SD) of age and body mass (BM) : 11. 9 ± 0. 8 y and 55. 4 ± 18. 2 kg, respectively] were included. The experimental design comprised four testing phases: 2 -weeks before Ramadan (BR), {{the end of the second}} week (R 2) and the fourth week (R 4) of Ramadan, and 10 – 12 days after the end of Ramadan (AR). At each phase, boys performed two test sessions in the afternoon (15 : 00 – 17 : 00 h) interrupted by 48 h of recovery (first test session: BM, VJT, HJT, and 20 -m and 30 -m sprint tests; second session: MBT and 6 MWT). The study was conducted during the summer of 2012 from July 5 to August 29. Results: 6 MWDs (m) were significantly shorter during R 2 (652 ± 101) and R 4 (595 ± 123) compared to BR (697 ± 86) and came back to baseline values AR. BM (kg) mean±SD did not significantly change during R 2 (52 ± 15) and during R 4 (53 ± 15) compared to BR (55 ± 17), and short-term explosive performances were unchanged throughout the study. Conclusion: In non-athletic children, first-ever Ramadan fasting impairs sub-maximal aerobic capacity but has no effect on BM or short-term explosive performance...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The use of {{resistance}} and plyometric training (RPT) {{to aid the}} development of sport-specific anaerobic capabilities is becoming widely acknowledged as a key training modality within badminton (Sturgess & Newton, 2008). However published, recommendations for optimal frequency and duration of RPT within a typical microcycle are sparse. The aim of this case study {{was to assess the}} response to and ‘withdrawal’ of incorporating one weekly 60 -minute RPT session, over an 8 -week period on badminton specific functional performance with an elite England under- 19 badminton player. Methods: This case study featured a male England under- 19 international badminton player (Age: 18 years, Height: 1. 77 m, Mass: 81. 5 kg), possessing two years experience of general resistance training, however with no history of any sport-specific RPT. The athlete completed the RPT intervention once-a-week during the competitive badminton season. The session featured a combination of multi-joint strength training exercises, medicine ball throws and plyometric jumps. The exercises were chosen in accordance with recommendations for elite badminton players (Sturgess & Newton, 2008) and modifications of exercises advocated to improve power (Foran, 2001; Ooi et al, 2009). Performance testing was conducted at three different time-points; baseline, post-intervention (8 -weeks) and after withdrawal from the RPT programme (16 -weeks), to monitor any changes in badminton specific functional performance. This followed an A-B-A withdrawal design as recommended for single-subject research (Kinugasa et al, 2004). Anaerobic power was assessed via a countermovement jump (CMJ), a standing long jump (SLJ), and both one- (1 -MBT) and two-arm (2 -MBT) <b>medicine-ball</b> (2 kg) throws. Acceleration was assessed by 5 - and 10 m run sprints. Agility was determined by badminton specific assessments the ‘sideways’ and ‘four-corner’ tests (Ooi et al. 2009). Results: Following the 8 -week RPT programme increases in anaerobic power were apparent as evidenced by increases in CMJ (6. 2 cm), SLJ (0. 13 m), 1 -MBT (2. 25 m) and 2 -MBT (0. 26 m). However, speed and agility performance was relatively unchanged. After the 8 -week withdrawal period (at 16 -weeks), there was a decline in anaerobic power with decreases in CMJ height (- 4 cm), SLJ (- 0. 04 m), 1 -MBT (- 0. 05 m) and 2 -MBT (- 0. 52 m). However, there were small improvements in 5 - and 10 m sprint times (- 0. 11 s and - 0. 12 s) and side-ways agility (- 0. 39 s). Conclusion: A low-frequency in-season badminton specific RPT programme provided favourable increases in anaerobic power development in badminton specific tests. However, improvements post RPT were not sustained following the withdrawal period. The improvements in speed and agility following the withdrawal period were likely due to specific conditioning effects of the competitive season...|$|E
40|$|Intensive strength-training (ST) {{can result}} in {{exercise}} induced muscle damage (EIMD), which commonly leads to reductions in acute muscle function. Post-exercise ingestion of carbohydrate and protein mixtures attempt to attenuate the effects of EIMD. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of whey-protein-hydrolysate and milk-based formulated drinks on recovery of muscle function following ST. Thirty resistance-trained males (age: 25. 2 ± 5. 5 years, mass: 79. 4 ± 8. 4 kg, stature: 1. 77 ± 0. 45 m) provided written informed consent to participate. The study {{was approved by the}} local ethics committee inline with Helsinki Declarations. Participants were randomly equally assigned to either; whey-hydrolysate and dextrose drink (WH), milk-based drink (MB), flavoured dextrose (PLACEBO) and performed baseline assessments of perceived muscle-soreness (SORENESS), static-squat jump (SSJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), seated <b>medicine-ball</b> throw (MBT) and isokinetic assessments of the knee-extensors and flexors. Subsequently, participants performed a ST session consisting of various multi-joint barbell exercises. Participants then consumed either WH, MB or PLACEBO 10 min following ST, subsequently repeating all assessments 24 h and 48 h post-ST. In relation to within-group changes, all groups experienced substantial increases in SORENESS at 24 h and 48 h (P < 0. 001). However, for dynamic power measures (SSJ, CMJ and MBT), PLACEBO experienced a decrease for only CMJ at 48 h (− 1. 8 cm), whereas WH and MB experienced significant decreases across SSJ (WH; − 3 cm at 24 h, MB; − 2. 6 cm at 24 h, − 2. 0 cm at 48 h), CMJ (WH; − 2. 4 cm at 24 h, MB; − 3. 7 cm at 24 h, − 3. 3 cm at 48 h) and MBT (WH; − 0. 25 m at 48 h, MB; − 0. 33 cm at 24 h, − 0. 38 m at 48 h) (P < 0. 05). All groups experienced significant decreases in isokinetic-extension torque at both 24 h and 48 h; however, flexion torque was decreased for PLACEBO only at these time points (24 h: − 10 N · m, 48 h: − 13 N · m) (P < 0. 05). Isokinetic-extension power and work were significantly decreased at 24 h and 48 h for both WH [Power (24 h: − 18 W, 48 h: − 13 W) Work (24 h: − 30 J, 48 h: − 22 J) ] and PLACEBO [Power (24 h: − 15 W, 48 h: − 14 W) Work (24 h: − 25 J, 48 h: − 28 J) ] (P < 0. 05); however, no decreases occurred for MB. Flexion power was significantly decreased for only PLACEBO at 24 h and 48 h (24 h: − 7 W, 48 h: − 6 W) (P < 0. 05). Decreases in flexion work occurred across all conditions at 48 h, but only for PLACEBO at 24 h (WH, 48 h: − 6 J) (MB, 48 h: − 15 J) (PLACEBO, 24 h: − 11 J, 48 h: 13 J) (P < 0. 05).
