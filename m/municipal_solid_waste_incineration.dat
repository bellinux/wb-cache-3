40|$|International audienceA {{number of}} life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) studies have been undertaken within the last 15 years comparing end-of-life treatment options for post-consumer plastic waste, including techniques such as: mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling, incineration with energy recovery and landfilling. These have attempted to support decisions {{in the formulation of}} waste management strategies and policies. In light of the introduction of life cycle thinking into European waste policies, specifically in relation to the waste hierarchy, a literature review of publically available LCA studies evaluating alternative end-of-life treatment options for plastic waste has been conducted. This has been done in order to: establish if a consensus exists as to the environmentally preferable treatment option for plastic waste; identify the methodological consid- erations and assumptions that have led to these conclusions; and determine the legitimacy of applying the waste hierarchy to the plastic wastestream. The majority of the LCA studies concluded that, when single polymer plastic waste fractions with little organic contamination are recycled and replace virgin plastic at a ratio of close to 1 : 1, recycling is generally the environmentally preferred treatment option when compared to <b>municipal</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> <b>incineration.</b> It has been found that assumptions relating to the virgin material substitution ratio and level of organic contamination can have a significant influence upon the results of these studies.

The minor phases identified were spinels and pyroxenes. An ANC leaching test was performed in order to observe the treatment effect on pollutant release. The natural pH was close to 10, and the major element release was less than in the case of untreated APC. This was a consequence of melilite formation.

Soluble phosphates and silicates were considered {{in some cases to}} fix heavy metals. The performance of T 1 –T 6 products was measured in terms of initial and final setting times, mechanical strength, total availability and leaching from S/S products. Two monolithic leaching tests were used to estimate emissions of pollutants over 48 h and 64 days. The results showed that the setting time was reduced when soluble phosphates were used. Moreover, although all the treatments have met the threshold of 1 MPa for unconfined compressive strength, this parameter was significantly reduced due to matrix dissolution during immersion. After three cycles of leaching, the limit of 10 % for solubilisation was exceeded for all treatments with the exception of T 5 (with phosphates).

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the energy potential of <b>municipal</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> (MSW) <b>incineration</b> in Chinese cities from 1996 to 2020. In China, with improving {{the standard of living}} recently, the extreme increase of the <b>municipal</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> generation (MSWG) and the energy consumption have become important problems. To diminish these problems, MSW incineration, one of the methods of disposing waste, was taken. The study mainly paid attention on the energy issue. At the beginning of the study, the data of GDP per capita and the electricity consumption in China were collected and calculated. However, the lack of data on the MSWG in China was the key problem in the study. The trend of the MSWG in China was assumed to be similar to the general tendency. Through using the data from World Bank and Hoornweg (2000), a figure of the general trend of MSWG was made. By combining the global trend and the GDP per capita, MSWG in China was obtained. Finally, the potential contribution of MSW incineration to energy consumption is calculated by comparing the electricity generation per capita from MSW with the electricity consumption per capita. As a conclusion, around 5 % contribution of the electricity generation of MSW incineration to the electricity consumption is not outstanding. However, as a by-product the contribution of MSW incineration to reduce MSW is about 70 %. In other words, about 70 % of landfilled waste can possibly be incinerated for energy. ...|$|R

The model considers simultaneously the hydrodynamic processes (rain water infiltration, advective and diffusive transport), pH-buffering and solubility-controlled processes by secondary minerals, ageing by atmospheric carbonation, and the leachate chemistry (major elements and trace metals such as Al, Cu, Pb). The evolution of pH is fairly well simulated with the following pH-buffering sequence: portlandite, calcium silicate hydrate (CSH), ettringite and, finally, calcite. The quantity of CO 2 dissolved in the percolating rain water is generally not sufficient to explain the pH evolution and carbonation processes, requiring atmospheric gaseous inputs. The relation between pH evolution and element release is discussed for both sites. Calculated Pb release is overestimated when based on solubility-controlled mechanisms only.
