Club {{called the}} third season The X-Files [...] "best season and <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{greatest}} TV seasons of all time", noting it was consistent and [...] " [...] from strength to strength" [...] between mythology and stand-alone episodes. However, {{he thought it}} [...] "starts out kind of terribly" [...] with [...] "The Blessing Way". Zack Handlen, VanDerWerff's colleague, wrote that the third season was [...] "one of the show's strongest, with the conspiracy arc still keeping tension high instead of just vamping for time. By this point, the sometimes awkward effects work of the early years is gone, and the overall direction is highly polished, giving even the season's weakest entries a cinematic feel". He also stated that Morgan's [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] and [...] "Jose Chung's From Outer Space" [...] were [...] "The X-Files two greatest hours". The writing credits provided by Morgan was widely cited as a highlight of the season. [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] written by him received positive reviews, and Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A, who praised the absurdity and entertainment value of the episode. Another episode, [...] "Quagmire" [...] containing some writing credits by Morgan received positive reviews, with the 10-minute dialogue sequence featuring Mulder and Scully receiving highly positive reviews.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} four seasons received similar praise. During the show's second season, Entertainment Weekly named The X-Files the [...] "Program of the Year" [...] for 1994, stating [...] "no other show on television gives off the vibe that The X-Files does". The DVD Journal gave {{the second season}} four out of four stars, calling it a [...] "memorable season". The review highlighted [...] "The Host", [...] "Duane Barry" [...] and [...] "Ascension", the cliffhanger finale [...] "Anasazi", the [...] "unforgettable" [...] "Humbug" [...] and meeting Mulder and Scully's families in [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "One Breath". IGN gave the season a rating of 9 out of 10, with the reviewer noting it was an improvement upon the first as it had [...] "started to explore a little" [...] and the [...] "evolution of the characters makes the product shine even though the plotlines have begun to seem familiar". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club argued that the third season of The X-Files was the show's [...] "best season and <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest TV seasons of all time", noting it was consistent and [...] " [...] from strength to strength" [...] between mythology and stand-alone episodes. Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly gave the fifth season an [...] "A – [...] ", writing that it [...] "proves the show was—even then—still at its creative peak (if only for another year or so) and full of surprises". He praised the new additions to the series' mythology and concluded that [...] "many stand-alone episodes now look like classics". Francis Dass, writing for the New Straits Times, noted that the season was [...] "very interesting" [...] and possessed [...] "some [...] truly inspiring and hilarious" [...] episodes.|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to retina and melanoma, OA1 protein product was also detected in human pigment cells like melanosomal membrane glycoprotein. This suggests that OA1 {{might be involved}} in melanosome biogenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation studies of OA1 with Gβ and Gαi in melanocyte extracts revealed its specific interaction with Gαi. [...] Further study have also shown that OA1 interact specifically with Gαi3 subtype. Moreover, since OA1 is an organellar GPCR, it may represent an unidentified pathway in the melanosome. Until recently, {{it was believed that}} the probable ligand for OA1 might be within the melanosomal lumen, <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components of the melanogenic pathway since it is so closely related to melanosome biogenesis.

The Ins des hobres blancos (Islands of the White Men) correspond, as far as locality is concerned, to the Arru (Aru) Islands. It would appear then that Gomes de Sequeira's Islands, which are the south-easternmost of those represented, must correspond with the Timor Laut group. In the same year, according to the voyages to the Banda Islands mencioned on Decadas and according to contemporaneous cartographers, Martim Afonso de Melo (Jusarte) and Garcia Henriques explored the Tanimbar Islands (the archipelago labelled [...] "aqui invernou Martim Afonso de Melo" [...] and [...] "Aqui in bernon Martin Afonso de melo" [...] ) and probably the Aru Islands (the two archipelagos and the navigator mentioned in the maps of Lázaro Luís, 1563, Bartolomeu Velho, c. 1560, Sebastião Lopes, c. 1565 and also in the 1594 map of the East Indies entitled Insulce Molucoe by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius and in the map of Nova Guinea of 1600).|$|E
