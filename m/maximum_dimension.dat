25|$|In Attappadi region gold grains {{are found}} only in native state and occur in {{different}} shapes and sizes. Visible specks of gold were noticed in the samples collected from veins, particularly where the associated sulphides {{have been subjected to}} weathering and leaching resulting in the formation of limonite. Gold grains with <b>maximum</b> <b>dimension</b> of 2mm were reported. Pyrite is the dominant sulfide phase within the quartz lodes (occurring as stringers and fracture fillings). Chalcopyrite, covellite, chalcocite, and galena are commonly observed in the mineral assemblage.|$|E
500|$|Amphidromus is a genus of {{tropical}} air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks {{in the family}} Camaenidae. The shells of Amphidromus are relatively large, from [...] to [...] in <b>maximum</b> <b>dimension,</b> and particularly colorful. During the 18th century, {{they were among the}} first Indonesian land snail shells brought to Europe by travelers and explorers. Since then, the genus has been extensively studied: several comprehensive monographs and catalogs were authored by naturalists and zoologists during the time period from the early 19th to the mid 20th centuries. Modern studies have focused on better understanding the evolutionary relationships within the group, as well as solving taxonomic problems.|$|E
500|$|The Scotch bonnet, {{scientific}} name Semicassis granulata, is a medium-sized to large species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the subfamily Cassinae, the helmet shells and bonnet shells. The common name [...] "Scotch bonnet" [...] {{alludes to the}} general outline and color pattern of the shell, which vaguely resemble a tam o' shanter, a traditional Scottish bonnet or cap. The shell is egg-shaped and fairly large, [...] in <b>maximum</b> <b>dimension,</b> with a regular pattern of yellow, orange or brown squarish spots.

500|$|Species in {{the genus}} Amphidromus usually have smooth, glossy, brightly colored, {{elongate}} or conic, dextrally or sinistrally coiled shells. The shells are moderately large, ranging from [...] to [...] in <b>maximum</b> <b>dimension,</b> having from 6 to 8 convex whorls. Their color pattern is usually monochromatic yellowish or greenish, {{but can be}} variegated. The aperture is oblique or ovate in shape, without any teeth or folds, and with the aperture height ranging from two-fifths to one-third of total shell height. The peristome is expanded and/or reflected, and is sometimes thickened. The columella may be straight or recurved, and the parietal callus is weak to well-developed, and the umbilicus may be open or closed. The radula is spatulate, has cusped teeth arranged in rows, usually with a monocuspid central tooth and bicuspid or tricuspid lateral teeth. The jaw is thin and weak, with low flat ribs. The pallial region is sigmurethrous, with a very long, narrow kidney. The genitalia are that of typical camaenids, with a long seminal receptacle, a short penis with low insertion of the retractor muscle, and a short or long epiphallic caecum (flagellum and appendix). The spermatophores have a pentagonal outline in cross-section. Amphidromus are typically arboreal animals.|$|E
