To achieve this purpose, Forty five (n= 45) youth boys were selected as subject at random. The age of the subjects were ranged between 15 and 19 years. The selected subjects were divided into three equal groups of high <b>resistance</b> training group, <b>medium</b> velocity <b>resistance</b> training group and control group of fifteen (n= 15) each. The training groups were treated with systematic high velocity <b>resistance</b> training and <b>medium</b> velocity <b>resistance</b> training for twelve weeks duration and three sessions in a week. The speed endurance was taken as a criterion variable for this study and 150 m run test was used as a test item. The data were collected before and immediately after the training. The collected data were analyzed statistically by using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The level of confidence was fixed at 0. 05 in all aspects. The results of the study shows that the high and <b>medium</b> velocity <b>resistance</b> training group have significant improvement (p ≤ 0. 05) in speed endurance as compare with the control group and the significant difference (p ≤ 0. 05) occurred between the training groups of high and <b>medium</b> velocity <b>resistance</b> training groups to each other.

40|$|A {{filtration}} {{theory for}} constant pressure filtration in viscoelastic media is presented. The theory {{is based on}} the linearized capillary hybrid model for flow in a porous medium. The main filtration equation is quite similar to that for non-Newtonian filtration except for the parameter vme representing a sum of two terms: one term characterizing the viscous (Newtonian) nature of the flow, and the second term portraying the elastic contribution to the flow. Constant pressure filtration experiments are performed using slurries of calcium carbonate in aqueous solutions of high molecular weight polyacrylamide (viscoelastic slurries) and slurries of calcium carbonate and water (Newtonian slurries). Three pressure drops are employed: 345 kPa, 517 kPa, and 689 kPa. The filtration theory provides a means to compile the experimental data, wherein filter cake and filter <b>medium</b> <b>resistances</b> are computed and compared. It is found that the filter cake resistances of the viscoelastic filtrations were considerably lower than those of the Newtonian filtrations. Furthermore, the filter <b>medium</b> <b>resistances</b> of the viscoelastic filtrations were, in general, higher than those of the Newtonian filtrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{filtration}} of drag reducing fluids {{has been}} studied {{in order to determine}} the variations in the resistance of filter cake and filter septum at different pressures. At the beginning of operation, both average specific cake resistance and filter <b>medium</b> <b>resistance</b> of filtration are important at any particular pressure and constant temperature; however, the filter cake resistance plays a dominant role in the remainder of a filtration run after a certain time interval. The average specific filtration resistance and filter <b>medium</b> <b>resistance</b> were computed from the relationships of filtrate volume versus effective time; the effective time of commencement of filtration was obtained by least-squares fitting of a developed equation.

40|$|We give {{an example}} of a {{mathematical}} model describing quantum mechanical processes interacting with medium. As a model, we consider the process of heat scattering of a wave function defined on the phase space. We consider the case when the heat diffusion takes place only with respect to momenta. We state and study the corresponding modified Kramers equation for this process. We consider the consequent approximations to this equation in powers of the quantity inverse to the <b>medium</b> <b>resistance</b> per unit of mass of the particle in the process. The approximations are constructed similarly to statistical physics, where from the usual Kramers equation for the evolution of probability density of the Brownian motion of a particle in the phase space, one deduces an approximate description of this process by the Fokker [...] Planck equation for the density of probability distribution in the configuration space. We prove that the zero (invertible) approximation to our model with respect to the large parameter of the <b>medium</b> <b>resistance,</b> yields the usual quantum mechanical description by the Schrödinger equation with the standard Hamilton operator.

40|$|Abstract. An earth {{boundary}} {{surface is}} {{the interface between}} two media, such as the atmosphere-lithosphere, atmosphere-ocean, and lithosphere-ocean. These boundary surfaces separate different density media with their own energy dynamics, composition, and strength. The advantages of an earth-system, boundary strategy in geomorphology {{is that it is}} less limiting and brings forth the importance of several concepts, which are intuitively obvious, but are often overlooked or assumed. Thus, a more complete understanding of the nature and origin of landscapes is possible. First, all surface morphology is created from the transfer of mass in 3 -d space; second, gravity is the dominant driving force of both exogenous and endogenous processes at meso- and megascales; third, a <b>medium’s</b> <b>resistance</b> to change (viscosity or rigidity) is dependent on the strength of the molecular forces holding the medium together, its thermal state and the presence of structural discontinuities; fourth, sympathetic boundaries are commonly found adjacent to the studied surface in one or both media; and fifth, the application of earth-system boundaries is not scale limiting and includes a range from continental scale morphology to mineral surface microtopography...|$|R

The tested muds cover Freshwater/Gypsum/Lignosulphonate mud and SeawaterlKCLlPolymer mud, bariteweighted and unweighted. The {{effects of the}} solid concentration, pressure and shear rate on the filter cake characteristics and the erodability were investigated. For static filtration experiments, all tests were conducted for two hours and the spurt loss, the filter cake thickness, the ratio of wet to dry cake mass and the cumulative filtrate volume against time were measured. For dynamic filtration experiments, however, only the spurt loss and the cumulative filtrate volume against time were measured and all tests were conducted for at least 8 hours. A general filtration equation was developed based on the cake filtration theory prevailing in the chemical engineering industry and it was utilised to obtain the modified classic static filtration equation and the dynamic filtration equation. The modified classic static filtration equation was then employed to fit the static filtration experimental data and the average specific static cake resistance and the effective filter <b>medium</b> <b>resistance</b> were calculated. The dynamic filtration equation showed a substantial agreement with the dynamic filtration experimental data. Using the static filter cake properties such as the ratio of wet to dry cake mass (m), the average specific dynamic cake resistance, the effective filter <b>medium</b> <b>resistance</b> and the dynamic filter cake erodability were calculated. In {{the study of the}} relationship between the static filtration data and the dynamic filtration data, an attempt of predicting the dynamic filtration data from the static filtration experimental data was conducted. Also, an attempt was carried out to predict the static filtration data and the dynamic filtration data in a sequential process.
