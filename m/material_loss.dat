25|$|Regardless {{of whether}} the {{situation}} is a discovered or a dual attack, it does not force an alliance if any attacking move is a direct defense against a threat of <b>material</b> <b>loss,</b> as defined above. That is, if First attacks Middle, and Middle defends by moving {{in such a way}} that First now checks Last (a discovered attack), this does not force an alliance between First and Middle. Or, if Last attacks First, and First defends by checking Last, and then Middle threatens Last's rook, this does not force an alliance between First and Middle either.|$|E

The National Guard Bureau (NGB) was aware of the shortfalls in security at Muniz and of the threat, yet corrective actions had not been implemented at the time.

This paper presents research that uses MFA to examine the end-of-use (EoU) product management for an international steel component manufacturer and offers {{lessons learned from the}} process. It is found that MFA is useful for mapping product flows and <b>material</b> <b>losses.</b> Also, dividing the initial product flow into sub-flows helps indicate feasibility of improved company-level EoU product management.

2500|$|It was not {{originally}} {{the intention of}} the Mongol Empire to invade the Khwarezmid Empire. According to the Persian historian Juzjani, Genghis Khan had originally sent the ruler of the Khwarezmid Empire, Ala ad-Din Muhammad, a message seeking trade and greeted him as his neighbor: [...] "I am master of the lands of the rising sun while you rule those of the setting sun. Let us conclude a firm treaty of friendship and peace." [...] or he said [...] "I am Khan of the lands of the rising sun while you are sultan those of the setting sun: Let us conclude a firm agreement of friendship and peace." [...] The Mongols' original unification of all [...] "people in felt tents", unifying the nomadic tribes in Mongolia and then the Turcomens and other nomadic peoples, had come with relatively little bloodshed, and almost no <b>material</b> <b>loss.</b> The Mongol wars with the Jurchens however had shown how cruel the Mongols could be.

An exception to this was in the Bandon area where there were many Protestant farmers who gave information.

"The {{influence}} {{which the}} standard of hours of work exerts on economic activities is partially obscured {{by the fact that}} the earnings of a human being are commonly counted gross; no special reckoning being made for his wear-and-tear, of which he is himself rather careless.

When the hours and the general conditions of labour are such as to cause great wear-and-tear of body or mind or both, and to lead to a low standard of living; when there has been a want of that leisure, rest, and repose which are among the necessaries for efficiency, then the labour has been extravagant from the point of view of society at large....
