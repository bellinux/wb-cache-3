30|$|Adults (age >  18  years) {{admitted}} to the ICU and given norepinephrine to treat shock were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were <b>moribund</b> <b>status,</b> pregnancy or breastfeeding, infusion of another medication via the central venous port used for norepinephrine administration, absence of healthcare insurance, refusal of the patient or next of kin {{to participate in the}} study, pheochromocytoma, and carcinoid tumor.|$|E
30|$|The {{study was}} {{approved}} by the ethics committee of the Marseille University Hospital (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Méditerranée, ID RCB: 2008 -A 00077 - 48). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient’s next of kin. Patients admitted {{in the intensive care unit}} of a university teaching hospital during a 10 -month period were screened if they met inclusion criteria: moderate-to-severe ARDS with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio ≤ 150  mmHg at a PEEP ≥ 8  cm H 2 O. Exclusion criteria were age < 18  years, <b>moribund</b> <b>status,</b> risks associated with HFOV (head injury, pneumothorax or a chest tube in place with persistent air leak) and contraindications to the placement of a nasogastric probe. All patients were sedated and continuously paralyzed [13]. The severity of illness was determined according to the Simplified Acute Physiologic II Score, the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment Score and the Lung Injury Score [14, 15].|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} inscriptions of Semitic {{languages in}} Eritrea and Ethiopia {{date to the}} 9th century BC in Epigraphic South Arabian (ESA), an abjad shared with contemporary kingdoms in South Arabia. After the 7th and 6th centuries BC, however, variants of the script arose, evolving {{in the direction of}} the Ge'ez abugida (a writing system that is also called an alphasyllabary). This evolution can be seen most clearly in evidence from inscriptions (mainly graffiti on rocks and caves) in Tigray region in northern Ethiopia and the former province of Akkele Guzay in Eritrea. By the first centuries AD, what is called [...] "Old Ethiopic" [...] or the [...] "Old Ge'ez alphabet" [...] arose, an abjad written left-to-right (as opposed to boustrophedon like ESA) with letters basically identical to the first-order forms of the modern vocalized alphabet (e.g. [...] "k" [...] in the form of [...] "kä"). There were also minor differences such as the letter [...] "g" [...] facing to the right, instead of to the left as in vocalized Ge'ez, and a shorter left leg of [...] "l", as in ESA, instead of equally-long legs in vocalized Ge'ez (somewhat resembling the Greek letter lambda). Vocalization of Ge'ez occurred in the 4th century, and though the first completely vocalized texts known are inscriptions by Ezana, vocalized letters predate him by some years, as an individual vocalized letter exists in a coin of his predecessor Wazeba. Linguist Roger Schneider has also pointed out (in an early 1990s unpublished paper) anomalies in the known inscriptions of Ezana that imply that he was consciously employing an archaic style during his reign, indicating that vocalization could have occurred much earlier. As a result, some [...] believe that the vocalization may have been adopted to preserve the pronunciation of Ge'ez texts due to the already <b>moribund</b> or extinct <b>status</b> of Ge'ez, and that, by that time, the common language of the people were already later Ethio-Semitic languages. At least one of Wazeba's coins from the late 3rd or early 4th century contains a vocalized letter, some 30 or so years before Ezana. Kobishchanov, Daniels, and others have suggested possible influence from the Brahmic family of alphabets in vocalization, as they are also abugidas, and Aksum was an important part of major trade routes involving India and the Greco-Roman world throughout the common era of antiquity.|$|R

It has been argued that the vowel marking pattern of the script reflects a South Asian system, such as would have been known by Frumentius. A separate tradition, recorded by Aleqa Taye, holds that the Ge'ez consonantal alphabet was first adapted by Zegdur, a legendary king of the Ag'azyan Sabaean dynasty held to have ruled in Ethiopia c. 1300 BC.|$|R
40|$|Pleural effusions are {{resistant}} to standard therapy, which causes discomfort and can require prolonged hospitalization. As an alternative, pleuroperitoneal shunting for pleural effusions of various etiologies was evaluated. We implanted 36 shunts in 29 patients. Two patients had bilateral shunts and five had shunt revisions. The effusion was related to a malignancy in 22 patients, postoperative chylothorax in two patients, and other causes in five patients. Therapeutic thoracentesis had been attempted in 28 patients, and eight had had chest tube placement previously with attempted sclerosis. Seven patients had a trapped lung syndrome. There was no operative mortality. All patients were deemed ready for discharge from the hospital if they had recovered from the operation within 48 hours. Five patients had poor results, either because of a <b>moribund</b> <b>status</b> or their refusal or inability to pump the shunt. Of the remaining 24 patients, four had good results with temporary improvement, and excellent results were achieved in 20 patients (83. 3 %), who experienced symptomatic relief and stabilization or regression of pleural effusion until {{the time of their}} death. Patients with chylothorax experienced complete resolution. The 14 patients with malignant effusions had a median survival of 4 months, and there were no instances of peritoneal tumor seeding. In conclusion, pleuroperitoneal shunting is an alternative therapy for pleural effusions that requires a limited hospitalization only, is associated with minimal and short-term discomfort, achieves excellent results in properly selected patients, and is the only viable therapy when lung expansion cannot be achieved...|$|E
