Surprisingly, depending on the <b>molecular</b> <b>environments</b> of G 4, BLM unfolds G 4 through different mechanisms: unfolding G 4 harbor-ing a 3 ′-ssDNA tail in three discrete steps with unidi-rectional translocation, and unfolding G 4 connected to dsDNA by ssDNA in a repetitive manner in which BLM remains anchored at the ss/dsDNA junction, and G 4 was unfolded by reeling in ssDNA.

40|$|Abstract. Galactic nuclei often harbor a disproportionately {{large amount}} of star {{formation}} activity {{with respect to their}} surrounding disks. Not coincidentally, the density of molecular material in galactic nuclei is often also much greater than that in disks (Table 1 in Kennicutt 1998). The interplay between rich populations of young stars and dense <b>molecular</b> <b>environments</b> is evident in our own Galactic center, which hosts over 10 % of Galactic star formation activity within only < 0. 1 % of the volume of the Galactic disk. Data obtained with the VLA and HST reveal a variety of star forming sites in the Galactic Center, including a substantial population of stars that are formed in very dense and massive clusters, while other stars are formed in somewhat sparsely populated associations of massive stars. Indeed, three of the stellar clusters are the most massive and densest in the Galaxy. In this paper, we discuss the Galactic center environment and its compact young star clusters, and compare them to their counterparts in star forming galactic nuclei, concluding that dense <b>molecular</b> <b>environments</b> and large velocity dispersions combine to alter star formation activity in both cases, particularly as regards massive young clusters. 1...|$|R

50|$|During most {{molecular}} bonding, {{it is the}} {{valence electrons}} which principally {{take part in the}} bonding. In recognition of this fact, it is common to represent valence orbitals by more than one basis function (each of which can in turn be composed of a fixed linear combination of primitive Gaussian functions). Basis sets in which there are multiple basis functions corresponding to each valence atomic orbital are called valence double, triple, quadruple-zeta, and so on, basis sets (zeta, ζ, was commonly used to represent the exponent of an STO basis function). Since the different orbitals of the split have different spatial extents, the combination allows the electron density to adjust its spatial extent appropriate to the particular <b>molecular</b> <b>environment.</b> In contrast, minimal basis sets lack the flexibility to adjust to different molecular environments.|$|E
