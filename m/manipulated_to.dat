5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> commit the crime {{and what happens to}} him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E

This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the {{different parts of the}} speech apparatus, the airstream can be <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> produce different speech sounds.|$|E
5|$|Bavetta was one {{of three}} referees for the Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Kings and the Lakers. Former referee Tim Donaghy has alleged {{that at least one of}} the referees working this game had {{subjective}} motives for wanting the Lakers to defeat the Kings, and made officiating calls to effectuate this outcome. The NBA has not permitted Bavetta to speak publicly regarding the incident, though The New York Times reported on June 12, 2008 that the FBI is investigating allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals had been <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> further the series to a seventh game. Even the television announcers commented on how obvious it was that the fix was in.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a recon mission. As the game progresses, Walker's mental health deteriorates, {{as he begins}} to experience hallucinations and slowly realizes the horror of war. Players can hide behind cover, vault over obstacles, and shoot enemies while utilizing a variety of gadgets. Sand is a key gameplay mechanic that can be <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> defeat enemies. Included with the game is an online multiplayer mode, developed separately by Darkside Game Studios, allowing players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards prices when they were secretly <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> match subjects’ birthday dates, thus resulting in a higher chance of purchase. However a second study using birth year as price did not lead to the same result. A study of the liking of products found that participants with high self-esteem liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> a certain extent based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing {{one of the guards}} to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E
5|$|Battles in {{the story}} take place on maps divided into a square-based grid. Battle actions are governed by a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During gameplay, weather and terrain effects appear such as fog of war or {{elements}} of the environment that can be <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> one side's advantage, affecting the progress of battle. Units are split between player, enemy and allied non-player character (NPC) units. Each unit's movement range and attack range is displayed when selected. The player must clear a map to advance the story: the objectives for clearing a level can vary from defeating all enemies to capturing strongholds or rescuing NPCs. When engaging a unit, the scene transitions into a battle between the player and enemy unit, with battle animation playing out. When hit with an attack, a character loses health points (HP). For player characters, HP can be restored with items or by units with healing magic; {{it can also be}} regained by standing on forts, gates or castles, or using a special spell that replenishes health based on damage dealt to an enemy.|$|E

5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E
5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{fought against}} the {{orthodox}} traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed {{that it would be}} a sin to marry after puberty. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.|$|E

5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is <b>manipulated</b> <b>to</b> the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E
