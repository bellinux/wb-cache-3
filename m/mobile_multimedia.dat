Web search engine ability in a mobile form allows users to find mobile content on websites which are available to mobile devices on mobile networks. As this happens mobile content shows a media shift toward <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia.</b> Simply put, mobile search is not just a spatial shift of PC web search to mobile equipment, but is witnessing more of treelike branching into specialized segments of mobile broadband and mobile content, both of which show a fast-paced evolution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{majority}} of today’s multimedia applications and content reside on the Internet. Since the Internet Protocol (IP) is the “glue ” {{that holds the}} Internet together, there is enormous interest in extending IP to <b>multimedia</b> <b>mobile</b> terminals. This would allow mobile terminals direct Internet access as well as access to intranet based multimedia. The current status of the emerging successor to IP, named Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 (MIPv 6), is examined in this paper. A quantitative estimate of MIPv 6 overhead is calculated and conclusions are drawn about the short-term evolution of MIPv 6 technology {{and its impact on}} the <b>Mobile</b> Ubiquitous <b>Multimedia</b> (MUM) industry...|$|R

It {{is based on}} the Satellite and Terrestrial Interactive Multiservice Infrastructure (STiMi), developed by TiMiTech, a company formed by the Chinese Academy of Broadcasting Science.

40|$|The ARMrayan <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Mobile</b> CMS (Content Management System) is {{the first}} mobile CMS that gives the {{opportunity}} to users for creating multimedia J 2 ME mobile applications with their desired content, design and logo; simply, without any need for writing even a line of code. The low-level programming and compatibility problems of the J 2 ME, along with UI designing difficulties, {{makes it hard for}} most people -even programmers- to broadcast their content to the widespread mobile phones used by nearly all people. This system provides user-friendly, PC-based tools for creating a tree index of pages and inserting multiple multimedia contents (e. g. sound, video and picture) in each page for creating a J 2 ME mobile application. The output is a stand-alone Java mobile application that has a user interface, shows texts and pictures and plays music and videos regardless of the type of devices used as long as the devices support the J 2 ME platform. Bitmap fonts have also been used thus Middle Eastern languages can be easily supported on all mobile phone devices. We omitted programming concepts for users in order to simplify <b>multimedia</b> content-oriented <b>mobile</b> application designing for use in educational, cultural or marketing centers. Ordinary operators can now create a variety of <b>multimedia</b> <b>mobile</b> applications such as tutorials, catalogues, books, and guides in minutes rather than months. Simplicity and power has been the goal of this CMS. In this paper, we present the software engineered-designed concepts of the ARMrayan MCMS along with the implementation challenges faces and solutions adapted.
