It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the <b>Main</b> <b>Agreement</b> for Agriculture, , was introduced.

5000|$|A prenuptial agreement, antenuptial agreement, or premarital agreement, {{commonly}} {{abbreviated to}} prenup or prenupt, is a [...] "marriage contract" [...] entered into prior to marriage, civil union {{or any other}} agreement prior to the <b>main</b> <b>agreement</b> by the people intending to marry or contract with each other. The content of a prenuptial agreement can vary widely, but commonly includes provisions for division of property and spousal support {{in the event of}} divorce or breakup of marriage. They may also include terms for the forfeiture of assets as a result of divorce on the grounds of adultery; further conditions of guardianship may be included as well.

5000|$|Only {{late in the}} 20th {{century was}} escape allowed if the threat {{involved}} illegitimate economic harm. A threat is always [...] "illegitimate" [...] {{if it is to}} do an unlawful act, such as breaking a contract knowing non-payment may push someone out of business. However, threatening to do a lawful act will usually not be illegitimate. In Pao On v Lau Yiu Long the Pao family threatened to not complete a share swap deal aimed at purchasing their company's building unless the Lau family agreed to change a guarantee agreement assuring the Paos would receive the rise in the swapped shares' prices when repurchased. The Privy Council advised that the Laus signing the guarantee agreement after the threat of non-completion of the <b>main</b> <b>agreement</b> was only a result of [...] "commercial pressure", not economic duress. Just by observing the Laus' behaviour, and consideration of the situation before signing, there was no coercion amounting to a vitiation of consent. However, contrasting to cases involving business parties, the threat to do a lawful act will probably be duress if used against a vulnerable person.|$|E

Four areas needed further description: cycle regularity, menstrual period frequency, duration of flow and volume of flow.

50|$|In {{an effort}} to re-launch {{professional}} football {{in the city of}} Paris, Paris Football Club was founded on 1 August 1969. The objective of the club was to be playing in the first division by 1970. An attempted merger with CS Sedan Ardennes was refused so Paris went looking in the second division and, subsequently, merged with Stade Saint-Germain to form Paris Saint-Germain, the professional club that currently plays in Ligue 1 today. The current incarnation of Paris FC came into being in 1972 when the club split from Paris Saint-Germain after coming under pressure from the capital city's mayor, who refused to support a non-Parisian club (the club had originally been situated in nearby Saint-Germain-en-Laye). As a result, a bitter split occurred and both Paris FC and Paris Saint-Germain remained as separate football club with the <b>main</b> <b>agreement</b> being that Paris FC had the right to keep the splitting entity's first division and professional status, as well as all the professional players. Paris Saint-Germain were, on the other hand, administratively relegated to the third division and given all the former entity's amateur players.|$|E

Article XVI of the regulations adopted Germany's Notzeichen (distress signal) as the international standard, reading: [...] "Ships in distress shall use the following signal: [...] repeated at brief intervals". The first ship to transmit an SOS distress call {{appears to have been}} either the Cunard liner [...] on June 10, 1909, according to [...] "Notable Achievements of Wireless" [...] in the September, 1910 Modern Electrics, or the steamer SS Arapahoe on August 11, 1909. The signal of the Arapahoe was received by the United Wireless Telegraph Company station at Hatteras, North Carolina, and forwarded to the steamer company's offices. However, there was some resistance among the Marconi operators to the adoption of the new signal, and, as late as the April 1912 sinking of the , the ship's Marconi operators intermixed CQD and SOS distress calls. However, in the interests of consistency and water safety, the use of CQD appears to have died out thereafter.|$|E

Negotiation and task allocation have been in the multi-agent systems realm since its inception as a research field. More recently, social aspects of agenthood have received increasing attention, namely developments in the fields of normative and trust systems...|$|E

30|$|Coordination {{based on}} trendsetting is {{of a more}} recent vintage in Scandinavia. The change from central level {{bargaining}} to coordinated industry bargaining, following the pattern set by the <b>main</b> <b>agreements</b> in the exposed sector, meant that wage leadership shifted from unskilled workers in {{the private and public}} sectors (the main benefactors of central agreements) to the skilled workers in the private (exposed) sector, with an increased role for salaried employees in later years (Bøje and Madsen 1994; Due et al. 1994; Iversen 1999). In each of these countries the changes started in the 1980 s, but it took till the early (Denmark), mid (Norway) or late 1990 s (Sweden) before a stable wage leadership was established (Scheuer 1998; Elvander 2002; Vartiainen 2001; Kjellberg 2012).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we present several {{implementation}} strategies answering to different classical problems in multi-agent systems.

As emphasized in the literature, the connectivity of the communication network is essential for global coordination objectives. Thus, {{the primary goal of}} our methodology is to characterize the controllers that preserve a given topology allowing the global coordination. In a second step we choose the controller appropriated to the <b>main</b> <b>agreement</b> objective by solving a convex optimization problem associated to the minimization of a well-chosen cost function.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results obtained by the CONSEN computer program for two post-test calculations of the EVITA facility (CEA) relating to the cryogenic experiments carried out in 2004 and 2005. EVITA experiment has the scope to test the cryogenic effects in case of water or steam inlet together with helium gas in volumes having initial vacuum conditions. It simulates the cryostat behaviour in the ITER plant during a {{loss of coolant accident}} due to the simultaneous ruptures of water and helium cooling pipes.

40|$|Purpose - During {{the last}} 15 years, {{knowledge}} management (KM) {{has changed from}} one generation to the next through constant improvements and new perspectives. A myriad researchers have presented methodologies, frameworks, technologies and have discussed various KM theoretical and practical issues. However, KM still needs extensive development - it is in its infancy. This paper aims to explore the world of KM in a different way; to review the current status quo and analyze the <b>main</b> <b>agreements</b> and disagreements among researchers and practitioners in order to highlight the key issues which need to be further researched. Design/methodology/approach - The authors attempt to review and analyze in a coherent way the <b>main</b> <b>agreements</b> and disagreements among researchers and practitioners - in the field of KM - based on a wide range of published works, including papers, books, reports and web sites. Findings - Based on the key agreements among researchers and practitioners and having in mind the remaining disagreements, the third KM generation should proceed to further investigation of several KM issues and to further research. Research limitations/implications - The key issues highlighted here need to be researched further. Following on from the individual-knowledge focus of the 1970 s/ 1980 s and the group-knowledge focus of the 1990 s/ 2000 s, the third KM generation should: develop criteria for evaluating frameworks, methodologies and approaches, and systems for measuring knowledge, intellectual capital and other assets; include double-loop learning; analyse investments and costs of KM Systems; use modern technologies for transfer of explicit knowledge; and apply KM to other areas of social life. There is also a need to clarify the meanings of differences between the various concepts discussed here. Originality/value - The distinguishing feature of this study is that it emphasizes placing KM in a broader context of researchers/practitioners' discussions so that the key issues can be better recognized and understood. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
