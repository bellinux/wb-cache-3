5|$|Gil Grissom has a {{more than}} passing {{similarity}} to Sherlock Holmes. Like Holmes, Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and little regard for societal norms of behavior; Grissom once smashed mustard jars {{in a grocery store}} to illustrate a theory ("I-15 Murders"), much as Holmes once practiced spearing a pig in a butchers to determine how strong a <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be to transfix a man with a harpoon.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} household, in late 1874 Coolbrith took a {{position}} as the librarian for the Oakland Library Association, a subscription library that had been established five years earlier. In 1878, the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library, the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act (Eureka was first). Coolbrith earned a salary of $80 per month, much less than a <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> received. She worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Her poetry suffered as a result. She published only sporadically over the next 19 years—working as Oakland's librarian was the low point of her poetic career.|$|E

For trifling misdemeanors, he instituted elaborate investigations and meted out extravagant fines and punishments where a wiser <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> overlooked the whole matter.

A runaway who might have been mercifully beheaded was impaled alive on a sharpened stick to die in horrible agony. Another negro, arrested on a similar charge, had his foot cut off, after which he was confiscated to the governor's use and put to work in his kitchen.|$|E
25|$|Often {{food and}} {{clothing}} {{would be sent to}} the regiment from families back home, in care of a soldier returning from furlough; Private Matthews writes that such a <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to remain with them on the boxcars even after his leave had expired, to prevent them from being stolen. One such man was AWOL for two weeks while keeping an eye on some boxes shipped by families of soldiers from Eufaula, but when he was finally able to obtain transportation for himself and his cargo to the regiment, he was absolved of all charges and nothing further was said.|$|E

25|$|An {{inscription}} dated 445 recognizes a Marcellus as {{the most}} important financial supporter in the rebuilding of the cathedral at Narbonne, carried out during the bishopric of St. Rusticus. John Matthews has argued that this Marcellus is likely to have been a son or near descendant of the medical writer, since the family of an inlustris is most likely to have possessed the wealth for such a generous contribution. The donor had served for two years as praetorian prefect of Gaul. Assuming that the <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a native, Matthews weighs this piece of evidence with the Athaulf anecdote from Orosius to situate the author of the De medicamentis in the Narbonensis, but this is a minority view.|$|E
25|$|A person {{accused of}} a crime could deny the charge by denying it on oath and finding {{a certain number of}} persons {{prepared}} to go on oath that they believed his or her own oath, a system known as compurgation. The number of persons required to swear depended on the gravity of the alleged crime; for example denying a homicide could require 300 compurgators, while if a woman accused a man of rape, the <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to find 50 men prepared to swear to his innocence. For lesser crimes a smaller number would be sufficient. Witnesses could also be called, including eyewitnesses of the crime (gwybyddiaid). A witness who has once been proved to have given false testimony on oath was barred from ever appearing as a witness again.|$|E
25|$|Jeffreys's DNA {{method was}} first {{put to use}} in 1985 {{when he was asked}} to help in a disputed {{immigration}} case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from Ghana. The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to {{the other members of the}} family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's face when she heard the results. DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and 1986 respectively. Colin Pitchfork was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched semen samples taken from the two dead girls. This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys's work in this case prove who the real killer was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. In 1992, Jeffreys' methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele, who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a femur bone of his exhumed skeleton, with DNA from his widow and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.|$|E

500|$|Caracciola {{first met}} Adolf Hitler, {{the leader of}} the Nazi Party, in 1931. Hitler had ordered a Mercedes-Benz 770, at that point Mercedes' most {{expensive}} car, but due to {{the amount of time spent}} upgrading the car in line with the Nazi leader's wishes, the delivery was late. To mollify Hitler's anger, Caracciola was dispatched by Mercedes to deliver the car to the Brown House in Munich. Caracciola drove Hitler and his niece Geli Raubal around Munich to demonstrate the car. He later wrote (after the fall of the Nazi Party) that he was not particularly awed by Hitler: [...] "I could not imagine that this <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the requirements for taking over the government someday." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 17th through 19th centuries, a woman expressing passionate {{love for}} another woman was fashionable, accepted, and encouraged. These {{relationships}} were termed romantic friendships, Boston marriages, or [...] "sentimental friends", and were {{common in the}} U.S., Europe, and especially in England. Documentation of these relationships is possible by a large volume of letters written between women. Whether the relationship included any genital component was not a matter for public discourse, but women could form strong and exclusive bonds {{with each other and}} still be considered virtuous, innocent, and chaste; a similar relationship with a <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> destroyed a woman's reputation. In fact, these relationships were promoted as alternatives to and practice for a woman's marriage to a man.|$|E

500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] {{for an artist}} not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|E
500|$|Vanger is {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} who launches an extensive investigation into his family's affairs. Despite calling the Vanger family [...] "dysfunctional", Plummer {{said of the}} character: [...] "I love {{the character of the}} old man, and I sympathize with him. He's really the nicest old guy in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish." [...] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik. [...] "I think that the old <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> it," [...] he opined, [...] "because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power. So in dealing with people, he would be very good [...] he would be quite jokey, and know how to seduce them." ...|$|E

500|$|In life, Lindow <b>Man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{measured}} between 5'6" [...] and 5'8" [...] (1.68 and 1.73m) {{tall and}} weighed about [...] It {{was possible to}} ascertain that his age at death was around the mid-20s. The body retains a trimmed beard, moustache, and sideburns of brown hair, as well as healthy teeth with no visible cavities, and manicured fingernails, indicating he did little heavy or rough work. Apart from a fox-fur armband, Lindow Man was discovered completely naked. When he died, Lindow Man was suffering from slight osteoarthritis and an infestation of whipworm and maw worm. As a result of decalcification of the bones and pressure from the peat under which Lindow Man was buried, his skull was distorted. While some preserved human remains may contain DNA, peat bogs such as Lindow Moss are generally poor for such a purpose, and {{it is unlikely that}} DNA could be recovered from Lindow Man.|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of such assessments, {{researchers}} such as Cheryl Glenn, Professor at the Pennsylvania State University, argue that Aspasia {{seems to have been}} the only woman in classical Greece to have distinguished herself in the public sphere and must have influenced Pericles in the composition of his speeches. Some scholars believe that Aspasia opened an academy for young women of good families or even invented the Socratic method. However, Robert W. Wallace, Professor of classics at Northwestern University, underscores that [...] "we cannot accept as historical the joke that Aspasia taught Pericles how to speak and hence was a master rhetorician or philosopher". According to Wallace, the intellectual role Aspasia was given by Plato may have derived from comedy. Kagan describes Aspasia as [...] "a beautiful, independent, brilliantly witty young woman capable of holding her own in conversation with the best minds in Greece and of discussing and illuminating any kind of question with her husband". Roger Just, a classicist and Professor of social anthropology at the University of Kent, believes that Aspasia was an exceptional figure, but her example alone is enough to underline the fact that any woman who was to become the intellectual and social equal of a <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be a hetaera. According to Sr. Prudence Allen, a philosopher and seminary professor, Aspasia moved the potential of women to become philosophers one step forward from the poetic inspirations of Sappho.|$|E
