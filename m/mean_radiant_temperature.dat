By utilizing a familiar engineering design tool to communicate integrated design techniques, better coordination can be achieved between architects and engineers.

40|$|Exergetic {{analysis}} can provide useful information as it enables {{the identification of}} irreversible phenomena bringing about entropy generation and, therefore, exergy losses (also referred to as irreversibilities). As far as human thermal comfort is concerned, irreversibilities can be evaluated based on parameters related to both the occupant and his surroundings. As an attempt to suggest more insights for the exergetic analysis of thermal comfort, this paper calculates irreversibility rates for a sitting person wearing fairly light clothes and subjected to combinations of ambient air and <b>mean</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The thermodynamic model framework relies on the so-called conceptual energy balance equation together with empirical correlations for invoked thermoregulatory heat transfer rates adapted for a clothed body. Results suggested that a minimum irreversibility rate may exist for particular combinations of the aforesaid surrounding temperatures. By separately considering the contribution of each thermoregulatory mechanism, the total irreversibility rate rendered itself more responsive to either convective or radiative clothing-influenced heat transfers, with exergy losses becoming lower if the body is able to transfer more heat (to the ambient) via convection...|$|R

40|$|The {{responses}} of 50 subjects wearing winter clothing (0 ° 86 clo) to two-hour-long exposures {{various kinds of}} winter indoor conditions were studied. The conditions included air speeds between 0. 05 and 0. 5 m/s (I 0 and I 00 fpm) and asymmetric radiation to a cold wall that produced <b>radiant</b> <b>temperature</b> asymmetries ranging from 0 to 20 K (0 to 36 F). The study was done at neutral or preferred temperatures and at conditions 3 °C (5. 4 F) lower. Some of the conclusions are: (i) The low <b>mean</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>temperatures</b> from the cold wall were compensated for by increased air temperature through the operative temperature concept. (2) The preferred operative temperature increased with air speed. (3) The level of occupant thermal acceptability at preferred temperatures was unaffected by air speeds of 0. 25 m/s (50 fpm) less or radiant asymmetries of I 0 K (18 F) or less. (4) At air velocities greater than m/s (50 fpm) the operative temperature determination procedure used seemed to overestimate radiation and underestimate convection. (5) Operative temperatures 3 ~C (5. 4 F) less than preferred temperature are probably too low for sedentary occupancy as acceptability levels were only about 60 % in these tests and at air speeds greater than 0. 15 m/s (30 fpm) the subjects did not reach equilibrium.

The challenge of performance simulation in computer-based models of buildings lies in the integration of various simulation techniques that require different kinds of building representations. Traditional simulation techniques for luminous, acoustic and thermal environments require different building representations. Thepaper proposes that an enhanced boundary representation is a viable, common building representation format for performance simulation of illumination levels, acoustical parameters and thermal comfort, thereby providing a building representation format for multi-domain performancesimulation on the computer.

40|$|Recent urban {{microclimate}} {{studies in}} Colombo, Sri Lanka, {{indicate that the}} maximum daily temperature within street canyons decreases with increasing height to width (H/W) ratio, but higher H/W ratio negatively affects street-level wind flow. There is also evidence pointing to the cooling effect of sea breeze. The nocturnal heat island is small in contrast to daytime urban–rural differences. In this paper, we use the software ENVI-met to simulate the effect of different urban design options on air and surface temperatures, {{as well as on}} outdoor thermal comfort. The latter is expressed as the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), an index based on air and <b>radiant</b> <b>temperatures</b> as well as wind and humidity. It is found that high albedo at street level gives the lowest air temperature during daytime, although the reduction is only about 1 °C. The lowest daytime <b>mean</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>temperatures</b> result from high H/W ratios of streets. This has a positive effect on thermal comfort; the increase of H/W ratio from about 1 to 3 leads to a decrease in PET by about 10 °C. Differences in air and surface temperatures, as well as PET, are small during the night. The results show that strategies that lead to better air temperature mitigation may not necessarily lead to better thermal comfort. However, shade enhancement through increased H/W ratios is clearly capable of significant reductions in PET, and thus, improved outdoor thermal comfort. Consequently, a critical urban design task in the humid tropics will be to guide the rapid urban growth towards efficient ‘shade growth’...|$|R

For hot and overcast day simulation, the difference in air temperature over the 24 hours between measured and predicted is in the range of 0. 1 K to 1. 8 K on the first floor and 0. 2 K to 4. 3 K on the second floor respectively. Whereas for hot and clear day simulation, the difference is in the range of 0. 1 K to 1. 5 K on the first floor and 0. 1 K to 2. 7 K on the second floor respectively.

Since these trends are expected to exacerbate existing conditions in cites, urban heat mitigation {{will be one of}} the key challenges of the twenty-first century. A frequently advocated means of mitigating urban heat is through shade trees. Through the reduction of air and radiative temperatures trees not only improve outdoor human thermal comfort, but also reduce the cooling loads of buildings. This paper investigates the impact of different canopy cover ratios and tree layouts on the urban microclimate. The numerical simulation study utilizes four characteristic dense urban configurations from Budapest (Hungary) to assess the influences of these factors on the effectiveness of shade trees in mitigating urban heat.

40|$|Using a physiologically {{relevant}} {{thermal comfort}} index (OUT_SET*), {{an analysis of}} the week-by-week human thermal climate of Sydney was carried out for three levels of metabolic activity. The OUT_SET* index is an outdoor version of the widely used indoor comfort index called the standard effective temperature (SET*) incorporating air and <b>mean</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>temperatures,</b> relative humidity, air velocity, clothing insulation and activity level. The outdoor comfort zone for Sydney in terms of OUT_SET* was found from earlier subjective field studies to be in the range 23. 8 - 28. 5 °C. The analysis indicated that the mid-summer period (weeks 43 through to 12 in the Southern Hemisphere) was most suitable for sedentary outdoor activities (e. g. watching spectator sport), whereas the mid-winter period was more suitable for light activities such as walking. Sydney's winter was found to be a very suitable season for tourism in many respects because of (a) low rainfall months, like August, and (b) the ability to undertake light activities while remaining within the outdoor comfort zone.

The aim has been to explore the potential of how seemingly fine scale green structure may contribute to regulating ecosystem services and thereby play an important role to SuDS (sustainable drainage systems), the urban microclimate and climate responsive design. Part of the aim has been to retrieve this information through quantitative indices and computational modelling, assuming that a numerical approach can produce comparative, rigorous and perceptible outcomes that act as efficient communication tools for e. g. city officials, planners, landscape architects, etc. The work combined a historical approach as well as computational modelling of numerical and tangible indices to shed some light on the hidden processes of regulating ecosystem services of fine-scale green structure. The SCS-CN approach was used for estimating surface runoff and ENVI-met for green structure influences on microclimate. It was found that within the green infrastructure network, individual configurations of green structure elements often influenced regulating ecosystem services beyond their proportionate size. Their influence depended in turn on place-specificity and contextual characteristics of e. g. geographical location, time of year, site spatial configuration and architectural composition. This is discussed with regard to urban densification (spatial), climate change and sustainable development and how the two tools used here can help in green infrastructure planning.

40|$|Quantitative {{information}} about outdoor thermal comfort, on various {{temporal and spatial}} scales, is required to design better cities and mitigate heat problems not only in warm but also in temperate climates. The overall objective {{of this study is}} to explore the augmentation of global/regional climate changes by urban features such as geometry in a compact mid-rise high-latitude city (Gothenburg). The magnitude of spatial and temporal variations of intra-urban <b>mean</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>temperatures</b> (T(mrt)) is quantified using the SOLWEIG (SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) model. Hourly time resolution, statistically downscaled meteorological data, based on the ECHAM 5 -GCM under the A 1 B emission scenario is used to simulate changes in T(mrt) and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) at the 2080 - 2099 time horizon. Results show that urban geometry causes large intra-urban differences in T(mrt), on hourly, daytime and yearly time scales. In general, open areas are warmer than adjacent narrow street canyons in summer, but cooler in winter. According to the ECHAM 5 -based scenario, the daytime T(mrt) will increase by 3. 2 degrees C by the end of this century. This is 0. 4 degrees more than simulated increase in air temperature (2. 8 degrees C) and is mainly a result of decreases in summer cloudiness. Occasions of strong/extreme heat stress are expected to triple. This equates to 20 - 100 h a year, depending on geometry. Conversely, the number of hours with strong/extreme cold stress decreases by 400 - 450 h. Furthermore, the number of hours with no thermal stress increases by 40 - 200 h a year. The study confirms the potential for using geometry to mitigate daytime thermal stress. A densely built structure mitigates extreme swings in T(mrt) and PET, improving outdoor comfort conditions both in summer and in winter. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of including information on either T(mrt) or thermal comfort in climate scenarios to describe the combined effects of changes in multiple climate variables and to more realistically measure the impact on humans.
