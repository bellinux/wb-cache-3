5000|$|The Golden Meadows Plant Materials Center in Galliano, Louisiana (LAPMC) was {{established}} in 1989 by the Natural Resource Conservation Service(NRCS). LAPMC develops plants and procedures to reverse the loss of coastal wetlands. The facility services coastal wetlands of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The eight species of plants that were developed by the center are used for coastal wetland remediation, restoration, and enhancement. These plants have proven effective in converting open water to new marsh. The eight species of plants are: ‘Pelican germplasm’ black mangrove ( [...] Avicennia germinans), ‘Caminada germplasm’ sea oats (Uniola paniculata), ‘Vermillion’ smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), ‘Gulf coast’ marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), ‘Brazoria germplasm’ seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum), ‘Boyou Lafourche germplasm’ California bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus), ‘Timbalier germplasm’ gulf bluestem (Schizachyrium maritimum), ‘Fourchon germplasm’ bitter panicum (Panicum amarum). LAPMC works continuously to reach its three goals. First, identify and evaluate species for coastal erosion control, marsh restoration and dune stabilization. Second, provide plants and technology to assist commercial growers in addressing coastal resource concerns. Third, provide educational opportunities and access to all segments {{of the community to}} the Golden <b>Meadow</b> <b>Plant</b> Materials Center Program.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} long-term (10 years) <b>meadow</b> <b>plant</b> community {{responses to}} (1) livestock grazing under riparian grazing utilization limits; (2) suspension of live-stock grazing; and (3) meadow site wetness and precipi-tation on the Inyo National Forest, California. Observed trends in <b>meadow</b> <b>plant</b> species richness, diversity, {{and frequency of}} soil stabilizing species {{were not significantly different}} between grazed (N = 16) and non-grazed (N = 9) study sites (P [0. 12 in all cases). Modest increases in richness and diversity were observed over the study period, but frequency of soil stabilizing species was constant. These results suggest that riparian conservation grazing strategies implemented during the study period neither degraded nor hampered recovery of <b>meadow</b> <b>plant</b> community conditions relative to non-grazed conditions. Meadow site wetness was negatively correlated to richness (P 0. 01) and diversity (P 0. 01), but was positively correlated to soil stabilization (P = 0. 02).

40|$|The role of meadows in the {{floodplains}} {{of small}} rivers at {{the territory of}} the Republic of Tatarstan (Russia) has increased after the flooding of meadows in the floodplains of the Volga and Kama Rivers, which occurred when the Kuybyshev and Lower Kama Reservoirs were created.

40|$|The {{subjects}} {{of this study}} were the plant succession of the regrassed and spontaneously revegetated fields in the Bohemian Forest foothills and the effect of grass cutting management on vegetation changes in time and some of the important soil microbial characteristics.

The data for the landscape view were collected during the season 2008 and were analyzed by ordination methods (DCA, CCA) and by the ANCOVA.

40|$|According to {{international}} nutritional standards, plant selenium (Se) concentrations in Belgium are too low. To correct this situation, adding Se in fertilizers for pastures and grasslands is suggested, similar to activities in Finland. However, {{there is a}} lack of data on <b>meadow</b> <b>plant</b> species' ability to absorb Se. Therefore, a pot experiment was initiated using 24 <b>meadow</b> <b>plant</b> species cultivated on a Belgian cambisol receiving standard fertilizer treatment, with or without the addition of 9 g Se ha(- 1) yr(- 1) as sodium selenate. Soil Se analysis confirmed the low Se status of the native soil. Mean foliar Se concentration in the control group was 0. 05 mg kg(- 1). Because plant deficiency may occur at levels less than 0. 10 mg Se kg(- 1), data provided further evidence for Se deficiency in Belgium plant production. When grown with Se, plant species showed wide variations for Se concentration, ranging from 0. 08 to 0. 49 mg Se kg(- 1). All values were less than 2 mg Se kg(- 1), the suggested threshold toxicity level for dairy cattle. There were two different types of plants in terms of response to Se fertilization. Most of the tested plants were known as nonaccumulators. There were also two probable secondary accumulators: Sinapis arvensis and Melilotus albus. Finally, one has to question the reliability of plant Se enhancement using this method when floristic composition is poorly controlled. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} acknowledged that soil biota may influence interactions among plant species, however, {{little is known}} about how to change historical influences of previous land management on soil biota, the so-called ‘biotic soil legacy effect’. We used a two-phase plant community-soil feedback approach to study how plant species typical to original (i. e. undisturbed) and degraded fen meadows may influence effects of the soil community on Carex species that are dominant in fen meadows. In phase one, soil from original, degraded, successfully and unsuccessfully restored fen meadows was conditioned by growing plants typical to original or to degraded fen meadows. In phase two, interactions between Carex and neighbouring plant species were studied to quantify plant community-soil feedback effects in different neighbour plant mixtures. Soil conditioning with plants typical to original fen meadows resulted in significantly more Carex biomass than with plants typical to degraded fen meadows. These effects were strongest when the soil originated from unsuccessfully restored fen meadows. However, biomass of plants typical of degraded fen meadows was also higher in soil conditioned by typical fen meadow plants. We conclude that soil legacy effects of plants from degraded fen meadows can be altered by growing typical fen <b>meadow</b> <b>plant</b> species in that soil, as this enhances priority effects that favour growth of other typical fen meadow plants. As also plant species from degraded fen meadows benefitted from soil conditioning, further studies are needed to reveal if plant species can be chosen that change negative soil legacy effects for rare and endangered fen <b>meadow</b> <b>plant</b> species, but not for plant species that are typical to degraded fen meadows...|$|E
40|$|Sierra Nevada <b>meadow</b> <b>plant</b> {{communities}} {{are influenced by}} multiple multi-scale environmental processes ranging from elevation and climate to local soil moisture regimes. In recent years, land managers have faced concerns over potential impacts of recreational pack stock use to these meadow communities. Detecting the effects of such a stressor amongst {{a large amount of}} inherent natural variability requires taking into account variation due to environmental processes across multiple temporal and spatial scales. I evaluated the influence of pack stock use within Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks on three <b>meadow</b> <b>plant</b> community responses: 1) total vegetation cover and bare ground, 2) multivariate species composition and abundance, and 3) local-scale spatial variability in plant community structure. The study design accounted for inherent natural variability across multiple scales by: 1) controlling for among-meadow variability by using remote sensing data to select non-stock (`control') sites, 2) accounting for within-meadow variation in the local hydrology using in-situ soil moisture readings and 3) controlling for variation in stock use patterns by sampling across the entire available gradient of stock use. Increased cover of bare ground was detected only within "dry" meadow areas at the two most heavily used stock meadows. No difference in species composition or abundance was detected for any level of soil moisture or stock use. Increased local-scale spatial variability in plant community structure was detected in "wet" meadow areas at the two most heavily used meadows. These results suggest that at the meadow scale plant {{communities are}} generally resistant to the contemporary levels of recreational pack stock use studied. However, within-meadow responses such as increased bare ground can be context-dependent as a function of local-scale hydrological conditions and the ability to detect such effects may be dependent on short term (1 - 2 years) antecedent site conditions and use levels...|$|E
