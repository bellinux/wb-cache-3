40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} and isolate the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> delays in underground lateral development at AngloGold Ashanti (AGA), Obuasi Mine, Ghana. It uses fishbone analysis to identify and present 20 possible <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> delays in lateral development at the mine. By employing Pareto analysis, 7 <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> delays have been isolated. They are: scoop problems, low compressed air, labour shortages, bad ground, flood, power outages and waste pass getting full. The study concludes that, should management concentrate in minimising the 7 <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> delays, it will be solving about 80 % of the problems associated with delays in underground lateral development at AGA, Obuasi mine. The study further gives specific recommendations to reduce delays in lateral development at the mine...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry is mired in disputes. It {{is one of}} the leading industries that is involved in a number of disputes. This paper examines the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> disputes in the {{construction industry}} and it further identifies the effects disputes have on projects and investigate the forms of minimizing the disputes and how to resolve them. This study was conducted through the use of secondary data from the use of journals, books and internet to achieve the objective for the study. The review of literature looked into details the different views from different scholars about the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> disputes then deduce from those views the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> dispute in the South Africa construction sector. The findings from the literature review showed that the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> disputes revolve around people, process and project characteristics. It was also mostly mentioned that project uncertainty, contractual problems and opportunistic behaviour cause construction disputes. The purpose of this academic paper was to justify the need to know the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> disputes in the South African construction industry and to further establish the effects disputes have on construction and to suggest ways to minimize and resolve disputes in projects. It is said that the people, process and projects characteristics are <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> disputes and so is the project uncertainty, contractual problems and opportunistic behaviours. As a way to resolve disputes, alternative dispute resolutions are put in place and so are adjudication, arbitration and litigation...|$|R
5|$|A second <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings {{in an attempt to}} estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing.

This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists.

5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was a <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban {{on the use of}} DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria are a <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease {{may only be}} discovered many years after, {{as was the case}} with Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E

Inflammation is usually caused by infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the lung tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called pneumonitis.

5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E

5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks {{may be lost}} to starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming {{is believed to be}} a <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E

Jack jumper stings are the single most common cause of anaphylaxis in patients at the Royal Hobart Hospital. The ant has also been a <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> anaphylaxis outside Tasmania, notably around Adelaide and the outskirts of Melbourne, while cases in New South Wales and Western Australia have been more distributed. One in 50 adults have been reported to suffer anaphylaxis due to the jack jumper or other Myrmecia ants.|$|E
5|$|The marked {{spread of}} dengue {{during and after}} the Second World War has been {{attributed}} to ecologic disruption.
