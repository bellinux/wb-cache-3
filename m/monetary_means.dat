Then, there is a discontinuity in the action, and Dmitri is suddenly running away off his father's property, knocking the servant Gregory in the head with the pestle with seemingly fatal results.|$|E

5000|$|Using McDonald (2002, pp. 12-33), the {{following}} {{specific set of}} attractors have been proposed by Senges (2007) to directly influence the knowledge entrepreneurship ability (figure 1.6): Environmental awareness describes with what practices and with what intensity the organization gathers information about its external and internal environment. The importance of this practice {{for the establishment of}} an entrepreneurial organization was also recognized by Cornwall and Perlman (1990). They write: [...] "Scanning should be a fundamental part of every manager's job, not something that is done by top management in conjunction with the annual update of the strategic plan"(Cornwall & Perlman, 1990, p. 46). As such the concept includes activities like internal needs analysis, benchmarking and inter-organizational networking. The organizations attitude towards the risk inherent in the pursuit of all innovation is captured under the concept of risk tolerance. A factor which has not been part of McDonald's model (and which replaces the variable named analytical diligence) covers the organizations vision in the sense of entrepreneuring (Kuratko, 2006). This ability is strongly related to strategic thinking and planning, describes its culture of envisioning and scouting new developments. New project support refers to the degree to which new initiatives are institutionalized as a means of institutional development.

It {{is best known as}} the place where the Bulgarian medium Baba Vanga lived and was buried. The area is in fact the crater of an extinct volcano, its appearance being shaped by the volcanic hill of Kozhuh, the thermal springs and Pchelina Hill. The village has 1,124 inhabitants.Rupite is a protected area, which is situated at a distance of about 10 km from Petrich and 2 km from the village of Rupite, at the eastern foot of the extinct volcano Kozhuh Mountain (281 meters altitude). The hill was built by volcanic rocks. Its name {{comes from the fact that}} it looks like a mantle (kozhuh in Bulgarian). In 1962 a part of the locality of Kozhuh - 0.4 hectares - was declared a natural landmark. The protected area of Rupite is famous for its healing mineral springs with a temperature of 74° C and capacity of up to 35 l/sec. The climate in the locality is transitional-Mediterranean, which is a reason for the presence of Mediterranean grass vegetation and some thermoliphic animal species. The natural by-river forest consists mainly of White Poplar (Populus Alba).The protected areas of Rupite and Kozhuh Mountain are homes to various snake species. Here you can see the relatively rare species - Cat Snake (Telescopus fallax). There are 201 bird species in the Rupite area, including various Mediterranean species, which can rarely be seen in other places in our country. Via Aristotelis passes through this area. This is one of the two basic bird migration routes through the territory of the country. In the region visitors can see species, such as the Large Olive Warbler (Нippolais Olivetorum), White-headed Shrike (Lanius nubicus) and Black-headed Shrike (Lanius minor). During the migration and the wintering period here stays the globally endangered species Small Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmaeus).The remains of an ancient town, existing within the period from 4th century BC to the 6th century AD are located along the south slopes and at the foot of the volcanic hill Kozhuh. According to explorers, this was the main town of the Thracian tribe Sints - Heraclea Sintica.The memorial temple “St. Petka of Bulgaria”, built in 1994 is situated in the locality of Rupite. The locality is mostly famous as a place related to the prophet Vanga, and by this it attracts thousands of worshippers and tourists. Vangeliya Gushterova (1911 - 1996), is the full name of the prophet, was famous around the whole world with her multiple prophecies which had come true. According to a legend, Vanga lost her sight in her early childhood years in a storm, but during the accident she had a vision, which gave her the unique abilities. In the last years of her life, Vanga lived in a small house in the Rupite, because according to her relatives she considered the area an energy source and collected her powers from it. The church was built by <b>monetary</b> <b>means,</b> provided by Vanga, and it is interesting because of its wall paintings. They were made by the famous Bulgarian artist Svetlin Rusev and they are quite realistic, which differentiates them from the Orthodox canon. Despite the fact that the temple was not built according to the rules of the Orthodox church, it attracts thousands of worshippers and tourists because of its connection with Grandmother Vanga.|$|E

Employees have {{the legal right}} to initiate an OSHA inspection predicated on occupational hazards. The study employed a survey research design utilizing data from OSHA?s IMIS. The sample consisted of 304 programmed inspections and 285 employee-initiated complaint inspections in the state of Wisconsin for the period of June 23, 2006 to June 23, 2007, inclusive. Five independent variables were examined: 1) type of inspection, 2) establishment union status, 3) establishment size, 4) type of complaint inspection, and 5) the establishment SIC code. Six dependent variables were examined: 1) mean number of violations per inspection, 2) <b>mean</b> <b>monetary</b> penalty per violation, 3) <b>mean</b> <b>monetary</b> penalty per inspection, 4) mean number of hours spent on inspection activities, 5) <b>mean</b> percent <b>monetary</b> penalty reduction, and 6) mean percent informal conference participation. It was hypothesized that there would be significant differences between each level of each independent variable with reference to each dependent variable. It was found that the mean informal conference participation percentage was significantly higher for programmed inspections (87. 8 %) than for employee-initiated complaint inspections (80. 8 %). It was found that the mean number of hours spent on inspection activities was significantly higher at unionized establishments (39. 3 hours) than non-unionized establishments (29. 4 hours). It was found that small establishments (less than 100 employees) had a significantly higher mean number of violations per inspection (6. 5 violations) and significantly lower <b>mean</b> <b>monetary</b> penalties per violation ix ($ 302. 53) than medium-sized establishments (between 100 and 500 employees) [2. 7 violations and $ 578. 59, respectively] and large establishments (more than 500 employees) [2. 0 violations and $ 527. 13, respectively] and that large establishments had significantly lower <b>mean</b> percent <b>monetary</b> penalty reductions (47. 3 %) than small establishments (34. 8 %). It was found that the mean number of violations per inspection was significantly higher for employee-initiated health-complaint inspections (4. 8 violations) than for employee-initiated safety-complaint inspections (3. 5 violations), that the <b>mean</b> <b>monetary</b> penalty per violation was significantly higher for employee-initiated safety-complaint inspections ($ 568. 64) than for employee-initiated health-complaint inspections ($ 278. 23), and that the mean number of hours spent on inspection activities was significantly higher for employee-initiated health-complaint inspections (37. 5 hours) than for employee-initiated safety-complaint inspections (27. 8 hours).
