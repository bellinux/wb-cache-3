40|$|In this paper, multi-group <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross-section</b> {{uncertainties}} are propagated {{through the}} DRAGON (Version 4. 05) lattice code {{in order to}} perform uncertainty analysis on k(infinity) and 2 -group homogenized macroscopic cross-sections. The test case corresponds to a 17 x 17 PWR fuel assembly segment without poison at full power conditions. A statistical methodology is employed for such purposes, where cross-sections of certain isotopes of various elements belonging to the 172 groups DRAGLIB library format, are considered as normal random variables. This library was based on JENDL- 4 data, because JENDL- 4 contains {{a large amount of}} isotopic covariance matrices among the different major nuclear data libraries. Thus, multi-group uncertainty was computed for the different isotopic reactions by means of ERRORRJ. The preferred sampling strategy for the current study corresponds to the quasi-random Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). This technique allows a much better coverage of the input uncertainties than simple random sampling (SRS) because it densely stratifies across the range of each input probability distribution. In order to prove this, the uncertain input space was re-sampled 10 times, and it is shown that the variability of the replicated mean of the different k(infinity) samples is much less for the LHS case, than for the SRS case. The uncertainty assessment of the output space should be based on the theory of non-parametric multivariate tolerance limits, {{due to the fact that}} k(infinity) and some of the macroscopic cross-sections are correlated. Therefore, for 10 replicated samples each containing 100 elements, the total output sample is composed by 1000 calculations. This sample size is more than enough to infer that the multivariate output population is covered 95 % with a 95 % of confidence. On the other hand, statistical sensitivity analysis was performed in order to know which <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross-section</b> has the greatest impact on k(infinity) predictions. It was found that the fission cross-section of Uranium 235 is the dominant input parameter for this particular case, because the computed JENDL- 4 variances for such reaction are very high at thermal and resonant regions compared to other variances that for instance, can be computed based on other nuclear libraries such as ENDF/B-VII. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{striated}} muscle, {{the basic}} contractile unit is the sarcomere, which comprises myosin-rich thick filaments intercalated with thin filaments made of actin, tropomyosin and troponin. Troponin {{is required to}} regulate Ca 2 +-dependent contraction, and mutant forms of troponins are associated with muscle diseases. We have disrupted several genes simultaneously in zebrafish embryos and have followed the progression of muscle degeneration {{in the absence of}} troponin. Complete loss of troponin T activity leads to loss of sarcomere structure, in part owing to the destructive nature of deregulated actin–myosin activity. When troponin T and myosin activity are simultaneously disrupted, immature sarcomeres are rescued. However, tropomyosin fails to localise to sarcomeres, and intercalating thin filaments are missing from electron <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> indicating that loss of troponin T affects thin filament composition. If troponin activity is only partially disrupted, myofibrils are formed but eventually disintegrate owing to deregulated actin–myosin activity. We conclude that the troponin complex has at least two distinct activities: regulation of actin–myosin activity and, independently, a role in the proper assembly of thin filaments.

MA-XRF scanning proved to be significantly useful in the study of still life paintings. By presenting compositional information from the entire painted surface in a visual manner, the element distribution images could comprehend a large part of methods and materials used by De Heem, reveal changes in the painting process, visualize the condition of the art works and conservation treatments, and gain profound insights into how the paintings were constructed. With MA-XRF scanning, it was possible to recapture unique evidence of working methods: from the application of the ground layers to the characteristic shaped underpaintings, and finally, to the addition of multiple paint layers in the working up of the paintings. This revealed De Heem’s systematic approach on how to achieve the perfect texture and luminescence for every subject. The chemical scans provided a view into the characteristic underpaintings, which he applied in an even color (usually lead white, vermilion or ochre) to mark the position of the main subjects in the composition. This is of importance since for this aspect in 17 th century paintings, cross-section analysis, XRR and IRR are often of limited use. In X-rays, some of the undermodelling paint layers are visualized. With cross-sectional analysis, the composition of the underpainting can be identified. However, MA-XRF scanning goes beyond that by characterizing the locally applied shapes to specific elements. With this improved reading of multiple layers and stages of painting, also the interrelationship of the flower still life paintings become more obvious.|$|E
40|$|The {{deterministic}} {{modeling of}} LWRs {{begins with the}} computation of energy‐collapsed and homogenized macroscopic cross‐sections {{by means of a}} lattice code. Once these parameters are functionalized {{as a function of the}} reactor state variables and discretized in space, they are used as input variables by core simulators in order to calculate the spatial distribution of the neutron flux and thus, the spatial distribution of the power. Once the power is determined, the thermal‐hydraulic variables are updated, and the process repeated until convergence. This thesis is divided in three different parts related to the possible neutronic and thermalhydraulic modeling strategies. In the first part, <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross‐section</b> uncertainties based on two modern nuclear data libraries such as JENDL‐ 4 and ENDF/B‐VII. 1 were derived in multi‐group format. These were propagated through lattice calculations in order to perform uncertainty analysis on the infinite neutron multiplication factor (, and on two‐group homogenized macroscopic cross‐sections corresponding to a PWR fuel segment. The aim is to compare the uncertainty assessment on and on the macroscopic cross‐sections when the different nuclear libraries are employed. It was found that the computed uncertainties based on JENDL‐ 4 are much higher than the computed uncertainties based on ENDF/B‐VII. 1. A sensitivity analysis showed that the multi‐group variances of the Uranium‐ 235 fission reaction based on JENDL‐ 4 are very high, being this the main reason of the observed large discrepancies in the different uncertainty assessments. In the second part of the thesis, two types of uncertainty analyses were performed on core simulations. The first one corresponds to the forward approach of input uncertainty propagation, where the input uncertain space formed by the nodal two‐group macroscopic cross sections and diffusion coefficients is sampled both with SRS and LHS. The possible ranges of variation of such an input space are based on data from a depletion calculation corresponding to the cycle 26 of the Swedish Ringhals‐ 1 BWR. The aim of this study is to compare the efficiency of the uncertainty assessment performed on the nodal thermal flux when SRS and LHS are employed. On the other hand, in the second type of uncertainty analysis presented in this chapter, discrepancies between spatial measured and calculated fluxes in Ringhals‐ 1 are used to perform an inverse uncertainty analysis on the spatial dependence of the different core parameters. This analysis is carried out using Bayesian statistics, where, for a certain cycle, the frequency distributions of macroscopic cross‐sections and diffusion coefficients at every assembly node are updated based on the error distribution of the spatial thermal flux. Emphasis was made on performing uncertainty analysis as well on the coefficients of a nodal cross‐section model. Although a very simple model was derived, the aim is to propose an uncertainty assessment based on replicated sampling techniques such as the general bootstrap method. Finally, in the third part of the thesis, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were applied to thermal‐hydraulic calculations. The objective is to show that when experimental data are available, uncertainty analysis can be used in the validation process of a BE code. Quantitative limits based on a statistical theory were computed to validate code thermal‐hydraulic features in predicting pressure drop, void fraction and critical heat flux based on the macroscopic exercises of the OECD/NRC BWR Full‐Size Fine‐Mesh Bundle Test (BFBT) benchmark.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty monolithic lithium disilicate (LS 2) crowns were constructed and loaded on bone level-type implants in a universal testing machine under quasistatic conditions according to DIN ISO 14801. Comparative analysis included a 2 × 2 format: prefabricated titanium abutments using proprietary bonding bases (group A) vs nonproprietary bonding bases (group B), and customized zirconia abutments using proprietary Straumann CARES (group C) vs nonproprietary Astra Atlantis (group D) material.

RESULTS Loaded LS 2 crowns, implants, and abutment screws in all tested specimens (groups A, B, C, and D) did not show any visible fractures. For an analysis of titanium abutments (groups A and B), stiffness and strength showed equally high stability. In contrast, proprietary and nonproprietary customized zirconia abutments exhibited statistically significant differences with a mean strength of 366 N (Astra) and 541 N (CARES) (P <. 05); as well as a mean stiffness of 884 N/mm (Astra) and 1, 751 N/mm (CARES) (P <. 05), respectively. <b>Microscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> revealed cracks in all zirconia abutments (groups C and D) below the implant shoulder.

The {{effects of}} {{different}} processing conditions (pressure, holding time and temperature) on the impregnation/consolidation quality of CF/PEKK composite were investigated using compression molding process. <b>Microscopic</b> investigation of <b>cross-sections,</b> density measurements and flexural mechanical properties {{were used to}} examine the quality of impregnation and consolidation. A qualitative model to describe the impregnation and consolidation process of this material was developed. The model predicts the variations of void content during consolidation as well as the holding time, moulding temperature and pressure required to reach full consolidation. Good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data was achieved. Optimum processing conditions can be determined based on selected void content...|$|R
40|$|Using {{classical}} density functional theory (DFT) we {{calculate the}} density profile ρ(r) and local compressibility χ(r) {{of a simple}} liquid solvent in which a pair of blocks with (<b>microscopic)</b> rectangular <b>cross-section</b> are immersed. We consider blocks that are solvophobic, solvophilic and also ones that have both solvophobic and solvophilic patches. Large values of χ(r) correspond to regions in space where the liquid density is fluctuating most strongly. We seek to elucidate how enhanced density fluctuations correlate with the solvent mediated force between the blocks, as {{the distance between the}} blocks and the chemical potential of the liquid reservoir vary. For sufficiently solvophobic blocks, at small block separations and small deviations from bulk gas-liquid coexistence, we observe a strongly attractive (near constant) force, stemming from capillary evaporation to form a low density gas-like intrusion between the blocks. The accompanying χ(r) exhibits structure which reflects the incipient gas-liquid interfaces that develop. We argue that our model system provides a means to understanding the basic physics of solvent mediated interactions between nanostructures, and between objects such as proteins in water, that possess hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches.

30|$|Research {{reports on}} the murals of the Qing dynasty are {{significantly}} fewer than for earlier dynasties. Furthermore, an overwhelming amount of related literature {{is focused on the}} content or art value [1, 2], compared with that, limited analyses of the materials and techniques have been reported. In order to understand the painting techniques and materials, the paint layer samples were examined and analyzed by polarized light microscopy, <b>microscopic</b> examination on <b>cross-sections,</b> x-ray fluorescence, x-ray diffraction, micro-Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and SEM-EDX. It {{is the first time that}} the comprehensive analyses have been carried out on the murals of the Five Northern Provinces’ Assembly Hall. Study on the materials is not only useful to understand the technique of folk wall painting in the Qing dynasty, but also crucial for subsequent conservation on the murals.|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{assessment}} of the total breakup proton-emission cross sections measured for 56 MeV deuteron interaction with target nuclei from $^{ 12 }$C to $^{ 209 }$Bi, with an empirical parametrization and recently calculated microscopic neutron-removal cross sections has been done {{at the same time}} with similar data measured at 15, 25. 5, 70, and 80 MeV. Comparable mass dependances of the elastic-breakup (EB) cross sections provided by the empirical parametrization and the microscopic results have been also found at the deuteron energy of 56 MeV, while the {{assessment of}} absolute-values variance up to a factor of two has been not possible {{due to the lack of}} EB measurements at energies higher than 25. 5 MeV. While the similarities represent an additional validation of the <b>microscopic</b> calculations, the <b>cross-section</b> difference should be considered within the objectives of further measurements.
