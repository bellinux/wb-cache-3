25|$|The <b>major</b> <b>defect</b> {{in silver}} halides is the Frenkel defect, where silver ions are located interstitially (Agi+) in high {{concentration}} with their corresponding negatively charged silver-ion vacancies (Agv−). What is unique about AgBr Frenkel pairs {{is that the}} interstitial Agi+ are exceptionally mobile, and that its concentration in the layer below the grain surface (called the space-charge layer) far exceeds that of the intrinsic bulk. The formation energy of the Frenkel pair is low at 1.16 eV, and the migration activation energy is unusually low at 0.05 eV (compare to NaCl: 2.18 eV {{for the formation of}} a Schottky pair and 0.75 eV for cationic migration). These low energies result in large defect concentrations, which can reach near 1% near the melting point.|$|E

50|$|A <b>major</b> <b>defect</b> {{in the war}} {{was that}} the gun's {{cartridges}} still used gunpowder as a propellant, although smokeless cordite had been introduced in 1892.

50|$|Conservation {{breeding}} {{groups of}} some of the rarest cattle have been maintained by the Cobthorn Trust since 1976, including Irish Moiled and Gloucester. Longhorn and Highland cattle have also been bred at the farm. The trust has been a centre of research into the breeding and genetics of Dexter cattle worldwide. The genetic nature of a <b>major</b> <b>defect</b> in the breed was established in a breeding programme at Cobthorn and has been instrumental in isolating the gene concerned. Studies have shown there to be very few purebred Dexters and a small group of these purebreds is kept by the trust. The trust's database on Dexters is highly detailed and a project to examine the genetic history of the breed is being undertaken in collaboration with Cardiff University.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} whether major levator ani muscle defects {{were associated with}} differences in postoperative vaginal support after primary surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). MethodsA retrospective chart review of a subgroup of patients in the Organ Prolapse and Levator (OPAL) study. Of the 247 women recruited into OPAL, 107 underwent surgery for prolapse and were the cohort for the present analysis. <b>Major</b> levator ani <b>defects</b> were diagnosed when more than 50 % of the pubovisceral muscle was missing on MRI. Postoperative vaginal support was assessed via POPâ quantification system. Postoperative anatomic outcome was analyzed according to levator ani defect status, as determined by MRI. ResultsSupport of the anterior vaginal wall 2 cm above the hymen occurred among 62 % of women with normal levator ani muscles/minor defects and 35 % of those with <b>major</b> <b>defects.</b> Support of the anterior wall 1 cm above the hymen occurred among 32 % women with normal muscles /minor defects and 59 % of those with <b>major</b> <b>defects.</b> Levator ani defects were not associated with differences in postoperative apical/posterior vaginal support. ConclusionSix weeks after primary surgery for prolapse, women with normal levator ani muscles/minor defects had better anterior vaginal support than those with <b>major</b> levator <b>defects...</b>|$|R
