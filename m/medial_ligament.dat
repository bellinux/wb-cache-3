5|$|It {{was a brief}} stint back in {{the playing}} squad, with Barton banned for six matches, with a further {{suspended}} six-match ban, for his assault on Dabo. After serving his ban, he played 75minutes in a reserve match and {{said he wanted to}} transform his image to become a role model, before he returned to action in the Tyne–Wear derby on 25 October. He was booed by Sunderland fans and had missiles thrown at him as he warmed up, as Newcastle lost 2–1. Without him, Newcastle had not recorded a league victory since the second match of the season, but Barton scored a penalty in his second match back to lift the club out of the relegation zone. The suspended six-match ban was nearly brought into action when Barton appeared to flick Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor in the club's next match, but the FA decided not to punish Barton. However, further allegations that Barton had made a racist remark to Agbonlahor were cause enough for the FA to reconsider this decision. The remarks remain unfounded and 'professional lip-readers' claimed he said nothing racist. In Newcastle's 2–2 draw with Wigan on 15 November 2008, Barton was injured after a tackle from Lee Cattermole. It was later confirmed that Barton would be out for two months with a <b>medial</b> <b>ligament</b> injury. Returning to the first team at the end of January, he played only twice before again breaking his metatarsal, during a 2–1 defeat to his old club Manchester City.|$|E

25|$|Bartel {{would only}} play 11 out of 23 {{games in the}} 2015 AFL Season, due to an injury {{sustained}} in round 3 against Gold Coast. Bartel went off in the 1st quarter and was later revealed to have a torn <b>medial</b> <b>ligament</b> in his left knee; Bartel was sidelined for three months {{this is the first}} time in Bartel’s career that he had been sidelined by a serious injury. Bartel returned in round 15 having a career best game picking up 41 possessions in a heavy defeat to North Melbourne. Bartel would go on to play the final eight games of the season. Due to the Injury Bartel’s tackle count and disposal count was at an all-time low at the end of the season with only 43 tackles and 259 disposals. Geelong finished 10th and missed the finals.|$|E
25|$|With the {{addition}} of Patrick Dangerfield in the previous years' off-season, Caddy was in line to play {{more time in the}} forward 50 for Geelong in 2016. He started the season strongly, kicking three goals and recording 21 disposals and seven clearances in the club's round 1 win over Hawthorn. Caddy suffered a <b>medial</b> <b>ligament</b> strain in Geelong's round 13 match with the Western Bulldogs. He had played in each of the club's matches to that point, but was forced to sit-out nearly two months of senior football {{as a result of the}} injury. He returned to the side in round 20, kicking 2 goals and gathering 19 disposals in the process. Caddy played in his first career finals win in September 2016, in a qualifying final against Hawthorn. He finished the season having played 18 matches and kicking a career best 21 goals. He was eighth at the club for disposals per game, seventh for total tackles and sixth for goals scored in season 2016. Caddy was one of just ten players in the competition to record averages of 20 or more disposals and one goal per game on a minimum of five games played that season.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} game of the 2006-07 Guinness Premiership season against Worcester Warriors on Friday, 8 September, Wilkinson was helped from the pitch after 47minutes {{with a knee injury}} {{incurred}} when one of his team members fell on him after he was tackled. A scan confirmed that he had torn the <b>medial</b> <b>ligament</b> of his right knee. He returned to play a full 80minutes in the 26–21 win against leaders Bristol on Friday, 3 November, kicking a conversion, a drop-goal and two penalties. It was reported on 9 November that Wilkinson suffered a lacerated kidney during the match. He returned from this injury in the Premiership game against Leicester Tigers on 27 January 2007, coming off the bench after 37 minutes. On 29 January 2007, Wilkinson was selected at fly-half in the starting line up for England in their 2007 Six Nations Championship opener against Scotland. England comprehensively beat Scotland 42–20 to regain the Calcutta Cup, Wilkinson making an impressive return, scoring 27points with five penalties, two conversions, a drop goal, and a try. This broke the previous Calcutta Cup individual record of 24, set by Rob Andrew. Wilkinson was awarded the RBS Man of the Match as adjudicated by BBC commentator, Brian Moore.|$|E

500|$|Wetherall kept off {{his injury}} {{problems}} and {{played in the}} first 15 games of the 2003–04 season, but was ruled out for two months after suffering <b>medial</b> <b>ligament</b> damage, following a knee injury sustained during the club's 1–0 defeat to Watford. He returned on 28 December 2003 in a 1–0 victory which gave Bradford their first win in six games. His return to the defence added a second successive clean sheet. The revival in form was short-lived and despite Wetherall missing just one more game, when he sustained a calf injury, Bradford were threatened with another relegation.

500|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} victory since early September 2014 after winning 1–0 away against Cheltenham Town, De Girolamo scoring from a Coulson {{pass in the}} 43rd minute. De Girolamo was recalled early from his loan spell by Sheffield United as they wanted him for their two upcoming cup fixtures, after he had scored three times in four York matches. Bournemouth's Guadeloupe international defender Stéphane Zubar joined on loan until 4 January 2015, with Parslow being loaned back to Grimsby until the same date. York drew 1–1 {{at home with their}} divisional rivals AFC Wimbledon {{in the first round of}} the FA Cup; Hyde gave York the lead in the eighth minute after scoring from Coulson's low cross, before Andy Frampton equalised for the away team on 22 minutes. Burton was ruled out for two to three months with a <b>medial</b> <b>ligament</b> injury suffered in this match, resulting in his loan at the club being curtailed. York signed 19-year-old Middlesbrough defender Brad Halliday on a one-month loan as cover and competition for McCoy. Fellow strugglers Oxford United won 1–0 at York, James Roberts scoring from threeyards after Danny Hylton flicked on a Brian Howard corner in the 35th minute, and Wilcox surmised the result saying [...] "The lads are working as hard as they possibly can but I'm just looking for a little bit more now".|$|E
500|$|In the 2010–11 season, Valbuena was {{inserted}} {{as a starter}} by Deschamps {{for the start of}} the campaign despite the arrivals of wingers Loïc Rémy and André Ayew. Valbuena was also hampered by the constant media inquiries about what happened at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, on which he has refused to comment, stating [...] "I was a [...] in the France team, I will not allow myself to discuss the events" [...] and that he was [...] "trying to forget" [...] the incident. Valbuena scored his first goal of the season on 12 September 2010 in a 2–2 draw with Monaco. On 23 November, he scored the opening goal in the team's 3–0 win over Russian club FC Spartak Moscow in the Champions League. The victory resulted in Marseille qualifying for the knockout portion of the competition for the first time since 2000. Four days later, Valbuena scored the third goal in the team's 4–0 win over Montpellier. On 22 January, Valbuena suffered a <b>medial</b> <b>ligament</b> sprain in his left knee as a result of a tackle from Ayew during a training session. He was, initially, ruled out for up to six weeks, but returned to training ahead of the team's Champions League match against English club Manchester United on 22 February. Valbuena made his return to the team in the second leg at Old Trafford appearing as a second-half substitute. Marseille were defeated 2–1 away, which resulted in the club losing on aggregate by the same scoreline.|$|E

40|$|It was {{studied the}} {{arrangement}} of the collagen fibrils of the <b>medial</b> collateral <b>ligament</b> of the canine elbow joint and evaluated its diameter, when it was isolated or associated to the oblique ligament and loaded in tension until failure. Eighteen joints were divided in three groups. The first group had the <b>medial</b> collateral <b>ligament</b> collected and not loaded, the second group had the <b>medial</b> collateral <b>ligament</b> tested separately and the third group had both <b>ligaments</b> associately tested. <b>Medial</b> collateral <b>ligament</b> not submitted to strain presented a wavy and reticular pattern of the collagen fibers, which was not totally destroyed when it was loaded associated to the oblique ligament, and totally loses the reticular pattern when stretched separately. When the <b>medial</b> collateral <b>ligament</b> was loaded in tension separately, the mean collagen fibrils diameter increased in relation to the group not submitted to the tensile strain. Associated to the oblique ligament, the mean collagen fibrils diameter was the largest in the insertion area and the smallest in the mid-substance, in relation to the other groups.
