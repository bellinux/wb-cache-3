25|$|A 2017 review {{concluded}} that while both <b>myo-inositol</b> and D-chiro-inositols may regulate menstrual cycles and improve ovulation, {{there is a}} lack of evidence regarding effects on the probability of pregnancy. A 2012 and 2017 review have found <b>myo-inositol</b> supplementation appears to be effective in improving several of the hormonal disturbances of PCOS. A 2011 review found not enough evidence to conclude any beneficial effect from D-chiro-inositol. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture.|$|E
25|$|A single {{randomized}} controlled trial found that sumatriptan {{may help prevent}} altitude sickness. Despite their popularity, antioxidant treatments have not {{been found to be}} effective medications for prevention of AMS. Interest in phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil has been limited by the possibility that these drugs might worsen the headache of mountain sickness. A promising possible preventive for altitude sickness is <b>myo-inositol</b> trispyrophosphate (ITPP), which increases the amount of oxygen released by hemoglobin.|$|E

2500|$|The optimum {{temperature}} for growth of Sporobolomyces salmonicolor is between , being the highest tolerable temperature. Growth {{does not occur}} at [...] This species does not undergo fermentation. Additionally, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor shows positive urease activity and a positive staining response when stained with diazonium blue B. Diazonium blue B is a technique used to classify asexual yeasts {{as members of the}} Zygomycota, Basidiomycota or Ascomycota. The major ubiquinone present is Q-10. The cell wall of S.salmonicolor contains fucose, mannose, glucose and galactose, however xylose is absent. Colonies grow in the presence of glucose, sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, ,-trehalose, melezitose, D-arabinose, ethanol, glycerol, D-mannitol, D-glucitol, D-gluconate, succinate, nitrate and urease. This species does not assimilate <b>myo-inositol</b> or D-glucuronate, and do not form extracellular starch-like compounds.|$|E

The other possible isomers are -chiro-, allo-, epi-, and cis-inositol. As their name denotes, the two chiro inositols are the only pair of inositol enantiomers, but they are enantiomers of each other, not of <b>myo-inositol.</b>|$|E

5000|$|MIOX {{can accept}} D-myo-inositol {{as well as}} the less {{abundant}} chiro isomer of inositol as substrates. A series of crystallization, spectroscopy and density functional theory experiments have revealed a putative mechanism (shown right) for the oxidation of <b>myo-inositol.</b> ENDOR spectroscopy was used to determine that the substrate directly binds to the Fe(II)/Fe(III) di-iron center of MIOX most likely through the O1 atom of <b>myo-inositol.</b> [...] In the mouse MIOX, this binding process was shown to be dependent on proximal amino acid residues as alanine mutants D85A and K127A were unable to turnover substrate. This binding step positions the <b>myo-inositol</b> prior to the catalytic steps which involve attack of an iron center by diatomic oxygen followed by abstraction of a <b>myo-inositol</b> hydrogen atom.|$|E
