40|$|The History of the Growth of the <b>Mobil</b> <b>Home</b> Industry in Wisconsin is {{a seminar}} as a partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for a masters degree at Wisconsin State University at LaCrosse. The manufacture of mobile homes in Wisconsin has a short history of just over twenty years. The growth of the industry in the state has been substantial and by all indications the future appears bright. Although, Wisconsin is not among the leading producers in the country, it's production and sales growth have compared favorably with those in other states. State manufactures and dealers have experienced few problems, {{with the exception of}} image and organization. These problems, however, are minor and are slowly being remedied. This is the first written history of the mobile home industry in Wisconsin. Some facts about Elmer W. Frey, a major contributor to this paper, have been printed in the Marshfield News-Herald, but they do not include most of the information covered in the succeeding pages...|$|E
40|$|The City of Portsmouth (City) {{is located}} in Rockingham County {{at the mouth of}} the Piscataqua River in the seacoast area of New Hampshire. The City of Portsmouth’s {{sewerage}} system consists of approximately 115 miles of sewers (excluding the Pease International Tradeport), 19 pumping stations, and a 4. 8 million gallon per day (mgd) primary wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) located on Peirce Island. The City has an inter-municipal agreement with the Town of New Castle, an island to the northeast of Portsmouth, to treat their wastewater at the City’s Peirce Island WWTF. Additionally, the City has entered into a long-term Municipal Services Agreement (MSA) with the Pease Development Authority (PDA) to maintain and operate the wastewater collection and treatment facilities at the Pease International Tradeport (Pease), the former Pease Air Force Base, and has other agreements with Rye, New Hampshire on behalf of Adams <b>Mobil</b> <b>Home</b> Park and with a private entity located in Greenland, New Hampshire. The Pease facilities include approximately 15 miles of sewers, one pumping station, and a secondary WWTF. The purpose of this project was to extend the city sewer to the Pleasant Point area which is adjacent to the Back Channel area of the Piscataqua River. Seventeen homes in the area were using septic systems to treat wastewater. Several of these septic systems were failing and several more were near failing and contributing to water quality problems. The project included the installation of a low pressure sewer in the Pleasant Point area connecting to an existing gravity sewer on New Castle Avenue. Homeowners are responsible for tying into the sewer services at the edge of their property line. This project helps implement the NHEP Action Plan WQ- 7 related to the elimination of failing septic systems. In addition, this project was identified as an MS 4 Permittee Action Item in the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Study for Bacteria in Little Harbor, New Hampshire. This project was funded in part by a grant from the New Hampshire Estuaries Project, a State Revolving Fund loan, Sewer system revenues and private participation...|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Exxon <b>Mobil</b> began {{purchasing}} <b>homes</b> in the Wooster area. The Wooster area and many residences had adjoining property {{with the oil}} refinery's property. The oil company purchased the homes to make a protective greenbelt {{around the perimeter of}} the plant. While residents were not forced to move, most have taken the buyout. Very few houses remain in the area today.|$|R
