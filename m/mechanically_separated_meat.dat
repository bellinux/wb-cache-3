No presence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp. or coagulase-positive Staphylococcus was detected; however, the psychrotrophic count in pasteurized sausages exceeded the limits allowed for consumption. pH and lipid oxidation speed (TBARS) values were reduced when vacuum packaging was used. Volatile nitrogenous bases remained virtually constant during the storage period, and higher values were observed in smoked products.

30|$|It {{was found}} that W-MR had marked {{decrease}} in lipids and phospholipids, compared with mince. CaCl 2 and citric acid used for membrane removal might disconnect the linkage between membranes and cytoskeleton protein, which linked together via electrostatic interaction. Ca 2 + as well as citric acid might interact with those components, especially the phospholipids membrane, thereby providing the charge or polarity to those components. As a consequence, {{they were more likely}} soluble in the aqueous phase. As a result, the releases of the phospholipid membranes from attached cytoskeletal were facilitated due to the loosened structure. In addition, Ca 2 + could interact with the polar head of phospholipid to form a calcium-phospholipid complex. In addition, citric acid might play a role as a binding agent for the basic amino acid residues of cytoskeletal proteins, thereby competing with the acidic phospholipids of membranes (Hrynets et al.

A indústria de carnes tem buscado exaustivamente produtos de qualidade, característica relacionada principalmente ao equilíbrio da composição. Com isso, o interesse pelo desenvolvimento de produtos a base de carne de frango tem crescido devido ao seu elevado valor nutricional, disponibilidade, preço, bem como às suas características de emulsificação. Os componentes químicos básicos de formação de emulsão (proteína, gordura e umidade) e ingredientes foram avaliados quanto à qualidade na formulação de mortadela de frango. Neste sentido, este trabalho tem como objetivo avaliar estes componentes sobre as características físico-químicas de mortadela de frango. Os efeitos dos níveis de proteína (12 - 16 %), gordura (19 - 30 %) e umidade (54 - 65 %) sobre as perdas no cozimento, textura e microestrutura de mortadela de frango foram estudados. Foram elaboradas nove formulações utilizando um planejamento de misturas, sendo que as variáveis proteína, gordura e umidade tiveram efeito significativo sobre as perdas no cozimento e perfil de textura das mortadelas de frango (p Abstract : The meat {{industry}} has been extensively seeking quality products, a feature related mainly to the balance of their composition. Therefore, the interest {{in the development of}} chicken meat products has grown due to its high nutritional value, availability, price, as well as to its emulsification characteristics. The basic chemical components of emulsion formation (protein, fat and moisture) and ingredients have been analyzed as to the quality in the formulation of chicken sausage. In this sense, this study aims to evaluate such components on the physical and chemical characteristics of chicken mortadella. The effects of protein levels (12 - 16 %), fat (19 - 30 %) and moisture (54 - 65 %) over the losses during cooking, texture and microstructure of chicken mortadella were studied. Nine formulations were created using a plan of mixtures, in which protein, fat and moisture variables had significant effect on the losses during cooking and texture profile of chicken mortadella (p < 0. 05). In the region of lower stability, higher losses were observed due to cooking, with values varying between 5. 90 %± 0. 67 and 9. 78 %± 0. 10; according to microscopy, the formation of bigger fat globules was observed. In the region of greater stability, reduced losses were observed in cooking with values between 2. 50 % ± 0. 29 and 4. 28 % ± 0. 55, for compositions of high protein content and less moisture content. The homogeneity and distribution of fat globules were attributed to a protein content suitable to emulsify the amount of added fat, resulting in greater emulsion stability. To the selection of a base formulation (protein: 12 %, fat: 26. 5 % and moisture: 61. 5 %) different ingredients were added, and their effects assessed. Part of the protein content of chicken breast and fat were replaced, in the formulation, by the following ingredients: <b>mechanically</b> <b>separated</b> chicken <b>meat</b> (10 - 40 %), soy protein concentrate (1 - 4 %), cassava starch (1 - 4) and sodium tripolyphosphate (0. 5 g/ 100 g of mixture). The addition of <b>mechanically</b> <b>separated</b> chicken <b>meat</b> (MSC) had influence above 10 %, and larger quantities (up to 40 %) did not change significantly the losses in cooking and the texture profile of chicken mortadella; a pH increase was observed. The concentration of soy protein concentrate (3 - 4 %) proved to be effective in reducing losses during cooking and keeping the firmness and chewiness of the product. Cassava starch (CS) in concentrations between 1 % and 4 % considerably reduced losses during cooking, slightly changing the pH and texture parameters of chicken bologna, while the addition of sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) reduced losses in baking. An option of formulation has comparatively approached the reference product, Searabrand commercial chicken mortadella, especially in the chewiness parameter. Thus, this study found that understanding the contribution of the effects of each basic constituent, {{as well as of the}} main ingredients used in the production of chicken mortadella, are essential to the development of better products, as well as in the solution of problems within the industry...|$|R

40|$|Background. More {{and more}} poultry is {{intended}} {{for the production of}} boneless culinary meat both in Poland and other EU countries. The method in which meat is prepared causes inaccurate deboning, leaving a relatively meaningful amount of muscle tissue on the skeletal system. Loss of protein, beneficial for its nutritional value, reaches the level of a few percent of the total of the obtained meat mass. Thus, the issue of <b>mechanically</b> <b>separated</b> poultry <b>meat</b> (MSPM) utilization becomes significant. However, meat mechanically deboned may deteriorate the sensory quality of the final product with respect to characteristics such as taste, odour, consistency, and colour. In this context, the work is focused on an evaluation of selected quality features of the frankfurter type sausage with varied MSPM participation obtained from poultry necks and bodies. Material and methods. The research material was a frankfurter type sausage, made from class III pork – control sample K. In the other experimental samples, 25 % and 50 % of pork was substituted by MSPM obtained from necks (Sz 25 and Sz 50) and bodies (W 25 and W 50) of broilers of the COB breed. In the experimental sausages the following were measured: chemical composition and colour L*a*b* in CIE system. Then, sensory evaluation was carried out applying a 5 -point method. The obtained results were subjected to statistical analysis. Results. On the basis of the obtained results it was stated that the basic composition of the final product changed depending upon the type and amount of MSPM introduced into the raw material composition. The introduction of MSPM into the mentioned meat products composition brought about a significant decrease in the notation of characteristics such as odour, cross-section colour, and exterior colour, measured sensorically. However, the statistical analysis of the results did not show a significant impact of a partial substitution of pork meat with mechanically deboned poultry meat on the overall desirability of the model sausages. Conclusions. A partial substitution of pork meat with mechanically deboned poultry meat from broilers’ necks and bodies is possible. MSPM content of the raw material composition higher than 25 % may negatively influence some sensory quality characteristics. No significant impact of substitution of pork meat MSPM on physical colour parameters a* and b* was noticed, independently of the type of MSPM and amount of substitution in the raw material...|$|R
