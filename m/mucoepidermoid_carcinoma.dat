40|$|The {{presenting}} {{signs and}} symptoms of laryngeal <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> mimic those of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. Hoarseness is common and some patients have hemoptysis, for-eign body sensation, dysphagia, or a neck mass. Reported lesions have varied in size from about 0. 5 - 5. 0 cm. Nothing in their gross appearance distinguishes them from squamous cell <b>carcinomas.</b> Microscopically, low-grade <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the lar-ynx resemble the same type of tumor found in other sites, and recognition is usually not too difficult. High-grade <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> may resemble poorly differentiated squamous cell car-cinomas. The behavior of these laryngeal tumors has been referred to as unpredictable. This may partly result from analyses that con-tain different numbers of high-grade adenosquamous carcinomas, which often are difficult to separate from mucoepidermoid carcino-mas. Although histological grading influences treatment, the mos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Because {{well-documented}} {{cases of}} <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> {{that are of}} minor salivary gland origin and occur {{in children and adolescents}} have rarely been reported, little information regarding their clinical features and biologic behavior is available. This case report represents a retrospective clinical analysis of five minor salivary gland <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> accessioned from a 35 -year period at the Louisiana State University School of Dentistry and combines the data with 15 well-documented cases from the English language literature. Case presentation The five <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in patients from birth to 19 [*]years of age accounted for 1. 3 % of the accessioned minor salivary gland neoplasms. There were an additional 15 well-documented cases in the literature. Combining the data for the 20 <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> resulted in a mean age of 13. 5 [*]years and a 2. 3 : 1 female-to-male ratio. Collectively, the hard palate, soft palate, and hard palate/soft palate junction accounted for 85 % of the cases. Thirty-five percent of the cases presented as a fluctuant submucosal swelling with surface color alterations. The average duration was five months, and bone involvement occurred in seven cases. A histologic grade of low to intermediate predominated (95 %). Surgical removal was the treatment in all cases. Thirteen cases had adequate follow-up of three years or more, and recurrence was documented in only one case. There were no cases of death or metastasis in this series. Conclusions In children and adolescents, <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> have a female predilection and occur most commonly on the hard or soft palate or both. A fluctuant submucosal lump with a bluish color is a helpful diagnostic clue. The histologic grades of most <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in the first and second decades of life are low and, to a lesser degree, intermediate. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice and results in a recurrence rate of less than 10 %. </p...|$|R

40|$|The gene numb encodes for {{a protein}} (Numb) {{involved}} in cell fate decisions in Drosophila, with proposed endocytic and developmental functions in mammalians. The distribution pattern of Numb in human tissues however, {{has not been}} fully characterized. We set out to explore the immunohistochemical expression of Numb in normal and neoplastic (28 adenoid cystic and 34 <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas)</b> salivary glands, and correlated the results with the clinico-pathologic features of the neoplasms. Intense Numb immunoreactivity was detected in normal ductal cells and in a subset of acinar cells. In salivary carcinomas, we detected diffuse and intense Numb immunostaining in 5 adenoid cystic and 8 <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> By contrast, the majority of adenoid cystic and mucoepidermoid cancers showed only moderate (14 and 5 cases) or focal staining (9 and 21 cases), respectively. The corresponding expression of Numb mRNA was documented in normal parotid gland and adenoid cystic carcinoma. Numb immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with the histological grade and Ki- 67 immunoreactivity of both adenoid cystic and <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> In addition, while tumor grade, stage, Ki- 67 and Numb immunoreactivity were associated with disease-free survival in univariate analysis, only Numb and Ki- 67 immunoreactivities retained independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis. These data suggest that loss of Numb is implicated in aberrant differentiation programs of salivary gland carcinomas and {{may serve as a}} prognostic indicator in patients treated for these neoplasms...|$|R

40|$|The {{biological}} features and clinical behavior of <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> are widely variable and poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate prognostic {{factors that may}} affect survival in patients with a primary diagnosis of head and neck <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> The effects of age, gender, anatomic localization, tumor size, clinical stage, histological grade, recurrence, metastasis, compromised surgical margins and treatment on clinicopathological outcomes were investigated. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyses were performed using the log rank test. A total of 16 cases were analyzed {{over a period of}} 18 years; males were 68. 7 %, with ages ranging from 13 to 83 years. The 75 % of the tumors developed in the major salivary glands, 56. 3 % in the parotid gland and they were predominantly classified as stage II 37. 5 % and low-grade lesions 37. 5 % at diagnosis. Surgical resection was performed in all patients. The follow-up period in this study ranged from 6 to 217 months. The 5 and 10 -year overall survival rates were both 85. 6 %. Disease-free survival rates were 81. 8 % (5 years) and 68. 2 % (10 years). There were statistically significant effects of tumor size (p= 0. 05), metastasis (p= 0. 04) and primary anatomic localization (p= 0. 04) on disease-free survival rates. Through a long follow-up period in present study we could highlight the relevance of primary anatomical site, tumor size and metastasis as useful prognostic factors that may affect survival in patients with a primary diagnosis of head and neck <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mena (mammalian Ena) is an actin {{regulatory}} protein involved in cell motility and adhesion. Based on its potential role in malignant transformation revealed in other organs, we analyzed the Mena expression in normal salivary glands (SG) and salivary tumors. Mena expression was determined in normal SG (n= 10) and also benign (n= 20) and malignant (n= 35) lesions of SG. For the immunohistochemical staining {{we used the}} anti-Mena antibody. All normal SG and the benign lesions (10 pleomorphic adenomas, 10 Warthin’s tumors) were Mena negative. Salivary duct carcinomas (n= 5), carcinomas in pleomorphic adenoma (n= 5), acinic cell carcinomas (n= 5), squamous cell carcinomas (n= 10) and high-grade <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (n= 2) were positive. The lymphomas (n= 5) and low-grade <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (n= 1) were Mena negative. In one case the lymphoblastic cells stained positive for Mena. Some of the endothelial cells, in the peritumoral vessels, were Mena positive. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first study in the literature about Mena expression in salivary tumors. Our study suggests that Mena protein seems {{to play a role in}} malignant transformation and its intensity is correlated with the type and grade of tumor and also with vascular invasion. Its positivity in endothelial cells may suggest its potential role in tumor angiogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Short-term {{cultures}} from 12 non-squamous cell carcinomas (NSCCs) of {{the head}} and neck were cytogenetically investigated.

Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 are the most common aberrations (11 / 40 cases); they have been detected in all types of NSCC except carcinoma in pleomorphic adenoma. Two aberrations seem to be closely associated with tumour type: t(6; 9) (q 21 - 24;p 13 - 23), which has been seen in three of 11 adenoid cystic carcinomas (in two as the sole aberration), and structural rearrangements of 8 q 12 - 13, which have been detected in three of four carcinomas in pleomorphic adenoma...|$|R

ADC values can help to differentiate between carcinomas, lymphomas, metastases, and inflammatory disorders (described in subsequent sections) [1, 9 – 12, 53, 54, 58].
