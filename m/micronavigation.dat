In both fields a focus of the debate has been the relevance (or even the presence) of a mental/internal representation in driving the course of actions of biological/artificial beings. In this paper we show that even very complex navigation tasks within maze-like environments can be carried out by an agent which needs to store just 'a handful of bytes' of internal representation about the world in which it is moving.

40|$|In many applications, Multi-Robot Systems {{are able}} to perform tasks which cannot be {{accomplished}} by a single robot.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a description of}} SAS processing algorithms, offering improvements in Fourier-based reconstruction, motion-compensation, and autofocus. Fourier-based image reconstruction is reviewed and improvements shown {{as the result of}} improved system modelling. A number of new algorithms based on the wavenumber algorithm for correcting second order effects are proposed. In addition, a new framework for describing multiple-receiver reconstruction in terms of the bistatic geometry is presented and is a useful aid to understanding. Motion-compensation techniques for allowing Fourier-based reconstruction in widebeam geometries suffering large-motion errors are discussed. A motion-compensation algorithm exploiting multiple receiver geometries is suggested and shown to provide substantial improvement in image quality. New motion compensation techniques for yaw correction using the wavenumber algorithm are discussed. A common framework for describing phase estimation is presented and techniques from a number of fields are reviewed within this framework. In addition a new proof is provided outlining the relationship between eigenvector-based autofocus phase estimation kernels and the phase-closure techniques used astronomical imaging. <b>Micronavigation</b> techniques are reviewed and extensions to the shear average single-receiver <b>micronavigation</b> technique result in a 3 - 4 fold performance improvement when operating on high-contrast images. The stripmap phase gradient autofocus (SPGA) algorithm is developed and extends spotlight SAR PGA to the wide-beam, wide-band stripmap geometries common in SAS imaging. SPGA supersedes traditional PGA-based strip map autofocus algorithms such as mPGA and PCA-the relationships between SPGA and these algorithms is discussed. SPGA's operation is verified on simulated and field-collected data where it provides significant image improvement. SPGA with phase-curvature based estimation is shown and found to perform poorly compared with phase-gradient techniques. The operation of SPGA on data collected from Sydney Harbour is shown with SPGA able to improve resolution to near the diffraction-limit. Additional analysis of practical stripmap autofocus operation in presence of under-sampling and space-invariant blurring is presented with significant comment regarding the difficulties inherent in autofocusing field-collected data. Field-collected data from trials in Sydney Harbour is presented along with associated autofocus results from a number of algorithms...|$|E

40|$|The initial {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} acute ischemic stroke (AIS) focuses on rapid recanalization, which often includes the use of endovascular therapies. Endovascular treatment depends upon <b>micronavigation</b> of catheters and devices into the cerebral vasculature, which is easier and safer with a motionless patient. Unfortunately, many stroke patients are unable to communicate and sufficiently cooperate with the procedure. Thus, general anesthesia (GA) with endotracheal intu-bation provides an attractive means of keeping the patient comfortable and motionless during a procedure that could otherwise be lengthy and uncomfortable. However, several recent retro-spective studies have shown an association between GA and poorer outcomes in comparison with conscious sedation for endovascular treatment of AIS, though prospective studies are lacking. The underlying reasons why GA might produce a worse outcome are unknown but may include hemody-namic instability and hypotension, delays in treatment, prolonged intubation with or without neuro-muscular blockade, or even neurotoxicity of the anesthetic agent itself. Currently, the choice between GA and conscious sedation should be tailored to the individual patient, {{on the basis of}} neurologic deficits, airway and hemodynamic status, and treatment plan.

40|$|International audienceThe use {{of phase}} {{coherence}} between two pings {{is used in}} many underwater imaging applications, in particular the <b>micronavigation</b> algorithms used in correcting receiver positions when focussing a synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) array. Recently, interest has turned to using the phase coherence between two sonar images that consist of two repeated passes over the same area in order to co-register the images and perform coherent change detection, meaning the detection of differences in two areas that causes a decorrelation between the two images. Such techniques are used in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) applications, and can detect subtle changes that are not immediately detectable by visual inspection or other traditional methods. Before computing the coherence the two images have to be accurately co-registered. Indeed remaining misregistrations after a 2 D rigid translation lead {{to a loss of}} phase coherence. This can be due to navigational disturbances or data processing defects. The problem of non-rigid and subpixel sonar image registration is achieved here in two main steps. The first step aims to estimate the displacement field from which a warping function is derived; then, the repeat-pass image is resampled using the warping function to co-register it to primary imag...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The Cramér–Rao lower bounds on the cross-track {{translation}} and rotation of a displaced phase-center antenna (DPCA) in the slant range plane between two successive pings (known as DPCA sway and yaw in what follows) are computed, assuming statistically homogeneous backscatter. These bounds are validated using experimental {{data from a}} 118 – 182 -kHz sonar, showing an accuracy {{of the order of}} 20 microns on the ping-to-ping cross-track displacements. Next, the accuracy required on the DPCA sway and yaw in order to achieve a given synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) beampattern specification, specified by the expected SAS array gain, is computed {{as a function of the}} number of pings in the SAS. Higher accuracy is required when increases to counter the accumulation of errors during the integration of the elementary ping-to-ping estimates: the standard deviation must decrease as 1 2 for the DPCA sway and 3 2 for the yaw. Finally, by combining the above results, the lower bounds on DPCA <b>micronavigation</b> accuracy are established. These bounds set an upper limit to the SAS length achievable in practice. The maximum gain in cross-range resolution achievable by a DPCA micronavigated SAS is computed as a function of the key SAS parameters. These theoretical predictions are compared with simulations and experimental results. Index Terms—Correlation, sonar navigation, synthetic aperture sonar (SAS). I...|$|E
40|$|In this Ph. D. thesis {{advanced}} {{signal processing}} techniques are addressed {{in order to}} reconstruct high-resolution seafloor imagery using synthetic aperture sonar ground- range imaging. This enables applications such as object detection, hydrography, and pipeline inspection, among others. In particular, the problems of echo-data-driven motion estimation known as <b>micronavigation,</b> and compensation of phase errors are considered. Based on the developed processing chain, a sensitivity study is conducted that points out the impact of distorted seafloor imagery on an automatic detection and classification system for target recognition. Furthermore, the framework of compressive sensing is introduced for synthetic aperture imaging to attain higher coverage rates using along-track undersampling. Synthetic aperture techniques are advantageous over conventional real aperture imaging techniques as they achieve a range-independent resolution that enables the reconstruction of high-quality sonar imagery. However, this requires an accurate knowledge of the positions of the transmitter and the receiving elements for multiple consecutive transmission and reception times. As inertial navigation systems are imprecise in tracking translational platform motion, echo-data-driven motion estimation is additionally employed to estimate the platform trajectory. For this purpose, a motion estimation processing chain for real sonar measurements is designed in this thesis, which considers height information about the seafloor. To this end, a topography estimation technique, which takes into account a continuous roll movement of the imaging platform, is developed. In order to avoid image defocus in environments with a strongly varying topography in case of nonlinear trajectories, the obtained height estimates are used during image reconstruction. This leads to significant image quality improvements, which is demonstrated on synthetic data. A comparison of real synthetic aperture sonar images then highlights the quality enhancement using the developed processing chain. Furthermore, practical methods for an unbiased estimation of platform motion are proposed. These involve a compensation technique for correcting the occurrence of biased time delay estimates due to a high ratio of carrier frequency to bandwidth as well as a broadside beamforming method that equalizes the varying time delays due to near-field scenarios and widebeam systems. In order to avoid image defocusing in the presence of residual phase errors, modifications of an existing autofocus technique are proposed to better cope with spatially varying point spread functions in stripmap synthetic aperture imaging. Additionally, a data-driven calibration method is developed so as to correctly estimate an optimal average sound speed yielding the best focused imagery in situations of a spatially varying sound-speed profile. Although data-driven motion estimation and phase error compensation techniques aim at achieving high-quality imagery of the seafloor, investigating the influence of distorted sonar imagery on automatic target recognition systems is of utmost importance for future autonomous sonar systems in order to judge their reliability. A sensitivity study is conducted that demonstrates significant performance loss in image segmentation, feature quality as well as in classification performance of a specific automatic detection and classification system. Further, an empirical relation between image degradation and performance loss of the individual stages of the automatic detection and classification system is highlighted. In order to guarantee reliable inputs for automatic target recognition, a strategy is proposed to sequentially assess the image quality of synthetic aperture sonar imagery during reconstruction, which is based on the instantaneous cross-range resolution. Increasing the coverage rate of a synthetic aperture system in the case of conventional imaging techniques is only feasible by increasing the physical array size. Alternatively, a compressive sensing framework is applied to perform aperture undersampling and, thus, offer a higher platform speed while still maintaining imaging performance. A stripmap imaging technique is developed to avoid the occurrence of azimuth image ambiguities. Synthetic data simulations then demonstrate the huge potential in data reduction, and laboratory experiments using compressive sensing further show an increase in platform speed by a factor of two. This possibly reduces the overall mission time of future synthetic aperture systems in real-life scenarios. All developed methods are applied to synthetic data as well as to real sonar measurements...|$|E
