He attempted to restore confidence in the system following the setback of the 1999 WTO ministerial conference held in Seattle. Ministers at the 2001 ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar regarded him as {{the driving force behind the}} decision to launch a new round of <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> negotiations—the ill-fated Doha Development Round. That 2001 meeting also saw the successful accession to the WTO of China and Chinese Taipei, which along with Estonia, Jordan, Georgia, Albania, Oman, Croatia, Lithuania and Moldova joined during Mr Moore's term, bringing the majority of the world's population within the rules-based trading system.

40|$|The Most-Favoured- Treatment Obligation is a {{fundamental}} principle under the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trading</b> system of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Organisation.</b> The principle requires Members to accord the same tariff and regulatory treatment given to the product of any one Member {{at the time of}} import or export of “like products” to all other Members. However, recent trends show deviation from this rule so much so that it is most often applied as an exception rather than as a general rule.

In addition, this new text: • explores the development of the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trading</b> system from the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947 to the WTO’s Hong Kong ministerial in December 2005 • examines the way in which the interaction of member states has been structured by the institution’s development • assesses the impact of institutional practices and procedures on the heightening of political tensions • and explains why WTO ministerials exhibit a propensity to collapse but why the breakdown of a meeting has so far not prevented the institution from moving forward This book will be of interest to scholars and students of international politics, economics and la...|$|R
40|$|This thesis examInes the {{strategic}} character of South Africa's regional and <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> strategies. It {{looks at the}} interplays between the domestic, regional and multilateral levels {{during the period from}} 1994 to 2004. The regional focus is on Southern Africa, looking in particular at the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Trade; and the multilateral/global backdrop is the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Organisation</b> (WTO) negotiations from Seattle to Doha 'Development' Round. The question at the core of this research is how regionalism is appropriated by state actors to respond both to domestic and global imperatives? The central question is framed around analysing the extent to which South Africa uses regional and <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> strategies to address its domestic developmental concerns and to build capacity for effective articulation at the global level. These developmental concerns encompass both social equity objectives and strategic competitive needs of domestic capital. For South Africa, the region's importance is linked to its strategic response to domestic growth challenges and exigencies linked to external forces. Drawing on the New Regionalism Approach (NRA) and Competitive Strategic Regionalism Approach as analytic frameworks, this thesis argues that South Africa uses regionalism as a strategy to address its domestic growth challenges, extend political influence in the sub-region and project power at the global level. However, due to structural disarticulation between South Africa and the region, a crucial paradox in South Africa's overall regional and <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> strategies is apparent. The thesis sets out to examine this paradox, concluding that it undermines the coherence of South Africa's post-apartheid regional and <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> strategies...|$|R

The newly created World <b>Trade</b> <b>Organisation</b> (WTO) provides an institutional framework that encompasses all the agreements and legal instruments negotiated in the UR as well as the dispute settlement procedures and provisions for the regular monitoring of policies of the member countries. The UR agreement has been widely perceived as constituting a major advance in the process of <b>multilateral</b> liberalisation of <b>trade</b> in goods and services and, when fully implemented, is expected to improve economic efficiency and welfare from the global, national and sectoral standpoints. An important feature of the UR agreement is the incorporation of new sectors like textiles and clothing within the ambit of the GATT/WTO framework. In view of the fact that the textiles and clothing industry is one of the few sectors in which developing countries enjoy a distinct comparative advantage over industrial countries, the UR agreement holds considerable significance for developing economies like Pakistan. ...|$|R

Second, imports, FDI and technology licensing contribute to intensifying competition, which can affect incentives for innovation.

This paper attempts to evaluate such a policy scenario. Its main contribution is to compare two management schemes for the European Union economy.

Our empirical results, based on a computable general equilibrium model, show huge effects on the dairy sector and reveal that the choice of a management scheme has a substantial bearing on sectoral welfare effects.

40|$|This paper {{combines}} both {{qualitative and}} quantitative economic analysis which shows that further <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization through a WTO trade round could yield significant benefits for the global economy. The qualitative analysis restates the economic case for further <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization, pointing out that trade has served {{as one of the}} engines of the global economy and that trade liberalization is a positive-sum game, whereas trade barriers generate significant welfare costs for countries which introduce them. It also highlights the role which trade liberalization can play in raising the growth prospects of the developing countries. The quantitative analysis reports results from a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. It is estimated that a 50 per cent across-the-board cut in global protection in all agricultural, industrial and services sectors coupled with a modest reduction in trade costs from a WTO agreement on trade facilitation could lead to annual welfare gains of around $ 400 billion for the world economy. In addition, a WTO agreement on competition could generate an annual welfare gain of approximately $ 85 billion. The study also refers to an independent and conservative estimate of a $ 75 billion annual windfall from a WTO agreement on investment. wto, trade liberalisation, world <b>trade</b> <b>organisation...</b>|$|R

Opening markets globally and strengthening the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Organisation</b> (WTO) as {{the bedrock of}} the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trading</b> system is therefore an economic imperative.

The Doha Declaration sets 1 January 2005 as the date for completing all but two of the negotiations. To oversee the negotiation of individual subjects, a Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) was established. The new round is ambitious insofar as it tackles some contentious issues. For instance: it seeks to phase out all forms of agricultural export subsidies and trade-distorting domestic farm support; it seeks to liberalize the entry of service-workers into foreign markets; it emphasizes the reduction or elimination of tariff peaks and escalation, especially with goods that would grant market access to developing countries; it seeks the reduction or eliminatio...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{its work}} on regionalism, the OECD Trade and Agriculture Directorate has {{completed}} {{a series of studies}} that compare rule-making provisions in regional trade agreements with those in the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Organisation</b> (e. g., in the area of services, investment and competition). This paper aims to complement existing studies, by examining legal provisions regarding "technical barriers to trade" (i. e., technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures) in selected bilateral and regional trade agreements, and their degree of similarity and convergence with the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, and with each other. The study reveals that most provisions regarding technical barriers to trade (TBT) included in bilateral and regional trade agreements converge towards the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trading</b> system. When implemented effectively, agreements seeking deeper economic integration and regulatory cooperation, in particular, can complement and strengthen the implementation the WTO Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade by setting the pace for improved regulatory practices and TBT-related infrastructure in member countries (e. g., through regional consultation fora and joint standardisation and accreditation bodies). Some caveats however remain. When overlapping agreements promote different criteria for the harmonisation of standard-related measures and when bilateral or regional initiatives are conducted in isolation from international efforts and divert attention from <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> and standards-related negotiations, new obstacles may arise both for regulators and businesses. Such constraints are further magnified for low income countries afflicted by administrative and technical capacity-related problems. To remedy these potential problems, the study proposes a number of policy recommendations. standards, technical barriers to trade, technical regulations, bilateral free <b>trade</b> agreements, <b>multilateral</b> <b>trading</b> system, mutual recognition agreement, certification, regulatory measures, testing, metrology, WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, equivalence, non-tariff barriers, regionalism, regional trade agreements, TBT, conformity assessment procedures, harmonisation, custom unions...|$|R
