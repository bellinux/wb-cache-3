Several Nature 2000 areas have been assigned in Dutch offshore waters and these are to be kept free from offshore wind farm development...|$|R

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to find out of exactly when Banan was closed. But it was presumably not until after the last stationary military units had left the town, on 2 October 1926.

50|$|In 1927 the City of Munich {{proposed}} {{to upgrade the}} airfield to primary airport. North of the Nymphenburg-Biedensteiner Canal was to become the airport, south of it was to remain the <b>military</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>area.</b> The first wooden buildings were built for the handling of passengers and freight in 1929, soon followed by a hangar. With {{the construction of a}} flight handling building the airport became a full airport in 1931. It remained in use as the Munich municipal airport until 1938, after which it was relieved by the newer and much larger Flughaven München-Riem. In its final year as an airport, it was used by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier, who tried to negotiate a peace with Adolf Hitler with the 1938 Munich Agreement.|$|E

The hall took the form of a roofed seating area that was open to the courtyard and replaced the old straw roof that had been held up by simple tree trunks.|$|R
50|$|One {{threat to}} the species is habitat {{degradation}} caused by feral pigs. Some individuals of this species are protected from pig damage by fences put up by the US Army. These enclosures also protect the plant from rats. The plant grows in moist forest that becomes dry in the dry season and is prone to fire, more so when there are <b>military</b> <b>exercises</b> in the <b>area,</b> and the plant does not tolerate fire. There is also an invasion by non-native plants such as Koster's curse (Clidemia hirta), thimbleberry (Rubus rosifolius), and Christmas berry (Schinus terebinthifolius).|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} {{is situated in}} a relatively inaccessible and inhospitable location and has the appearance of being a lookout or a defensive structure. Despite close examination, test pitting and metal detection of the surrounds on two occasions in 2009, no sign of any human occupation or presence could be found. Possible explanations for this structure that are under consideration are: that is an Aboriginal stone arrangement, or that it was constructed by survivors from the Vergulde Draeck, runaway convicts, drovers or recreational campers, or by those engaged in <b>military</b> <b>exercises</b> in the <b>area.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{area around}} the church became a {{training}} ground of {{a unit of the}} Russian 58th army stationed nearby. In 2001, the president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, accused the military personnel of profaning the monuments of the Dzheirakh district by [...] "setting up a latrine" [...] near the Tkhaba-Yerdy Church. He also said a military helicopter had destroyed an adjacent burial site. In 2007, concerns about the damage to the historical monuments due to the <b>military</b> <b>exercises</b> in the <b>area</b> was again raised by the director of the Dzheirakh-Assin reserve, M. Kodzoyev, who brought the case to the court, but without achieving any results.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} set within a {{framework}} of the revivalist Christians’ Inner Mission, and presents as a case-study their mission to conscripts stationed in <b>military</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>areas</b> and garrison towns across Sweden. The revivalists’ evangelical zeal is given special attention. This {{is in contrast to}} much of the earlier research, which worked with the secularization paradigm formulated by the founders of sociology. Conscription in the early 20 th century was regarded in various civilian and military circles as a platform for social and national integration, although these attitudes remain largely unstudied in Sweden’s case. Those engaged in missionizing the army were also drawn to this ‘School of the Nation’. The thesis shows that the motives of those involved in this home mission to soldiers were grounded in religion. However, the expansive missionary work was strengthened by the positions held by its male protagonists in the power structures of society. The mission was maintained by social contacts between an informal alliance of upper-class officers from among the mission’s military members, and by civilian missionaries from lower social classes. A decisive contextual factor for the army-mission as an educational project was that Sweden remained at peace. The civilian contribution to the mission grew as it spread more widely through the country. It is argued in this thesis that the soldiers’ homes were dominated by a discourse of domesticity. This discourse designated a place, a relationship, and a state of mind for the conscript during his free time at the military base. The missionaries were convinced that contact with the domestic and family values of civilian society should be preserved by the soldiers’ homes. The discourse of domesticity also looked ahead to the conscript’s subsequent life in civilian society: the missionaries wished to train up conscripts to be sober, moral family breadwinners...|$|R

5000|$|The U.S.-Greek Defense Industrial Cooperation Agreement, {{which was}} signed in September 8, 1983, regulates defense and {{intelligence}} relations between Greece and the United States. The agreement was most recently extended in 2015. During the Gulf War collaboration strengthened relations between Greece and the United States, as Greece sent military and medical assistance to the U.S. forces in the Gulf region. In May 1995 Greece Defence Ministry organised the [...] "NEW SPIRIT 95" [...] <b>military</b> <b>exercises</b> in the <b>area</b> of Karditsa {{as a mean to}} foster military cooperation between Greece, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and the United States. In parallel, exchange of visits between high-level political and military officials to the two countries such as that of Condoleezza Rice to Athens reinforced cooperation between Greece and the United States in the areas of fighting against terrorism and the war against drugs. Additionally the port of Thessaloniki is open to NATO exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean and Greece has been a main contributor to NATO operations in Afghanistan, including counterterrorism and counter-piracy maritime efforts. Greece and the U.S are also allies in the War of Terror and are closely cooperating in the coalition for the fight against the Islamic State, with Greece providing technical and arms support to the U.S.-led coalition in its efforts to drive out ISIL from Iraqi and Syrian territories.|$|R
