Rosen, Lim, Carrier, and Cheever (2011) examined the impact of in-class mobile phone usage during course lecture on test performance. Students responded to messages sent by researchers at even intervals throughout a 30 -min videotaped lecture (Rosen et al., 2011). Students in the high text <b>messaging</b> <b>group</b> performed worse by one letter grade on an information post-test than the low text <b>messaging</b> <b>group</b> (10.6 % lower score). However, the moderate text <b>messaging</b> <b>group</b> showed no score difference compared to the other two groups. Participants who received and sent more words in their texts performed worse on the test; however, this was moderated by elapsed time between receiving and sending a text, with longer delays resulting in better performance. Student metacognitive self-reports reflected test results. Nearly three-fourths of participants felt that receiving and sending text messages during class was disruptive to learning. Despite this, 40 % felt it was acceptable to text in class.|$|R

40|$|IntroductionRecognition and {{alleviation}} of pain {{should be}} a priority when treating ill and injured children in the Emergency Department (ED). Optimising analgesia in paediatric patients post-discharge remains a challenge. The increasing accessibility of mobile phone technology worldwide offers new opportunities to communicate with families post-discharge. This study investigates whether text message reminders improve pain management in children post-discharge from the ED. MethodThis was a prospective study of 50 children (aged 1 – 16 years) with fractures, discharged from the ED. An online automated service was used to send text messages to parents at 6 h and 30 h post-discharge. These served as reminders to administer analgesia. 25 parents received text message reminders and 25 parents received no messages. All parents were telephoned 48 hours post-discharge to ascertain the number of analgesia doses administered {{and the frequency of}} reported pain. ResultsThe mean number of analgesia doses administered to the text <b>message</b> <b>group</b> was 7. 6 vs. 4. 9 in the control group, p=< 0. 05. In the text <b>message</b> <b>group</b> 0 children complained of pain frequently or constantly vs. 5 in the control group. 100 % of parents in the text <b>message</b> <b>group</b> felt text messages were an effective reminder. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that sending text message reminders post-discharge significantly increases the number of analgesia doses administered, reduces the frequency of patients reporting pain and is an effective method of communicating with parents. With increasing accessibility of mobile phones worldwide this is a viable, cost-effective and reproducible method of optimising analgesia post-discharge from the Paediatric ED...|$|E

40|$|FDDI-Based Reconfigurable Networks [1] have an {{architecture}} that {{is suitable for}} delivering messages that have hard real-time constraints as well as certain fault-tolerance requirements. This architecture uses multiple FDDI networks to connect hosts and provides for automatic reconfiguration to maintain high network bandwidth in spite of faults. An important open problem is how resources in such networks should be managed in order to guarantee that the fault-tolerant real-time requirements of messages are met. This paper presents an efficient and practical solution to this problem. Our solution consists of off-line and on-line components. On-line management deals with run-time manipulation of messages and network resources. A <b>message</b> <b>grouping</b> approach simplifies on-line management.

The purpose of the present study was to determine if automated text messages sent daily to adolescent orthodontic patients were more effective at improving oral hygiene than those receiving weekly reminders. A double blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the effects of automated messages on oral hygiene. Subjects were recruited from patients undergoing orthodontic treatment at the Texas A&M University College of Dentistry Department of Orthodontics. They were being treated with a variety of fixed full appliances in both arches. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a once a week text <b>message</b> <b>group</b> or a daily text <b>message</b> <b>group.</b> There were 52 females and 27 males who participated in the study. The daily group had significantly greater increases in oral hygiene compliance. The daily score increases were 52 %, 19 %, and 21 % for the BI, PI, and GI. The weekly score increases were 30 %, 13 % and 14 % for the BI, PI, and GI. Adolescents who completed our survey preferred more frequent messages and found that decreasing treatment time was the most effective type of text message received.

This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of instant messaging communication to supplement medical education for medical students whilst on clinical attachment. Methods A total of 6 WhatsApp Messenger (WhatsApp Inc.) groups were created for medical students on clinical attachment. These were used to provide communication within Problem Based Learning (PBL) groups for a duration of 80 weeks. The frequency and type of communication were recorded. Students 2 ̆ 019 opinions were evaluated through a structured interview process {{at the end of the}} study period. A thematic analysis was performed on the content of the instant <b>messaging</b> <b>groups</b> and on the results of the structured interviews.
