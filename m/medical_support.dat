5|$|Burston {{remained}} DGMS {{after the}} war. In the immediate post-war period, {{he was responsible}} for the demobilisation of the Army Medical Services, and for providing <b>medical</b> <b>support</b> to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Criticism of the medical arrangements, which Burston felt might lead to the force being prematurely withdrawn, led to Burston being publicly rebuked by the Army Minister, Cyril Chambers. Burston retired as DGMS and from the Army in 1948, handing over to Kingsley Norris. He served as honorary colonel of the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps from 1952 to 1957.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{the various}} Belgian ground forces {{units in the}} United Kingdom were amalgamated into the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, more often known as the Brigade Piron after its {{commanding}} officer, Colonel Jean-Baptiste Piron.

In March 1944, an artillery battery of four 25 pounder guns operated by troops from Luxembourg {{was added to the}} brigade's artillery unit. 80 Luxembourgers were serving with the Brigade Piron by August 1944 when the Brigade landed in Normandy.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{articles}} reporting {{randomized controlled}} trials, professional <b>medical</b> writing <b>support</b> {{is associated with}} increased adherence to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). We set out to determine whether professional <b>medical</b> writing <b>support</b> was also associated with improved adherence to CONSORT for Abstracts. Methods: Using data from a previously published cross-sectional study of 463 articles reporting randomized controlled trials published between 2011 and 2014 in five top medical journals, we determined the association between professional <b>medical</b> writing <b>support</b> and CONSORT for Abstracts items using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: The mean proportion of adherence to CONSORT for Abstracts items reported was similar with and without professional <b>medical</b> writing <b>support</b> (64. 3 % vs 66. 5 %, respectively; p= 0. 30). Professional <b>medical</b> writing <b>support</b> was associated with lower adherence to reporting study setting (relative risk [RR]; 0. 40; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 23 – 0. 70), and higher adherence to disclosing harms/side effects (RR 2. 04; 95 % CI, 1. 37 – 3. 03) and funding source (RR 1. 75; 95 % CI, 1. 18 – 2. 60). Conclusions: Although professional <b>medical</b> writing <b>support</b> {{was not associated with}} increased overall adherence to CONSORT for Abstracts, important aspects were improved with professional <b>medical</b> writing <b>support,</b> including reporting of adverse events and funding source. This study identifies areas to consider for improvement...|$|R

Their mandate consisted in consolidating and training a force of 10,900 Somalis, officially to fight al Shabab forces. The SNA force would initially be trained by the AMISOM contingents. On the passing of specific UN requirements, designated SNA battalions would then participate in joint operations with AMISOM. UNSOA's support during the period comprised food supplements, shelter, fuel, water and <b>medical</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
5|$|For most of 1967 {{and early}} 1968, the {{formation}} supported the 1st Cavalry Division through Operation Pershing. This {{was a large}} scale search of areas {{under the jurisdiction of}} the US II Corps which, according to the US Army, saw 5,400 enemy killed and 2,000 captured. The division re-deployed to Camp Evans, north of Hue in the I Corps Tactical Zone, during the 1968 Tet Offensive It was involved in recapturing Quang Tri and Hue regions. After intense fighting in Hue, the division then moved to relieve US Marine Corps units besieged at the Khe Sanh combat base in Operation Pegasus through March 1968. The 1st Cavalry Division next conducted major clearing operations in the Ashau Valley from mid-April through mid-May 1968. From May until September 1968, the division participated in local pacification missions, as well as Medical outreach programs intended to offer <b>medical</b> <b>support</b> to the Vietnamese local population. During this time, the division and support command were assigned to I Corps.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide <b>medical</b> <b>support,</b> chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three <b>medical</b> <b>support</b> teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands. There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.|$|E
5|$|The unit {{assigned}} {{to destroy the}} battery was the 9th Parachute Battalion, part of the 3rd Parachute Brigade, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway. The battalion's normal complement of 600 men {{was supported by a}} section of sappers from the Royal Engineers, eight Airspeed Horsa glider loads transporting Jeeps and trailers, and stores including explosives, an anti-tank gun and flamethrowers. Three of the gliders, transporting 50 volunteers, were to carry out a coup de main landing onto the position to coincide with the ground assault. In April1944, the force was taken to Walbury Hill in Berkshire, where over seven days the Royal Engineers had built a full-scale replica of the battery, including obstacles and barbed wire fences. The following five days were spent holding briefings and getting acquainted with the layout of the battery. They carried out nine practice assaults, four of them at night. Due {{to the nature of the}} mission, the battalion was given additional <b>medical</b> <b>support</b> from No. 3 Section 224th (Parachute) Field Ambulance. Another unit that would be present during the attack but not directly involved was A Company of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion. This company was tasked to provide covering fire for the 9th Battalion's approach to and withdrawal from the battery.|$|E
