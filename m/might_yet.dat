On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there <b>might</b> <b>yet</b> be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{remarked on}} the {{different}} corporate cultures between Dynegy and Enron, and on the [...] "straight-talking" [...] personality of the CEO of Dynegy, Charles Watson. Some wondered if Enron's troubles had not simply {{been the result of}} innocent accounting errors. By November, Enron was asserting that the billion-plus [...] "one-time charges" [...] disclosed in October should in reality have been $200 million, {{with the rest of the}} amount simply corrections of dormant accounting mistakes. Many feared other [...] "mistakes" [...] and restatements <b>might</b> <b>yet</b> be revealed.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "unrestricted" [...] {{version of}} Hilbert's fifth problem, closer to Hilbert's {{original}} formulation, considers both a locally Euclidean group G and another manifold M on which G has a continuous action. Hilbert asked whether, in this case, M {{and the action}} of G could be given a real analytic structure. It was quickly realized that the answer was negative, after which attention centered on the restricted problem. However, with some additional smoothness assumptions on G and M, [...] it <b>might</b> <b>yet</b> be possible to prove {{the existence of a}} real analytic structure on the group action. The Hilbert–Smith conjecture, still unsolved, encapsulates the remaining difficulties of this case.|$|E
500|$|According to Yahoo! Music {{journalist}} Angus Batey, American Gangster used [...] "a {{selection of}} beats built from '70s soul and funk" [...] to reflects [...] "the period setting; lyrically, its primary theme is {{an investigation of}} the evolution of the gangsta archetype, looking at how the drug dealer became a semi-sympathetic outlaw figure, examining the contradictions inherent in those who chase the American Dream {{on the far side of}} legality, and ruminating on what this period of US history <b>might</b> <b>yet</b> come to mean". Although Jay-Z says American Gangster was inspired by the movie of the same name, songs such as [...] "Say Hello" [...] touch on the topics of censorship and the Jena 6 controversy.|$|E

500|$|Working for a {{compromise}} that <b>might</b> <b>yet</b> save the Union, Breckinridge opposed a proposal by Ohio's Clement Vallandigham that the border states unite to form a [...] "middle confederacy" [...] that would place a buffer between the U.S. and the seceded states, nor did Breckinridge desire to see Kentucky as the southernmost state in a northern confederacy; its position south of the Ohio River left it too vulnerable to the southern confederacy should war occur. Urging that federal troops be withdrawn from the seceded states, he insisted [...] "their presence can accomplish no good, but will certainly produce incalculable mischief". He warned that, unless Republicans made some concessions, Kentucky and the other border states would also secede.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian High Court granted full de jure {{recognition}} to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black nationalists {{who had been a}} month earlier convicted [...] of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council [...] "so far as possible", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that the court therefore faced a choice between the 1965 constitution and a legal vacuum, the latter of which he felt he could not endorse. Referring to the Privy Council's decision that the UK <b>might</b> <b>yet</b> remove the post-UDI government, he said that [...] "on the facts as they exist today, the only prediction which this court can make is that sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so".|$|E

500|$|In 1637 {{fully-fledged}} opera came to Venice {{with the}} opening of the Teatro San Cassiano. Sponsored by the wealthy Tron family, this theatre was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. The theatre's inaugural performance, on 6 March 1637, was L'Andromeda by Francesco Manelli and Benedetto Ferrari. This work was received with great enthusiasm, as was the same pair's La Maga fulminata the following year. In rapid succession three more opera houses opened in the city, as the ruling families of the Republic sought to express their wealth and status by investing in the new musical fashion. At first, Monteverdi remained aloof from these activities, perhaps on account of his age (he was over 70), or perhaps through the dignity of his office as maestro di capella at St. Mark's. Nevertheless, an unidentified contemporary, commenting on Monteverdi's silence, opined that the maestro <b>might</b> <b>yet</b> produce an opera for Venice: [...] "God willing, one of these nights he too will step onto the stage." [...] This remark proved prescient; Monteverdi's first public contribution to Venetian opera came in the 1639–40 carnival season, a revival of his L'Arianna at the Teatro San Moisè.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} post-War period {{once again}} reform {{on the agenda}} with, in particular, {{the passing of the}} Education Act 1944. The effect was dramatic: state support, through bursaries and central grants, was hugely increased; the proportion of state school entrants increased considerably; {{for the first time in}} over a hundred years, there was considerable competition over places. Stallybrass, made Vice-Chancellor of the University in 1947, was sceptical about state education. It was not the quality of the students, but rather the means of state control that worried him. Annual grants from government were made to the University, not colleges, and <b>might</b> <b>yet</b> replace endowments as Brasenose's primary source of income, making it dependent on University support and increasing [...] "federation" [...] of colleges in a University superstructure. Stallybrass worried over this loss of college autonomy, although it was matched with a doubled grant from the government and huge sums set aside for capital spending. The right of Brasenose to choose its own students might be under threat, he thought; as it happened, the Labour government decided against corporate admission and threats to Stallybrass' power mostly resided within Brasenose.|$|E
500|$|It was {{initially}} believed that Newton {{had failed to}} escape from the Boston after it ditched into the sea, and he was posted as missing. Squadron Leader Hampshire had immediately dispatched a sortie to recover the pair that were last seen swimming for shore, but no sign of them was found. Two weeks later, he wrote a letter to Newton's mother in which he described her son's courage and expressed the hope that he <b>might</b> <b>yet</b> be found alive. Hampshire concluded, [...] "Bill is one of those rare fellows I shall miss for a long time, and if it is to be, remember for an age". The details of his capture and execution were only revealed later that year in a diary found on a Japanese soldier. Newton was not specifically named, but circumstantial evidence clearly identified him, as the diary entry recorded the beheading of an Australian flight lieutenant who had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire on 18March 1943 while flying a Douglas aircraft. The Japanese observer described the prisoner as [...] "composed" [...] in the face of his impending execution, and [...] "unshaken to the last". After the decapitation, a seaman slashed open the dead man's stomach, declaring [...] "Something for the other day. Take that." ...|$|E
