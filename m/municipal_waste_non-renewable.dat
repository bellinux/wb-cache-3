The biological methods tested were: the aerobic specific oxygen uptake rate, dynamic respiration index tests, and the anaerobic biochemical methane potential test. The non-biological methods evaluated were: dry matter, loss on ignition, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, water extractable dissolved organic carbon, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, lignin and cellulose content and cellulase hydrolysis.
