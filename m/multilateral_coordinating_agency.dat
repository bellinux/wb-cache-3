The historical background and purpose of statewide <b>coordinating</b> <b>agencies</b> is also described. The question is raised as to whose viewpoint the agency really represents, the institution's or the state government's, and it is suggested that if it is not to be merely a capricious and arbitrary decision making body, it could represent the best interest of both parties. The <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency,</b> it is argued, cannot afford to be just a rubber stamp organization that merely approves every new proposal Eor an institution that is proposed by the state government and higher education. Rather, by considering each proposal on its own merit, the statewide <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> will assure each body involved that the decision it reaches will be both fair and unbiased.

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this {{research}} to examine the interactions between organizations and the work of <b>coordinating</b> <b>agencies</b> in influencing those interactions using social exchange theory. A model was developed, incorporating elements of exchange theory, and the components of that model examined in the community. Techniques of change and the outcomes of activities of the <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> were examined in an effort to develop a 2 ̆ 2 case study 2 ̆ 2 of a <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> 2 ̆ 7 s activity in the community. Historically, social services were provided in the community through informal, often familial, networks. With the urbanization of society, social services have become more formalized and specialized with a remarkable {{increase in the number of}} individual agencies. Movement from a 2 ̆ 2 growth 2 ̆ 2 to a scarcity economy and new federalism as well as concern with duplication, overlap, and gaps in services have led to an interest in the coordination of these activities. The Area Agency on Aging, considered by many to be a forerunner to the Allied Services Act, was implemented in 1973 by the federal government for the purpose of coordinating services to the elderly in the community. The goal of the Area Agency is the development of a comprehensive coordinated community service system. The activities of six such <b>coordinating</b> <b>agencies</b> as well as the social service organizations in their areas were studied to determine the explanatory value of social exchange theory. Additionally, attitudes of service providers toward various tactics for community change as well as the perceived outcomes of <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> activities were investigated. The study of the Area Agency on Aging as a <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> in the community was accomplished in two waves of data collection. The first, consisting of indepth interviews with 84 individuals in six areas, took place from May through July of 1975. The second wave involved indepth interviews and a mailed survey. Data were collected from 191 individuals in 126 agencies in three areas, urban, rural and urban/rural mixed. The data were coded and analyzed by computer to determine trends and relationships. The interview schedules were analyzed for specific cases. These objective and subjective data were used to 2 ̆ 2 reconstruct 2 ̆ 2 this study of interaction and coordination. A model, Organizational Interaction Model, was derived utilizing social exchange theory. This model contains the elements of commodities: funding, information, access to influentials, clients, staff and technology; valuing criteria: integration, status, world view, autonomy, domain and power; and arenas of exchange: planning, contracts and letters of agreement, hearings and meetings, evaluation and monitoring, and client transfers. These elements were examined, and their explanatory value for activities in the community involving organizations and <b>coordinating</b> <b>agencies</b> was determined. Change techniques, involving varying types as well as levels of intervention, were studied in terms of their perceived appropriateness by community organizations. The data suggested changes in activities of <b>coordinating</b> <b>agencies,</b> social planners, and makers of policy. Perceived outcomes of <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> activity over the past three years show positive impacts in the community generally, though individual impacts vary. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed for <b>coordinating</b> <b>agencies</b> as well as local and federal policy makers, with suggestions for future research. Social exchange theory offers rich ground for the study of community service systems and the coordination of interactions within corrrnunities...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} variables associated with an organization 2 ̆ 7 s decision {{to participate in an}} interorganizational service network. The survev of literature on the subject supported the hypothesis that structural variables of complexity, formalization, and centralization and a psychological variable, the awareness of organizational interdependency, are associated with the decision to participate. Interorganizational participation was operationally defined in terms of various behavioral components: an organization 2 ̆ 7 s involvement with the <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency,</b> client referrals to and from other organizations and to and from the <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency,</b> and information exchanged with other organizations and with the <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency.</b> Using this framework, testable hypotheses were formulated regarding the relationship between the selected measures of the independent variables of complexity, formalization, centralization, and awareness of interdependency and the dependent variable of interorganizational participation. Human service agencies which provide services to the elderly in the State of Oregon were surveyed in this study. These agencies, together with the Area Agency on Aging, a <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> established under the Older Americans Act, constituted the interorganizational service network. A main concern of that type of <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> is to facilitate effective working relationships between the organizations in such service networks. This study was designed to explore the factors associated with that process. Findings and Conclusions: The evidence presented suggests that the psychological variable of awareness of interdependency is significantly related to the decision to participate. This finding was generally supported by qualitative data gathered from six organizations examined under the case study method. For the structural variable it was found that: a) complexity was not significantly related to the decision to participate; b) centralization had a significant relationship with only some components of the measures of participation; c) there was some association between formalization and the participation processes. In general, it appears that a key step to building effective networks of service organizations is to increase awareness of interdependency among organizational members...|$|R
40|$|Coordinated, uncoordinated and {{unilateral}} {{policies to}} reduce {{carbon dioxide emissions}} by 10 % in 11 member states of the European Union (EU) by 2010 are compared with unilateral policies in each member state. The paper presents the results from four projections using a large-scale, integrated, regionalized E 3 model of the EU (not a general equilibrium model) estimated on time series, cross-section data for 1968 — 93 with international trade treated as between each member state and a European transport and distribution network. The 10 % reduction is achieved by additional excise duties incremented every year from 1999 to 2010, according to the carbon contents of fuels, with special treatment of electricity (taxed on outputs not inputs) and with revenues recycled via reductions in employers' social security contributions. <b>Multilateral</b> <b>coordinated</b> policies require a common tax rate of 156 Ecus per tonne carbon (1999 prices), which rises {{to an average of}} 162 Ecu/tonne, with a wide range between regions when policies are uncoordinated. All the tax shift projections show double dividends of emission reduction and employment gain for all member states. Unilateral policies do not show much carbon leakage and they show smaller gains for output and employment. The results are compared with those from a general equilibrium model (GEM-E 3), tackling the same topic.
