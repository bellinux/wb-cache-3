40|$|Purpose – The Hermite {{collocation}} {{method of}} discretization {{can be used}} to determine highly accurate solutions to the steady-state one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation (which {{can be used to}} model the transport of contaminants dissolved in groundwater). This accuracy is dependent upon sufficient refinement of the finite-element mesh as well as applying upstream or downstream weighting to the convective term through the determination of collocation locations which meet specified constraints. Owing to an increase in computational intensity of the application of the method of collocation associated with increases in the <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement,</b> minimal <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement</b> is sought. Very often this optimization problem is the one where the feasible region is not connected and as such requires a specialized optimization search technique. This paper aims to focus on this method. Design/methodology/approach – An original hybrid method that utilizes a specialized adaptive genetic algorithm followed by a hill-climbing approach is used to search for the optimal <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement</b> for a number of models differentiated by their velocity fields. The adaptive genetic algorithm is used to determine a <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement</b> that is close to a locally optimal <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement.</b> Following the adaptive genetic algorithm, a hill-climbing approach is used to determine a local optimal feasible <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement.</b> Findings – In all cases the optimal <b>mesh</b> <b>refinements</b> determined with this hybrid method are equally optimal to, or a significant improvement over, <b>mesh</b> <b>refinements</b> determined through direct search methods.

To this end, different modifications to the standard Berger-Oliger adaptive <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement</b> algorithm have been proposed. In this work we present a fourth order stable <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement</b> scheme with sub-cycling in time for numerical relativity. We do not use buffer zones to deal with refinement boundaries but explicitly specify boundary data for refined grids. We argue that the incompatibility of the standard <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement</b> algorithm with higher order Runge Kutta methods is a manifestation of order reduction phenomena, caused by inconsistent application of boundary data in the refined grids. Our scheme also addresses the problem of spurious reflections that are generated when propagating waves cross <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement</b> boundaries. We introduce a transition zone on refined levels within which the phase velocity of propagating modes is allowed to decelerate in order to smoothly match the phase velocity of coarser grids. We apply the method to test problems involving propagating waves and show a significant reduction in spurious reflections. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{numerical simulation}} of large scale flows, {{together with the}} detailed modeling of flooding or drying of small-scale regions, is a difficult and a challenging problem. Adaptive mesh method allows, in principle, to solve accurately those scales. However in practice, on one hand, {{the lack of a}} priori or efficient a posteriori error estimates, especially for multidimensional hyperbolic problems, make the analysis harder.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{numerical solution}} of singular perturbation problems by finite difference methods is considered. (For efficient computations of this type, refinement of the finite difference mesh is important. The technique of solution-adaptive <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement,</b> {{in which the}} mesh is refined iteratively {{by looking at the}} properties of a computed solution, can be the simplest method by which to implement a <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement.)</b> The theoretical justification of solution-adaptive <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement</b> for singularly perturbed systems of first order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is discussed. It is shown that a posteriori error estimates can be found for weighted one-sided difference approximations to systems of ODEs without turning points and to systems of ODEs with turning points that can be transformed to a typical normal form. These error estimates essentially depend only on the local meshwidths and on lower order divided differences of the computed solution, and so can be used in the implementation of solution-adaptive <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement.</b> It is pointed out, however, that not all systems with turning points fall into these categories, and solution-adaptive <b>mesh</b> <b>refinement</b> can sometimes be inadequate for the accurate resolution of solutions of these systems.
