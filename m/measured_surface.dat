5|$|On September19 and 20, Georges {{underwent}} {{a period of}} rapid intensification, in which winds increased by 45mph (85km/h) in a 24-hour span. At {{the end of this}} phase, Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) and a barometric pressure of 937mbar (hPa; 27.68inHg), just below Category 5 status. At the time of peak intensity, a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight-level winds up to 168mph (270km/h) while dropsondes <b>measured</b> <b>surface</b> winds up to 175mph (280km/h). One of the readings from a dropsonde, that was disregarded, recorded winds of 191mph (307km/h) in the lower-levels of the eyewall. This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it seemed too high and not representative of the actual intensity of Georges. The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm-force winds, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles. Around the time of peak intensity, the eye of Georges was roughly 35mi (55km) in diameter.|$|E

50|$|Dial test indicators, whose tips {{swing in}} an arc rather than {{plunging}} linearly, usually have spherical tips. This shape gives point contact, allowing for consistent measurements as the tip moves through its arc (via consistent offset distance from ball surface to center point, regardless of ball contact angle with the <b>measured</b> <b>surface).</b> Several spherical diameters are commercially offered; 1mm, 2mm, and 3mm are the standard sizes.|$|E

A main stream (2) formed with an inert liquid is led through a flow channel (1).

50|$|The jump {{method is}} {{difficult}} to execute mainly due to unaccounted vibrations entering the instrument.

In this case, the bottom cylinder is oscillated at a known frequency, while {{the frequency of the}} top cylinder is measured using a piezoelectric bimorph strain gauge.

50|$|In some cases, {{the physics}} of the {{measuring}} instrument may have a large effect on the data. This is especially true when measuring very smooth surfaces.

In this case the probe is a physical filter that limits the accuracy of the instrument.|$|E

50|$|Surface {{roughness}} often shortened to roughness, is {{a component}} of surface texture. It is quantified by the deviations {{in the direction of}} the normal vector of a real surface from its ideal form. If these deviations are large, the surface is rough; if they are small, the surface is smooth. In surface metrology, roughness is typically considered to be the high-frequency, short-wavelength component of a <b>measured</b> <b>surface.</b> However, in practice it is often necessary to know both the amplitude and frequency to ensure that a surface is fit for a purpose.|$|E
