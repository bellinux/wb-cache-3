5000|$|The use of <b>milters</b> {{has spread}} {{in recent years}} and <b>milters</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly important in mail processing on the large scale to block, verify and sort incoming mail.|$|R
5000|$|Sendmail {{supports}} {{a variety of}} mail transfer protocols, including SMTP, ESMTP, DECnet's Mail-11, HylaFax, QuickPage and UUCP. Additionally, Sendmail v8.12 [...] introduced support for <b>milters</b> - external mail filtering programs that can participate in {{each step of the}} SMTP conversation.|$|R

50|$|Mr. Mints {{was born}} in Moldova in {{the family of a}} {{military}} engineer, Iosif Samuilovich Mints (born 1932). His mother, Lusia Izrailevna <b>Milter</b> (1936-2007, Kodyma, Ukrainian SSR), worked as a librarian; as a child in 1941-1944 she was deported to the ghetto in Chechelnik in Transnistria, where 14 members of her family died. Both grandfathers - Samuil Iosifovich Mints (1892-1942) and Srul Gershkovich <b>Milter</b> (1901-1944) - perished in the Great Patriotic War.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Milter</b> (portmanteau for mail filter) is an {{extension}} to the widely used open source mail transfer agents (MTA) Sendmail and Postfix. It allows administrators to add mail filters for filtering spam or viruses in the mail-processing chain. In {{the language of the}} art, [...] "milter" [...] refers to the protocol and API implementing the service, while [...] "a milter" [...] has come to refer to a filter application that uses <b>milter</b> to provide service.|$|E
50|$|Amavis {{can receive}} mail {{messages}} from an MTA over {{one or more}} socketsof protocol familiesPF_INET (IPv4), PF_INET6 (IPv6) or PF_LOCAL (Unix domain socket),using protocols ESMTP, LMTP, or a simple private protocol AM.PDP can beused with a helper program like amavisd-milterto interface with <b>milters.</b> On the output side protocols ESMTP or LMTPcan be used to pass a message to a back-end MTA instance or to an LDA, ora message can be passed to a spawned process over a Unix pipe.When ESMTP or LMTP are used, a session can optionally be encrypted usinga TLS STARTTLS (RFC 3207) extensionto the protocol. SMTP Command Pipelining (RFC 2920) is supported inclient and server code.|$|R
50|$|Moshe {{was educated}} {{in his native}} Tomaszow. He {{finished}} Itzhak <b>Milter’s</b> primary Jewish school (kheder), which was a hot-bed for many writers and journalists who wrote their literary works in Yiddish. From 1925 to 1930 he was {{an editor of the}} local journal „Tomaszower Wokhenblat”, published in Yiddish. He was {{also a member of the}} Zionist party „Poale-Zion”. In 1930 he left his familiar town and emigrated to France. He settled down in Paris, where his elder brother Abram resided (Abram was arrested in Paris after the Nazi conquest of France and finally was sent to the concentration camp Auschwitz; he died there on 25 April 1942). In Paris Dluznowsky was a correspondent of a number of Jewish journals, e.g. „Parizer Wokhenblat”. Before the Nazi conquest of France he left for Morocco and in 1942 moved to the United States.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Milter</b> {{support was}} added to Postfix 2.3.0 {{released}} July 12, 2006. Many, but not all, milters {{can be used with}} Postfix [...] "out of the box".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Milter</b> library {{included}} with Sendmail uses POSIX threads to allow multiple concurrent filters. MIMEDefang's Perl filter uses a pre-forked process model, {{similar to the}} traditional Apache Web server multi-processing model. MIMEDefang therefore consists of three components: ...|$|E
50|$|OpenDKIM and MDaemon Messaging Server by Alt-N Technologies {{have been}} among the first {{software}} implementations of VBR. OpenDKIM provides a <b>milter</b> as well as a standalone library.Roaring Penguin Software's CanIt anti-spam filter supports VBR as of version 7.0.8 released on 2010-11-09.|$|E
50|$|In some {{countries}} the legislationdoes not permit mail filtering to discard a mail message once it hasbeen accepted by an MTA, so this rules out an after-queue filtering setupwith discarding or quarantining of messages, but leaves a possibility ofdelivering (possibly tagged) messages, or rejecting {{them in a}} before-queuesetup (SMTP proxy or <b>milter).</b>|$|E
50|$|The Sendmail Consortium {{provides}} a documented Application Programming Interface {{that can be}} used to create milters for special needs. The library provided by The Sendmail Consortium is pthread-based. However, documentation of the protocol used for communication between sendmail and <b>milter</b> processes is not provided. This internal protocol is subject to changes in new sendmail versions.|$|E
50|$|The {{infrastructure}} {{provided by}} mimedefang.pl follows the <b>Milter</b> API reasonably closely, but not exactly. It includes convenience routines for parsing and rebuilding MIME messages so that filter authors {{can concentrate on}} high-level policy rather than worry about low-level API details. This convenience comes with a small loss of flexibility and some loss of performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} {{also features}} a <b>Milter</b> interface for sendmail and on-demand scanning. It has support for Zip, RAR, Tar, Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS formats, most mail file formats, ELF executables and Portable Executable (PE) files compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor. It also supports many document formats, including Microsoft Office, HTML, Rich Text Format (RTF) and Portable Document Format (PDF).|$|E
50|$|SpamAssassin is a Perl-based {{application}} (Mail::SpamAssassin in CPAN) {{which is}} usually used to filter all incoming mail for one or several users. It can be run as a standalone application or as a subprogram of another application (such as <b>Milter,</b> SA-Exim, Exiscan, MailScanner, MIMEDefang, Amavis) or as a client (spamc) that communicates with a daemon (spamd). The client/server or embedded mode of operation has performance benefits, but under certain circumstances may introduce additional security risks.|$|E
50|$|Three topologies for {{interfacing}} with an MTA are supported. The amavisdprocess can be {{sandwiched between}} two instances of an MTA, yielding a classicalafter-queue mail filtering setup, or amavisd canbe {{used as an}} SMTP proxy filter in a before-queuefiltering setup, or the amavisd process can be consulted to provide mailclassification but not to forward a mail message by itself, in which case theconsulting client remains in charge of mail forwarding. This last approach isused in a <b>Milter</b> setup (with some limitations), or with a historical clientprogram amavisd-submit.|$|E
50|$|Various {{supporting}} {{characters from}} the previous seasons returned to reprise their recurring roles, including Albert Hall as Judge Seymore Walsh, John Michael Higgins as Steven <b>Milter,</b> and Renee Elise Goldsberry, Vatrena King and Sy Smith as the backup singers for Vonda Shepard. Jon Bon Jovi {{was added to the}} cast mid-season as Victor Morrison, Ally's new love interest, but was written out before the finale. Josh Groban returned as guest star Malcolm Wyatt. Barry Humphries, Matthew Perry and Christina Ricci all had recurring roles during the season. Elton John, Mariah Carey and Barry White appeared as performers at the bar.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of <b>milter,</b> an email filter was {{generally}} implemented as a program to which an MTA would hand the message once it has completely arrived, {{with most of the}} message's envelope information removed. That program could then analyze the header and body of the message and make a decision to accept the message (i.e. return a [...] "success" [...] status to the MTA) or reject it (i.e. return a [...] "failed" [...] status to the MTA). The MTA would then log a successful delivery or return a failure message to the sender as appropriate, and the filter would be responsible for effecting delivery of the message (to the intended inbox(es) as-is, or modified to remove unwanted content, or to specific folder(s), etc.).|$|E

40|$|Roaring Penguin Software Inc. {{started as}} a one-person {{consulting}} company in 1999. A year later, David F. Skoll, the company's President and CTO, was asked to develop an e-mail filtering tool. David developed MIMEDefang, an e-mail filter that used Sendmail's <b>Milter</b> facilities. David donated the code to the open source community, and kept developing MIMEDefang as a free tool for system administrators. Today, the MIMEDefang code is available at at the website. By 2002, {{it was obvious that}} there was a need for a packaged mail-filtering solution suitable for end-users. David decided to go ahead and write what became CanIt-PRO. Whereas MIMEDefang is suited to system administrators who are familiar with Perl and comfortable with writing their filtering policies in Perl, the CanIt product line allows end-users to control their filtering through a simple web-based interface. The company transformed itself from a consulting company to a product development company. This transformation required significant changes...|$|E

G. <b>Milter</b> (Eds.), Learning {{at the crossroads of}} theory and practice (pp. 93 - 110). Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Springer Business & Media. Lifelong learning (LLL) is a focal point of Dutch policy in relation to innovation, economic growth and social-cohesion. Prerequisite for LLL policy and implementation is knowledge of LLL participation of the working age population (18 – 64 years). Problem is that policy makers, government agencies and learning institutions only know the extent for formal LLL and not informal LLL. This contribution represents the first large-scale study of participation in barriers for and benefits of LLL in the Netherlands. It presents data from an on-line survey which yielded 520 qualified responses from the Dutch labour force. Results show that younger workers make more use of LLL than older workers and those with higher levels of formal education participate more than those with lower levels. Perceived outcomes include better job performance, keeping up with new knowledge, and better performance of new, job-related tasks. Barriers include lack of time, inconvenient time and place of LLL activities, cost of LLL activities, and a lack of employer support...|$|E
