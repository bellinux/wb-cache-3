5|$|A large {{factor in}} the {{worldwide}} occurrence of this flu was increased travel. Modern transportation systems <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for soldiers, sailors, and civilian travelers to spread the disease.|$|E
5|$|This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for {{ships to}} come {{alongside}} and reduced the amount of overhang needed for tipping.|$|E
5|$|Harrison became {{chairman}} of the Committee on Public Lands and successfully promoted passage of the Land Act of 1800, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to buy land in the Northwest Territory in smaller tracts at a low cost. The sale price for public lands was set at $2 per acre. This became an important contributor to rapid population growth of the Northwest Territory.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Easley {{bought into}} a car {{dealership}} (along with partner Rick Johnson), Alderwood Oldsmobile & Cadillac in Lynnwood Washington, (which later moved to Shoreline, Washington in 1996, {{taking advantage of a}} General Motors program that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for African-Americans and other minorities to own an auto dealership. The dealership became successful and Easley was named president of the African American Dealers Association.|$|E
5|$|Kings Cross {{came into}} the {{ownership}} of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921. The LNER made improvements to various amenities, including toilets and dressing rooms underneath what is now platform 8. The lines through the Gas Works tunnels were remodelled between 1922 and 1924 and improved signalling <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to manage {{the increasing number of}} local trains.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E
50|$|The same markets <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> {{for private}} {{entities}} to raise bonds or sell stock to fund private initiatives.|$|R

5|$|As {{promotion}} for the show, Showtime {{posted a}} preview of the pilot on their website. In September 2006, CBS and YouTube struck a strategic content and advertising partnership, and the YouTube CBS Brand Channel started including daily contributions from the Showtime network, including promotional video clips from its critically acclaimed original series, such as Dexter. On October 28, after the first few episodes had aired, Showtime <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for viewers {{to catch up with the}} show by dedicating a whole night to showing the first five episodes.|$|E
5|$|Krüper's {{nuthatch}} {{is threatened}} by urbanisation and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{passed by}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for police officers who had been off the force {{for more than a}} year to apply for reinstatement. It was expected that this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E
50|$|In 1982 a {{road was}} built that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for Bangkok {{residents}} {{to reach the}} main protected area of the mountains.|$|R
50|$|Because Ant <b>made</b> <b>it</b> trivial to {{integrate}} JUnit tests with the build process, Ant <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for willing developers to adopt test-driven development, and even Extreme Programming.|$|R
50|$|The high {{altitude}} mountains have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> {{for people in}} Karaj to use them as mountain trail for hiking and mountain climbing.|$|R
5|$|People {{identifying}} with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, {{and is often}} used to refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS {{to communicate with each other}} in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for individuals to connect.|$|E
5|$|The daric also {{improved}} {{government revenues}} as {{the introduction of}} the daric <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to collect new taxes on land, livestock and marketplaces. This led to the registration of land which was measured and then taxed. The increased government revenues helped maintain and improve existing infrastructure and helped fund irrigation projects in dry lands. This new tax system also {{led to the formation of}} state banking and the creation of banking firms. One of the most famous banking firms was Murashu Sons, based in the Babylonian city of Nippur. These banking firms provided loans and credit to clients.|$|E
5|$|The {{guidelines}} set by Judah Benjamin in 1861 {{soon became}} {{the choice of}} the clothing depots across the South as the war went into its second year. This easier-to-produce jacket, with the loosened hat and trouser regulations, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to clothe Confederate infantrymen. The typical uniform by the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862 was a slouch hat or kepi, a shell-jacket, and a pair of sky-blue or gray cloth trousers, with brogans.|$|E
50|$|Metro {{expanded}} to Kontula in 1986 which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> {{to reach the}} area. The Kontula Metro Station is daily used by 20,000 people.|$|R
5000|$|The dioptra {{was used}} {{extensively}} on aqueduct building projects. Screw turns on several {{different parts of}} the instrument <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to calibrate for very precise measurements ...|$|R
25|$|For {{individual}} hobbyists, {{websites such as}} Etsy, Big Cartel and Ravelry have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to sell knitting {{patterns on}} a small scale, in a way similar to eBay.|$|R
5|$|The {{sequences}} set in 2029 and the stop-motion {{scenes were}} developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Junior. A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that {{the model of the}} structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} {{that lead to}} the shift to modern globalization was the development of a more politicized system. Proto-globalization period marked a steady expansion of larger states from the Indonesian islands to northern Scandinava. The settlement of these individuals <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for governments to tax, develop an army, labor force, and create a sustainable economy. The development and streamlining of these cultural aspects lead to an increase in peripheral players in the game of globalization. The stable legal institutions developed in the late proto-globalization and early modern globalization period established economic advances, intellectual property rights (more predominantly in England), general geographical stability, and generational societal improvement.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the subway}} was built, the Bloor {{streetcar}} line operated {{along the route}} between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue. Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 {{to the opening of}} the subway line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to build a subway across the Don Valley, and the streetcar that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this streetcar line and {{to make it easier to}} expand into the suburbs, the line was built under Bloor street and Danforth Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Many {{components}} in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors. Unlike Mercury, Gemini used completely solid-state electronics, and its modular design <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to repair.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{became popular}} due to the modular engine {{architecture}} and {{the inclusion of a}} scripting language called UnrealScript, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to mod, including total conversions like Tactical Ops.|$|R
50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{contends that}} PJT Partners disclosed the sensitive informations it gathered from it (Petroleum Zion) including renegotiated terms to ACA, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for ACA {{to want to}} close the transaction.|$|R
5|$|By the 19th century, Leicester Square {{was known}} as an {{entertainment}} venue, with many amusements peculiar to the era, including Wyld's Great Globe, which was built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and housed a giant scale map of the Earth. The construction of New Coventry Street <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for traffic to access the square, resulting in private residences being replaced by shops, museums and exhibition centres. Savile House at No.5–6, built in 1683 for Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, had become a museum by this time, and was ultimately destroyed by fire in 1865. It was rebuilt as the Empire Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the wreck in 1971, the project became known to the general public and received increasing media attention. This helped bring in more donations and equipment, primarily from private sources. By 1974 the Committee had representatives from the National Maritime Museum, the Royal Navy, the BBC and local organisations. In 1974 the project received royal patronage from Prince Charles, who participated in dives on the site. This attracted yet more publicity, and also more funding and assistance. The initial aims of the Mary Rose Committee were now more officially and definitely confirmed. The Committee had become a registered charity in 1974, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to raise funds, and the application for excavation and raising of the ship had been officially approved by the UK government.|$|E
5|$|Literature {{in early}} modern Scotland is {{literature}} written in Scotland or by Scottish writers between the Renaissance {{in the early}} sixteenth century and {{the beginnings of the}} Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in mid-eighteenth century. By the beginning of this era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands, but the tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived. Middle Scots became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. The establishment of a printing press in 1507 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.|$|E
5000|$|Following Downtown's {{presentation}} {{the group}} adopted a trio format. The group's interplay included drummer Héctor Matos and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to add Christian Galíndez on percussion and Norberto [...] "Tiko" [...] Ortíz on saxophone.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Major Victory {{also had}} a charismatic personality that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for him to lead others. In contrast, however, he was also arrogant and did not handle the authority of others very well.|$|R
60|$|So Bab, with {{frequent}} interruptions and hints from Betty, told the wonderful tale {{in a simple}} way, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to understand; for she liked history, and had a lively tongue of her own.|$|R
