50|$|In the PFR, the {{reactants}} {{come into}} contact with each other in the pipe rather than a <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel</b> in conventional mixing systems, such as a continuously stirred tank reactor. This eliminates the need for extra mixing tanks which saves space but as a trade-off, the actual reaction site will be dependent on the pipe specifications and velocity of the fluid. The PFR also eliminates the need of bulky cascade systems or tanks used by other technologies in existing developments which can reduce maintenance costs. Due {{to the nature of the}} device, the reactants processed in PFRs will have short retention times, however, adding backflows into the system is a technique which can increase retention time if required. Unlike conventional mixing systems, a turbulent mixing chamber can be realized without producing pressure drops. Also, PFRs, like most flash reactors, are highly efficient with a small footprint.|$|E

However, cotton wool (with the risk of cotton fever) or tampons can be used, although to be more effective, several filtrations should be performed; cigarette filters should not be used, due to the risk of fibres breaking off and being injected along with the solution, nor should filters of any sort ever be re-used, either as filters or in an attempt to recover drug material present, due to many risks, ranging from cotton fever to life-threatening sepsis.|$|E
5000|$|Blend time, {{sometimes}} termed mixing time, is {{the time}} to achieve a predefined level of homogeneity of a tracer in a <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel.</b> Blend time is an important parameter to evaluate the mixing efficiency of mixing devices. [...] In order to make this definition valid, the tracer should be in the same physical phase (e.g. liquid) as the bulk material. [...] Blend time can be determined either with experiments or numerical modeling, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The experimental methods to determine the blend time in liquid include conductivity method and discoloration method. The conductivity method requires a conductivity probe to present in the target system, which make it an intrusive method because the existence of the probe might change the mixing efficiency of the mixing device. Discoloration method does not require any probe which makes it a non-intrusive method. However, the color detection device (sometimes the human eye) needs to be calibrated against the conductivity method. [...] Both methods are usually applied to monitor the concentration of the tracer in the most difficult to mix locations such as the area adjacent to the impeller shaft.|$|E

It is the first report of a reassortment of the pandemic virus, which in humans {{has been slow to}} evolve. Nancy Cox, head of the influenza division at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said, [...] "This particular paper is extremely interesting because it demonstrates for the first time what we had worried about at the very onset of the pandemic, and that is that this particular virus, when introduced into pigs, could reassort with the resident viruses in pigs and we would have new gene constellations.

[...] Pigs have been termed the <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel</b> of flu because they can be infected both by avian flu viruses, which rarely directly infect people, and by human viruses. When pigs become simultaneously infected with more than one virus, the viruses can swap genes, producing new variants which can pass to humans and sometimes spread amongst them.

40|$|During {{process plant}} {{development}} and preliminary design stages emissions {{resulting from the}} daily manufacturing operations are identified and measures are taken to control {{them in order to}} prevent possible adverse impacts on people and the environment. Process industry experiences not only emissions resulting from the daily manufacturing operations but also emissions which are fugitive or unanticipated. Fugitive emissions during process plant operation stage are often monitored because they are an occupational health concern. However the attention on fugitive emissions during the plant design stage is lacking. During this stage the equipment that involves large fugitive emissions could be identified and avoided. For this, methods to estimate fugitive emissions from various equipment used in the process industry are required. This work proposes a methodology to estimate the amount of potential fugitive emissions resulting from a <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel</b> used in the mixing operation. The distribution of those emissions in the environment which are essential to identify the impacts on the environment and human well-being is also looked at. Two designs of mixing vessels are studied for fugitive emissions. Firs t is a closed design where fugitive emissions are assumed to occur under well controlled conditions. The second is an open design where emission from surface evaporation occurs from an open <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel.</b> The method is applied on a paint <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel</b> in the paint manufacturing industry during early design stage and potential fugitive emission quantities are estimated.

40|$|Transport {{studies that}} employ column {{experiments}} in closed-flow mode complement classical approaches by providing new characteristic features {{observed in the}} breakthrough behavior and an equilibrium between liquid and solid phase. Specific to the closed-flow mode is the recirculation of the column effluent to the inflow via a <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel.</b> Depending on the ratio of volume of the water-filled pore space to {{the volume of the}} <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel,</b> a damped oscillating solute concentration emerges in effluent and <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel.</b> Oscillation frequency, extent of damping and amplitude are thereby governed by the transport properties of the porous medium. These characteristics allow for the analysis of transport processes in soils in a similar fashion as known for classical open-flow column experiments. However, the experimental design considers feedbacks of liquid solid interactions by connecting the effluent solution with the inflow. In this way, solute and porous medium can equilibrate with respect to all physicochemical parameters, thereby permitting a convenient consideration of mass balances. With this paper, the features emerging in the breakthrough of column experiments run in closed-flow mode and methods of evaluation are illustrated under experimental boundary conditions forcing the appearance of these oscillations. Additionally, the effect of flow velocity and <b>mixing</b> <b>vessel</b> volume on the breakthrough is investigated. We demonstrate that the water content of the porous medium and the pumping rate can be determined from a conservative tracer breakthrough curve. In this way, external preconditioning of the soil material, e. g., drying, can be avoided. This renders the closed-flow column approach especially interesting for the study of porous media with diverse mineral content and bacterial community that react strongly on changes in the water content. Furthermore, the basis for the modeling of closed-flow experiments is given by the derivation of constitutive equations and numerical implementation, validated by the presented experiments...|$|E

According to the plaque involved vessel, patients were grouped as without plaque, plaque involved left anterior descendant artery (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), circumflex artery (Cx), and mixed (two or more vessels). Results: While EAT volume was found to be higher in the group with plaque, {{the difference between the two}} groups was statistically significant (88. 6 ± 9. 2 cm 3, 67. 4 ± 7. 2 cm 3, respectively, p= 0. 001).

In this study, we summarize and report {{for the first time}} the coexistence of wholly human-like H 3 N 2 viruses, double-reassortant H 3 N 2 viruses, and triple-reassortant H 3 N 2 viruses in pigs in China by analyzing the eight genes of swine influenza A (H 3 N 2) viruses found in China from 1970 to 2006. In 1970, the first wholly human-like H 3 N 2 (Hong Kong/ 68 -like) viruses were isolated from pigs in Taiwan, and then in the next years Victoria/ 75 -like, Sydney/ 97 -like, New York/ 99 -like, and Moscow/ 99 -like swine H 3 N 2 viruses were regularly isolated in China. In the 1980 s, two triple-reassortant viruses were isolated from pigs. Recently, the double-reassortant viruses containing genes from the human (HA and NA) and avian (PB 2, PB 1, PA, NP, M, and NS) lineages and the triple-reassortant viruses containing genes from the human (HA and NA), classical swine (NP), and avian (PB 2, PB 1, PA, M, and NS) lineages emerged in pigs in China.
