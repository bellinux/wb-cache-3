2500|$|In November 2014, one of Cosby's lawyers, John Schmitt, {{released}} a statement reading, [...] "Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cosby</b> have resurfaced.

2500|$|On November 16, 2015, it was {{reported}} that accusers Tamara Green and Barbara Bowman filed a joint lawsuit against John Schmitt, one of Bill Cosby's lawyers. In November 2014, Schmitt released a statement reading, [...] "Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cosby</b> have resurfaced. The fact they are being repeated does not make them true. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cosby</b> does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment." [...] This statement was also posted to the front page of Cosby's official website. Green and Bowman contend that this widely circulated statement amounted to branding them as liars, resulting in emotional distress and other damages.|$|E
2500|$|The defense criticized lawyer Gloria Allred, who {{represents}} several of Cosby's accusers, stating that Allred's [...] "campaign against <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cosby</b> builds on racial bias and prejudice that can pollute {{the court of}} public opinion." [...] Allred responded by calling the claim [...] "desperate". She said that Cosby [...] "complains about racial bias but what about the African American women whom I represent who accuse him of sexual assault or rape and who refuse to remain silent about what they say they have suffered?" [...] and [...] "This is not an issue of racial bias. Instead, it is an {{issue of whether or not}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cosby</b> has committed acts of gender sexual violence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fordham University {{rescinded}} Cosby's honorary degree, {{making it}} the university's first in history. Fordham said, [...] "The University has taken this extraordinary step in light of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cosby's</b> now-public court depositions that confirm many of the allegations made against him by numerous women." [...] and that [...] "Mr. Cosby was willing to drug and rape women for his sexual gratification, and further damage those same women's reputations and careers to obscure his guilt, hurt not only his victims, but all women, and is beyond the pale." [...] The next day Cosby's attorney John P. Schmitt {{sent a letter to}} Fordham University calling its statement [...] "so irresponsible as to shock the conscience", and saying [...] "The mischaracterization of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cosby's</b> testimony is so egregious that one can only conclude that it was written by one either unfamiliar with the testimony or determined deliberately to misrepresent <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cosby's</b> words." [...] Schmitt criticized the university for an apparent effort to lend [...] "gratuituous support" [...] to defamation suits pending against Cosby, citing what he called the school's unfounded claim that the entertainer has a [...] "longtime strategy of denigrating the reputations of women who accused him of such actions".|$|R

2500|$|Cosby {{was asked}} {{directly}} about Buress's comments {{and the resulting}} fallout in two November 2014 interviews, which were originally intended to be about a new art exhibit at the Smithsonian that featured his private collection of African American art. In an NPR interview on November 15, 2014, reporter Scott Simon said: [...] "This question gives me no pleasure, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cosby,</b> {{but there have been}} serious allegations raised about you in recent days." [...] Cosby became silent, leading to an awkward radio exchange in which Simon verbally described Cosby's actions to listeners: [...] "you're shaking your head no." [...] Simon continued asking Cosby to comment on the allegations before finally wrapping up the interview with no further communication from Cosby. In a November 6, 2014, interview with Associated Press reporter Brett Zongker, Cosby appeared visibly rattled by unexpected Buress questions and told Zongker, [...] "No, no, we don't answer that." [...] In the proceeding minutes, Cosby repeatedly attempted to get Zongker to confirm that the AP would edit out the Buress questions, implying that Zongker's [...] "integrity" [...] and ability to be a [...] "serious reporter" [...] would be compromised if that portion of the interview was not [...] "scuttled". When Zongker failed to guarantee this request, Cosby turned to his off-camera publicist David Brokaw and told him to get on the phone with Zongker's editors [...] "immediately".

A judge in 2017 confirmed the correctness of Castor's legal analysis. On December 30, 2015, with the statute of limitations about to expire, Cosby was charged with felony sexual assault. At a preliminary hearing on February 2, 2016, Castor testified that he made a promise to never prosecute Cosby for the incident, but Judge Steven T.

5000|$|Cosby {{appeared}} in court {{during the afternoon}} of December 30, 2015, to face the three second degree felony counts of aggravated indecent assault without entering a plea, arranged for bail, and was formally charged that afternoon. Testimony from the Constand's civil suit had been reviewed by that time and the file was said to contain new information. Cosby had testified that the sexual contact was consensual.

The preliminary hearing was scheduled for January 14, 2016. In Pennsylvania, the maximum penalty for a conviction on aggravated indecent assault is 10 years in prison and a fine of $25,000.
