The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine mental health and stress-coping strategies in <b>memorizers</b> of Quran in Kashmar in 2013. Methods: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, <b>memorizers</b> of Quran in Kashmar were selected by convenience sampling method.

40|$|Muslims {{across the}} world {{memorize}} the Quran in Arabic for verbatim recall. <b>Memorizers</b> can be native speakers of Arabic, non-native speakers of Arabic, or non-Arabic speakers. The last category of speakers constitutes an unusual learner population, in that they cannot draw on primary linguistic knowledge to assist their memorization. Research on memorization suggests that memorization may instil sensitivity to patterns {{that can be used}} to bootstrap learning. The purpose of this study is to investigate if memorization of the Quran by non-Arabic speaking <b>memorizers</b> leads to pattern recognition in Classical Arabic. <b>Memorizers</b> of the Quran with no knowledge of Arabic were tested on their awareness of language patterns through a grammaticality judgement task (study 2). Contrary to implicit predictions in the research literature, findings from the language tests indicated that the participants had not developed any sensitivity to the morphological patterns of Classical Arabic. These results are discussed in the light of expert Quran memorizers’ reflections on their memorization practices (study 1), including what they brought to the act of memorization and what, according to them, underlay their success in memorization. It is proposed that memorizers’ extreme risk aversion in memorization stands in their way of developing awareness of the language patterns. This interpretation is further evidenced by results from a follow up study on native speakers of Arabic, who also did poorly on the grammaticality judgement task. The conclusion drawn is that Quran <b>memorizers</b> recite accurately because they don’t learn the language. It is further concluded that Quran memorization is a special case, in which a range of extra linguistic factors such as identity, motivation and intention play an important rol...|$|R

5000|$|This usage {{derives from}} Miller's (1956) idea of {{chunking}} as grouping, but {{the emphasis is}} now on long-term memory rather than only on short-term memory.

Chase and Simon (1973) and later Gobet, Retschitzki and de Voogt (2004) showed that chunking could explain several phenomena linked to expertise in chess. To be more specific, more skilled chess players have a larger chunk size. Several successful computational models of learning and expertise have been developed using this idea, such as EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and <b>Memorizer)</b> and CHREST (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures).
