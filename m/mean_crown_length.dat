40|$|Background Forest {{ecosystem}} functioning is {{strongly influenced by}} the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), and therefore, accurate predictions of APAR are critical for many process-based forest growth models. The Lambert-Beer law {{can be applied to}} estimate APAR for simple homogeneous canopies composed of one layer, one species, and no canopy gaps. However, the vertical and horizontal structure of forest canopies is rarely homogeneous. Detailed tree-level models can account for this heterogeneity but these often have high input and computational demands and work on finer temporal and spatial resolutions than required by stand-level growth models. The aim {{of this study was to}} test a stand-level light absorption model that can estimate APAR by individual species in mixed-species and multi-layered stands with any degree of canopy openness including open-grown trees to closed canopies. Methods The stand-level model was compared with a detailed tree-level model that has already been tested in mixed-species stands using empirical data. Both models were parameterised for five different forests, including a wide range of species compositions, species proportions, stand densities, crown architectures and canopy structures. Results The stand-level model performed well in all stands except in the stand where extinction coefficients were unusually variable and it appears unlikely that APAR could be predicted in such stands using (tree- or stand-level) models that do not allow individuals of a given species to have different extinction coefficients, leaf-area density or analogous parameters. Conclusion This model is parameterised with species-specific information about extinction coefficients and <b>mean</b> <b>crown</b> <b>length,</b> diameter, height and leaf area.

It has an array of biologically active plant chemicals including triterpenes, proteins and steroids. Aim: The aim is to evaluate the effect of methanolic seed extract of M. charantia (MC) on ova count, implantation and the fetus of Sprague–Dawley rats. Methodology: Thirty adult cyclic female Sprague–Dawley (S–D) rats divided into three groups (A, B and C) of 10 rats/group {{were used for the}} study. The female rats in Groups B and C were made pregnant by cohabiting with male S–D rats. In all the groups, MC extract was administered in the morning (9. 00 a. m.) at a dose of 25  mg/ 100  g b. w. /oral. In Group A, rats (in proestrous phase) were treated with a single dose and sacrificed the following day (estrous phase). Rats in Group B were fed once daily from day 1 to 10 of gestation and sacrificed on the 12 th day. Rats in Group C were fed once daily from day 6 to 19 of gestation and sacrificed on the 20 th day of gestation. The following were assessed: ova count, anti-implantation, early abortifacient properties and possible teratogenicity.

Specific categories included DBH classes from 25 to 50  cm, 51 to 76  cm, and ≥ 77  cm; crown kill ranges ≤ 10 %, 11 to 50 %, 51 to 60 %, 61 to 70 %, 71 to 80 %, 81 to 90 %, and 91 to 100 %; and cambium kill categorical ratings of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Any tree that survived at least one year post fire was monitored annually for five years or until death, then for 10  years post mortality. Only trees with 10  years of post-mortality observations were used in this analysis. One year post fire, we assessed tree and injury characteristics including species, DBH, tree height, pre-fire <b>crown</b> <b>length,</b> number of red turpentine beetle (RTB; Dendroctonus valens LeConte) pitch tubes for pines, and fire injury. We quantified fire injury by recording cambium kill rating (CKR; ordinal variable between 0 and 4 describing the number of dead cambium samples at each quadrant of the tree base), <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed (all species; observed portion of the crown with dead tissue from fire injury), and <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> scorched (Jeffrey pine and ponderosa pine only; observed portion of the crown with dead needles, but living buds and branches). Lengths were measured using a clinometer or laser hypsometer to the nearest 0.3  m. We calculated pre-fire <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> and <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed from the estimated pre-fire crown base height, post-fire crown base height, and tree height measurements. The pre-fire crown was estimated using the methods described in Ryan (1982), by visually reconstructing the crown to its pre-fire state based on crown scorch and fine branch structure. We converted <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed into percent <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed, by dividing the <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed by the pre-fire <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> to create a crown injury variable (CI). When <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed was not available, we used an estimated live crown measurement to determine percent <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed. Snag persistence may be influenced by whether it is in isolation or in a group of living trees (Mitchell and Preisler 1998; Russell et al. 2006). We therefore also assessed whether each snag was in a stand that had been salvage logged (Sal) and if the snag was surrounded by live conifers (protected by green conifers; PGC) as binary categories (0 [*]=[*]no and 1 [*]=[*]yes). Each year after this initial assessment, trees were monitored for live or dead status and break height, if applicable.|$|R

40|$|Taiwan red cypress (Chamaecyparis formosensis Matsum) is an {{indigenous}} and important cypress conifer {{with a broad}} area of natural forests and plantations in Taiwan. Because of the high economic value and multiple uses of the species, numerous researchers have studied its growth and yield within plantation forests. However, {{few studies have examined}} how the crown characteristics of the tree respond to different thinning regimes, particularly in the long run. The crown is a dominant outline of aboveground component of a tree that can sensitively reflect competitions from trees located nearby.  This study evaluated the crown form of Taiwan red cypress at three different growth stages with different thinning intensities over 20 years. The study began in 1982, when the three plantations examined were aged 7, 15, and 21  years, and when thinning treatments began. In 2002, crown form parameters (CFPs) and crown profile equations (CPEs) were used to analyze the thinning effects at the tree level. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that age class influenced most CFPs and that thinning treatments influenced all CFPs, indicating that both factors could simultaneously affect the CFPs.  Moreover, the CPEs fit the observed data well for all age classes, demonstrating that the equation had a high capacity for predicting crown form.  The CPEs were used to determine the <b>mean</b> <b>crown</b> shape profile for each thinning treatment and age class. According to the <b>mean</b> <b>crown</b> profile predicted by CPEs, we found that <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> and width increased with thinning intensity for all aged trees, especially after a heavy thinning treatment. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the {{relation}} of horizontal and vertical canopy structure to tree functional diversity of a highly diverse subtropical broad-leaved slope forest, stratified for different successional stages. This is of particular interest because many key ecosystem processes and functions are related to the arrangement of forest canopies. We assessed the effect of stand-related functional diversity (FDQ, measured as Rao’s quadratic entropy of leaf traits), together with other environmental variables on horizontal [measured as relative crown projection areas (CPAr) ] and vertical [relative crown overlap, coefficients of variation (CV) of crown positioning variables] structure of the upper canopy at the local neighbourhood level. The analyses with mixed effects models revealed a negative relation (p = 0. 025; estimate - 0. 07) between FDQ and CPAr. No significant effect of FDQ on vertical canopy structure has been found (p > 0. 05). The findings are discussed with regard to resource partitioning and niche differentiation of canopy and sub-canopy species.

40|$|SUMMARY This study {{examined}} the impact of maternal prepregnant stature, smoking, and past reproductive characteristics on gestational length, birthweight, weight-for-gestation, and <b>crown</b> heel <b>length.</b> Analyses were based on 5722 para one and two Caucasian women in Trondheim and Bergen (Norway) and Uppsala (Sweden) who had a singleton pregnancy and who were interviewed before 20 completed weeks of gestation. Data included information about previous induced and spontaneous abortions, prepregnant weight and height, smoking, course and outcome of previous pregnancies with special reference to preterm and low birthweight (LBW) births, and perinatal deaths. Number of adverse outcome predictors was counted for each woman and birth outcomes were analysed by that number. Separate univariate and multivariate analyses examined {{the impact of the}} individual risk characteristics. <b>Mean</b> birthweight, <b>crown</b> heel <b>length,</b> and gestational length were significantly related to number of prepregnant risk characteristics with a dose response decrease from 3750 g, 51. 2 cm, and 39. 6 weeks to 2955 g, 47. 7 cm, and 37. 7 weeks for women with zero and six risk factors, respectively. Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that prepregnant weight, a previous LBW birth, and cigarette smoking around conception were the strongest birthweight predictors with a mean BW reduction of 424 g (95 % CI 373, 475 g) and 130 g (95 % CI 112, 157 g) for a previous LBW birth and 10 cigarettes per day, respectively. As 88 % of birthweight variation was left unexplained by these prepregnancy characteristics, it may be concluded that the major risk factors are either unknown or that main predictors of birthweight, such as life style factors, exert their effect   during gestation, or both.

40|$|Forest canopy {{structure}} is {{strongly influenced by}} stand density due to changing competitive interactions among the individual trees and in turn directly influences stemwood volume production. The structure and dynamics of forest canopies, particularly {{in relation to the}} production of stemwood, were examined in unmanaged, even-aged stands of two dissimilar tree species, Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. The analysis of structure-production relationships was guided by a conceptual model which generated hypotheses and led to examination of assumptions incorporated in the model. <b>Mean</b> <b>crown</b> dimensions were related to stand density through a negative exponential function for both species, but because of differing shade­tolerances, <b>mean</b> <b>crown</b> size of lodgepole pine was affected more by increasing density than was <b>mean</b> <b>crown</b> size of subalpine fir. More importantly, examination of the model assumptions indicated that adequate characterization of canopy structure should account for the influence of both crown shyness and stand height. Stand density also influenced the amount and distribution of leaf area in these forest stands. The more plastic mean leaf area of lodgepole pine led to a constant leaf area index over a range of density and, thus, was consistent with conventional wisdom which assumes closed canopied forest stands support stable leaf area indices across a wide range of densities. The less plastic mean leaf area of subalpine fir, however, led to positive correlation between leaf area index and density. Changes in <b>mean</b> <b>crown</b> dimensions and <b>mean</b> leaf area influenced the production of stemwood volume such that large <b>mean</b> <b>crown</b> sizes were less efficient than small <b>mean</b> <b>crown</b> sizes. The decrease in efficiency was attributed to accumulation of large branch biomass in large crowns to support foliage far from the stem. Increased support costs were indicated by the increasing proportion of crown volume which was nonfoliated as <b>mean</b> <b>crown</b> size increased. The assumption that accumulated branch biomass was responsible for the observed declines in efficiency for forest trees was reinforced by a comparison of structure-production relationships for lodgepole pine and the annual Helianthus annuus L...|$|R

Epicormic branches can be removed without compromising tree growth. •ContextThe formation of epicormic shoots is often observed following pruning treatments, but {{their role in the}} overall tree growth is unknown. •AimsThe objectives of this study were to examine how pruning intensity and season affect the production of epicormic branches and how their presence (or removal) affects tree growth and total non-structural carbohydrate reserves in the roots. •MethodsTrees from four hybrid poplar clones were pruned in fall, spring, and summer at two intensities 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 of the <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> and an unpruned control. Produced epicormic branches were removed from half the trees. •ResultsPruning intensity and season were the most important factors affecting the number and biomass of epicormic shoots while clone was not. Pruning 1 / 3 <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> in summer reduced the emergence of epicormic shoots compared to 2 / 3 and spring or fall pruning. Two years after pruning, the removal of epicormic shoots did not affect height or diameter at breast height of trees, and their presence did not restore root total non-structural carbohydrates reserves to unpruned levels. •ConclusionWe concluded that pruning should be done in summer at 1 / 3 of the <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> to reduce epicormic shoot formation and to avoid decreases in stem growth. If epicormic shoots appear, they can be removed without compromising tree growth...|$|R

40|$|Background: The gingival {{morphology}} of the maxillary anterior region {{plays an}} important role in determining the final esthetic outcome. Knowledge of the periodontal biotype is of fundamental importance because the anatomical characteristics of the periodontium, such as gingival thickness, gingival width and alveolar bone morphology, will determine periodontium behavior when submitted to physical, chemical, or bacterial injury or during periodontal or implant surgical procedures and orthodontic treatment. Materials and Methods: 50 subjects with healthy periodontal tissues with no loss of attachment and (b) presence of all anterior teeth in both upper and lower jaw were selected. On clinical examination gingival thickness was recorded based on the transparency of periodontal probe. Following parameters are recorded from dental cast, i. e., <b>crown</b> <b>length,</b> <b>crown</b> width, papillary <b>length</b> (PL) and papillary width. Results: There was highly significant correlation between gingival biotype and <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> and area of papilla with P value − 0. 002 and 0. 013 respectively. Significant correlation was found between area of crown and PL with P value − 0. 013 and 0. 016. The results of discriminant function analysis showed that average <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> was the best single determinant of biotype and area of papilla was the next best choice. Conclusion: Within the limits of the current investigation, the existence and correlation of different gingival biotypes and dentopapillary complex dimension has been confirmed. These findings can be utilized as objective guidelines for determining the biotype and response of gingiva to many dental operative procedures...|$|R
