40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the study of}} vibration suppression by using eddy current as a suppression agent on a power steering system. Vibration occurs due to some factors such as engine vibration, road surfaces, vibration direction, tire characteristics, suspension design and steering devices. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the voltage induced effect on vibration suppression occurred at power steering system using eddy current braking. Equipments involve are accelerometer, data acquisition (DAQ), electric motor, transformer, aluminium disc and Voltage regulator. Position of the accelerometer was placed at the steering wheel and aluminium disc. Based on the result for frequency domain, in a normal condition, the level of vibration amplitude produce is 0. 2348 <b>mvolt.</b> while, after voltage was apply to power steering system lowest vibration suppression at steering column (aluminium disc) is 0. 166 <b>mvolt</b> with 2 mm air gap opening using 48 volt power supply. For steering wheel, in a normal condition is the level of vibration is 0. 2251 <b>mVolt.</b> After voltage was applied to power steering system, the lowest vibration suppression at steering wheel is 0. 1836 <b>mVolt</b> using 96 Volt of voltage induced. Based on the experimental result, increasing voltage induced managed to reduce vibration on power steering system since the electromagnetic braking force using eddy current increase which act as the vibration suppression agent...|$|E

We aimed {{to estimate the}} amount of cutaneous vitamin D synthesis in pregnant village women (n= 100) in different seasons in conjunction with serum 25 OHD. We also correlated variations in surface UV energy {{with the presence of}} environmental pollution and crowding. Methods The measurements of UVB radiation energy were obtained using UV spectrometer at different times of the day between 9 am and 4 pm, in different seasons. The instrument was calibrated to denote 13 microWatt/ cm 2 of irradiance per <b>mVolt</b> of deflection.

40|$|The bias {{dependence}} of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junctions is investigated theoretically with a fully self-consistent scheme that combines the non-equilibrium Green's functions method with density functional theory. At voltages smaller than 20 <b>mVolt</b> the I-V characteristics and the TMR are dominated by resonant transport through narrow interface states in the minority spin-band. In the parallel configuration this contribution is quenched by a voltage comparable to the energy width of the interface state, whereas it persists at all voltages in the anti-parallel configuration. At higher bias the transport is mainly determined by the relative positions of the Δ_ 1 band-edges in the two Fe electrodes, which causes a decrease of the TMR...|$|E
40|$|Rapidly {{progressive}} {{periodontal disease}} {{was found in}} three patients belonging to three different generations of the same family. Beyond the clinical inspection, blood examination allowed measurements of the luminol enhanced biochemiluminescence from the circulating PMN leukocytes. Abnormally low values were recorded in the affected individuals (75, 84 and 138 <b>mVolts</b> per 10 (6) cells) whereas a sample of healthy individuals exhibited photonic values from 240 up to 910 <b>mVolts</b> per 10 (6) cells. These abnormal values, however, were not constantly recorded. They gave way to higher PMN activity indices after the patients had been treated either by antibiotics, scaling, debridement or classical pocket cleaning.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{success rate}} of left {{ventricular}} (LV) lead implantation for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is high. Congenital abnormalities of the coronary sinus (CS) are rare but can be responsible for unsuccessful implantation. Method and resultA 64 -year-old male with standard indication for CRT was referred to our institution for a CRT-D implantation. Unfortunately, intubation of the CS was not possible. TEE showed a congenital CS anomaly with complete drainage of the CS into the left atrium. Because of contra-indication for general anaesthesia and thus for surgical epicardial implantation, we proposed to implant the LV lead by a transseptal approach. After the patient had given his consent, a transseptal puncture was performed via the right femoral vein. A conventional screw-in lead was implanted at the laterobasal segment of the LV using a deflectable catheter guide introduced via the left subclavian vein through the transseptal puncture. Post-implantation parameters of the LV lead were acceptable: pacing threshold 0. 7 V- 0. 4 ms, impedance 435 ohms, R wave amplitude 5 <b>mvolts.</b> Right ventricular and right atrium leads were then implanted (fig 1) A post-implant CT scan confirmed the ectopic location of the CS ostium without persistent superior vena cava (fig 2). Figure 1 Figure 2 The patient was discharged on anticoagulation with a targeted international normalized ratio between 3 and 4. At the one- and three-month follow-up, no complication had occurred. He was in class 2 of the NYHA and had not been hospitalised. Electrical parameters remained steady. ConclusionComplete drainage of the CS in the left atrium without persistent vena cava is a rare congenital abnormality. When cardiac resynchronization therapy is needed, transseptal implantation could be a feasible alternative...|$|R
40|$|Adhesives {{are widely}} used and often {{preferred}} {{as a means of}} fastening parts together. Aircraft applications in bonding large areas or bonding parts of vehicle chassis, has brought about the need for highly reliable techniques in non destructive testing of adhesive bonds. Despite the many years of research there is still a need for further work to achieve a reliable method that can fully predict the performance of adhesive bonds under operating conditions. Among a wide range of different methods, a variety of ultrasonic techniques are used for non-destructive testing of adhesive bonds including pulse echo or through signal. In all cases the ultrasonic signal response is analyzed and conclusions are drawn with regard {{to the quality of the}} adhesive bond. Features of the ultrasonic signal, such as amplitude and frequency, are used for analysis. Even though there have been great improvements in ultrasonic testing of adhesive bonds, it is not always easy to extract conclusive information from the signals that discriminate clearly between the levels of bond quality. The method introduced in this paper enhances the capability of discriminating between varying degrees of bond quality when compared with existing methods in ultrasonic testing. A widely used method utilizes the magnitude of the returning signal as a measure of the level of contact between the adhesive and adherent. Higher amplitudes indicate lesser contact as less signal is transmitted through to the adhesive. However differences in output signal can be very small and in some cases is unable to discriminate between “good” and “bad” areas. Furthermore, measurement units are in terms of <b>mVolts</b> that could easily be lost in signal noise. The method introduced here uses Wavelet Packets for analysis of ultrasonic signals. Wavelets are analogues to sine and cosine functions of traditional Fourier analysis however they offer features, which overcome some of the limitations of traditional Fourier analysis in characterizing signal structures with sharp changes. Wavelet Packet filters are used to calculate the coefficients of the ultrasonic signal under investigation. These coefficients are subsequently linked to the quality of the adhesive bond. Research in this area revealed that substantial improvements could be achieved in differentiating signals between varying categories of defective areas. Non-defective areas were differentiated from those with defects by a factor of 20 when using the Wavelet Packet method. The Maximum Value method could only differentiate the same areas by a factor of 2. 5. Standard Ultrasonic testing equipment was used with accompanying software and an X Y Z test rig to enable scanning of specimens. The specimens were prepared from materials that are used in the automotive industry i. e. 0. 8 mm sheet steel and structural adhesive. The defects were strategically placed between the adhesive and metal for later comparison with the ultrasonic test results. Data from the experiments was used to conduct suitable analyses for comparing the traditional with the proposed method. The method developed here is a sensitive tool providing high-resolution discrimination when applied to reading of ultrasonic signals from adhesive bonds...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we provide}} an {{extremely}} simple, rapid, direct, sensitive and specific method to quantify {{for the first}} time intracellular GSH in human prostate cancer cells (DU 145) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A 549) using an electrochemical detector coupled to a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC-ECD). GSH determination in cancer cells are importance because GSH has been involved in the development of resistance to several anticancer drugs. Separation of GSH was performed on a Alltima C 18 column using a binary pre-mixed mobile phase of methanol-NaH 2 PO 4 (10 mM, pH 3. 0 with phosphoric acid) (2 : 98 v/v). GSH was detected with an oxidation potential of + 500 <b>mVolt.</b> The limit of detections was 0. 33 pMol. Linearity, accuracy and precision were found to be acceptable. The experiments show that the HPLC-ECD method developed in this study could represent an useful alternative to the existing procedures since its simplicity and rapidity...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringWilliam L. DunnTwo {{types of}} high {{efficiency}} neutron detector arrays (HENDAs), a 32 -channel planar device and two trenched devices, were constructed at Kansas State University (KSU) and characterized. These HENDAs are prototypes for a detector {{that will be}} developed for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), which is located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The general design objectives of a proposal from the KSU Semiconductor Materials and Radiological Technologies (SMART) Lab to the National Science Foundation, {{which led to a}} grant that funded this research, were reached. A spatial resolution for the HENDA prototypes of approximately 120 μm was achieved. The prototypes had relatively fast response times of approximately 1. 2 μs, with rise times of 300 ns for the planar device and 200 ns for the 100 -μm deep trenched device. The thermal neutron counting efficiency of one of the trenched devices was measured to be about 12 %. It is expected that the goal of a 50 % efficient HENDA is attainable by making trenches contained within the trenched device deeper and by stacking modules in a sandwich design. The pulse heights produced by the HENDA prototypes were approximately 0. 5 volt with noise levels of 13 <b>mvolt,</b> resulting in a signal to noise ratio of almost 40 : 1. The response of HENDA, when placed in the neutron beam from the tangential beam port of the KSU TRIGA Mark II was proportional to the reactor power from 2 kW to 512 kW. At 512 kW, the neutron flux is φ = 1. 08 x 10 [superscript] 7 cm[superscript]- 2 s[superscript]- 1, and therefore HENDA can operate with negligible dead time at neutron fluxes beyond 107 cm- 2 s- 1. From the experimental results, HENDA is a valuable linear array detector and can be applied to experiments that are designed to study material properties and structures through methods such as neutron diffraction and imaging...|$|E
