40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Leiðarvísir, a <b>medieval</b> <b>itinerary</b> from Iceland to the Holy Land. The itinerary indicates {{stops and}} distances, {{but is also}} rich in significant information on the places along the route. Leiðarvísir {{has been attributed to}} the twelfth-century Abbot Nikulás of the Benedictine abbey of Munkaþverá in Iceland and the text has been considered to be a travel account based on the direct experiences gained by the abbot during a journey. An analysis, however, of all the datable termini present in the itinerary demonstrates that the attribution of the whole itinerary to Nikulás cannot be maintained. Having taken into consideration the most relevant criteria and definitions required to categorise a text as ‘travel writing’ and as a ‘travel account’, this thesis will then show that Leiðarvísir does not share any of the distinguishing genre features typical of a travel account, and that it should rather be classified as an impersonal guide. Finally, the thesis focuses on the description of Rome in Leiðarvísir, putting {{it in the context of}} other medieval descriptions of Rome. Not only does this contextualization make evident that the description of Rome is largely based on written sources, but it also proves that some of its details are incompatible with a twelfth-century dating and with its attribution to Nikulás. It emerges that Leiðarvísir is a work composed by an erudite scholar using written sources, and that it was probably successively enriched and updated with relevant information by one or more later scribes. ...|$|E
50|$|The ancient sources, {{particularly}} the <b>Medieval</b> <b>itineraries</b> for pilgrims, mention other martyrs buried within the catacomb: Artemy, Paulinus, Sophia {{and her three}} daughters Faith, Hope and Charity. The resting place {{of the last four}} martyrs can probably be identified with the so-called cubicle of St. Sophia.|$|R
50|$|Like {{some other}} famous <b>medieval</b> <b>itineraries,</b> it shows {{an absence of}} a traveler's or author's egotism, and contains, even in the last chapter, {{scarcely}} any personal narrative. Joannes was not only an old man when he went on this mission, but was, according to accidental evidence {{in the annals of}} his order, a fat and heavy man (vir gravis et corpulentus), insomuch that, contrary to Franciscan precedent, he rode a donkey between his preachings in Germany. In his narrative, however, he never complains.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Medieval</b> <b>itineraries</b> of {{pilgrimage to}} the Holy Land {{conveyed}} the collective conscience {{of the society for}} which they were written rather than the impressions of the individual author. The first Hebrew itineraries were written in the 12 th century, probably following the contemporary Christian genre. Yet, despite the evident influence, the Jewish writers succeeded in adopting the Christian genre to the particular needs of their reading audience. This paper explores the characteristics of the Hebrew genre and how they served the pur-pose of making the myths real.

25|$|From the Renaissance on, some {{individuals}} wanted {{not only to}} record events, as in <b>medieval</b> chronicles and <b>itineraries,</b> but also to put down their own opinions and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris that covers the years 1405–49, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the Florentines Buonaccorso Pitti and Gregorio Dati and the Venetian Marino Sanuto the Younger. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, emotional experience and personal impressions.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the emergence of}} Italy as a discrete object in the Mediterranean {{in the history of}} Western cartography. In particular, it focuses on different coexisting Renaissance mapping traditions that rested on two opposed spatial understandings and experiences of the basin: on the one hand, as a functional region and a sequence of interconnected places grounded in an older Ancient and <b>Medieval</b> tradition of <b>itineraries,</b> mappae mundi and portolan charts; on the other, as a compact geographical area defined by forms and dimensions (through Ptolemaic chorographic mapping). These two different spatial understandings persist in contemporary debates {{about the nature of the}} Mediterranean region. The latter can be likened to the “great Mediterranean body,” or formal organic unit conceived by Braudel. The former is a vision “from the sea” in line with the “functional” approach recently proposed by Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, who portray the Mediterranean as a space made of coastal flows and connectivities between “microregions. ...|$|R
