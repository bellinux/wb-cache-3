5|$|By January 1904, {{the ship}} had become the {{flagship}} of the Channel Fleet. As {{a result of a}} reorganization in January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet, and <b>Magnificent</b> accordingly became a part of the Atlantic Fleet. A gun explosion aboard <b>Magnificent</b> on 14 June 1905 resulted in 18 casualties. The explosion was caused by a faulty shell in one of the 6-inch guns; it failed to fire, and when the loader opened the breech, contact with the fresh air detonated the shell. On 15 November 1906, she ended her Atlantic Fleet service and was paid off at Devonport. <b>Magnificent</b> was commissioned into reserve on 16 November 1906, based at Chatham. During her reserve service, she was attached to the Gunnery School at Sheerness as a gunnery training ship in December 1906.|$|E

5|$|Although {{at various}} times the Byzantines made <b>magnificent</b> {{achievements}} {{in the application of}} the sciences, and are responsible for preserving much of ancient knowledge, some authors have argued that Byzantine scholars made few novel contributions to science in terms of developing new theories or extending the ideas of classical authors.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that Streeterville is bounded on the west by the <b>Magnificent</b> Mile, the City of Chicago and the Streeterville Organization of Active Residents, claim the boundary extends one block further to the west to Rush Street.

5|$|Citizen Kane was {{the only}} film made under Welles's {{original}} contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control. Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse. In July 1941, Welles reluctantly signed a new and less favorable deal with RKO under which he produced and directed The <b>Magnificent</b> Ambersons (1942), produced Journey into Fear (1943), and began It's All True, a film he agreed to do without payment. In the new contract Welles was {{an employee of the}} studio and lost the right to final cut, which later allowed RKO to modify and re-cut The <b>Magnificent</b> Ambersons over his objections. In June 1942 Schaefer resigned the presidency of RKO Pictures and Welles's contract was terminated by his successor.|$|E
5|$|Deformed matrices, {{consisting}} of randomly oriented nanochannels in a spongelike keratin matrix, create the diffuse non-iridescent blue colour of Ara ararauna, the blue-and-yellow macaw. Since the reflections {{are not all}} arranged in the same direction, the colours, while still <b>magnificent,</b> do not vary much with angle, so they are not iridescent.|$|E
5|$|For his victory, the Senate awarded Titus a Roman triumph. On {{the day of}} the festivities, the Flavian family rode {{into the}} capital, preceded by a lavish parade that {{displayed}} the spoils of the war.

5|$|I must {{mention the}} <b>magnificent</b> fight {{put up by}} 9th Armoured Brigade — 3rd Hussars, Wiltshire Yeomanry, Warwickshire Yeomanry.... If the British armour owed any debt to the {{infantry}} of 8th army, the debt was paid on November 2nd by 9th Armoured Brigade in heroism and blood....|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Hansen {{was also}} charged with {{rebuilding}} Christiansborg Palace which had burnt down in 1794. Unfortunately, it burnt down {{once again in}} 1884. All that remains is the <b>magnificent</b> chapel which, with its Ionic columns, conveys a sense of antiquity.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, a <b>magnificent</b> ship-burial was {{discovered}} under a large mound at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk. Although Rædwald is usually {{considered to have}} been buried with the ship (or commemorated by it), another possibility is Eorpwald. Alternatively, he might also have had his own ship-burial nearby.|$|E
5|$|It {{once was}} an {{important}} religious center, used exclusively by the prominent families of New Spain.

5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at a {{large and}} important colony of the <b>magnificent</b> frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though {{it was unclear whether}} it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{family also}} profited from the relationship. Her father, already Viscount Rochford, was created Earl of Wiltshire. Henry {{also came to}} an {{arrangement}} with Anne's Irish cousin and created him Earl of Ormond.

5|$|Birds have {{featured}} in culture and art since prehistoric times, {{when they were}} represented in early cave paintings. Some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Māori's legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. Birds were later used as symbols of power, as in the <b>magnificent</b> Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright wrote of the west front that it is “as <b>magnificent</b> an entrance to a sacred building as could well be imagined.” The long wooden roof of the nave is original and has retained its painting from 1220.|$|E

5|$|Coma Berenices also {{contains}} the neutron star RBS 1223 and the pulsar PSR B1237+25. RBS 1223 {{is a member}} of the <b>Magnificent</b> Seven, a group of young neutron stars. In 1975, the first extra-solar source of extreme ultraviolet, the white dwarf HZ 43, was discovered in Coma Berenices. In 1995, there was a very rare outburst of the WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova AL Comae Berenices. A June 2003 outburst from GO Comae Berenices, an SU Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova, was photometrically observed.|$|E
5|$|Eskimo (also {{known as}} Mala the <b>Magnificent</b> and Eskimo Wife-Traders) is a 1933 American Pre-Code drama film {{directed}} by W. S. Van Dyke and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).

The film stars Ray Mala as Mala, Lulu Wong Wing as Mala's first wife Aba, Lotus Long as Mala's second wife Iva, Peter Freuchen as the Ship Captain, W. S. Van Dyke as Inspector White, and Joseph Sauers as Sergeant Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Fame of Zamoyski, {{significance}} in life, endured after his death. He was praised by {{artists such as}} Szymon Starowolski and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, and historians, including Stanisław Staszic, Stanisław Tarnowski and Artur Śliwiński. There were also those critical of him: Hugo Kołłątaj, Józef Szujski, Michał Bobrzyński. Nonetheless, Polish historiography and culture treatment of Zamoyski is mostly positive, and historian Janusz Tazbir remarked that Zamoyski posthumous career was even more <b>magnificent</b> than his real one. Leśniewski, ending his recent biography of Zamoyski, concludes {{that he is a}} significant, if controversial, figure of Polish Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in {{that they}} often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne {{protozoa}} of the genus Haemoproteus have been recovered from {{four of the five}} species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran genus Pectinopygus and amblyceran genus Colpocephalum and species Fregatiella aurifasciata have been recovered from <b>magnificent</b> and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands. Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.|$|E
5|$|Gian Gastone was {{descended from}} both Cosimo the Elder and Lorenzo the Elder through the {{marriage}} between Maria Salviati, grandchild of Lorenzo the <b>Magnificent,</b> and Giovanni de' Medici, great-grandson of Lorenzo the Elder. This becomes clearer when one understands their common ancestor: Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, father to both Lorenzo the Elder and Cosimo de' Medici. Thus {{the kings of}} France from Louis XIII and on, are descended from the 'cadet' branch, confirming that Gian Gastone was not the last Medici.|$|E
