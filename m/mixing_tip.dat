40|$|The {{mammalian}} lung develops through branching morphogenesis. Two primary {{forms of}} branching, which occur in order, in the lung have been identified: tip bifurcation and side branching. However, {{the mechanisms of}} lung branching morphogenesis remain to be explored. In our previous study, a biological mechanism was presented for lung branching pattern formation through a branching model. Here, we provide a mathematical mechanism underlying the branching patterns. By decoupling the branching model, we demonstrated the existence of Turing instability. We performed Turing instability analysis to reveal the mathematical mechanism of the branching patterns. Our simulation {{results show that the}} Turing patterns underlying the branching patterns are spot patterns that exhibit high local morphogen concentration. The high local morphogen concentration induces the growth of branching. Furthermore, we found that the sparse spot patterns underlie the tip bifurcation patterns, while the dense spot patterns underlies the side branching patterns. The dispersion relation analysis shows that the Turing wavelength affects the branching structure. As the wavelength decreases, the spot patterns change from sparse to dense, the rate of tip bifurcation decreases and side branching eventually occurs instead. In the process of transformation, there may exists hybrid branching that <b>mixes</b> <b>tip</b> bifurcation and side branching. Since experimental studies have reported that branching mode switching from side branching to tip bifurcation in the lung is under genetic control, our simulation results suggest that genes control the switch of the branching mode by regulating the Turing wavelength. Our results provide a novel insight into and understanding of the formation of branching patterns in the lung and other biological systems...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} routes, namely solvent aided dispersion {{and direct}} mixing, {{were employed to}} disperse Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWNTs) into a mono-component epoxy system used as matrix for advanced composites. In the first route, MWCNTs were diluted in three different solvents (acetone, sodium dodecyl sulfate and ethanol) and then mixed with the matrix by tip sonication. In the second case, carbonaceous nanoparticles were added directly into the hosting system and dispersion {{was carried out by}} using three different techniques (mechanical stirring, magnetic agitation and tip sonication). The effects of the solvents and agitation energy were investigated by optical microscopy at micron level, in order assess the more efficient dispersion procedure for the considered epoxy system. It was demonstrated that parameters associated with direct mixing rather than solvent solubility govern MWCNT dispersion. Optical analysis of the nanocomposite morphology evidenced a very low density of MWCNTs micron sized aggregates in the case of direct <b>mixed</b> <b>tip</b> sonicated samples if compared to those obtained by solution aided dispersion. In addition, nanocomposites obtained by sonication showed the lowest density of MWCNTs micron sized aggregates, also when compared with mechanically and magnetically stirred system.

The main objectives of this analysis {{is to establish a}} proper CFD analysis methodology to this kind of very complicated turbulent swirling flow in a subchannel since previous results show that a predicted turbulent swirl flow within 5 times of hydraulic diameter length from the <b>mixing</b> devices <b>tip</b> shows different results, which are dependent on the models chosen, such as the turbulent model, wall function model, the y+ value, and the numerical model for a convection term.

A series of sensitivity analyses shows that a very dense mesh distribution along the stream-wise direction around the mixing devices is recommended to use for resolving a drastic change of the turbulent intensity due to a strong swirl flow induced by the mixing devices.

In nine patients Campath- 1 G was given pre-transplant, but also continued post-transplant until day + 5 to reduce GVHD (group 2). There were three patients with late graft failure in group I following initial neutrophil engraftment, and four cases of grade II+ GVHD. In group II, two patients had early graft failure (no take), and there were no cases of acute GVHD out of seven evaluable patients. One patient in group I developed chronic GVHD of the liver, and two patients (one in each group) had transient localised chronic GVHD. PCR of short tandem repeats was used to evaluate chimaeric status in 13 patients. Of 11 patients with initial neutrophil engraftment, only one had 100 % donor haemopoiesis at all times.

40|$|Axial {{flow pump}} runners known as {{inducers}} {{are subject to}} complex internal flows and fluid-induced lateral and rotordynamic forces. The internal flows in inducers are three dimensional and are characterized by complicated secondary flows. The current research investigates the boundary layer flows on the blades, hub and housing of unshrouded and shrouded axial flow inducers using flow visualization techniques. Rotordynamic and lateral force data on unshrouded inducers were also obtained under varying conditions of flow and whirl. Studies on the internal flows showed that the blade boundary layer flow had strong radial components at off-design conditions. The flow remains attached to the blade surface of unshrouded inducers at all flow coefficients tested. The origin of the upstream swirling backflow {{was found to be}} at the discharge plane of the inducer. In addition, flow reversal was observed at the suction side blade tip near the leading edge in a shrouded inducer. Re-entry of the hub boundary layer flow (a downstream backflow) into the blade passage area was observed at flow coefficients below design. For unshrouded inducers the radially outward flow near the blade <b>tip</b> <b>mixed</b> with the <b>tip</b> clearance leakage flow to form the upstream backflow. These observations provide {{a better understanding of the}} internal flows and the occurrence of upstream backflows in inducers. The rotordynamic forces acting on an inducer due to an imposed whirl motion was also investigated. It was found that the rotordynamic force data at various whirl frequency ratios does not allow a normal quadratic fit; consequently the conventional inertial, stiffness and damping coefficients cannot be obtained and a definite whirl ratio describing the instability region does not result. Rotordynamic forces were found to be significantly dependent on the flow coefficient. At flow coefficients below design, these forces are characterized by multiple zero crossings at various whirl frequencies and large destabilizing peaks. Theoretical estimates of the tangential rotordynamic force on a non-whirling inducer using actuator disk theory were significantly different, both in magnitude and direction, from the experimentally measured forces. The effect of upstream and downstream flow distortions on the rotordynamic and lateral forces on an inducer were studied. It was found that at flow coefficients below design, large lateral forces occurred in the presence of a downstream asymmetry. The reverse flows occurring downstream which consist of high energy fluid are the possible cause of these large forces. The imposition of a uniform downstream condition reduced these forces to near zero values. Results of inlet distortion experiments show that a strong inlet shear causes a significant increase in the lateral force. However, weak inlet shear flows and the flow asymmetry due to a 180 ° upstream bend did not cause a significant lateral force. It was found that flow distortions upstream or downstream did not cause any significant effect on the rotordynamic forces. Cavitation was found to have important consequences for fluid-induced rotordynamic forces. These forces become destabilizing for both forward and reverse whirl. The magnitudes of the destabilizing forces were found to increase with decreasing cavitation numbers...|$|R

The evolution is followed to the onset of hydrogen mixing into a convection, driven by the helium flash at red giant or asymptotic giant branch phase. The models of mass M ≥ 0. 9 M ⊙ undergo the central hydrogen flash, triggered by the carbon production due to the 3 α reaction. We find that {{the border of the}} off-center and central ignition of helium core flash falls between 1. 1 and 1. 2 M⊙; the models of mass M ≤ 1. 1 M ⊙ experience the hydrogen <b>mixing</b> at the <b>tip</b> of red giant branch while the models of M = 1. 2 M ⊙ during the helium shell flashes on the asymptotic giant branch. The equation of state for the Coulomb liquid region, where electron conduction and radiation compete, is shown to be important since it affects the thermal state in the helium core and influences the red giant branch evolution. It is also found that the non-resonant term of 3 α reaction plays an important role, although it has negligible effect in the evolution of stars of younger populations. We compare our models with the computations by several other sets of authors, to confirm the good agreement except for one study which finds the helium ignition much closer to the center with consequences important for subsequent evolution.

40|$|In {{many cases}} cracks leading to {{fracture}} occur at interfaces between two different constituents, e. g. a fiber and the matrix in a composite. The early solutions of such {{problems in the}} context of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) revealed the presence of an unsatisfactory behavior: rapid oscillations in the stress and displacement fields, implying the physically impossible phenomenon of interpenetration. In the late seventies two major modifications were proposed: one by Atkinson and the other by Comninou. The Atkinson modification recognizes that the interface between two different materials is almost never sharp, and provides a gradual transition which avoids the oscillatory behavior. The Comninou approach simply resolves the interface crack problem by accepting its inherently unilateral nature (presence of inequalities) and allowing for partial closure at the tips. Both solutions have received high praise and severe criticism, especially since the oscillatory behavior is absent in some, at least, classes of nonlinear materials (Knowles and Sternberg). Current emphasis is placed on numerical models of the elastoplastic behavior of interface cracks. An additional complication is the apparent presence of <b>mixed</b> mode crack <b>tip</b> fields regardless of the type of the applied loading. Valuable as these theoretical efforts may be, it is becoming increasingly imperative to perform experiments to determine the mode of propagation and critical parameters governing interface fracture. Even then, the results must be viewed with caution, because the quantities of interest can only be determined indirectly.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a rapidly moving transient crack in functionally graded materials (FGMs) is investigated theoretically and experimentally. First, a systematic theoretical analysis is presented {{for the development of}} the transient elastodynamic local stress, strain, and displacement field expansions near a growing <b>mixed</b> mode crack <b>tip</b> in FGMs. The crack propagation direction is assumed to be inclined to the di-rection of the property variation. The displacement potential approach in conjunction with asymptotic analysis is utilized to derive explicit expressions for stress, strain, and in-plane displacement fields. The transient crack growth is assumed to include processes in which both the crack tip speed and the dynamic stress intensity factor are differentiable functions of time. These stress fields are used to generate the contours of constant maximum shear stress (isochromatics fringes) and the effect of transient crack growth on these contours is discussed. To further understand the transient crack growth behavior, a series of dynamic fracture experiments are performed with functionally graded material fabricated in-house. The phenomenon of transition from a static crack to a dynamic mode I crack is examined in these experiments. The full-field stress data around the crack is recorded using dynamic photoelasticity and high-speed digital photography. Due to opaqueness of FGMs, birefringent coatings are employed to obtain the full-field isochromatics around the crack tip. The stress field expansions developed in the first part of the study are used to interpret the experimental observations. The results of the experiments showed that the higher order transient expansion provides an accurate representation of crack tip fields under severe transient conditions. 1...|$|R

Data from large, in-ground lysimeters at the Purdue University Water Quality Field Station near West Lafayette, IN were used from plots on soils characterized predominantly as Drummer silty clay loam. This included hourly drain flow collected from 265 m 2 clay-lined lysimeters over a sixteen year period (1995 – 2011). Nitrate concentration samples were collected as a <b>mixed</b> composite of <b>tips</b> accumulated every 24 to 72 hours during storm events from 1998 – 2011. A paired regression {{analysis was used to}} mitigate environmental and climatic impacts on inter-tile variability to quantify shifts in total event flow. Miscanthus-transitioned tile mean event flow decreased significantly at p≤ 0. 20, while switchgrass-transitioned tile response varied across replicates, including significant decreases (p≤ 0. 10) and significant increases (p≤ 0. 05) in mean event flow. Average nitrate concentration decreased significantly in response to switchgrass and Miscanthus cropping system transitions. ^ Nitrate concentrations were significantly lower in Miscanthus -transitioned tiles compared to switchgrass and mixed prairie system tiles once plants were established. Cumulative event nitrate loads were also significantly lower for all perennial plots compared to continuous maize control. Results suggest that although transition into switchgrass and Miscanthus predominantly decreases total event flow, increases in tile drain event flow may be observed due to site-specific conditions including preferential flow. Perennial crops decreased tile nitrate concentrations significantly, which resulted in significantly lower net load from perennial system tile drains. ...|$|R

Based on the experimental data and on the numerical results collected at SISTEMAR and at the University of Genoa in the case of Contracted and Tip Loaded (CLT) propellers, a new tip loaded propeller geometry is devised in order to mitigate some of the downsides of the CLT geometries increasingly adopted to improve full-scale propeller efficiency. The modified tip loaded propeller, i. e. a <b>mix</b> between a <b>tip</b> rake and a Contracted and Tip Loaded propeller, is designed via an optimization strategy using a Boundary Elements Method (BEM), a custom parametric description of the unconventional blade geometry and an optimization algorithm (of genetic type) within the modeFRONTIER environment.

At first, the accuracy of the BEM, adopted for the design by optimization, is verified in terms of predicted propeller performance in order to assess its applicability for the analysis of modified tip geometries and check its confidence with respect to the allowable modifications of the blade shape. As a second step, viscous calculations are adopted to confirm the improvements of the newly designed geometries, in terms of both cavitation and predicted velocity field downstream the propeller, {{as a result of a}} better adaptation of the end plate geometry to the incoming flow.

40|$|Control of {{compressor}} {{tip clearance}} flows is explored in a linear cascade using {{three types of}} fluidic actuators; Normal Synthetic Jet (NSJ; unsteady jet normal to the mean flow with zero net mass flux), Directed Synthetic Jet (DSJ; injection roughly aligned with the mean flow), and Steady Directed Jet (SDJ), mounted on the casing wall. The objective is to affect the following measures: (1) reduction of tip leakage flow rate, (2) <b>mixing</b> enhancement between <b>tip</b> leakage and core flow, and (3) increase in streamwise momentum of the flow in the endwall region. The measurements show that the NSJ provides mixing enhancement only, or both mixing enhancement and leakage flow reduction, depending on its pitchwise location. The DSJ and SDJ actuators provide streamwise momentum enhancement with a consequent reduction of clearance-related blockage. The blockage reduction {{associated with the use}} of NSJ is sensitive to actuator frequency, whereas that with the use of DSJ is not. For a given actuation amplitude, DSJ and SDJ are about twice as effective as NSJ in reducing clearance-related blockage. Further the DSJ and SDJ can eliminate clearance-related blockage with a time-averaged momentum flux roughly 16 % of the momentum flux of the leakage flow. (cont.) However, achieving overall gain in efficiency appears to be hard; the decrease in loss is only about 30 % of the expended flow power from the present SDJ actuator, which is the best among the actuators considered. Guidelines for improving the efficiency of the directed jet actuation are presented. Time-resolved measurements show periodic unsteadiness of the tip clearance vortex with the peak frequency corresponding to the optimum condition for blockage reduction with the NSJ. A physical explanation of the source of the observed periodic unsteadiness is suggested based on trailing vortex instability theory. Observations of the time scale for the unsteadiness from different compressor geometries and flow conditions are shown to scale with a reduced frequency based on convective time through the blade passage. by Jinwoo Bae.

It is proposed {{the making of a}} reinforcing synthetic resin, such as a crust, with an adequate thickness for the size of the piece and molder pressure, light and easy to make-even handicraft- models 1. CURRENT MATERIALS USED IN PATTERN-MAKING [1, 4] Nowadays in the casting, forming technology are used sample piece made from different materials such as: wood, (different <b>tips),</b> <b>mixed</b> metal (aluminum, copper, iron) and synthetics resin. Generally these samples are massive, and they have disadvantages like: massy weight, big consume of materials, difficult manufacturing and a sophisticate technology. It is possible the manufacturing of light samples made from different tips of composite materials, crust tip models which fulfill all the forming needs. In the attempts made by “ Transilvania ” University of Brasov, U. T. S. M., some current synthetic resin –matrix and complementary materials –glass fiber were tested. 1. 1.

40|$|Analysis of Argo data {{obtained}} during winter 2011 – 2012 revealed the presence over the Irminger Basin of an exceptionally {{large number of}} profiles (41) with mixed layer depths (MLD) exceeding 700 m, which was deep enough to reach the pool of the intermediate Labrador Sea Water located in the Irminger Sea. Four of these profiles exhibited an MLD of 1000 m, which was the maximum value observed for the winter in question. The Argo sampling in the Irminger Sea during that winter, which was 3 to 4 times greater than for the preceding winters, enabled the different phases of the mixed layer deepening down to 1000 m, together with their spatial extents, to be observed for the first time. Two intense convective periods occurred: in late January south of Cape Farewell and in late February-early March east of Greenland. A final deepening period was observed in mid-March, during which the deepest mixed layers were observed. This long deepening period occurred in large regional areas and {{was followed by a}} rapid restratification phase. The temporal evolution of oxygen profiles from one Argo float testifies to the local and rapid ventilation of the mixed layer by the deep convection. A mixed layer heat budget along the trajectories of the 4 floats that sampled the deepest mixed layers showed that heat loss at the air-sea interface was mainly responsible for heat content variations in the <b>mixed</b> layer. Greenland <b>Tip</b> Jets were of primary importance for the development of deep convection in the Irminger Sea in the winter of 2011 – 2012. They enhanced the winter heat loss and two long (more than 24 hours), intense late events close together in time pushed the mixed layer deepening down to 1000 m. Net air-sea fluxes, the number of Greenland Tip Jets, the stratification of the water column, the NAO index and the Ekman-induced heat flux are pertinent indicators to assess conditions that are favorable for the development of deep convection in the Irminger Sea. By considering each of those indicators, it was concluded that the 2011 - 2012 event was not significantly different from the three other documented occurrences of deep convection in the Irminger Sea...|$|R
40|$|It is {{necessary}} apical plug material to exhibit proper adaptation with the root canal walls. Presence of voids at {{the interface between}} the root canal wall and this material result in micro leakage, which might {{have a relationship with}} post treatment disease. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect of different mixing (manual and ultrasonic) and placement (manual and manual in association with indirect ultrasonic) method of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) on the void count and dimension in the apical plug in natural teeth with simulated open apices. Eighty human maxillary central incisors were selected. After simulation of the open apex model, the teeth were assigned to 4 groups based on the mixing and placement techniques of MTA: group 1, manual mixing and manual placement; group 2, manual mixing and manual placement in association with indirect ultrasonic; group 3, ultrasonic mixing and and manual placement; and group 4, ultrasonic mixing and manual placement in association with indirect ultrasonic. The prepared samples were placed within gypsum sockets in which the periodontal ligament was reconstructed with polyether impression material. In group 1, after mixing, the material was condensed with a hand plugger. In group 2, after <b>mixing,</b> the ultrasonic <b>tip</b> was contacted with the hand plugger for 2 seconds. In groups 3 and 4, mixing was carried out with the ultrasonic tip for 5 seconds and in groups 3 and 4, similar to groups 1 and 2, respectively, the materials were placed as apical plugs, measuring 3 mm in length. A wet cotton pellet was placed at canal orifices and dressed with Cavit. After one week, the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) technique was used to count the number of voids between the material and root canal walls. The void dimensions were determined using the following scoring system: score 1, absence of voids; score 2, the void size less than half of the dimensions of the evaluated cross-section; score 3, the void size larger than half of the dimensions of the evaluated cross-section. Chi-squared and Fisher?s exact tests were used for statistical analyses. Statistical significance was set at P 0. 05). Evaluation of void dimensions showed no score 3 in any of the study groups and the dimensions of all the voids conformed to score 2. Under the limitations of the present study, use of ultrasonic mixing and manual placement techniques resulted in a decrease in the number of voids in the apical plug...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of a large}} rotor tip gap on the {{performance}} of a one and half stage axial compressor are investigated in detail with a numerical simulation based on LES and available PIV data. The current paper studies the main flow physics, including why and how the loss generation is increased with the large rotor tip gap. The present study reveals that when the tip gap becomes large, tip clearance fluid goes over the tip clearance core vortex and enters into the next blade's tip gap, which is called double-leakage tip clearance flow. As the tip clearance flow enters into the adjacent blade's tip gap, a vortex rope with a lower pressure core is generated. This vortex rope breaks up the tip clearance core vortex of the adjacent blade, resulting in a large additional <b>mixing.</b> This double-leakage <b>tip</b> clearance flow occurs at all operating conditions, from design flow to near stall condition, with the large tip gap for the current compressor stage. The double-leakage tip clearance flow, its interaction with the tip clearance core vortex of the adjacent blade, and the resulting large mixing loss are the main flow mechanism of the large rotor tip gap in the compressor. When the tip clearance is smaller, flow near the end wall follows more closely with the main passage flow and this double-leakage tip clearance flow does not happen near the design flow condition for the current compressor stage. When the compressor with a large tip gap operates at near stall operation, a strong vortex rope is generated near the leading edge due to the double-leakage flow. Part of this vortex separates from the path of the tip clearance core vortex and travels from the suction side of the blade toward the pressure side of the blade. This vortex is generated periodically at near stall operation with a large tip gap. As the vortex travels from the suction side to the pressure side of the blade, a large fluctuation of local pressure forces blade vibration. Nonsynchronous blade vibration occurs due to this vortex as the frequency of this vortex generation {{is not the same as}} the rotor. The present investigation confirms that this vortex is a part of separated tip clearance vortex, which is caused by the double-leakage tip clearance flow...|$|R
40|$|In this master thesis the {{meandering}} of {{the wake}} of a three bladed horizontal axis model wind turbine has been studied. Measurements have been conducted by the use of four hot-wire probes located at multiple nearby points in the wake at X/D = 1, 3 and 5 downstream the model wind turbine. The meandering has been studied based on the location of the tip vortices shed by the turbine blades. The experiments were conducted in the wind tunnel at NTNU at the Department of Energy and Process Engineering. The aim {{of the study was to}} see the effect on the meandering of {{the wake of}} the model turbine when placed in an incoming flow with turbulence intensity typical for atmospheric turbulence, compared to an incoming flow with a low turbulence intensity round 0. 3 %. The atmospheric turbulence was generated by inserting a grid in the inlet to the test section in the wind tunnel. The grid generated a turbulence intensity round 5. 5 % and integral length scales of Luuz = 3. 1 E- 2 m and Luux = 6. 5 E- 2 m at the position of the model wind turbine in the tunnel. The performance of the model turbine in both incoming flows was calculated based on measurements of the thrust and torque acting on the turbine in a free stream velocity of 10 m/s. The greatest deviation in the performance curve was found at the top of the curve; however the difference between the two cases was minor. Initial measurements with a single hot-wire probe was conducted in the wake of the turbine to locate the tip vortices. Based on these results, the location to conduct the multiple hot-wire measurements was decided. Already at this stage the effect of the grid turbulence was evident due to the smeared out energy in the flow in the wake caused by diffusion and <b>mixing.</b> The <b>tip</b> speed ratio (TSR) of the model wind turbine was 6 in the case without grid generated turbulence, and 7 in the case with grid turbulence during the final measurements in the wake. The effect of the change in TSR was evaluated, and it was found that new measurements were not needed. The normal stress based on the velocity measurements in the wake were phase averaged according to the position of the turbine blade using Matlab. When comparing these results with the normal stress calculated directly from the time series, it was found that the tip vortices had merged together or broken up at all measurement point except at X/D = 1 downstream the turbine without grid generated turbulence. Using power spectral density function (PSD) the observations were confirmed. The tip vortices was not equally distributed within the wake and were located 30 &# 176;, 128 &# 176; and 224 &# 176; at respectively z/R = 1. 12, 1. 15 and 1. 20. Their diameters were found to be 1. 8 E- 2 m, 1. 35 E- 2 m, 2. 7 E- 2 m in z direction. The location of the peak in the normal stress tended to meander a bit back and forth, mainly directed towards the rotor center, with a distance from 4. 5 E- 3 m to 1. 8 E- 2 m, and in the streamwise direction with a total distance of 6. 17 E- 2 m. The tip vortices seem to meander individually within the wake, and not with the same distance. Based on the results and observations conducted throughout this study, new measurements should be conducted at a shorter distance to the turbine rotor to be able to compare the meandering of the wake for the two different incoming flows. </p...|$|R
40|$|Flow through {{tip shroud}} cavity in a {{representative}} axial turbine vane-rotor stage environment is assessed for {{its role in}} loss generation and turbine durability. Steady and unsteady three-dimensional flow computations, complemented by control volume analyses, for varying shroud configurations provided results for establishing quantitative links between loss and ow processes as well as loss level scalings. Specifically tip shroud cavity flow is dominated by two counter-rotating vortices upstream, and a free expansion leakage jet downstream, of the tip seal, followed by a mixing shear layer at cavity exit. One of the vortices, the cavity inlet toroidal vortex, sets the loss level within the cavity inlet and the mass ow recirculated out of the cavity into the main flow path. It is found that tip shroud cavity flow incurs a 0 : 85 % debit in stage eciency per 1 % of main flow fluid through the cavity with approximately 50 % generated in the free expansion of the tip seal leakage jet and 50 % from cavity exit mixing. The proportion of total loss attributable to cavity exit <b>mixing</b> increases with <b>tip</b> seal gap. In addition, vane-rotor unsteady interaction induces an additional 0 : 25 % debit in eciency per 1 % of main flow fluid through the cavity. The additional efficiency penalty induced by vane-rotor unsteady interaction results from an enhancement of the cavity inlet toroidal vortex and associated recirculated mass flow. Overall cavity loss is set by cavity mass flow fraction, stagnation pressure ratio across tip seal, velocity disparity between cavity exit flow and rotor exit flow, and cavity inlet vortex strength. These findings were used to formulate a modified tip shroud configuration that nearly eliminates cavity exit mixing loss, but it incurs a penalty associated with cavity flow low Reynolds number effects and induced mismatching between vane and modified tip shroud. In the process of designing this modified tip shroud, {{it was found that}} the turbine main flow perceives the cavity as a line sink-source pair, permitting estimation of flow redistribution in the main flow path. Finally, any operational transients which eliminate tip seal clearance would lead to enhanced impingement heat transfer at blade tip due to recirculating ow from cavity inlet; this can increase the likelihood of blade failure. by Timothy R.

40|$|Authors: Edward Hutchinson & Ervin Fodor ### Abstract It {{is often}} useful to {{concentrate}} and purify the pleomorphic, enveloped virions of influenza viruses prior to analysis. This protocol describes a standard method for purifying ‘spherical’ influenza virions, {{the most common}} morphology of laboratory-adapted strains, by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous density gradient. The protocol, which takes around eight hours to complete, is designed for virions shed into the growth media of infected cells, and would also be suitable for concentrating virions from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs. Two different density gradients are described: a conventional gradient of sucrose and a gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep™ density gradient medium). A high degree of virion purity can be achieved, but small quantities of contaminants will remain. These can be removed by an optional haemadsorption-elution (HAd) step, which takes an additional one and half hours. This allows extremely efficient removal of the original contaminants, but introduces other, distinct contaminants at low levels. ### Materials Consumables required: 1. 0. 45 μm syringe filters - 50 ml syringes - 50 ml plastic tubes - 15 ml plastic tubes – optional - Thickwall tubes for the SW 28 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 25 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 355642) - Thinwall tubes for the SW 41 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 14 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 331372) - 5 ml syringe and needle (21 G or similar) - 1. 5 ml tubes - Standard plasticware, pipettes, permanent marker pen Reagents required: 1. 10 × NTC solution (1 M NaCl, 0. 2 M Tris-HCl pH 7. 4, 50 mM CaCl 2) - sucrose or OptiPrep™ density gradient medium (Sigma; D 1556) - sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - ddH 2 O - adult chicken blood cells in Alsever’s (TCS Biosciences; FB 010) – optional ### Equipment 1. Rotating wheel – optional - Refrigerator - 37 °C water bath - Benchtop centrifuge with refrigeration (e. g. a Rotanta 460 R, Hettich Lab Technology) - Mass balance - Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) - Beckman Coulter SW 28 swinging bucket rotor - Beckman Coulter SW 41 swinging bucket rotor - Aspiration vessel suitable for infectious material (e. g. an Integra Vacusafe; optional) - - 80 °C freezer ### Procedure 1. Prepare solutions in advance and store in the refrigerator – all should be used cold. Prepare: - a. 1 × NTC solution (from 10 × stock). - b. Working dilutions for the density gradient. If using sucrose, make 50 ml aliquots of 30, 40, 50 and 60 % solutions (w/v) by adding the required mass of sucrose to 5 ml 10 × NTC and topping up with ddH 2 O. Mix on a rotating wheel until dissolved, then pass through an 0. 45 μm syringe filter into a clean 50 ml tube. Mix equal amounts of these solutions in additional tubes to produce 35, 45 and 55 % solutions (w/v). If using OptiPrep™, follow a similar procedure to prepare a 10 – 40 % (w/v) series of iodixanol solutions in NTC (OptiPrep™ is 60 % iodixanol, so 12 ml solutions at 10, 20, 30 and 40 % should contain 1. 2 ml 10 × NTC and 2, 4, 6 and 8 ml OptiPrep™, respectively. Intermediate concentrations (15, 25 and 35 %) can be prepared by mixing, as above.) - c. To prepare a step gradient, layer 1. 5 ml {{of each of the}} seven solutions into a thinwall tube. Starting with the most concentrated solution, use a pipette to slowly add layers, 0. 75 ml at a time, taking care not to mix layers (the interfaces of different concentrations should remain visible). Gradients can be prepared in advance and stored at 4 °C (some mixing by diffusion is acceptable); if prepared during the purification this should be done during the first ultracentrifugation step. If only one gradient is required a balance can be quickly prepared by mixing 5. 25 ml of the most and least concentrated solutions, or using 10. 5 ml of the middle concentration. - d. If performing HAd, prepare chicken blood. To prevent lysis, blood should be centrifuged at no more than 1, 250 g (around 2, 500 rpm if using 15 ml tubes in a benchtop centrifuge, depending on the rotor) at 10 °C; although it should be kept cold it should not be put directly on ice. On receipt cells should be rinsed twice in chilled PBS. Comparison of the cell pellet to liquid in another tube should be used to estimate the volume of cells, and the pellet resuspended in PBS to 20 % packed cell volume (pcv) for storage in the refrigerator. If haemolysis occurs during storage the cells should be rinsed again in PBS and resuspended in an appropriate volume. When about to begin purification, pre-warm an aliquot of PBS to 37 °C. - Prepare virus to be concentrated. A maximum of 150 ml of virus-containing medium can be prepared without prior HAd. This can be obtained from six 175 cm 2 tissue culture flasks which have been seeded with a suitable cell line (e. g. Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells), infected when sub-confluent with an influenza virus at a low multiplicity of infection, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for approximately 48 h. - When the virus is ready to harvest, extensive cytopathic effect will be apparent by microscopy. Transfer the media to six 50 ml tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at approximately 2000 g (around 4, 000 rpm, depending on the rotor) to pellet cellular debris. - Transfer the supernatant to six (thickwall) tubes and place in the buckets of an SW 28 rotor. Weigh the buckets (with the lids on) and transfer media between them as necessary to balance. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at 18, 000 g (10, 000 rpm) in an SW 28 rotor to further pellet cellular debris. Retain 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - If extremely high purity is required (and chicken red blood cell contaminants are not problematic) perform HAd as described in steps (3) – (9). Otherwise, proceed to step (10). - Optional. Transfer supernatants to six clean, chilled 50 ml tubes and add 325 μl of chicken red blood cells (20 % pcv) to each tube. Mix by gentle inversion and refrigerate for 30 min, inverting regularly. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend all pellet in a single aliquot of 10 ml chilled PBS – to do so, sequentially rinse each tube with the same 5 ml aliquot of PBS, repeat with a second 5 ml aliquot, and pool both aliquots a single 15 ml tube. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml chilled PBS (some agglutination of cells is likely to be apparent). Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml 37 °C PBS, transfer to a clean, room-temperature 50 ml tube and increase the volume to 20 ml with 37 °C PBS. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min, mixing regularly by gentle inversion. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C), and take 100 μl of the supernatant for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Prepare two thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol. Gently layer the supernatant onto the 5 ml cushion, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Add 20 ml PBS or water to the second tube to balance. Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volume of the balance tube as necessary. Proceed to step (11). - If HAd was not performed, prepare 6 thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol in each. Gently layer the supernatants onto the 5 ml cushions, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 28 rotor at 4 °C for 90 min at 112, 000 g (25, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatants, taking care not to disturb the pellet (which may not be visible). When nearing the bottom of the tube, run the aspiration pipette around the meniscus and tilt away from the pellet to remove the supernatant. Add 50 μl chilled 1 × NTC to each tube (or around 500 μl to the single tube if HAd was used) and resuspend by pipetting up and down. Pool the suspension and layer gently onto the top of a density gradient (see 1. c, above) taking care not to mix the layers. Place the gradient tube and a balance tube into SW 41 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 150 min at 209, 000 g (35, 000 rpm). Afterwards, the virions should be visible as a ‘milky’ band of material at around 40 % sucrose or 30 % iodixanol. Hold the tube against a dark background and use a pen to mark the position of the meniscus and of the virions. Secure the tube and, using a 5 ml syringe and needle, carefully pierce the side of the tube a few millimetres below the virions. While moving the needle tip gently forwards and backwards, withdraw around 1 cm height of the gradient (1 – 2 ml), including the band of virions. Eject the contents of the syringe into a new thinwall tube containing 9 ml chilled 1 × NTC, and rinse out the syringe once in this solution. Place the tube and a balance tube in SW 41 rotor buckets weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 60 min at 154, 000 g (30, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet. Add around 80 μl chilled 1 ×NTC and resuspend by pipetting; this should give around 150 μl of a milky solution of purified virions. Reserve around 10 % for analysis, and store the rest in a 1. 5 ml tube at - 80 °C. ### Timing - 1. Solution preparation. When convenient. - 2. Generation of virus. Two days. - 3. Harvesting and clarification. 40 min. - 4. Transfer, balance and clarification. 50 min. - 5 – 9. HAd (optional). 90 min. - 10. Layering onto cushions. 15 min. - 11. Ultracentrifugation. 120 min. - 12. Ultracentrifugation. 180 min. - 13. Ultracentrifugation. 80 min. Approximate time for purifications (steps 3 – 13) : 8 hours without HAd, 9 and a half hours with HAd. ### Troubleshooting - Growth of virus can be assessed before beginning by microscopic examination of cells (step 3). If no cytopathic effect is visible it is unlikely that there will be enough virus to purify. - With the volumes described, concentrated virus should be visible in steps 12 and 13 (though a dark background may be necessary in step 12, and the band may be faint). Additional bands may appear in step 12 depending on the mixing of the gradient steps and on the morphology of the virus; for most applications the major band can be harvested, but if this is ambiguous the entire gradient can be harvested in aliquots from the top (step 13 is then not required). - Samples taken throughout the purification can help to identify problems. A number of assays can be used to detect virions, including plaque assay (to detect fully infectious virions – typically recovery of infectious material is around 10 – 30 %) and SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining (to assess purity). If chicken blood is being used a quick assay for the presence of virions (whether infectious or not) can be performed while other steps are being carried out using a modified haemagglutination (HA) assay. In a 96 -well round-bottomed dish add 50 μl PBS to 11 of the 12 columns, leaving the first column empty (a multi-channel pipette is helpful throughout this assay). In the first column add 100 μl of sample or PBS (up to eight samples per dish; material from the final step in the purification should only be used if heavily diluted beforehand), and perform twofold serial dilutions of this by transferring 50 μl into the second column, <b>mixing,</b> changing pipette <b>tip</b> and repeating across the dish. Then add 50 μl chicken red blood cells (at 1 % pcv) to each well, mix and leave to stand, preferably at 4 °C. For each sample the last dilution in which the blood cells agglutinate and cannot settle {{to the bottom of the}} well contains one haemagglutinating unit (HAU). Note that, as this is a modification of the standard assay, the HAU values here are useful only for relative measures and should not be compared to other experiments. Note also that the assay is rather insensitive to low concentrations of virus. Typical end-points are 1 / 128 for the input material (in 120 ml) and 1 / 512 after HAd (in 20 ml – i. e. around 2 / 3 recovery of material). ### Anticipated Results The method described should result in a thousand-fold decrease in volume with, typically, a 10 – 30 % recovery of infectious material (plaque-forming units). As some virus will be inactivated during purification the physical recovery of material is likely to be better than this. Electron microscopy shows that virions generally remain intact during purification (see Fig 1 b of ref (1) and Fig 1 b of ref (2)). Purification without HAd is sufficient to remove the majority of contaminating material, as can be seen by SDS-PAGE and silver staining in Fig 1 a of ref (1) and Fig 1 a of ref (2), and this is likely to be sufficient for the majority of applications. However, as shown in Fig 3 b of ref (2) low levels of contaminants are still present when material is purified in this way. These contaminants can be excluded by HAd, as shown in Fig 3 c of ref (2), though this method introduces additional contaminants derived from chicken red blood cells. Readers interested in the presence of specific protein contaminants after purification with and without HAd are referred to the supplementary data of ref (2). ### References 1. Hutchinson, E.
