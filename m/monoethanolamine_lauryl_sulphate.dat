40|$|Moisturizers {{are often}} used in the {{prevention}} and treatment of irritant contact dermatitis. The {{present study was to}} deter-mine whether long-term daily use of a moisturizer on normal skin would a¡ect skin barrier function, hydration state, or susceptibility to sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Healthy volunteers used a moisturizer on one forearm 3 times daily for 4 weeks. The other forearm served as a control. Afterwards both forearms were challenged with a patch-test of sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Skin barrier function was evaluated by measuring trans-epidermal water loss and skin hydration by measuring electrical capacitance. Electrical capacitance was signi¢-cantly increased on the treated arm during the treatment period. After challenge with sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate,</b> trans-epidermal water loss was signi¢cantly higher on the arm treated with moisturizer than on the control arm. The results suggest that long-term treatment with moisturizers on normal skin may increase skin susceptibility to irritants.

40|$|Excystment agents (extract of Escherichia coli, living E. coli and glutamic acid) {{failed to}} cause excystment of Schizopyrenus russelli cysts in the {{presence}} of either emetine or compounds I and I 1 (structurally based on emetine). A very high percentage of the cysts excysted {{in the presence}} of the excystment agents after the removal of emetine, showing that the treated cysts were viable. Ninhydrin reaction, using a fixed amount of glutamic acid and increasing concentrations of emetine, showed progressive inhibition of colour development. This suggests the possible binding of excystment factor to emetine, thus preventing excystment. Excystment inducing property of the excystment agents could not be prevented {{in the presence of}} carbarsone. When the cysts were treated with sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> and then with emetine or with sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> and emetine together, there was hardly any excystment.

40|$|An {{occlusive}} patch-test assay {{has been}} developed for assessment of topical retinoid action in human epidermis. Previous work with this assay has demonstrated marked epidermal hyperplasia in skin treated with topical all- trans -retinoic acid for 4 days and similar effects with the local irritant, sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate.</b> To investigate the capabilities of this assay further, a time-course and dose-response were performed with all- trans -retinoic acid, and a comparison made with sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate.</b> At no time, between 1 and 4 days, could the clinical or histological effects of 0. 1 % and 0. 025 % cream formulations of all- trans -retinoic acid be distinguished from each other. Epidermal hyperplasia was used to generate a 4 -day dose-response for all-trans-retinoic acid at concentrations from 0. 00 l to 0. 025 % dissolved in a 70 % ethanol/ 30 % propylene glycol vehicle. All- trans -retinoic acid could he successfully differentiated from sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> at 2 days {{by virtue of its}} greater ability to increase epidermal thickness, spongiosis and glycosaminoglycan deposition. It appears that although all- trans -retinoic acid and sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> produce similar epidermal histological changes at 4 days, significant differences at earlier time-points suggest differing mechanisms of action. In addition, this in vivo human assay is able to provide potency ranking for doses of all- trans -retinoic acid, and may predict clinical efficacy of retinoids in improvement of acne and/or photodamage...|$|R

Osmotic drug delivery system was chosen as controlled drug delivery system. The porous osmotic pump tablets were designed using Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken factorial design {{to find out the}} best formulation. For screening of three categories of polymers, six independent variables were chosen for Plackett-Burman design. Osmotic agent sodium chloride and microcrystalline cellulose, pore forming agent sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> and sucrose, and coating agent ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate were chosen as independent variables. Optimization of osmotic tablets was done by Box-Behnken design by selecting three independent variables.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim {{of present}} study was to enhance topical {{permeation}} of clotrimazole gel preparation by using various permeability enhancers such as coconut oil, pistachio oil and sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (SLS). Clotrimazole gel preparations were prepared and optimized by using three factor, five level central composite design. A second-order polynomial equation was generated in order to estimate the effect of independent variables i. e. coconut oil (X 1), pistachio oil (X 2) and sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (X 3) at various dependent variables i. e. flux (Y 1), lag time (Y 2), diffusion coefficient (Y 3), permeability coefficient (Y 4), and input rate (Y 5) of clotrimazole gel formulations. Ex vivo skin permeation study was performed through rat skin by using modified Franz diffusion cell system. Optimized formulation F 8 exhibited highest flux 2. 17 µg/cm 2 /min, permeability coefficient 0. 0019 cm/min and input rate 1. 543 µg/cm 2 /min, along with moderate lag time 77. 27 min and diffusion coefficient 0. 063 cm 2 /min, which is further supported by anti-fungal activity that exhibited more prominent zone of inhibition against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Mucor. Thus, it can be concluded that permeation of clotrimazole gel was enhanced by various combination of coconut oil, pistachio oil and sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> but optimized formulation F 8 containing 0. 4 ml pistachio oil, 0. 8 ml coconut oil and 0. 04 g of SLS exhibited more pronounced and promising effect through rat skin...|$|R

40|$|Background & Aim: The {{hot water}} extract of {{a mixture of}} Anogeissus leiocarpus and Prosopis africana is widely used in the {{northern}} part of Nigeria for the treatment and management of asthma. Since investigations of its pharmacological activities already justify its use, and the need for standardization of herbal medicine and develop appropriate dosage forms has continued to grow, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of some common channelling agents (sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate and sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate)</b> on the compaction properties of the mixed stem bark extracts of Anogeissus leiocarpus and Prosopis africana. Experimental: Granules of the mixed extracts (AA 1) were produced using the wet granulation method of massing and screening. The micromeritics and flow properties of the extracts as well as the effects of the three common additives were studied, while the compaction properties of the extract formulated alone and in the presence of these additives were interrogated using the Heckel equation. Results: Our results showed that, all the formulations containing the channelling agents exhibited poor flow. Granules prepared using sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) exhibited plastic deformation during consolidation, those formulated using calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) showed initial fragmentation before consolidation by plastic deformation and those formulated using sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> consolidated essentially by plastic deformation. Inclusion of additives modified the compressibility profiles of the formulations.

40|$|In {{order to}} gain a greater insight into the complex {{mechanisms}} of action of different irritant chemicals on the skin, we have studied the behavior of epidermal CD 1 + cells in experimentally induced irritant contact dermatitis. Healthy, human volunteers were patch tested for 48 h with the following six chemically unrelated irritants and their appropriate vehicle controls; benzalkonium chloride, sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate,</b> dithranol, nonanoic acid, croton oil, and propylene glycol. After visually assessing and grading the resulting inflammatory reactions, punch biopsies were taken and the morphology and density of CD 1 + cells in the epidermis studied using immunocytochemical techniques in combination with image analysis and electron microscopy. Statistically significant decreases in the epidermal density of CD 1 + cells occurred in the responses to dithranol (p < 0. 05) and nonanoic acid (p < 0. 01). Importantly, these changes in density were not simply due to variations in the intensity of inflammatory response (r = 0. 1157). Alterations in {{the length of the}} dendritic processes of CD 1 + cells were also induced, and semi-quantitative analysis revealed significant decreases in dendrite length in the reactions to sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (p < 0. 05), nonanoic acid (p < 0. 001), croton oil (p < 0. 05), and dithranol (p < 0. 005). Unlike epidermal density, however, this effect on cell morphology was directly related to the severity of inflammation (r = - 0. 74, p < 0. 01). Morphologic evidence of cellular injury to Langerhans cells was seen by electron microscopy in the majority of biopsies, although relatively few cells were affected in sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> and propylene glycol reactions.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Administering adsorbates such as {{activated}} charcoal can treat acute poisoning from chemicals and pesticides. It {{has been suggested}} that {{activated charcoal}} is an effective antidote for virtually all organic and inorganic compounds. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. Adsorbents used were chitosan, activated charcoal, silica and humic acids. Adsorbates used were paracetamol, prazosin hydrochloride, cimetidine, fluoxetine hydrochloride, conjugated estrogens and amitraz. Amitraz is widely used in South Africa and amitraz adsorption studies were performed to gain an insight into effective pesticide waste and dip vat management. This study used different solution properties to determine their influence on the hydrolysis of amitraz. Amitraz hydrolysis could be described as a pseudo-first order rate process and a type ABCD pH rate profile. Hydrolysis increased with temperature and was fastest at low pH, slowest at neutral to slightly alkaline pH, and slightly increased above pH 10. Hydrolysis was fastest in water, slower in propylene glycol and ethanol solutions and slowest in DMSO mixtures. In surfactant solutions, anionic micelles enhanced and cationic micelles retarded the hydrolysis rate. The half-live of amitraz was reduced from 27 days for the aqueous suspension in buffer pH 5. 8 containing 0. 5 % sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> to 8 hours and 12 hours when 1 % potassium oxihumate was added. Adsorbents were mixed with amitraz solution for 24 hours at 31 °C. Study results proved that coarse activated charcoal powder adsorbed more than the other adsorbents used and can be used to treat amitraz poisoning or to manage spills. A study was also done to investigate amitraz adsorption on pears and oranges. Fruit soaked in amitraz solution for 5 minutes and left to dry for 24 hours, were washed in solutions of distilled water, sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate,</b> cetrimide and Tween 80. Four crystal forms of amitraz were identified by their crystal morphology, XRPD patterns, aqueous solubility and thermal properties. Form C was the most stable with t½ of 136 days. Forms B and D were least stable with t½ of 28 days. Stability correlated with solubility differences. The addition of sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> increased hydrolysis (t½ = 17 hours) and no difference in stability of crystal forms in anionic surfactant solutions occurred. Adsorption activity of activated charcoal and chitosan were done on OTC drugs. The official dissolution media, simulated gastric and intestinal fluids were used. Cimetidine did not adsorb onto activated charcoal or chitosan tablets. Adsorption of paracetamol was minimal. Prazosin hydrochloride and fluoxetine hydrochloride were strongly adsorbed by activated charcoal with no adsorption onto chitosan. Conjugated estrogens were adsorbed by chitosan and not by activated charcoal. Anionic surfactants such as sodium <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulphate</b> can potentially be used for cleaning up amitraz, as it demonstrated increased solubilisation and hydrolysis of amitraz. Activated charcoal can be used to treat many drug poisonings and overdoses. Doctora...|$|R
