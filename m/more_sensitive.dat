5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and {{are more prone to}} adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|Foliose lichens such as Physcia caesia are {{intermediate}} {{in their}} response to air pollution — less sensitive than fruticose lichens, but <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than crustose lichens. Physcia caesia is found in cities, though at lower frequencies than more pollution-tolerant species.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{standards}} {{exist for}} defining Henoch–Schönlein purpura, including the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification and the 1994 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC).

5|$|Their {{sensitivity}} to water quality also makes them suitable for bioassays. Americamysis bahia and Americamysis almyra are frequently {{used to test}} for pesticides and other toxic substances, with A. bahia found to be <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> during the periods when it is moulting.|$|E
5|$|A colour {{reaction}} for salts of acetic acid is iron(III) chloride solution, {{which results in}} a deeply red colour that disappears after acidification. A <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which can be detected by its malodorous vapours.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, {{have led to a}} mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} be <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{can provide}} high {{performance}} {{because of its}} good locality of reference, but is <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> {{to the quality of}} its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes. It takes constant expected time per search, insertion, or deletion when implemented using a random hash function, a 5-independent hash function, or tabulation hashing. However, good results can be achieved in practice with other hash functions such as MurmurHash.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA recent {{paper by}} Knorr et al. (2005 a) {{suggested}} that the decomposition of resistant soil organic matter is <b>more</b> temperature <b>sensitive</b> than labile organic matter. In Knorr et al. 's (2005 a) model, the reference decay rate was presumed to be same for all pools of soil carbon. We refit Knorr et al. 's (2005 a) model but allow both the activation energy and the reference decay rate to vary among soil C pools. Under these conditions, a similar fit to measured data can be obtained without invoking {{the assumption that the}} resistant C pool is <b>more</b> temperature <b>sensitive</b> than the labile pool. Other published evidence does not unequivocally support Knorr et al. 's (2005 a) hypothesis of increased temperature sensitivity of resistant pools of soil carbon. Because of the lack of experimental data, Knorr et al. 's (2005 a) conclusion that the decomposition of the resistant SOM is <b>more</b> temperature <b>sensitive</b> than the labile pool is premature...|$|R
5|$|The 24-inch Burrell Schmidt Telescope was {{originally}} built in 1939 by Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio and was housed at the Taylor Road facility. It is currently housed at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The telescope recently had its optics upgraded {{with a very}} wide field of view CCD array, which is much <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than the photographic plates. It is the instrument used today by the Case astronomers.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{modality}} {{of choice}} is computed tomography (CT scan) without contrast, of the brain. This has a high sensitivity and will correctly identify over 95 percent of cases—especially {{on the first day}} after the onset of bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than CT after several days. Within six hours of the onset of symptoms CT picks up 98.7% of cases.|$|E
5000|$|... 1-Methyl-1-nitrosohydrazine is {{colourless}} solid, {{sensitive to}} impact, but not friction sensitive, and melts at 45°C before decomposing at 121°C. Compared to trinitrotoluene, this compound is <b>more</b> impact <b>sensitive,</b> but less friction sensitive.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} factors {{have been found to}} be {{associated}} with sodium sensitivity. Demographic factors which affect sodium sensitivity include race, gender, and age. One study shows that the American population of African descent are significantly <b>more</b> salt <b>sensitive</b> than Caucasians. Women are found to be <b>more</b> sodium <b>sensitive</b> than men; one possible explanation is based on the fact that women have a tendency to consume more salt per unit weight, as women weigh less than men on average. Several studies have shown that the increase in age is also associated with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{provides connectivity}} between key tiger reserves like Tadoba, Pench, Bor and Nagzira. It thus also serves to reduce pressure of tourists and tourist-related activities from those protected areas {{because they are}} <b>more</b> Eco <b>sensitive.</b>|$|R
5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are measured by the peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to the arterial partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly sensitive to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E

5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to {{the side effects of}} benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E
5|$|De Lucía {{was noted}} for his fast and fluent picados (fingerstyle runs). A master of contrast, he often {{juxtaposed}} picados and rasgueados (flamenco strumming) with <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> playing and {{was known for}} adding abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. These innovations saw him {{play a key role}} in the development of traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion from the 1970s. He received acclaim for his recordings with flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla in the 1970s, recording ten albums which are considered some of the most important and influential in flamenco history.|$|E
