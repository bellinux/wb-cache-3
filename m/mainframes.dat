5|$|SAS was re-designed in SAS 76 {{with an open}} {{architecture}} that allowed for compilers and procedures. The INPUT and INFILE statements were improved so they could read most data formats used by IBM <b>mainframes.</b> Generating reports was also added through the PUT and FILE statements. The ability to analyze general linear models was also added as was the FORMAT procedure, which allowed developers to customize the appearance of data. In 1979, SAS 79 added support for the CMS operating system and introduced the DATASETS procedure. Three years later, SAS 82 introduced an early macro language and the APPEND procedure.|$|E
5|$|The first {{versions}} of SAS were {{named after the}} year in which they were released. In 1971, SAS 71 was published as a limited release. It was used only on IBM <b>mainframes</b> and had the main elements of SAS programming, such as the DATA step and the most common procedures in the PROC step. The following year a full version was released as SAS 72, which introduced the MERGE statement and added features for handling missing data or combining data sets. In 1976, Barr, Goodnight, Sall, and Helwig removed the project from North Carolina State and incorporated it into SAS Institute, Inc.|$|E
5|$|William Chalmers invented Plexiglas while a {{graduate}} student at McGill. In computing, MUSIC/SP, software for <b>mainframes</b> once popular among universities and colleges around the world, was developed at McGill. A team also contributed to the development of Archie, a pre-WWW search engine. A 3270 terminal emulator developed at McGill was commercialized and later sold to Hummingbird Software. A team has developed digital musical instruments in the form of prosthesis, called Musical Prostheses.|$|E

5|$|Early {{computer}} games {{began to be}} created in the 1950s, and the steady {{increase in the number}} and abilities of computers over time led to the gradual loosening of restrictions on access to mainframe computers at academic and corporate institutions beginning in the 1960s. This in turn led to a modest proliferation of generally small, text-based games on mainframe computers, with increasing complexity {{towards the end of the}} decade. While games continued to be developed on <b>mainframes</b> and minicomputers through the 1970s, the rise of personal computers and the spread of high-level programming languages meant that later games were generally intended to or were capable of being run on personal computers, even when developed on a mainframe. These early games include Hamurabi, an antecedent of the strategy and city-building genres; Lunar Lander, which inspired numerous recreations in the 1970s and 1980s; Civil War, an early war simulation game; Star Trek, which was widely ported, expanded, and spread for decades after; Space Travel, which played a role in the creation of the Unix operating system; and Baseball, an early sports game and the first baseball game to allow player control during a game.|$|E

50|$|On July 26, 2010, the European Commission {{announced}} {{two separate}} antitrust investigations against International Business Machines (IBM). Both cases {{were related to}} alleged abuse of IBM's dominant position in the <b>mainframe</b> market. The first case followed complaints by <b>mainframe</b> emulator vendors T3 Technologies and TurboHercules, later joined by Neon Enterprise Software, {{and focused on the}} alleged tying of IBM's <b>mainframe</b> hardware to its <b>mainframe</b> operating system, potentially precluding customers from the execution of mission critical <b>mainframe</b> applications on non-IBM servers. The second case was an investigation begun on the EC's own initiative that looked into IBM's alleged discriminatory behaviour towards competing suppliers of <b>mainframe</b> maintenance services.|$|R

50|$|Unlike Teletype terminals, the Uniscope {{minimizes}} {{the number of}} I/O interrupts required by accepting large blocks of data, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using coax cable and hardware devices known as multiplexors. A Uniscope operator awaits a prompt from the remote <b>mainframe.</b> The prompt indicates that the <b>mainframe</b> is ready to receive input. The operator enters data, offline from the <b>mainframe,</b> and then presses the Transmit button. The terminal locks the keyboard and sends to the <b>mainframe</b> what the operator entered. All the data goes in a single transmission and that causes a single interrupt at the <b>mainframe.</b> Eventually, the <b>mainframe</b> responds, sometimes with a single line; other times with a screen-load of data. And the cycle repeats.|$|R
