5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of samarium is in samarium–cobalt <b>magnets,</b> which have a nominal composition of SmCo5 or Sm2Co17. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of neodymium <b>magnets.</b> However, samarium-based <b>magnets</b> have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for neodymium <b>magnets).</b> These <b>magnets</b> are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups.|$|E

5|$|<b>Magnets</b> {{are made}} of heavy metals such as manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, niobium, bismuth, praseodymium, neodymium, gadolinium, and dysprosium.

5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron <b>magnets</b> {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines.

5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks.

40|$|In this paper, the {{partitioned}} rotor flux switching permanent <b>magnet</b> {{machine with}} ferrite permanent <b>magnet</b> is proposed. By {{the adoption of}} the partitioned rotor configuration, the stator flux leakage is eliminated and the permanent <b>magnet</b> utilization is improved. The ferrite permanent <b>magnet</b> machine often suffers from irreversible demagnetization due to the inherent relatively low coercivity of ferrite permanent <b>magnet.</b> To mitigate the machine irreversible demagnetization risk, an improved partitioned rotor flux switching permanent <b>magnet</b> machine with hybrid permanent <b>magnet</b> topology is also proposed. Two little pieces of rare-earth permanent <b>magnet</b> are installed at the corners of ferrite permanent <b>magnet,</b> thus forming the hybrid permanent <b>magnet</b> topology. And the demagnetization mechanisms of both machines are clarified by the magnetic equivalent circuit method, which prove that the rare-earth permanent <b>magnet</b> offer magnetic protection function for the ferrite permanent <b>magnet.</b> Furthermore, by the 2 -D finite element analysis, the demagnetization characteristics and the electromagnetic performances of the two machines are quantitively assessed, revealing that the demagnetization risk is reduced significantly. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results verify that the improved machine can not only maintain low-cost design, but also possess enhanced demagnetization withstand capability and competitive electromagnetic performances as expected...|$|R
