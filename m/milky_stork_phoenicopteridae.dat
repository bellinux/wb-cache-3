50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> {{probably}} undertakes short {{seasonal migration}} outside the breeding season, but {{little is known}} of the timing and path of such movements. Local migrations by <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> (and several other wader species) {{may be caused by}} onset of drought in the dry season. In Cambodia however, it disperses during the wet season from Tonle Sap lake probably to the coast. <b>Milky</b> <b>storks</b> are reported migrating from Sumatra to Java, and across the Sunda Straits, in September and October. Although these apparent migrations are not extensively mapped, <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> flocks are reported to range over 200 km in a day.|$|R
50|$|Young captive <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> {{can become}} sexually mature from {{three months of}} age, but breeders at this age appear {{precocious}} and inexperienced; so that actual breeding age is probably slightly older. In its natural habitat, young storks begin to leave their natal breeding grounds at 3-4 months of age. Especially in captivity, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is further found to occasionally breed with the painted stork. One hybrid of a male lesser adjutant and female <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was also hatched at Jurong Bird Park, Singapore.|$|R
50|$|Population {{recovery}} for this species has relied largely on captive breeding. In 1987, the first captive breeding and reintroduction {{project for the}} <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was initiated in Zoo Negara in Malaysia (a country where the wild <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> population declined by over 90% from the 1980s to 2005) from a small young group of five males and five females received from Singapore Zoo and Johor Zoo. From these 10 individuals, the captive population increased to over 100 individuals by 2005. Therefore, with {{the decline in the}} wild <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> population in Malaysia since the 1980s, the captive, free-flying population has steadily risen.|$|R
50|$|The {{adult is}} readily {{recognisable}} {{in the field}} by its white head feathers, yellow-orange bill and pink legs. It is distinguished from other waders such as egrets and lesser adjutants by its extensively white body plumage and black wing coverts. However, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> resembles and may therefore {{be confused with the}} partly sympatric Asian Openbill and various white egret species. Nevertheless, the egrets are smaller and completely white, and the Asian Openbill is also smaller and distinguished from the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> by the grey bill. In the northern part of its range around Vietnam, <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> occasionally occur in sympatry with the closely related and morphologically similar painted storks. However, the painted stork is distinguished from the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> in adult plumage by the former’s black and white breast band and wing coverts, pink inner secondaries, more restricted bare head skin, and generally brighter soft part colouration.|$|R

50|$|The park, {{as part of}} the Selangor River estuary, is home to {{a number}} of large bird species such as <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> and herons as well as primates, namely silver leaf monkeys and long-tailed macaques. The area was a {{breeding}} ground of an endangered <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> species before the program was suspended. An abandoned aviary still {{stands in the middle of}} the park.|$|R
50|$|The Lake Birds exhibit {{includes}} painted storks, Black-headed ibis, egrets, swans, pelicans, Black-crowned night heron, and <b>milky</b> <b>storks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Logistic {{regression}} {{was applied}} to develop a morphometric sexing method of two closely related stork species that were previously sexed through amplification of the CHD gene. Tarsus length (TL) and bill length (BL) measurements were recorded from captive populations of adult <b>Milky</b> <b>Stork</b> (Mycteria cinerea) (n 5 60) and Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala) (n 5 58) at Zoo Negara Malaysia. Despite having monomorphic plumages, both stork species exhibited normal sexual size dimorphism in which males were significantly larger than females in the tested variables. Based on logistic regression analysis, BL correctly classified the sex of sampled individuals from Painted and <b>Milky</b> <b>stork</b> with an overall predicted accuracy of 94. 8 and 90. 0 %, respectively. However, TL measurements generated a lower predicted accuracy level of 86. 2 % and a same accuracy level of 90 % on the sex classification of individuals from Painted and <b>Milky</b> <b>stork,</b> respectively. By comparing the measurements of both species, only the average BL measure-ments of the <b>Milky</b> <b>storks</b> were significantly {{lower than that of}} Painted stork...|$|R

50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork’s</b> {{range is}} {{restricted}} to Southeast Asia, where it is widely but patchily distributed. It occurs in Sumatra (its global stronghold), Java, Sulawesi, eastern Malaysia, Cambodia, southern Vietnam (where it probably largely recolonised after the war of 1963-75), Bali, Sumbawa, Lombok and Buton. It historically occurred in southern Thailand, but is now very likely extinct here. One perfect adult male <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> specimen from Setul in Peninsula Thailand taken from 1935 was later found among collections of the Zoological Reference Collection at the National University of Singapore, suggesting that the species was formerly resident here. The discovered specimen was the first, and probably also the last <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> to be reported from Thailand, although this stork probably still occasionally visits Thailand as a vagrant. It is also vagrant elsewhere to countries such as Bali and Sumbawa, and is resident on Sumatra, Java and Sulawesi (all within Indonesia). The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was first reported on Sulawesi {{when a group of}} five apparently resident individuals was sighted there in 1977. The island of Madura may also support an important population after 170 individuals were sighted there in 1996.|$|R

50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> (Mycteria cinerea) is a medium, almost {{completely}} white plumaged stork species found predominantly in coastal mangroves {{in parts of}} Southeast Asia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} Ibis genus, with the binomial name Ibis cinereus, but is now categorised as belonging to Mycteria due to large similarities in appearance and behaviour to the three other storks in this genus (the wood stork, yellow-billed stork and painted stork). Phylogenetic studies based on DNA hybridization and cytochrome oxidase b have demonstrated that the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> shares a clade with other Mycteria, and forms a sister pair of species with the painted stork.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is {{well-known}} among Indonesian locals and is readily distinguished by {{them in the}} field from other waders; although it has at least historically been commonly (and sometimes illegally) harvested for meat and eggs. Like many other wading bird species, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is also sometimes considered a minor pest in the aquaculture industry by feeding on commercial fish and shrimps. This stork is however officially protected in Malaysia and Indonesia [...] and has been listed on Appendix I of CITES since 1987.|$|R
50|$|This stork has various natural predators. In South Sumatra, monitor lizards, {{especially}} Varanus salvator, {{have been}} reported to predate <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> eggs and juveniles. Crocodiles Crocodilus porosus also sometimes eat young <b>milky</b> <b>storks.</b> In Matang Mangrove Forest in Malaysia, brahminy kites, water monitor lizards and common palm civets Paradoxurus hermaphroditus are potential (nest) predators and probably contribute to low survival here. In captivity in Malaysia, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> may also be potentially threatened by the crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), which is a potential predator of stork eggs and chicks, and whose range has gradually expanded here. This monkey could swim across to nest sites surrounded by water, as they have done for captive grey herons. On Pulau Rambut, potential predators include reticulated python, cat snakes (especially Boiga dendrophila and Brahminy kite. White bellied sea eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster and monitor lizard are also reported to predate chicks here.|$|R

50|$|<b>Milky</b> <b>storks</b> {{also appear}} to exploit {{commercial}} shrimp as food. Active shrimp ponds usually last for three months before drying, whereupon remaining shrimp are exposed on the bottom as water level recedes, and <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> and other waders come to feed on the remaining shrimps. Such a feeding advantage could become increasingly available as land-based aquaculture expands in Kuala Gula. In Java, they are also reported to feed at fishponds, especially after the dry season when waters have receded to uncover mud expanses suitable for their feeding. These manmade environments may however disfavour breeding.|$|R
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> {{is usually}} silent during non-breeding. At nests, {{individuals}} utter a falsetto “fizz” call during the Up-Down display. The young utter a froglike croak when begging for food.|$|R
50|$|Especially {{in captivity}} in National Zoo of Malaysia, Singapore Zoo and Dusit Zoo, <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> and painted interbred to produce hybrid offspring. These hybrids {{apparently}} vary in appearance through {{different combinations of}} <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> and painted stork phenotypes in varying proportions. Because these hybrid juveniles are not readily distinguishable from pure-bred juveniles based on morphology, molecular methods {{have been used to}} detect possible hybrids. Compared to the parent painted stork, the adult hybrid has a pink rather than orange bill and head. Adult hybrids may also have some small black spots on the white wing and a subtle pink tinge on the feathers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> {{previously}} ranged {{more widely}} throughout Southeast Asia. For example, it was formerly widely distributed along {{the coasts of}} the Malaysian Peninsula, but is now restricted to Matang Mangrove Forest in Perak.|$|R
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> breeds colonially in {{mangrove}} swamps, with breeding colonies {{ranging in}} size from 10-20 to a few hundred nests. In Java, breeding colonies of 75-100 nests have been estimated to cover 4.5 ha, with 5-8 nests per tree within colonies having been recorded. The height of the nest above the ground notably varies. Nests are commonly built in tall Avicennia marina and other Avicennia tree species in Java, and Rhizosphora apiculata trees in Sumatra, in both cases usually 6-14 m above ground, but sometimes in the very tops of trees. Nests on Pulau Rambut are built in tops of outstanding mangrove trees 30 m high. Similar nesting characteristics were observed on the island of Pulau Dua when the species still bred there. In Indonesia, some <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> nest close to the ground in dense shrubs of Acrostichum mangrove ferns 2-6m above the ground. <b>Milky</b> <b>storks</b> also commonly nest in dead or dying mangrove trees. Further, some colonies in South Sumatra have been located far inland at brackish lakes or freshwater swamps in Alstonia trees reaching up to 60 m high.|$|R
50|$|In Peninsula Malaysia, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is more {{exclusively}} marine {{than the}} congeneric painted stork. However, the two species’ ranges {{are said to}} overlap in the marshy plains of Cambodia, where they probably use the same habitats.|$|R
50|$|Zoo Negara has bred over 200 highly {{endangered}} <b>milky</b> <b>storks.</b> The zoo {{is currently}} working with the local Wildlife Department on a release program for these birds. Other breeding achievements include hornbills and the freshwater crocodile - false gharial.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork’s</b> daily {{food intake}} has been {{estimated}} at 630 g wet weight, which {{may be able to}} be met within two hours at maximum foraging intensity. Various feeding mechanisms have been noted in this stork. However, as in other Mycteria, the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> locates and captures prey predominantly by sense of touch, usually by bill groping or direct bill probing. Because food location is primarily tactile, foraging is most efficient at high prey concentrations. [...] The groping method consists of walking slowly through shallow water with the partially open bill submerged about three quarters in the water. The stork rapidly shuts its mandibles when a prey item touches the groping till, raises its head and quickly swallows the item whole after some tossing. After swallowing a large fish, the stork may rest for up to one minute before resuming foraging. Alternatively, the bird may stand passively at the water’s edge with its half-open bill steadily submerged in the water where waves are present, so that water flows through the bird’s mandibles. The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> also sometimes draws its bill through the water in an arc side-to-side when standing or walking, until the bill touches a prey item.|$|R
50|$|Particularly for captive individuals, {{there is}} {{the risk of a}} loss of genetic {{integrity}} through hybridization with painted storks in captivity or in the wild in the northern parts of the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> range where it may co-occur with the painted stork.|$|R
50|$|Common comfort {{movements}} in the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> include allopreening between breeding partners and head shaking. Individuals perched near incubating partners also carrying out head rubbing, whereby the stork oils the bare head skin on its preen gland and then rubs its head on its plumage.|$|R
50|$|This stork has {{occasionally}} {{appeared in}} zoos such as Vienna Zoo and Washington Park Zoo, {{with the latter}} having held the longest living <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> specimen, which lived for 12 years, 4 months and 18 days (1937-1950). Many juvenile zoo specimens have been misidentified as young painted storks on purchase, and later proved to be <b>milky</b> <b>storks.</b> The only zoos which are recorded as having bred the species are Zoo Negara (where the stork bred in captivity {{for the first time}} in 1987), San Diego Zoo and Singapore Zoo. Captive breeding and reintroduction programmes for this stork have been widely supported by government and non-government agencies such as Perhilitan, the Malaysian Zoological Society, the Malaysian Nature Society and the Malaysian Zoological Society.|$|R
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> was {{essentially}} eliminated from Vietnam through widespread destruction of mangrove swamps during the Southeast Asian War in 1963-75. Subsequent large-scale reforestation may however {{have led to}} some recolonization; although the species has also suffered long-term effects of herbicide application in Southern Vietnam in later years.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{successful}} <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> reintroduction {{was carried out}} in Kuala Selangor Nature Park in 1998 with the release of 10 captive-bred individuals here. [...] Matang Mangrove Forest in Malaysia has been a popular candidate reintroduction site because this area is considered a suitable <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> habitat in terms of shelter, breeding and feeding grounds; and there are apparently minimal threats from predators and parasites. The area is also protected and systematically managed, and raw materials are sustainably harvested here. However, captive individuals released into their natural habitat face new potential threats such as susceptibility to disease, lack of ability to hunt for food and defend territory, and lack of ability to effectively detect and evade potential predators. These released individuals may also harbour disease and parasites that could harm wild populations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is {{predominantly}} a lowland coastal species throughout its range; where it inhabits mangrove, freshwater and peat swamps, and estuaries. The only proven breeding records however are reported from mangroves bordering the feeding grounds. It forages on tidal mudflats, in shallow saline or freshwater pools, freshwater marshes, fishponds, rice fields; and on backswamps along river floodplains up to 15 km from the coast. The <b>milky</b> <b>stork’s</b> breeding habitat requirements are extensive and undisturbed mangrove (and probably also riverine or dryland) forest with tall, outstanding trees behind it; and shallow pools within {{the forest for}} juveniles to forage in. The tall trees are also used for resting, {{and there should be}} sufficient individual limbs from which to take off. With a lack of such suitable trees, manmade alternatives such as cart wheels mounted on poles have been proposed.|$|R
50|$|Another {{potential}} threat to the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> is contamination of its natural habitat with elevated concentrations of ions of metals such as copper, zinc and lead. Sources of this observed contamination include use of agrochemicals in Kuala Gula, corrosion and runoff from jetties and boats coated with these metals, and aquaculture development. On Pulau Rambut, breeding colonies might also be threatened by increasing sea pollution.|$|R
50|$|In South Sumatra, it {{is found}} to breed {{alongside}} lesser adjutants, black-headed ibis and various heron species. In Cambodia, <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> have been reported breeding alongside painted storks, lesser adjutants and spot-billed pelicans in flooded forest around Tonle Sap during the early dry season in January and February. Colonies here are situated in mangrove backswamps 1-4 km from the coast in dense Archostichum ferns or dead trees.|$|R
5000|$|Before it was {{established}} that the yellow-billed stork was {{closely related to the}} American woodstork, the former was classified as belonging to the genus Ibis, together with the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> and painted stork. However, the yellow-billed stork has actually long been recognised as a true stork [...] and along with the other 3 related stork species, it should not strictly be called an ibis.|$|R
50|$|Some 160 {{species can}} be found inside the park, {{including}} the banteng, barn swallow, black-naped oriole, black racket-tailed treepie, crested serpent-eagle, crested treeswift, dollarbird, hawksbill turtle, Indian muntjac, Java sparrow, Javan lutung, large flying fox, leopard cat, lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, <b>milky</b> <b>stork,</b> Pacific swallow, red-rumped swallow, rusa deer, sacred kingfisher, savanna nightjar, stork-billed kingfisher, water monitor, wild boar, yellow-vented bulbul and the critically endangered Bali myna.|$|R
5000|$|Like other <b>storks,</b> the <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> habitually soars on {{thermals}} {{to travel}} between areas. Flocks {{of up to}} a dozen birds can be seen soaring on thermals at great heights between 10:00 and 14:00. At breeding colonies and feeding grounds, flight is contagious in that take-off by one bird is quickly followed by others. [...] Average flapping rate has been estimated at 205 beats per minute.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the park}} is the largest {{breeding}} colony of <b>milky</b> <b>storks</b> in the world, {{and one of the}} largest colonies of lesser adjutant. Other threatened birds in the park include the Storm's stork, white-winged duck, Nordmann's greenshank and Far Eastern curlew. The total bird population of the park has been estimated to be up to one million, while during winter up to 100,000 migratory birds stop over for rest.|$|R
