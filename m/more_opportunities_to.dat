5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this would indicate that the candidate is identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this reason, {{it is not necessary to}} attain a score of 1. Because there are <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> spend time ashore.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E

If node i detects more idle channels than node j, it has <b>more</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> find a common channel with nearby nodes, which may result in <b>more</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> set up a cluster with a common channel.|$|R

5|$|Seyfried {{appeared}} {{as the title}} character in the erotic thriller Chloe, theatrically released by Sony Pictures Classics on March 26, 2010. Chloe originally premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2009. In the film, Seyfried's character is an escort/prostitute who is hired to test a husband, because his wife feels that she cannot trust his fidelity. Chloe enjoyed commercial success and became director Atom Egoyan's biggest moneymaker ever. Seyfried's performance in the film also received favorable reviews from critics; it also helped her to gain industry acclaim and receive <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> play more varied roles.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Queensland {{were the}} least {{successful}} team in the Sheffield Shield, and Harvey moved north to Brisbane the following season {{to try to get}} <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> play Sheffield Shield cricket. Harvey joined the Toombul grade club, and made his first-class debut for Queensland against Victoria late in the season, although none of his brothers played for Victoria in this match; Merv had already retired, Neil was representing Australia, and Ray had been dropped. In his only match for the summer, he scored 1 and 13 and took two catches in each innings as an opener. He was dropped after the match.|$|E
5|$|Atangana {{travelled}} {{frequently in}} the French colonial period. He {{made a point of}} attending his subjects' weddings and funerals, for example. He had <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> visit Europe, including the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931 and the French Colonial Conference in 1935. In 1938, his wife died. Atangana was a handsome man by Ewondo standards: strong, well groomed, with a reputation as a good fighter, dancer, and husband. He remarried on 6 January 1940 to Julienne or Yuliana Ngonoa, a young Beti woman of the Mvog Manga sublineage from the village Nkolafamba. She bore him two children: Marie-Thérèse and René Grégoire. Atangana seems to have adhered to Catholic strictures against polygamy, despite the fact that other Beti chiefs at the time had several hundred wives.|$|E

5|$|Four matches {{followed}} the MCC fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool was rested {{for the first}} of these against Lancashire at Manchester, a rain-affected draw that was Australia's first non-victory of the season. He returned for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was drawn, but had little success, taking a total of 0/68. He failed to maximise his promotion to No. 4, making only 17 as Australia scored 400 in their only innings. McCool did not get any <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> push for selection, as he was rested from the next two matches against Hampshire and Sussex. Australia won the former by eight wickets after conceding a first innings lead {{for the first time on}} the tour, before winning the second by an innings by 325 runs.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{court upheld}} a {{socio-economic}} ranking system for commoners and nobles, {{which was based}} on the twenty-ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang (d. 338 BCE) of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 (excluding slaves) could be promoted in rank up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted in rank, he was granted a more honorable place in the seating arrangements of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at the table, was punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt from labor service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan meant <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> become promoted. In addition to an increase in salary (see table to the right), newly promoted men were granted wine and ox-meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief.|$|E

5|$|After the {{foundation}} and success of the American School for the Deaf, many other institutions for the deaf were founded throughout the country. Since schools, particularly in the South, were segregated, many Southern states created separate schools or departments for Black deaf children. The first school established for Black deaf children below the Mason–Dixon line opened in the District of Columbia in 1857; it remained segregated until 1958. The last Southern state to create an institution for Black deaf children was Louisiana in 1938. Black deaf children became a language community isolated from White deaf children, with different means of language socialization, allowing for different dialects to develop. Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children, oralism—the prominent pedagogical method of the time—was not as strictly applied to the Black deaf students. Oralist methods often forbade the use of sign language, so Black deaf students had <b>more</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> use ASL than did their White peers. Despite the decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, integration was slow to come. Schools for the deaf were no exception: the last desegregated in 1978, 24 years after the decision.|$|E
