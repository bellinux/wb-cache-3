25|$|In {{its early}} years, {{instead of buying}} most of the {{expensive}} items needed to run a television station, Tarzian had his own engineers and technicians design and build the items needed. For example, an overhead <b>microphone</b> <b>boom</b> cost approximately $300. Tarzian employees built one for less than $30. When Tarzian decided to start broadcasting network programs, establishing a coaxial cable link from Cincinnati would prove impractical, so Tarzian built his own microwave relay system from Cincinnati to Bloomington.|$|E

50|$|Drawbacks {{include a}} less {{optimized}} lighting which needs {{to provide a}} compromise for all camera angles and less flexibility in putting the necessary equipment on scene, such as <b>microphone</b> <b>booms</b> and lighting rigs. These can be efficiently hidden from just one camera but can be more complicated {{to set up and}} their placement may be inferior in a multiple-camera setup. Another drawback is in film usage—a four-camera setup will use (depending on the cameras involved) up to four times as much film (or storage space for digital) per take, compared with a single-camera setup.|$|R

5000|$|Historians have {{identified}} TW3 as breaking ground in comedy and broadcasting. Graham McCann said it challenged the [...] "convention that television should not acknowledge {{that it is}} television; the show {{made no attempt to}} hide its cameras, allowed the <b>microphone</b> <b>boom</b> to intrude and often revealed other nuts and bolts of studio technology." [...] In the 1960s, this was unusual and gave the programme an exciting, modern feel. TW3 also flouted conventions by adopting [...] "a relaxed attitude to its running time: loosely structured and open-ended, it seemed to last just as long as it wanted and needed to last, even if that meant going beyond the advertised time for the ending ... the real controversy of course, was caused by the content." ...|$|E
5000|$|Assigning 2 stars (out of 5), The Motion Picture Guide (1987 edition) {{found it}} to be [...] "long, often-enraging and totally miscast" [...] with [...] "a nonsinging Keel as Saint Peter". Evaluating the {{presentation}} as [...] "just so much biblical nonsense because such liberties are taken that any serious student of the life and surrounding events will take exception, the write-up decides that [...] "Douglas wrote the novel but made the mistake of entrusting it to the wrong people." [...] After pointing out the film's [...] "numerous technical mistakes: <b>microphone</b> <b>boom</b> shadows, klieg lights, Martha Hyer's vaccination mark", the Guide concludes that [...] "to make a love story the focal point of such a potentially dynamic saga of history's most memorable era was a bad decision. One of the rare bummers by Disney in those years." ...|$|E

5000|$|Film makers {{may also}} create an {{original}} image that includes visual information that extends {{above and below}} the widescreen theatrical image; this is called [...] "open matte". This may still be pan-and-scanned, but gives the compositor the freedom to [...] "zoom out" [...] or [...] "uncrop" [...] the image to include not only the full width of the wide-format image, but additional visual content at the top and/or bottom of the screen, not included in the widescreen version. As a general rule (prior to the adoption of DVD), special effects would be done within the theatrical aspect ratio, but not the full-frame thereof; also the expanded image area can include extraneous objects—such as cables, <b>microphone</b> <b>booms,</b> jet vapor trails, or overhead telephone wires—not intended {{to be included in the}} frame.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difficulty}} of {{keeping up with}} the demanding schedule of a daily half-hour show manifested itself on screen. In addition to sets and props wobbling unintentionally (in one episode of the 1795 storyline, actor Thayer David bumped into a large [...] "oak tree" [...] and it almost fell over), heavily used actors—especially Frid and Bennett—often struggled with their lines, and occasionally, a stagehand could be spotted wandering onto the back of the set. At other times, the <b>microphone</b> <b>boom</b> appeared in the frame (giving the show the derisive nickname [...] "Mic Shadows"), a television camera would appear on screen, a fly hovered around the head of an actor, or window curtains fell down. These [...] "bloopers" [...] are treasured by Dark Shadows fans and have been collected by MPI Home Video on both VHS and DVD.|$|E
5000|$|The boom {{operator}} {{is part of}} the sound crew, and an assistant to the sound engineer or production sound mixer. The {{boom operator}}'s main responsibility is microphone placement, sometimes using a [...] "fishpole" [...] with a microphone attached to the end—and sometimes using a [...] "boom" [...] (most often a [...] "fisher boom"). The fisher boom is a piece of equipment that the operator stands on that lets him precisely control the microphone at a greater distance from the actors. They also place wireless microphones on actors when necessary. The boom operator strives to keep the <b>microphone</b> <b>boom</b> near the action, but away from the camera frame so it never appears onscreen. They work closely with the production sound mixer, or sound recordist, to record all sound while filming including background noises, dialogue, sound effects, and silence.|$|E

[...] "This is a farewell kiss from the Iraqi people, you dog," [...] yelled al-Zaidi in Arabic as he threw his first shoe towards Bush. [...] "This is for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq," [...] he shouted as he threw his second shoe. Bush ducked twice to avoid being hit by the shoes. Prime Minister Maliki also attempted to catch one of the shoes to protect Bush. Al-Zaidi was pulled to the floor by another journalist, before being grabbed by Prime Minister Maliki's guards, kicked, and rushed out of the room.

5000|$|In 1952, the new {{television}} {{department of the}} Canadian Broadcasting Corporation prepared to go on air with Canada's first live televised variety show, The Big Revue. Thomson auditioned with 110 other dancers for {{a spot on the}} three-person chorus line; she was the first dancer hired. There were many challenges and mishaps in the age of live television. On one show, Thomson was struck in the head by a swinging <b>microphone</b> <b>boom</b> just before going on-camera, and although she completed her routine, she couldn't remember anything about her dance afterwards; on another show, she had to walk down a set of stairs wearing a feathered costume while trying to hold on to two pigeons that were doing their best to frantically fly away. During the first decade of Canadian television, Thomson performed regularly on Wayne & Shuster, The Barris Beat, The Denny Vaughan Show, and Hit Parade, and also appeared as an actor in various live dramas. She also met or worked with both established stars such as Duke Ellington -- who told her [...] "I'm going to tickle the ivories, then I'm going to tickle you" [...] -- as well as then-unknowns like Norman Jewison, the studio director on The Big Revue, singer Robert Goulet, and a young folksinger named Gordon Lightfoot, who told everyone in the CBC cafeteria {{that he was going to}} be a star.|$|E
40|$|Directional {{studies of}} {{acoustic}} systems and acoustic transducers require considerable pre-cision of orientation combined with co-ordination {{of control and}} measurement processes. The paper describes a manipulator designed and built by the authors. The manipulator is so de-signed that it allows a studied sample to be precisely rotated with a remote control of the rotation angle. It makes it also possible to measure angle-dependent radiation and reception patterns of loudspeakers, microphones, antennas, noisy mechanisms etc. The method of con-trol and data collection from the manipulator via an RS- 232 port should also be noted. It is also possible {{to communicate with the}} plain table through LAN. Key words: turntable, <b>microphone</b> <b>boom,</b> rotation angle, digital remote control. 1...|$|E

5000|$|A boom {{operator}} {{is an assistant}} of the production sound mixer. The principal responsibility of the <b>boom</b> operator is <b>microphone</b> placement, usually using a boom pole (or [...] "fishpole") with a microphone attached to the end (called a boom mic), their aim being to hold the microphone {{as close to the}} actors or action as possible without allowing the <b>microphone</b> or <b>boom</b> pole to enter the camera's frame.|$|R
40|$|The recent test program, {{in which}} the SR- 2 and SR- 3 Prop-Fan models were acoustically tested in flight, is {{described}} {{and the results of}} analysis of noise data acquired are discussed. The trends of noise levels with flight operating parameters are shown. The acoustic benefits of the SR- 3 design with swept blades relative to the SR- 2 design with straight blades are shown. Noise data measured on the surface of a small-diameter <b>microphone</b> <b>boom</b> mounted above the fuselage and {{on the surface of the}} airplane fuselage are compared to show the effects of acoustic propagation through a boundary layer. Noise level estimates made using a theoretically based prediction methodology are compared with measurements...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{reported}} from flight {{measurements of the}} noise from a full-scale SR- 7 L advanced single-rotation turbofan model mounted on the wing of the NASA Lewis Propfan Test Assessment (PTA) aircraft (a modified Gulfstream II). Data obtained on the PTA with an outboard <b>microphone</b> <b>boom</b> and by the NASA Lewis acoustically instrumented Learjet flying along several sidelines relative to the PTA are presented in tables and graphs and briefly discussed. It is found that the PTA-boom and Learjet sound levels are in good agreement at Mach 0. 69 and altitude 20, 000 ft, but the Learjet values are {{significantly lower than the}} boom levels at Mach 0. 79 and altitude 36, 000 ft...|$|E
40|$|Novel wing designs will {{incorporate}} advanced wing-tip {{devices for}} a quick wake-vortex break down and an increased wing performance through different devices, e. g. differential spoiler setting, large wing-lets, mini trailing edge devices and sub-boundary layer vortex generators. Advanced wing configurations will enhance the aircraft's capability to perform noise abatement flight procedures, but may also generate excess aerodynamic noise. Therefore farfield noise measurements were conducted in the open test section of the DNW-LLF on a 1 / 10. 6 scaled X 408 D (A 340) model for all relevant aircraft configurations, to quantify the different devices' noise characteristics. All devices were tested individually {{by means of an}} out-of-flow traversing <b>microphone</b> <b>boom.</b> In comparison of measured noise directivities with and without devices installed only small effects on noise in the order of 1 dB were detected...|$|E
5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the <b>microphone</b> <b>booms,</b> restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|R
