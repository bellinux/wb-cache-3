50|$|Some food pastes are {{considered}} to be condiments and are used directly, while others are made into sauces, which are more liquidy than paste. Ketchup and prepared <b>mustard</b> are <b>pastes</b> that are used both directly as condiments and as ingredients in sauces.|$|R
50|$|In Bengal and Odisha , ilish can be smoked, fried, steamed, {{baked in}} young {{plantain}} leaves, prepared with <b>mustard</b> seed <b>paste,</b> curd, begun (eggplant), different condiments like jira(cumin) and so on. It {{is said that}} people can cook ilish in more than 50 ways. Ilish roe is also popular as a side dish. Ilish can be cooked in very little oil since the fish itself is very oily.|$|R
5000|$|Paturi: Generally, {{oily fish}} is sliced evenly and {{wrapped in a}} banana leaf, after the fish has been basted with freshly <b>pasted</b> <b>mustard</b> {{with a hint of}} mustard oil, chili, {{turmeric}} and salt.|$|R
50|$|The main {{ingredients}} are hilsa, <b>mustard</b> <b>paste,</b> turmeric powder and salt. lime juice, coriander leaves, tomatoes and green chillies may be added for flavour.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of spices}} for both fish and {{vegetable}} dishes is quite extensive and includes many combinations {{not found in}} other parts of India. Examples are the onion-flavoured kalonji (nigella or black onion seeds), radhuni (wild celery seeds), and five-spice or panch phoron (a mixture of cumin, fennel, fenugreek, kalonji, and black mustard seeds). Bengali cooking includes the phoron of a combination of whole spices, fried and added at the start or finish of cooking as a flavouring special to each dish. Bengalis share their use of whole black mustard seeds with South Indians, but unique to Bengal is the extensive use of freshly ground <b>mustard</b> <b>paste.</b> A pungent <b>mustard</b> <b>paste</b> called Kashundi is a dipping sauce popular in Bengal.|$|E
50|$|The dish {{is served}} with the bacon sliced, and {{with some of the}} boiling juices (Cabbage water) added. Another common accompaniment to the dish is <b>Mustard</b> <b>paste</b> or Parsley/Onion Sauce, white sauce which {{generally}} consists of flour, butter, milk and a herb of some sort (often parsley).|$|E

50|$|The food in {{the region}} around Puri-Cuttack is greatly {{influenced}} by the Jagannath Temple. On the other hand, kalonji and <b>mustard</b> <b>paste</b> are used mostly in the region bordering Bengal and curries tend to be sweeter. In the region closer to Andhra Pradesh, curry tree leaves and tamarind are used more. The Brahmapur region has influences of South Indian cuisine and the Telugu people living there have invented new Odia dishes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mustard</b> <b>paste,</b> holud (turmeric), poshto (poppyseed), ada (ginger), dhone (coriander, {{seeds and}} leaves) and narikel (ripe coconut usually desiccated) are other common ingredients. 'The panch phoron {{is a general}} purpose spice mixture {{composed}} of radhuni (Carum roxburghianum seeds), jira (cumin), kalo jira (black cumin, also known as nigella), methi (fenugreek) and mouri (aniseed). This mixture is more convenient for vegetarian dishes and fish preparations. Panch phoron is {{also referred to as}} Bengali five spice mixture.|$|E
50|$|One French {{variation}} adds {{egg yolk}} for pommes duchesse or Duchess potatoes; piped through a pastry tube into wavy ribbons and rosettes, brushed {{with butter and}} lightly browned. Pomme purée (potato puree) uses considerably more butter than normal mashed potato - up to two parts potato for one part butter. In low-calorie or non-dairy variations, milk, cream and butter may be replaced by soup stock or broth. Aloo Bharta, an Indian sub-continent variation, uses chopped onions, <b>mustard</b> (oil, <b>paste</b> or seeds), chili pepper, coriander leaves and other spices.|$|R
50|$|In {{the eastern}} Indian state of Odisha, taro root {{is known as}} saru. Dishes made of taro include saru besara (taro in <b>mustard</b> and garlic <b>paste).</b> It is also an {{indispensable}} ingredient in preparing the heart of Odia cuisine, the dalma, where vegetables are cooked with dal. Sliced taro roots, deep fried in oil and mixed with red chili powder and salt, are known as saru chips.|$|R
40|$|The {{consistency}} of commercial mayonnaise, <b>mustard</b> and tomato <b>paste</b> samples {{was assessed by}} squeezing flow before and after compression or stirring, by hand and with a domestic blender which caused intensive shearing. The specimens before and after these treatments were squeezed between Teflon® coated parallel plates mounted on an Instron UTM model 5542 to a final height of 0. 8 mm and had been let to relax before the crosshead was withdrawn. Their consistency was assessed {{in terms of their}} apparent stress at three heights, and after relaxation for 1 and 2 min at 0. 8 mm height. Compression of the specimen prior to its testing (1 – 3 times) has very little effect on the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s consistency which supports the view that there was little friction between the Teflon® coated plates and the samples. Shearing caused measurable loss of consistency in the <b>mustard</b> and tomato <b>paste</b> which was not fully restored even after three hours. The sheared mayonnaise restored much of its consistency after about an hour as judged by the apparent stress at a given height, and almost fully recovered it if judged by the apparent residual stress after relaxation...|$|R
50|$|The use {{of spices}} for both meat and {{vegetable}} dishes is quite extensive and includes many combinations. The combination of whole spices, fried and added {{at the start}} or finish of cooking as a flavoring is special to each dish. Whole black mustard seeds and freshly ground <b>mustard</b> <b>paste</b> form a typical combination. A pungent mustard sauce called kashundi is sauce for snacks or sometimes makes a base ingredient for fish dishes and vegetable dishes.|$|E
5000|$|The Romans were {{probably}} the first to experiment with the preparation of mustard as a condiment. They mixed unfermented grape juice (the must) with ground mustard seeds (called sinapis) to make [...] "burning must", mustum ardens — hence [...] "must ard". A recipe for mustard appears in De re coquinaria, the anonymously compiled Roman cookbook from the late 4th or early 5th century; the recipe calls for a mixture of ground mustard, pepper, caraway, lovage, grilled coriander seeds, dill, celery, thyme, oregano, onion, honey, vinegar, fish sauce, and oil, and {{was intended as a}} glaze for spit-roasted boar. (Mustard was being used in curries in Asian countries well before Romans started using it. Romans experimented with using <b>mustard</b> <b>paste)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{early use}} of mustard as a {{condiment}} in England is attested {{from the year}} 1390 in the book The Forme of Cury which was written by King Richard II's master cooks. It was prepared {{in the form of}} mustard balls — coarse-ground mustard seed combined with flour and cinnamon, moistened, rolled into balls, and dried — which were easily stored and combined with vinegar or wine to make <b>mustard</b> <b>paste</b> as needed. The town of Tewkesbury was well known for its high-quality mustard balls, originally made with ground mustard mixed with horseradish and dried for storage, which were then exported to London {{and other parts of the}} country, and are even mentioned in William Shakespeare's play King Henry the Fourth, Part II.|$|E
50|$|The idol of {{the chief}} deity is 9 feet tall and made of a special element called Katusarkara Yogam (<b>Mustard</b> and Jaggery <b>paste)</b> and no Abhishekam (ritual bathing) is {{performed}} to it. The deity has shangu and chakra in the hands and Goddess Mahalakshmi in his chest (ThiruVazhMarbhan). Dashavathara (Ten incarnations of Vishnu) paintings adorn the Indra Kalyana Mandapam of this temple. Other shrines for Garuda, Ganesha, Rama, Vishwaksenar, Nammalvar, Nataraja are present. There is a temple tank opposite to the temple for taking bath.|$|R
5000|$|Elena Molokhovets's classic Russian {{cookbook}} A Gift to Young Housewives {{gives the}} first known recipe for Govjadina po-strogonovski, s gorchitseju, [...] "Beef à la Stroganov, with mustard", in its 1871 edition. The recipe involves lightly floured beef cubes (not strips) sautéed, sauced with prepared mustard and bouillon, and finished {{with a small amount}} of sour cream: no onions, no mushrooms. A competition purported to have taken place in 1890 is sometimes mentioned in the dish's history, but both the recipe and the name existed before then. Another recipe, this one from 1909, adds onions and tomato sauce, and serves it with crisp potato straws, which are considered the traditional side dish for Beef Stroganoff in Russia. [...] The version given in the 1938 Larousse Gastronomique includes beef strips, and onions, with either <b>mustard</b> or tomato <b>paste</b> optional.|$|R
30|$|There {{has been}} great deal of {{interest}} in understanding the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids [1, 2]. Examples of such rheological complex fluids are blood plasma, chocolate, <b>mustard</b> mayonnaise, tooth <b>paste,</b> shampoo, food stuffs, mud, polymer melts, clay coatings, oils and greases, paints etc. These kinds of fluids offer special challenges to the engineers, modelers, mathematicians, and physicists. The study of non-Newtonian fluids {{is very important in}} view of its applications in various branches of engineering and technology, therefore the flow analysis of these fluids is very important in theory and practice. From a theoretical point of view, flows of this type are fundamental in fluid mechanics. Practically speaking, these flows have applications in many manufacturing processes in industry. Due to the great diversity in the physical structures of non-Newtonian fluids, {{it is not possible to}} establish a single constitutive equation. Thus, many non-Newtonian fluid models have been proposed of which most are empirical or semi-empirical. The equations of motion for non-Newtonian fluids are much more complicated and are of higher order than the Navier-Stokes equations. The solutions of most of the problems in the real world are usually even numerical, on computers. However, analytical solutions, even if they may not be accurate, can provide some penetrating insight into the physics of a problem which manages a maze of numbers crunched on a computer. For that reason, researchers still look for analytical solutions of the known and unknown problems, particularly the former, as they can act as a bench mark for the latter. Various analytical and numerical approaches/methods by a number of people with and without slip condition [3 – 26] have been done.|$|R
50|$|Food: In winters, {{people in}} this region enjoy real taste of {{regional}} food. Well cooked millet with curry of fresh peas, fresh potatoes, carrot and spices along with <b>mustard</b> <b>paste,</b> tastes very delicious. Chapaties prepared form millet flour, along dish prepared form spinach and mustard leaves also tastes good, chapaties can also be eaten with ghee mixed with home made jaggery. People also prefer cooked millet with chutney made of tomatoes, garlic leaves, coriander leaves, ginger, green chillies, cumin seeds. Sweet boondies (made form bengal gram flour and fried in ghee) with along curd is preferred by people. The preferred sweet in this region is chena made form milk (after souring milk- paneer is extracted and then chena is prepared). Jalebies (made form gram flour) along with condensed milk is also favorite among {{people in this}} region.|$|E
5000|$|Avakaya: The {{most popular}} item of Andhra cuisine. It {{is made of}} cut green mangos, mustard powder, red chili powder and {{vegetable}} oil. It is prepared during April/May, when green mangos are abundant. Every family in Andhra has its own recipe for this pickle based on the variety of mango, chili and the oil used. Like Gongura pachadi, it exemplifies the Andhra cuisine and is a staple of showcase Andhra lunches. For many Andhrites, it is a must have side dish with any pappu item. Mudda pappu (cooked toor dal) and avakaya combined is a staple in most households. There are umpteen varieties of avakaya — with or without garlic and depending on the other ingredients used like pesarakaya (avakaya with moong dal powder), menthi kaya (avakaya with fenugreek powder), neeti kaya (avakaya made by grinding <b>mustard</b> <b>paste</b> with water).|$|E

The analyzed material {{consisted of a}} mild yellow <b>mustard</b> <b>paste</b> condiment and ground white mustard seeds which were originally used in the <b>mustard</b> <b>paste</b> production process. The samples were extracted in a Soxhlet extraction system and analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. The only sinalbin degradation product in ground mustard seeds was 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) acetonitrile. The most abundant sinalbin degradation product in yellow <b>mustard</b> <b>paste</b> was 4 -(hydroxymethyl) phenol. Other compounds identified in this sample were: 4 -methyl phenol, 4 -ethyl phenol, 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) phenol and 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethanoic acid...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of various formulations of mayonnaise stored in commercial glass jars, at 20 C {{in the dark}} was studied. Dijon mayonnaise made with sunflower oil and containing <b>mustard</b> <b>paste</b> can be stored up to I 0 months in closedjars without serious oxidative damage due {{to the presence of}} high amounts of natural tocopherols in the oil and limited oxygen availability. However, in the absence of mustard, the oxidative degradation was somewhat faster and the amount of conjugated dienes was increased more quickly and to a higher degree than that in the mustard containing sample. Supplying oxygen by opening one time the jars to air increased the rate of degradation, even when the mayonnaise was stored at 4 C. Exposing of glass jars of mayonnaise alternatively to daylight and darkness for I month produced only little conjugated dienes while hexanal appeared in significant amounts. Addition of antioxidant (rosemary extract and EDTA) or emulsifier (DA TEM) decreased the level ofphotooxidative volatiles in the headspace...|$|E
