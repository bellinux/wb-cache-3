40|$|Manufacturing {{is a major}} {{driving force}} and an {{important}} pillar for national economic development. It is an important source to create national income. Currently {{the low level of}} logistics industry development significantly restricted prosperity and development of manufacturing, and affected the overall competitiveness of the supply chain. The paper firstly explains the relevant research about industrial linkage and coordination degree, and creatively forms development paths of industry linkage between <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>logistics.</b> Then, the paper takes the development situation of the <b>manufacturing</b> and the <b>logistics</b> industry during the period of 2000 to 2008 in China. It builds an evaluation model about coordination of <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>logistics</b> industry linkage and analyzes the changes of coordination degree between <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>logistics.</b> The research results show that manufacturing is positively related to logistics industry. But their coordination degree is in the critical state of coordination and disharmony. In the economic restructuring, making efforts to promote linkage development has more significance for enhancing the competitiveness of industries in China. </p...|$|R
