For such use cases, a special notation has been introduced, which expresses IPv4-mapped and IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses by writing the least-significant 32 bits of an address in the familiar IPv4 dot-decimal notation, whereas all preceding ones are written in IPv6 format. For example, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address ::ffff:c000:0280 is written as ::ffff:192.0.2.128, thus expressing clearly the original IPv4 address that was mapped to IPv6.|$|E

From a model of optimal land use, it derives and then estimates a deforestation equation on county-level data for the period 1978 to 1988. The data include a deforestation measure from satellite images {{which is a great}} advance in allowing within-country analysis. Evidence exists that: most important for policy, both increased road density in neighbouring counties lead to more deforestation; government development projects increase deforestation; greater distance from the economic center of the country leads to less deforestation; and better soil quality leads to more deforestation. The evidence on provision of subsidized credit is <b>mixed.</b> <b>Addressing</b> an oft-mentioned factor, the population density is significant when population is the sole explanatory variable, but not when other variables suggested by the model are included.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to answer}} a number of basic {{questions}} about microcontroller development: • What’s the potential for writing more efficient program code and is it worth the effort? How could it be done? Could the presumed trade-off between code space and development time be overcome? • Which microcontroller hardware architecture should you choose? • Which IDE (development ecosystem) should you choose? This is {{an investigation of the}} above, using separate sets of incremental code changes (improvements) to a simple serial port communication test program. Two generations of Atmel 8 -bit AVR microcontrollers (ATmega and ATxmega) and two conceptually different IDEs (BASCOM-AVR and Atmel Studio 6. 1) are chosen for the comparison. The benefits of producing smaller and/or faster code is the ability to use smaller (cheaper) devices and reduce power consumption. A number of techniques for manual program optimization are used and presented, showing that it’s the developer skills and the IDE driver library concept and quality that mainly affect code quality and development time, rather than high code quality and low development time being mutually exclusive. The investigation shows that the complexity costs incurred by using memory-wise bigger and more powerful devices with more features and peripheral module instances are surprisingly big. This is mostly seen in the IV table space (many and advanced peripherals), ISR prologue and epilogue (memory size above 64 k words), and program code size (configuration and initialization of peripherals). The 8 -bit AVR limitation of having only three memory pointers is found to have consequences for the programming model, making it important to avoid keeping several concurrent memory pointers, so that the compiler doesn’t have to move register data around. This means that the ATxmega probably can’t reap the full benefit of its uniform peripheral module memory layout and the ensuing struct-based addressing model. The test results show that a <b>mixed</b> <b>addressing</b> model should be used for 8 -bit AVR ATxmega, in which “static” (absolute) addressing is better at one (serial port) instance, at three or more the “structs and pointers” addressing is preferable, and at two it’s a draw. This fact is not dependent on the three pointer limitation, but is likely to be strengthened by it. As a <b>mixed</b> <b>addressing</b> model is necessary for efficient programming, {{it is clear that the}} driver library must reflect this, either via alternative implementations or by specifying “interfaces” that the (custom) driver must implement if abstraction to higher-level application code is desired. A GUI-based tool for driver code generation based on developer input is therefore suggested. The translation from peripheral instance number to base address so far used by BASCOM-AVR for ATxmega is expensive, which resulted in a suggestion for a HW-based look-up table that would generally reduce both code size and clock cycle count and possibly enable a common accessing model for ATmega, ATxmega, and ARM. In the IDE evaluation, both alternatives were very appreciated. BASCOM-AVR is found to be a fine productivityenhancement tool due to its large number of built-in commands for the most commonly used peripherals. Atmel Studio 6. 1 suffers greatly in this area from its ill-favored ASF driver library. For developers familiar with the AVRs, the powerful avrgcc optimizing compiler and integrated debugger still make it worthwhile adapting application note code and datasheet information, at a significant development time penalty compared to BASCOM-AVR. Regarding ATmega vs. ATxmega, it was decided that both have its place, due to differences in feature sets and number of peripheral instances. ATxmega seems more competitively priced compared to ATmega, but incurs a complexity cost in terms of code size and clock cycles. When it’s a draw, ATmega should be chosen...|$|E

40|$|A Li-rich {{red giant}} star (2 M 19411367 + 4003382) {{recently}} discovered {{in the direction of}} NGC 6819 belongs to the rare subset of Li-rich stars that have not yet evolved to the luminosity bump, an evolutionary stage where models predict Li can be replenished. The currently favored model to explain Li enhancement in first-ascent red giants like 2 M 19411367 + 4003382 requires deep mixing into the stellar interior. Testing this model requires a measurement of 12 C/ 13 C, which is possible to obtain from APOGEE spectra. However, the Li-rich star also has abnormal asteroseismic properties that call into question its membership in the cluster, even though its radial velocity and location on color-magnitude diagrams are consistent with membership. To address these puzzles, we have measured a wide array of abundances in the Li-rich star and three comparison stars using spectra taken as part of the APOGEE survey to determine the degree of stellar <b>mixing,</b> <b>address</b> the question of membership, and measure the surface gravity. We confirm that the Li-rich star is a red giant with the same overall chemistry as the other cluster giants. However, its log g is significantly lower, consistent with the asteroseismology results and suggestive of a very low mass if the star is indeed a cluster member. Regardless of the cluster membership, the 12 C/ 13 C and C/N ratios of the Li-rich star are consistent with standard first dredge-up, indicating that Li dilution has already occurred, and inconsistent with internal Li enrichment scenarios that require deep mixing.
