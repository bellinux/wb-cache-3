In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that I had ever seen in all <b>my</b> <b>travels</b> and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E

Across the street was a housing project, and he observed suburban teenagers going into the project and obtaining heroin from a dealer known as [...] "Captain Jack". [...] "It's about {{coming out of the}} New York suburbs," [...] Joel told John Kalodner in 1974. [...] "But in <b>my</b> <b>travels</b> I have seen {{a lot of the same}} suburb all over the country.

500|$|Betjeman characterised Heber's {{style as}} {{consciously}} literary, with careful choices of adjectives and vivid figures of speech: [...] "poetic imagery was {{as important as}} didactic truth". A more recent analysis by J. R. Watson draws attention to Heber's tendency to deliver what he terms [...] "a rather obvious sermon", and to his mixing of powerful description with [...] "a rather trite moralism". A handful of Heber's hymns have survived into popular use into the 21st century. One whose popularity has waned is the missionary hymn [...] "From Greenland's Icy Mountains", written in 1819 {{as part of a}} country-wide campaign on behalf of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Watson describes this as [...] "a conspicuous example of that fervent belief to convert the world to Christianity which led Heber and others to lay down their lives in the mission field", and while widely sung until {{the second half of the}} 20th century, it was for instance omitted from the 1982 revision of the Episcopal Church hymnal. Betjeman felt that in the modern world, the words of this hymn seem patronising and insensitive to other beliefs, with references to [...] "...every prospect pleases and only man is vile", and to [...] "the heathen in his blindness [...] down to wood and stone". These phrases and the assumptions behind them offended Gandhi, who drew attention to them in a speech to the YMCA in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1925: [...] "My own experience in <b>my</b> <b>travels</b> throughout India has been to the contrary ... is not vile. He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are, possibly more so". Other Heber texts remain popular, and the Dictionary of North American Hymnology noted that most of his hymns remain in use.|$|E

2500|$|... "For me, 1960 or thereabouts {{was a time}} to {{take another}} look at the {{philosophy}} and art of the Orient--particularly Japanese art--that I had become familiar with in my youth. Through <b>my</b> <b>travels</b> and my studies of traditional Japanese arts I was able to reaffirm my conviction in the Oriental view of nature which sees man as one part of nature, a part that must live in harmony with the rest of nature. From 1960 on, I attempted to express this relationship between man and nature in my works. My sumi-e drawings are a direct response to nature; my fountain sculptures are an attempt to unify water--the life force of the universe that flows in an elusive cyclical course throughout eternity--with an immutable metal sculpture."—George Tsutakawa ...|$|E

Apollonius of Tyana specifically states that Nero was called a beast: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>travels,</b> which have been wider than ever man yet accomplished, I have seen man, many wild beasts of Arabia and India; but this beast, that is commonly called a Tyrant, I know not how many heads it has, nor if it be crooked of claw, and armed with horrible fangs. ...
