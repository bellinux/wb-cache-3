Laseter was co-producer of Tucker's albums in 2002 (Tanya), 2005 (Live at Billy Bob's Texas), and 2009 (<b>My</b> <b>Turn).</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2004, public {{attention}} focused again on Cheney's sexuality, when the Bush administration supported the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed {{amendment to the}} United States Constitution that would limit marriage to heterosexual couples and ban civil unions and domestic partnership benefits. Cheney did not publicly express her opinion of the amendment at the time. In her 2006 autobiography Now It's <b>My</b> <b>Turn,</b> Cheney stated her opposition to the amendment. However, at the time, she remained silent to support Bush's re-election bid. In August 2004, Dick Cheney reiterated the position he took in the 2000 Presidential campaign: that the issue should be handled by individual state governments. He added, though, that President Bush determined his administration's policies, and his policy supported the Federal Marriage Amendment.|$|E

500|$|Before the 2012 London Olympics, Vijender {{spoke to}} The Wall Street Journal about the {{increasing}} government bias to boost cricket.

He agreed despite being still contractually obligated with Infinity Optimal Solutions (IOS), a celebrity management firm who dealt with his media appearances and ramp walks as a male model. IOS successfully petitioned the Delhi High Court to bar him from entering into any deal with Percept.|$|E
500|$|Dirty Dancing {{is based}} {{in large part on}} screenwriter Eleanor Bergstein's own childhood: she is the younger {{daughter}} of a Jewish doctor from New York, spent summers with her family in the Catskills, participated in [...] "Dirty Dancing" [...] competitions, and was herself nicknamed [...] "Baby" [...] as a girl. In 1980, Bergstein wrote a screenplay for the Michael Douglas film, It's <b>My</b> <b>Turn.</b> However, the producers cut an erotic dancing scene from the script, much to her dismay. She then conceived a new story, focused almost exclusively on dancing. In 1984, she pitched the idea to MGM executive Eileen Miselle, who liked it and teamed Bergstein with producer Linda Gottlieb. They set the film in 1963, with the character of Baby based on Bergstein's own life, and the character of Johnny based on the stories of Michael Terrace, a dance instructor whom Bergstein met in the Catskills in 1985 while she was researching the story. She finished the script in November 1985, but management changes at MGM put the script into turnaround, or limbo.|$|E

The album included a cover of [...] "Georgia on My Mind", which was the first single, and re-recordings of [...] "In a Different Light" [...] and [...] "Why Didn't I Think of That".

500|$|Despite its title, {{the word}} [...] "your" [...] is not {{heard in the}} song until its reprise. The track's {{introduction}} is proceeded by a spoken monologue. Beginning [...] "Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think my collection's complete? Wouldn't you think I'm the girl/The girl who has everything?", [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is [...] "a plea {{for a life of}} discovery" [...] and [...] "inquisitiveness" [...] as opposed to love, using [...] "nonsensical expressions" [...] such as [...] "gadgets", [...] "gizmos", [...] "whosits" [...] and [...] "whatsits" [...] in lieu of various human artifacts. Lyrically, the ballad employs several [...] "twist and turns", using very specific lyrics to describe both the performer's fascination with the human world and desire to walk among them, including [...] "walking around on those what-do-you-call-them?... feet" [...] and [...] "Up where they walk, up where they run/Up where they stay all day in the sun/Wanderin' free, wish I could be/Part of that world." [...] Comprising [...] "impeccable rhymes" [...] while incorporating the term [...] "thingamabobs" [...] into the line [...] "You want thing-a-ma-bobs? I've got twenty but who cares? No big deal, I want more", [...] "Part of Your World"'s [...] "empowering" [...] lyrics convey several messages, such as facing one's fears, believing in oneself, and wishing for new life experiences. The ballad concludes with a final chorus belted [...] "When's it <b>my</b> <b>turn?</b> Wouldn't I love, love to explore that world up above? Out of the sea/Wish I could be/Part of that world".|$|E
