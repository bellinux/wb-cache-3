25|$|Voelker {{spent much}} of his time fishing near Ishpeming when he was not writing. He kept his car stocked with fishing poles and other supplies, and for seven or eight months of the year, he was out fishing or hiking in the woods. He was said to have fished five or six days a week for 20 years, {{according}} to one close friend. He was also known for his skills as a card player, specifically cribbage. Many readers attempted to locate Frenchman's Pond based on the descriptions from his books. Voelker did <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> discourage them from finding it, including leaving debris in the road to the pond, although he did take some people with him to the pond. Frenchman's Pond is still owned by his daughter Grace and his grandson Adam.|$|E

He announced in September of that year {{that he intended to}} start up a newspaper in Calcutta (which would have been India’s first modern newspaper), saying that he had “in manuscript <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> communicate which most intimately concerned every individual”, but he was directed to quit Bengal and proceed to Madras and from thence to take his passage to England. Company officials declared him bankrupt, “to the irretrievable loss of his Fortune”, he later claimed. He never seems {{to have been able to}} redeem himself in the eyes of the Company, and in London and elsewhere fought a rearguard action against his many opponents within it.|$|E

[...] Mr. Hooper has a special relationship with the Muppet character Big Bird, who would often come into Hooper's Store for a birdseed milkshake and a chat. A running gag in the show was that Big Bird would often mispronounce Mr. Hooper's name, although most attempts ended in [...] "ooper," [...] such as [...] "Looper" [...] or [...] "Cooper". [...] Mr. Hooper's first name, Harold, was not revealed until the character earned a GED during night school.|$|E
500|$|Saints Row 2 is {{a mobile}} tie-in action game {{modeled after the}} Saints Row 2 console game.

The game was built on their proprietary Talisman engine, which G5 Senior Producer Mike Zakharov said in 2008 enabled the game {{to have a big}} environment with <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do as [...] "one of the most complex modern mobile games". As compared with its preceding mobile tie-in game (associated with the original Saints Row), the Saints Row 2 mobile game fixed issues of small sprites and too much traffic. Additionally, the developers changed the camera perspective from directly overhead to a slight angle. Saints Row 2 for mobile devices was first announced in June 2008 and released in October. It is compatible with the Nokia N95 and Nokia N81.|$|E

[...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?"

Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the series premiere four out of four stars, commenting that it was as [...] "involving as any new drama and funnier than any new sitcom [...] matches high visual style with a witty-but-never arch sensibility." [...] He highlighted the performances of the six leading actresses, writing, [...] "Individually, each is terrific; combined, they're an irresistible feminine force", and praised Hatcher's [...] "revelatory performance." [...] Bianco also noted that Cherry avoided making the pilot campy. The San Francisco Chronicle Tim Goodman complimented the pilot's tonal diversity while expressing concern that American audiences would [...] "tune in, get freaked out by the scattershot emotional chords and flip over to something safer." [...] However, he praised Cherry's writing {{as well as the}} acting, declaring, [...] "There are almost too <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> love in 'Desperate Housewives.'"

2500|$|The {{study of}} matrix algebra first emerged in England in the mid-1800s. In 1844 Hermann Grassmann {{published}} his [...] "Theory of Extension" [...] which included foundational new topics {{of what is}} today called linear algebra. In 1848, James Joseph Sylvester introduced the term matrix, which is Latin for [...] "womb". While studying compositions of linear transformations, Arthur Cayley was led to define matrix multiplication and inverses. Crucially, Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix, thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object. He also realized the connection between matrices and determinants, and wrote [...] "There would be <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say about this theory of matrices which should, it seems to me, precede the theory of determinants".|$|E
2500|$|Social {{insurance}} can be <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> {{many people}} in many countries.

By forcing everyone in society to be a policyholder and pay premiums, it ensures that everyone can become a claimant when or if he/she needs to. Along the way this inevitably becomes related to other concepts such as the justice system and the welfare state.

2500|$|Dante's day {{is spent}} in the purgatory of serving a {{succession}} of customers while repeating {{the fact that he}} is [...] "not even supposed to be here today". Stressed with the demands of his job, Dante passes time in wide-ranging conversations with his best friend, Randal Graves. Randal is an irresponsible slacker who works in the next-door video store, RST Video, although he spends most of the day at the Quick Stop, neglecting the video store's customers. They converse about <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> pass time, such as whether or not the contractors working on the second Death Star when it was destroyed at the end of Return of the Jedi were innocent victims. Other events of the day include the discovery that Dante's high school girlfriend, Caitlin Bree, whom he has been having early morning phone conversations with, is engaged to be married. Dante's current girlfriend, Veronica Loughran, also stops in to bring him homemade lasagne. The two talk about Dante's stuck-in-a-rut lifestyle with no motivation to change before having an argument about her past sexual partners.|$|E

2500|$|... is {{the other}} unique culture in Keio. During the late Edo period and the early Meiji period, several private prep schools often used {{students}} as assistant teachers and it was called [...] "Learning half and teaching half". Keio also had initially used this system. In the early period of such schools of Western studies, there had been <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> learn not only for students but also professors themselves. Hence there had been sometimes the occasions that students who had learned in advance had taught other students and even professors. After the proper legal systems for education had been set up, those situations have disappeared. However, Fukuzawa thought the essence of academia was and is a continuous learning, and knowing more things provides more learning opportunities. Keio respects his thought and put the rule in [...] "" [...] that there shouldn't be any hierarchy between teachers and learners, {{and all of the}} people in Keio Gijuku are in the same company. For this reason, there is still a culture in this university that all professors and lecturers are officially called with the honorific of [...] "Kun" [...] but never [...] "Teacher" [...] or [...] "Professor".|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{was always}} {{critical}} of the Soviet Union and he does now accept that Mao's regime in China was responsible for 'a huge death toll, {{in the tens of}} millions'. However, back in 1960s, Chomsky was considerably less {{critical of the}} communist movements in Asia, noting what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, [...] "I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. There are <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable." [...] Chomsky continued: [...] "There are even better examples than China. But I do think that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which {{a good deal of the}} collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step." [...] He said of Vietnam: [...] "Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Levinas {{pointed to}} the Judeo-Christian belief that it was God who first {{commanded}} Abraham to sacrifice Isaac and that an angel commanded Abraham to stop. If Abraham were truly in the religious realm, {{he would not have}} listened to the angel's command and should have continued to kill Isaac. To Levinas, [...] "transcending ethics" [...] seems like a loophole to excuse would-be murderers from their crime and thus is unacceptable. One interesting consequence of Levinas' critique is that it seemed to reveal that Levinas viewed God as a projection of inner ethical desire rather than an absolute moral agent. However, one of Kierkegaard's central points in Fear and Trembling was that the religious sphere entails the ethical sphere; Abraham had faith that God is always {{in one way or another}} ethically in the right, even when He commands someone to kill. Therefore, deep down, Abraham had faith that God, as an absolute moral authority, would never allow him in the end to do something as ethically heinous as murdering his own child, and so he passed the test of blind obedience versus moral choice. He was making the point that God as well as the God-Man Christ doesn't tell people everything when sending them out on a mission and reiterated this in Stages on Life's Way. I conceive of God as one who approves in a calculated vigilance, I believe that he approves of intrigues, and what I have read in the sacred books of the Old Testament is not of a sort to dishearten me. The Old Testament furnishes examples abundantly of a shrewdness which is nevertheless well pleasing to God, and that at a later period Christ said to His disciples, “These things I said not unto you from the beginning … I have yet <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now” – so here is a teleological suspension of the ethical rule of telling the whole truth.
