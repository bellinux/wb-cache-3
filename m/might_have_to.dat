5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside. This series of events began to pose questions for Hanoi. The North Vietnamese {{had been willing to}} maintain the status quo in Cambodia as long as their supply lines and sanctuaries were secure. But with the expansion of the war across the border they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take further steps to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|Eight Union sailors {{were killed}} and 44 were wounded while the Confederates lost none. (Captain Joseph Dixon of the river {{batteries}} had been killed the previous day during Carondelets bombardment.) On land the well-armed Union soldiers surrounded the Confederates, while the Union boats, although damaged, still controlled the river. Grant realized that any success at Fort Donelson {{would have to be}} carried by the army without strong naval support, and he wired Halleck that he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> resort to a siege.|$|E
5000|$|The {{architect}} of the deal, Dr. Stephen Dunn, described it as [...] "a good solution, focused on local needs.

5|$|Since the {{versions}} the {{two houses}} had passed were not identical, the bill {{returned to the}} House of Representatives, where on May 25, Arizona's Carl Hayden successfully moved that the House agree to the Senate amendment. The Speaker, Champ Clark, felt that {{the title of the}} bill <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be changed for reasons he did not explain, but Hayden disagreed and Clark did not press his point. The bill passed the House, and was enacted by the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on June 1, 1918.|$|E
5|$|While {{some were}} {{executed}} quickly, others were tortured before being killed. The public torture of prisoners was a traditional ritual in many tribes of the Eastern Woodlands. Captives <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> endure excruciating torture {{for hours and}} even days. The British Indian Department used its influence to discourage the killing and torturing of prisoners, with some success, but in 1782 the Indians revived the practice of ritual torture in order to exact revenge for the slaughter at Gnadenhütten.|$|E
5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E

In any case, the executions did not save him.|$|R

5|$|Based {{around the}} {{overflow}} of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, {{a core of}} personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines, and some resolved that they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel to Europe {{to be sure of}} doing so. Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the new unit. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern Rhodesia, were also attached to the regiment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{two weeks before the}} test, some 250 {{personnel}} from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity site, and Lieutenant Bush's command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the base camp. Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary. They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation. Groves had warned the Governor of New Mexico, John J. Dempsey, that martial law <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be declared in the southwestern part of the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Independence Bowl, the game {{received}} as much or more coverage than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith, who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game. Spread bettors favored Air Force to win the game by four points. Ticket sales were slow in the {{weeks leading up}} to the bowl, and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets. Tech representatives said they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> return as many as 8,000 tickets due to the difficulty of selling tickets for a game more than 20 hours away by car.|$|E

5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding {{stated that}} they were near a bankruptcy, and that they {{intended}} to throw out Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company {{stated that they}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> file for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball stated that they had a 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} well {{organized}} for defense, {{and in the}} Battle for Brest Middleton's units went about capturing it methodically. The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} a potential SANDAG {{purchase of the}} road began in October 2010. On July 29, 2011, SANDAG agreed to purchase the lease of the freeway from South Bay Expressway LLC; even though a study suggested that the agency <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{spend millions of dollars}} to maintain and repair parts of the highway. Objections raised to the purchase during the negotiation phase included needing a loan from the federal government of $1.5 million to complete the purchase, and a possible increase in traffic through Lemon Grove. The sale of the franchise rights until the year 2042 was finalized on December 16, 2011, at a price of $341.4 million, and $10.2 million in additional fees, with $254 million from TransNet sales tax revenue, some of it to be repaid with toll revenue. SANDAG claimed at the time that they would reduce the tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on I-805, which would mean that additional lanes would not need to be constructed on that route. Despite this, the operator decided to increase tolls instead even with the low demand for using the road; the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the decision. in mid-2011, it cost $4 to drive the entire toll portion of the road.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat {{that the}} Strait would be closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means. This was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, 2007 the National Meteorological Service in Mexico decreed zone {{of alert}} from Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. It {{requested}} {{the public to}} take precautions before the possible coming of rain, intense winds and storm surges {{in the south and}} southwestern coasts of Mexico. The Ministry of Education of Guerrero canceled classes at all schools in the evening and close the port navigation. Faced with the prospect of Henriette strengthening, The Head of the Harbor Bay in Acapulco stopped all travel for small craft and coastal fisheries. Also blue and yellow flags were raised as a preventive measure for swimmers. On September 4, the port of Mazatlán, Sinaloa had to be shut down to all navigation due to the inclement weather produced by the hurricane. The port authority reported that Henriette produced waves surpassing 4meters (13ft) in height. The Carnival Pride cruise scheduled to arrive at the port had to be diverted out to sea {{as a result of the}} port's closure. In the city itself, school was suspended for two days, and officials stated that approximately 600families <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be evacuated. Further north, the port of Topolobampo, Sinaloa was also closed due to Henriette's threat, and 20families were evacuated from their homes in an ejido.|$|E

5|$|Værøy Airport {{had opened}} on 1 July 1986 {{as part of}} the {{regional}} airport network in Northern Norway operated by Widerøe. Prior to this, Værøy and Røst had been served by helicopters using a heliport; that had replaced previous services with seaplanes. All services to the airport were suspended immediately after the incident. On 7 May, Widerøe stated that they would not use Værøy Airport, and that they would decline the concession to operate to Værøy if the island community did not receive a new airport. They commented that the restrictions caused by the wind forced the airline to terminate up to half the departures. The chairman of the Widerøe's Pilots' Union, Cpt. Helge Høvik, stated the same day that the airline <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> lower the number of calls at some other regional airports, namely Mosjøen Airport, Kjærstad, Mo i Rana Airport, Røssvold, Sandnessjøen Airport, Stokka and Sandane Airport, Anda. Høvik stated that he felt that many of the airports were located in the wrong place, for instance at the bottom of valleys, on top of hills and between mountains. Widerøe stated that there was not a safety problem at any other regional airports.|$|E
