5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not <b>my</b> <b>dress.</b> This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
25|$|Kahlo and Rivera {{returned}} to New York in March 1933, {{as he had}} been commissioned to paint a mural for the Rockefeller Center. During this time, she only worked on one painting, <b>My</b> <b>Dress</b> Hangs There (1934). She also gave further interviews to the American press. In May, Rivera was fired from the Rockefeller Center project amid an international scandal, as he had included Vladimir Lenin in the mural and refused to change it. He was instead hired to paint a mural for the New Workers School. Although Rivera wished to continue their stay in the United States, Kahlo was homesick, and they {{returned to}} Mexico soon after the mural's unveiling in December 1933.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} really relaxed... {{it was so}} hot. I was {{literally}} dripping! Not nice! In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one up the front of <b>my</b> <b>dress,</b> one {{up the back of}} <b>my</b> <b>dress.</b> I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
500|$|In 2016, Madonna, whilst {{channeling}} {{the theme}} [...] "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology", provided {{one of the}} most controversial outfits in the gala's history. She appeared in an ensemble designed by Givenchy creative director Riccardo Tisci exposing both her breasts and buttocks. Madonna hit back on her official social media channels by stating [...] "We have fought and continue to fight for civil rights and gay rights around the world. When it comes to women’s rights we are still in the dark ages. <b>My</b> <b>dress</b> at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the role}} of the evil Asa and her {{innocent}} descendant Katia, Bava noted: [...] "A strange type was needed, and we chose Steele from pictures." [...] Bava reportedly found Steele difficult to work with. According to Bava, the actress [...] "was somewhat irrational, afraid of Italians. One day she refused to come to the set, because somebody told her I was using a special film-stock that made people appear naked." [...] Steele recalled: [...] "Lord alone knows I was difficult enough. I didn't like my fangs – I had them changed three times. I loathed my wig – I changed that four times. I couldn't understand Italian. I certainly didn't want to allow them to tear open <b>my</b> <b>dress</b> and expose my breasts, so they got a double that I didn't like at all, so I ended up doing it myself – drunk, barely over eighteen, embarrassed and not very easy to be around." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ponting {{was confronted}} by a large media pack shortly after his arrival at Sydney Airport and said he wasn't aware of Lillee's comments. [...] "I'm not {{concerned}} about those things. As long as I am {{doing the right thing}} by everyone in <b>my</b> <b>dressing</b> room as the team and the coaching staff, well then that's all I can do... But as long as I am looking after the guys in <b>my</b> <b>dressing</b> room, then I'll be happy," [...] Ponting stated, adding that he wished to remain captain.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>my</b> white <b>dress</b> {{makes me}} look ghostly," [...] she {{answered}} lightly, though deeply conscious of surprise and pleasure {{at such an}} unexpected reply from him. This borderman might be full of surprises. [...] "Such a time as I had bringing <b>my</b> <b>dresses</b> out here! I don't know when I can wear them. This is the simplest one." ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the birth of her {{daughter}} in 1965, Joni Anderson was gigging again around Yorkville, beginning to sing more of her original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met Chuck Mitchell, an American folk-singer from Michigan. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States. In one interview, Mitchell claimed she married Chuck only 36 hours after they met, but it is unclear if they were ever married in Toronto. Sometime in late April, Mitchell left Canada for the first time, going with Chuck to the US, where the two began playing music together. Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, [...] "I made <b>my</b> <b>dress</b> and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money... I walked down the aisle brandishing my daisies." ...|$|E

And I fell off into the pigpen and <b>my</b> <b>dress</b> got all dirty and the pig runned right over me. <b>My</b> <b>dress</b> was just awful but Davy said if I'd stand under the pump he'd wash it clean, and I did and he pumped water all over me but <b>my</b> <b>dress</b> ain't a bit cleaner and my pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} {{it would be}} more fit--if you will excuse the plainness of <b>my</b> <b>dressing</b> in your presence--that I should go forth and leave you to encounter her alone?" [...] said I.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Gregory! I sha'n't want anything. You {{would not}} let me sell any of <b>my</b> <b>dresses,</b> and I have half a dozen light ones. I shall not want a penny spent on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Louisa locked me out, Dr. Hamilton," [...] {{she cried}} almost hysterically.

6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] said Rosa with a laugh. [...] "Your sister Blanche {{looked very}} well in one of <b>my</b> <b>dresses</b> last year; {{and you know how}} stout she is. We will find some means to {{accommodate}} them all, depend upon it." ...|$|R

I did not wear <b>my</b> own <b>dress,</b> in order that I might avoid observation. I went to be henceforward lost. Make this known. I leave no other charge with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Glad {{you like}} 'em,' {{returned}} Miss Wren, loftily. 'But the fun is, godmother, how I make the great ladies try <b>my</b> <b>dresses</b> on. Though it's {{the hardest part}} of my business, and would be, even if my back were not bad and my legs queer.' ...|$|R
