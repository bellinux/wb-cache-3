5|$|In 2015 {{a common}} grey seal {{found its way}} from the Wash up the river and spent a few weeks {{sleeping}} in gardens next to the river in Deeping St James. The seal was spotted further downstream in Spalding as it eventually <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back to the sea.|$|E
5|$|Surveying of sandbanks {{around the}} harbour was {{completed}} on 18 March, {{and the ship}} <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> down the coast to survey the extent and depths of the Abrolhos reefs, completing and correcting Roussin's survey.|$|E
5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As {{the railroad}} <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E

30|$|The flow method <b>made</b> then <b>its</b> <b>way</b> further {{through the}} work of Hamilton [206], Perelman and others [320, 321, 322], leading to the {{solution}} of the three dimensional Poincaré conjecture (see for example [299] for an exposition).|$|R
50|$|In 1929, a naval {{prisoner}} being escorted {{on a train}} made {{an escape}} through a window while the train taking him to Wellington <b>made</b> <b>its</b> slow <b>way</b> up the incline leading to the tunnel on the northern side, a case {{very similar to the}} 1921 and 1926 escapes.|$|R
5|$|Greek {{influence}}, {{which had}} <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to Phoenicia during the Persian period, now became stronger. Figurines found in Kharayeb show Aegean influence on local craftsmen. This spreading Hellenization interacted {{with the local}} Semitic population substratum, which remained faithful to its gods and its language. It resulted in an artistic and architectural symbiosis best illustrated in the artifacts of Umm el 'Amed and Bustan esh Sheikh.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, when Kwajalein of the Marshall Islands {{was secured}} by the U.S. forces, Sergeant Fernando Bernacett {{was among the}} Marines who were sent to guard various {{essential}} military installations. Bernacett, a combat veteran of the Battle of Midway, guarded the airport and prisoners of war, {{as well as the}} atomic bomb as it <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> for Japan.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, 1940, the 17-year-old Hatfield, {{driving his}} mother's car, struck {{and killed a}} pedestrian, Alice Marie Lane, as she crossed the street. Hatfield was not held criminally liable for the crash, but was found civilly liable to the family. The case <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to the Oregon Supreme Court in 1943, with the court affirming the trial court's decision.|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} HIA {{and how it}} <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>ways</b> into Switzerland {{administrative}} structure is strongly linked to the political functioning of the country. In that perspective, this chapter tackles separately the processes at each institutional level (federal state, cantons states), but also the nexus between them, specifically the Swiss HIA Platform whose purpose is to coordinate and to reinforce the efforts made to initiate HIA in Switzerland. Three founding cantons – Geneva, Jura and Ticino – initiated the creation of this Platform, which is strongly supported by Health Promotion Switzerland. The legal status of HIA in Switzerland, as well on the federal or cantonal level, {{is an important issue}} for its specific context and will be analysed. Finally, the weaknesses, opportunities and perspectives for HIA in Switzerland will be discussed...|$|R

25|$|Singapore history {{dates back}} to the third century. It was a vassal state of various empires before being {{reestablished}} and renamed by Sang Nila Utama. The island was ruled by various sultanates until 1819, when the British came to the island and set up a port and colony. During British rule, the port of Singapore flourished and attracted many migrants. After independence in 1965, Singapore <b>made</b> <b>its</b> own <b>way.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl {{opened at}} #1, {{grossing}} $46,630,690 in its opening weekend and $70,625,971 since its Wednesday launch.

5|$|The attacks at Maldegem and Ursel {{began at}} 08:30. Both I and II./JG 1 became {{involved}} in intense dogfights. III./JG 1 had lost only one aircraft over the target (and not to enemy fire). I./JG lost a further Fw 190 to friendly anti-aircraft fire as it <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to Ursel. III./JG 1 lost at least two further Fw 190s to friendly anti-aircraft fire. Casualties could have been heavier, had the British anti-aircraft defences of Maldegem airfield not been removed in December.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920 divided {{a war with}} Japan into three phases. In the first phase, the {{garrison}} of Singapore would defend the fortress while the fleet <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> from home waters to Singapore. Next, the fleet would sail from Singapore and relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The final phase would see the fleet blockade Japan and force it to accept terms.|$|E
50|$|With {{the fall}} of communism, as with all the Soviet {{satellite}} countries, products were recrafted and repackaged {{to be sold to}} the western markets and toys were no exception. Reflecting the 180 degree change in economic orientation away from the Soviet Union, Kovodružstvo Náchod changed its name to Kovap Náchod in 1991. In 1993, Kaden toys became products of the Czech Republic as Slovakia <b>made</b> <b>its</b> own <b>way</b> in the new Europe (Bábkarská Bystrica 2008). As of 2016, both names had parallel websites (Kaden 2007; Kovap website 2006).|$|R
60|$|There was a {{steaming}} mist {{in all the}} hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it <b>made</b> <b>its</b> slow <b>way</b> through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from {{the light of the}} coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.|$|R
40|$|Greetings! Has spring <b>made</b> <b>its</b> blustery <b>way</b> {{into your}} neighborhood? I'm still shaking the winter from my back but I've noted some brave green shoots nosing {{their way out}} of the ground {{recently}} [...] . so summer IS on <b>its</b> <b>way,</b> right?! OK, maybe that's a stretch, but at least we can look ahead to summer, and with summer the ASEE Annual Conference in Charlotte, NC. I hear North Carolina is famous for its luscious green and varicolored plant life, not to mention warmth and hospitality. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at the conference come June 20 - 23 ! Sheila Curl and many of your dedicated colleagues are working to deliver a vibrant and stimulating program, and your participation will ensure a memorable and rewarding conference.

5|$|A {{worldwide}} tour dubbed The Unholy Alliance Tour, {{was undertaken}} {{to support the}} new record. The tour was originally set to launch on June 6, but was postponed to June 10, as Araya had to undergo gall bladder surgery. In Flames, Mastodon, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, and Thine Eyes Bleed (featuring Araya's brother, Johnny) and Ted Maul (London Hammersmith Apollo) were supporting Slayer. The tour <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> through America and Europe and the bands who participated, apart from Thine Eyes Bleed, reunited to perform at Japan's Loudpark Festival on October 15, 2006.|$|E
5|$|After several false {{starts in}} early September, the Continental Army {{established}} a siege around Fort St. Jean. Beset by illness, bad weather, and logistical problems, they established mortar batteries that {{were able to}} penetrate into the interior the fort, but the defenders, who were well-supplied with munitions, but not food and other supplies, persisted in their defence, believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton. On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly fell, and on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted. When word of this <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to St. Jean's defenders, combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort, the fort's defenders capitulated, surrendering on November 3.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian turned Bounty eastward {{in search of a}} remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle. He had in mind the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{key areas}} the society is focused on is the {{educational}} sector.

40|$|Laparoendoscopic Single-Site Surgery (LESS) has <b>made</b> <b>its</b> fore <b>ways</b> into {{clinical}} practice, {{and allows}} foreseeing a less traumatic surgery without visible scar. Its development reminds the revolution associated with apparition of laparoscopy. Actual clinical experience gained showed that LESS is valid, seems {{as safe as}} conventional laparoscopy, while offering patients a surgery without trace. LESS development, which requires advanced laparoscopy training, has made surgeons and industry rethink surgical ergonomic thus allowing rapid technical innovations. These innovations will change minimally invasive surgery in a near future, {{if they did not}} already. We, now, have to control its evolution to build a safe and reasonable future for minimally invasive surgery combining patients' desire and safety, populations needs...|$|R
6000|$|The {{winter was}} spent in urging these claims, and {{thousands}} of men planned to try some {{one or the other}} of these [...] "side-doors." [...] The movement overland seemed about to surpass the wonderful transcontinental march of miners in '49 and '50, and those who loved the trail for its own sake and were eager to explore an unknown country hesitated only between the two trails which were entirely overland. One of these led from Edmonton to the head-waters of the Pelly, the other started from the Canadian Pacific Railway at Ashcroft and <b>made</b> <b>its</b> tortuous <b>way</b> northward between the great glacial coast range on the left and the lateral spurs of the Continental Divide on the east.|$|R
5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen {{standing}} in line at the movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{then made}} their second substitution, {{bringing}} on Van Persie {{in place of}} Cesc Fàbregas. As the match entered injury time {{at the end of}} the second half, Ronaldo made yet another run down the left wing, outpacing Lauren to Rooney's through-ball. The ball broke back to Rooney 30 yards from goal, but his shot went over the bar. The second half finished with a Wes Brown cross from the right wing that <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> across the penalty area to Ronaldo, but the Portuguese could only head the ball straight at Lehmann.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} commercial plantings in Victoria were near Yering and established by Hubert de Castella, a Swiss immigrant {{who came to the}} region in 1854. The devastation of France's vineyards by the phylloxera louse opened up an opportunity for the British wine market with traditionally heavily favored French wine. Castella was very ambitious and laid out his plans for Victoria to produce enough wine to supply all of England's needs in his treatises John Bull's vineyard. Unfortunately before Castella's grand plan could be fully realized, phylloxera <b>made</b> <b>its</b> own <b>way</b> to Australia and the viticultural setback was compounded with the development of a domestic temperance movement as well as economic uncertainty and labor shortages during the first World War.|$|R
60|$|We {{crossed the}} longer street, up which a clumsy steam tram, {{vomiting}} smoke and sparks, <b>made</b> <b>its</b> clangorous <b>way,</b> and adown which one saw the greasy brilliance of shop fronts and the naphtha flares of hawkers' barrows dripping fire into the night. A hazy {{movement of people}} swayed along that road, and we heard the voice of an itinerant preacher from a waste place between the houses. You cannot see these things as I can see them, nor can you figure--unless you know the pictures that great artist Hyde has left the world--the effect of the great hoarding by which we passed, lit below by a gas-lamp and towering up to a sudden sharp black edge against the pallid sky.|$|R
5000|$|With Clem Morris at the throttle, engine No. 2, {{dragging}} a coach and the combine, <b>made</b> <b>its</b> leisurely <b>way</b> south from Nahcotta and then returned. Mrs. Taylor, of Ocean Park, {{who had been}} on the first train in 1889, was a prominent passenger on the last one. On the engine the peninsula residents hung a mourning wreath for a railroad that had served them well for 42 years. *** Ilwaco's Mayor Brumbach, who had attended the groundbreaking ceremonies over forty years before, addressed the citizenry from the rear platform of the train. Taps was sounded from an old bugle, and as the 3:30 train departed for the last time a salute was fired from the town cannon, to be answered with a long trailing whistle from the locomotive.|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the gondola <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island. The epidemic <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, {{and hit the}} city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors {{that would have to}} take care of 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues from that point on) would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the New Zealand and Australian Division, {{under the}} command of Major General Alexander Godley, was being formed for {{operations}} in the Dardanelles, and the battalion was attached to the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, one of the two infantry brigades (the other was the Australian 4th brigade) that formed the bulk of the division. In April, the division, now part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) embarked for Gallipoli. The Wellington Battalion was landed at Anzac Cove on the afternoon of 25 April, and <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> up to Plugge's Plateau.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes, as {{the caravan}} <b>made</b> <b>its</b> slow <b>way</b> along, a young Boer would dash up upon his horse, and, reining in, ask a few {{questions}} as to their route, and then ride off again. Already the boys had admired the figures and riding of the Boers whom they had seen in action in Zululand, but they were much more struck by their appearance as they saw them now. There are no finer {{men in the world}} than the young Boers of the Transvaal; in after-life they often become heavy, but as young men their figures are perfect. Very tall and powerfully built, they sit their horses as if man and animal were one, and are such splendid marksmen that, while riding at full speed, they can, with almost absolute certainty, bring down an antelope at a distance of 150 yards.|$|R
50|$|Eels, perch and stickleback {{all live}} in the loch {{which is also a}} {{breeding}} site for frogs and toads. The loch has footpaths around its shores and walkers are encouraged by the NTS to include a circuit of the loch during their visit to St. Abb's Head although there is a warning that the paths can be quite muddy after rain. The loch has a stepped outflow which only runs for only several metres before disappearing down a man <b>made</b> drain, finding <b>its</b> <b>way</b> underground to the North Sea which is just 500 metres to the SE.|$|R
60|$|The {{experience}} was a novel one {{to all of}} them; even Mr. Archibald {{had never been in}} the woods so early in the morning. In fact, under these great trees it could scarcely be said to be morning. The young light which <b>made</b> <b>its</b> uncertain <b>way</b> through the foliage was barely strong enough to cast a shadow, and although these woodland wanderers knew that it was a roadway in which they were walking, that great trees stood on each side of them, with branches reaching out over their heads, and that there were bushes and vines and here and there a moss-covered rock or a fallen tree, they saw these things not clearly and distinctly, but as through a veil. But there was nothing uncertain about the air they breathed; full of the moist aroma of the woods, it was altogether different from the noonday odors of the forest.|$|R
