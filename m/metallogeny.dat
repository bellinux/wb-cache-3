40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a modeling procedure of mineral potential mapping based on singularity theory, and further presents {{an idea to}} look into <b>metallogeny</b> of Sn–Cu polymetallic deposits in southeastern Yunnan mineral district, China by applying a localized regression method. Mineralization is a typical cascade process generally accompanied by irregular geological, geochemical and geophysical signatures. Singularity index as an efficient anomaly analytical tool helps to identify anomalies as well as characterize formation processes of these anomalies. In this study, the singularity-based mineral potential mapping method was utilized to characterize hydrothermal mineralization associated with magmatic, tectonic and sedimentary processes in this district. Based on the results, a mineral prospectivity model was constructed to delineate target areas. In addition to mineral prospectivity, controlling effects of geo-processes on mineralization are spatially non-stationary. Geographically-weighted regression analysis was thus employed to investigate these spatially-varied controlling effects and it has contributed to improve understanding to local <b>metallogeny</b> in the study area.

The four-year-Iong IGCP project was begun in 1992 to investigate the petrology and <b>metallogeny</b> of various intracontinental mafic igneous provinces with an overall goal of establishing geological criteria for targeting mineral deposits in such environments. The principal goal of the 1995 meeting is to showcase to the international scientific and exploration communities the significant advances in our understanding of the structure, mineralization, and magmatic history of the Midcontinent rift. Toward this end, three field trips have been organized around the three-day symposium to be held August 25 - 27, 1995 in Duluth. The field trips are designed to provide a broad overview of the geologic framework of the Midcontinent rift, where it is best exposed in the western Lake Superior region. Field trip I (August 19 - 24) looks at the physical volcanology of the flood basalts exposed on Isle Royale. Field trip II (August 22 - 24) highlights the stratigraphy, structure and mineralization of the volcanic and sedimentary rocks forming the southern limb of the Midcontinent rift in Wisconsin and Upper Michigan.

40|$|Accretionary orogens are {{the sites}} of {{long-lived}} convergent margin tectonics, both compressional and extensional. They are also the hosts {{to the majority of}} the world's important gold deposits. A very diverse range of deposit types occurs within accretionary orogens, commonly in close proximity in space and time to each other. These include porphyry and associated high-sulphidation Au-Cu-Ag deposits, classic low-sulphidation Au-Ag deposits, low-sulphidation Au deposits centred on alkalic intrusive complexes, Carlin-type Au deposits, Au-rich volcanic-hosted massive sulphide deposits, orogenic Au deposits, intrusion-related Au deposits and iron oxide Cu-Au deposits. Empirical patterns of spatial distribution of these deposits suggest there must be fundamental generic controls on gold <b>metallogeny.</b> Various lines of evidence lead to the proposal that the underlying key generic factor controlling accretionary orogen gold <b>metallogeny</b> is regional-scale, long-term, pre- and syn-subduction heterogeneous fertilisation of the lithospheric mantle that becomes a source of mineralisation-associated arc magma or hydrothermal fluid components. This process provides a gold-enriched reservoir that can be accessed later in a diverse range of tectonomagmatic settings. Based on this concept, a unified model is proposed in which the formation of a major gold deposit of any type requires the conjunction in time and space of three essential factors: a fertile upper-mantle source region, a favourable transient remobilisation event, and favourable lithospheric-scale plumbing structure. This framework provides the basis for a practical regional-scale targeting methodology that is applicable to data-poor regions. 20 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use {{published}} isotopic ages for gold deposits and related {{rocks in the}} Jiaodong Peninsula (East Shandong Province) to investigate {{the origin of the}} large-scale gold <b>metallogeny</b> in the region, which contains world-class lode gold deposits. According to this database, metallogenic processes in this area occurred in the Mesozoic, with peak activities between 110 Ma and 130 Ma. In the Jiaodong gold province (JGP), the mineralizing events are coeval with or postdate Mesozoic granitoid intrusions. Both the Rb-Sr isochron ages and zircon SHRIMP age dating results suggest that Mesozoic granitoids were emplaced during several thermal events. The identification of inherited zircons coupled with ISr ratios (> 0. 709) indicate that these granitoids were mainly sourced from the continental crust, by remelting or partial melting. ISr values obtained from ores and fluid inclusions are generally higher than 0. 709, and slightly higher than those for Mesozoic granitoids. This also indicates that both ore fluids and metals were mainly sourced from the crust. Synthesis of the available data suggests that collision between the South and North China continents was probably the dominant factor responsible for the gold <b>metallogeny</b> in the JGP. Granitoid emplacement and large-scale gold metallogenesis can be related to three important stages in the geodynamic evolution of a collisional orogen (compression-crustal thickening-uplift, lithospheric delamination and transition to extension, and a final extension phase). The most important metallogenic phase occurred at the transition from collisional compression to extension tectonics. Copyright © 2005 by V. H. Winston & Son, Inc.

30|$|An {{increase}} in tectonic {{activity at the}} start of the Paleozoic resulted in an {{increase in}} the frequency of faulting and the formation, in the Tagil-Magnitogorsk depression, of a volcanic belt. In a number of respects, this volcanic belt is similar to an island-arc, but geophysical data lead us to classify the proposed island-arc structure as an intra-continental rift. A substantial increase in the coefficient of the basicity of the crust resulted from the introducing of large volumes of mafic and ultramafic magma (Zoloev et al. 2012). This has led to a significant change in the <b>metallogeny</b> of the Magnitogorsk area of the Urals fold zone.

40|$|A {{study of}} metallogenic {{relationships}} among Precambrian gold deposits provides some broad new insights regarding genetic problems. Three types of deposits are important: greenstone-hosted lodes, palcoplacers, and graywacke- or turbiditc-hosted ores. Epither-mal deposits are present but are rare and of minor importance. Important gold lodes occur in greenstone belts of all Archcan cratons {{and are a}} worldwide element ofArchean <b>metallogeny.</b> Their temporal distribution, however, exhibits some enig-matic irregularities. They are apparently more important in late Archcan than in early Archcan belts, and much less so in otherwise similar early Proterozoic greenstone belts. Early Proterozoic oxygenation of the atmosphere-hydrosphere may explain the latter situa-tion. The deposits are lacking or are very rare in middle-Proterozoic rocks, but they reap-pear occasionally in late Proterozoic and Phanerozoic orogenic belts. Their origin remains controversial, but broad metallogenic considerations favor original sea-floor hydrothermal exhalative deposition followed by extensive metamorphogenic redistribution rather than a single-stage pigenetic process...|$|E
