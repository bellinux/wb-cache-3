40|$|The {{elimination}} of hot spots and {{the reduction of}} eddy current losses in bushing mounting plates is an important consideration in transformer design. The currently used bushing mounting <b>plates</b> are either <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> or <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> with non-magnetic stainless steel inserts or stainless <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> The authors calculate the eddy current losses in bushing mounting plates using four different methods; (i) an analytical formulation; (ii) a three-dimensional finite element method (FEM); (iii) from measured values of the initial temperature rise; and (iv) from measured values of the steady-state temperature rise. There is a close agreement between the loss values obtained using these four methods. The analysis {{has resulted in a}} detailed understanding of the loss pattern and temperature rise phenomenon in bushing mounting plates. The authors also analyse tank plates of small pad-mounted distribution transformers. It is shown that judicious use of non-magnetic stainless steel can result in considerable energy savings for pad-mounted transformers. FEM simulations are performed to find out cost-effective materials for the tank plates of the pad-mounted transformers.

40|$|The present, paper {{deals with}} the CAE-based study Of impact of {{jacketed}} projectiles on single- and multi-layered metal armour plates using LS-DYNA. The validation of finite element modelling procedure is mainly based on the mesh convergence study using both shell and solid elements for representing single-layered <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> target <b>plates.</b> It, is shown that the proper choice of mesh density and the strain rate-dependent material properties are essential for all accurate prediction of projectile residual velocity. The modelling requirements are initially arrived at by correlating against test residual velocities for single-layered <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> of different depths at impact velocities in the ran. -c of approximately 800 - 870 m/s. The efficacy of correlation is adjudged, {{in terms of a}} 'correlation index', defined in the paper: for which values close to unity are desirable. The experience gained for single-layered plates is next; used in simulating projectile impacts on multi-layered <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> target <b>plates</b> and once again a high degree of correlation with experimental residual velocities is observed. The study is repeated for single- and multi-layered aluminium target plates with a similar level of success in test residual velocity prediction. TO the authors' best knowledge, the present comprehensive study shows in particular for the first time that, with a. proper modelling approach, LS-DYNA can be used with a great degree of confidence in designing perforation-resistant single and multi-layered metallic armour plates...|$|R

50|$|Interestingly, the Elsie mine {{is one of}} {{very few}} anti-personnel mines which use a shaped charge. As {{can be seen from}} the {{specification}} below, the explosive filling is unusually small (i.e. weighs 9.45 grams) compared to most other anti-personnel mine designs, which generally contain a minimum of 30 grams of high explosives. However, the shaped charge in the Elsie mine ensures that most of the force of detonation is directed upwards. As a result it can penetrate a 12 ply vehicle tyre or 3/8 inch (approx 9 mm) <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> A person who has been injured by an Elsie mine generally has a small, deep, circular penetration wound which extends all the way through the bones of their foot and out the other side. The wound is generally severe and debilitating, though rarely fatal - assuming that prompt emergency medical care is provided. In contrast to other anti-personnel mines (e.g. the PMN series), the Elsie is designed primarily to disable its victims, rather than kill them.|$|E

50|$|On a media day at Aberdeen Proving Ground on May 4, 2011, {{reports were}} given about the M855A1's {{performance}} in the field since it was issued 11 months earlier. One primary advantage given by the round is its consistent performance against soft targets. While the older SS109/M855 was yaw-dependant, which means its effectiveness depends on its yaw angle when it hits a target, the M855A1 delivers the same effectiveness in a soft target no matter its yaw angle. The new SMP-842 propellant in the round burns quicker in the shorter M4 carbine barrel, ensuring less muzzle flash and greater muzzle velocity. The M855A1 was able to penetrate 3/8 in of <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> at 300 m. The round even penetrated concrete masonry units, similar to cinder blocks, at 75 m from an M16 and at 50 m from an M4, which the M855 could not do at those ranges. Its accuracy is maintained and sometimes increased, as {{it was able to}} shoot a 2-inch group at 600 m.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of simplified semi-empirical relations for the prediction of residual velocities of small calibre projectiles impacting on <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> target <b>plates,</b> normally or at an angle, and the ballistic limits for such plates. It has been shown, for several impact cases for which test results on perforation of <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> are available, that most of the existing semi-empirical relations which are applicable only to normal projectile impact do not yield satisfactory estimations of residual velocity. Furthermore, it is difficult to quantify some of the empirical parameters present in these relations for a given problem. With an eye towards simplicity and ease of use, two new regression-based relations employing standard material parameters have been discussed here for predicting residual velocity and ballistic limit for both normal and oblique impact. The latter expressions differ in terms of usage of quasi-static or strain rate-dependent average plate material strength. Residual velocities yielded by the present semi-empirical models compare well with the experimental results. Additionally, ballistic limits from these relations show close correlation with the corresponding finite element-based predictions...|$|R
