50|$|At {{the temple}} of Samayapuram, which lies six {{miles to the north}} of Tirucirapalli, the Hindu system of worship is still seen today for the worship of Mariyamman. worship for Mariyamman is a ten-day festival, {{organized}} by temple authorities during the second week in April. Some continue to use an old village customs of worship by offering chickens and goats to the deity, but the animals are no longer sacrificed but sold after being offered. But the main worshipping of the goddess occurs on the road a mile or two from the temple. A hurried walk and dance carries hundreds of thousands of worshippers along the road to the temple. Countless people in the crowd have fasted, shaved their heads, and wear bright yellow clothes, which are sacred to the goddess. Many women and children carry a pot on their heads decorated with the goddess’s favourite leaves of the <b>margosa</b> tree. Young men and women carry similar pots but are followed by drummers and dance more wildly. Larger men and women carry pots of charcoal fire. Some put themselves through a special tribulation of having one of the sacred weapons, dagger, trident, or a spear, inserted through their cheeks or tongues. Through this worship each individual realizes themselves and others through samsara and moksha. In this self-realization he or she is bonded with the goddess, which is the underlining reason of the worship.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the images}} of Lord Jagannath must be made of wood, the priests must first locate an {{appropriate}} tree.

The tree which will be used has to fulfill many conditions. Lord Jagannath is dark in color. So the neem tree from which his deities is to be carved out should be dark; whereas the trees which would be used for the deities of his brother and sister are lighter in color; as his siblings are fair! The Neem tree for Lord Jagannath must have four principal branches - symbolizing four arms of Narayana. There must be a water body near the tree - like a river or a large pond and a cremation ground nearby. An ant-hill should be close to the tree and at the roots of the tree there must be a snake-pit of a cobra. No bird must have made nests in the tree; and no branches would have broken or cut. The tree has to be located near a three-way or would be surrounded by three mountains. No creepers must have grown on the tree and there have to be Varuna, Sahada and Vilva trees (these three trees are not very common) close by. There have to be a hermitage and a temple of Lord Shiva in the vicinity. The most amazing requirement is, on the tree trunk there must be natural impressions of conch-shell and chakra (wheel)! ...|$|E
50|$|Jaffna kingdom {{was less}} feudalized than other kingdoms in Sri Lanka, such as Kotte and Kandy. Its economy {{was based on}} more money {{transactions}} than transactions on land or its produce. The Jaffna defense forces were not feudal levies; soldiers in the kings service were paid in cash. The king’s officials, namely Mudaliayars, were also paid in cash and the numerous Hindu temples seem not to have owned extensive properties, unlike the Buddhist establishments in the South. Temples and the administrators depended on the king and the worshippers for their upkeep. Royal and Army officials were thus a salaried class and these three institutions consumed over 60% of the revenues of the kingdom and 85% of the government expenditures. Much of the kingdom's revenues also came from cash except the Elephants from the Vanni feudatories. At {{the time of the}} conquest by the Portuguese in 1620, the kingdom which was truncated in size and restricted to the Jaffna peninsula had revenues of 11,700 pardaos of which 97% came from land or sources connected to the land. One was called land rent and another called paddy tax called arretane.Apart from the land related taxes, there were other taxes, such as Garden tax from compounds where, among others, plantain, coconut and arecanut palms were grown and irrigated by water from the well. Tree tax on trees such as palmyrah, <b>margosa</b> and iluppai and Poll tax equivalent to a personal tax from each.

30|$|Neem plant (Azadirachta indica) is {{well known}} for its {{medicinal}} properties. Known with different names {{in different parts of the}} world (Indian Lilac, <b>Margosa,</b> Dogonyaro), neem has been well established for its medicinal properties such as in treatment of various ailments. In Africa, it is popular in the treatment of malaria and for its effectiveness as an antibacterial agent. Recently, A. indica like other similar botanicals is gaining prominence in its application in treatment of plant-related diseases. In a research conducted by Mahmoud et al. [1], 5 % aqueous leaf extract of neem was shown to cause inhibition in growth of six tested fungal pathogens (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Candida albicans and Microsporum gypseum). In another research, aqueous neem extracts inhibited A. niger more than C. albicans, while alcohol neem extract inhibited C. albicans better than A. niger [2]. Neem plant is effective against fungal growth, a quality which may be used in increasing the shelf life of plant tubers after harvest.|$|E
