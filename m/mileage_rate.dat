For example, to limit their employees’ permitted <b>mileage</b> <b>rate,</b> to regulate variable expense coverage (e.g., fuel, tolls), etc. In this regard, we would like to note that a recent report [30] which summarizes the company car market for 2011, a year after the last reform in the value of personal use calculation, points out that the absolute number of company cars in Israel remains constant whereas their share in the total fleet has slightly decreased to 12.2  %. Figures in this report show that the gap in the average annual mileage driven is similar to the study findings: annual average for company cars in 2011 was 27, 900  km., compared to the annual average for privately owned cars of 15, 800  km.
