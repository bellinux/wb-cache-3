Refugees from the War of 1812, {{primarily from the}} Chesapeake Bay and Georgia Sea Islands, fled the United States to settle in Hammonds Plains, Beechville, Lucasville, North Preston, East Preston, and Africville. An April 1814 proclamation of Black freedom and settlement by British Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane led to an exodus of around 3,500 Black Americans by 1818. The settlement of the refugees was initially seen {{as a means of}} creating prosperous agricultural communities; however, poor economic conditions following the war coupled with the granting of infertile farmland to refugees caused economic hardship. Social integration would prove difficult in the early years, as the prevalence of enslaved Africans in the <b>Maritimes</b> <b>caused</b> the newly freed Black Canadians to be viewed on the same level of the enslaved. [...] Militarily, a Black Loyalist named Richard Pierpoint, who was born about 1744 in Senegal and who had settled near present-day St. Catharines, Ontario, offered to organize a Corps of Men of Colour to support the British war effort.

This [...] "Coloured Corps" [...] fought at Queenston Heights and the siege of Fort George, defending what would become Canada from the invading American army.

40|$|The {{world is}} seeing more {{maritime}} disasters every year, {{in a variety}} of jurisdictions around the world. Many of these disasters cause a large number of deaths. As a result of those deaths, there is often pressure on the relevant authorities to prosecute the parties responsible. The master of the vessel may be the most obvious party to charge, but there may have been other parties responsible for the operation and management of the vessel whose negligent or reckless conduct contributed to the vessel’s demise. Despite the contributions of other parties, the master of a vessel may become a scapegoat, and, as a result, bear the brunt of any prosecution. There are several reasons why the master may receive the most blame in these situations. One of those may be that the law in force within the relevant jurisdiction does not provide particular criminal charges that apply to parties other than the master. This paper asks whether Australian law encourages prosecuting bodies to scapegoat the master of a vessel and whether this is demonstrative of the wider problem of seafarer criminalisation worldwide. Criminal law will be fit for its intended purpose if it provides prosecuting authorities with the means to prosecute those truly responsible for damage caused, and to prosecute those parties in an appropriate manner. In 2012, the Australian government spearheaded sweeping changes to domestic maritime law. Those changes brought several new criminal charges relevant to <b>maritime</b> disasters <b>causing</b> death, and amended previous charges. This paper looks to the law in Australia applicable to <b>maritime</b> disasters <b>causing</b> death and asks whether the laws are fit for their intended purpose.

5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong <b>maritime</b> influence, <b>causing</b> extreme temperatures (hot or cold) to be rare.|$|R

The system’s proposed area of operation is the waters of Indonesia, as current antipiracy solutions are not feasible due to the region’s unique physical geography. Worldwide deployment is possible with minimal modifications. The systems engineering process was used to identify a system that effectively and economically prevents pirates from boarding commercial vessels. A model of the operational environment was developed in MATLAB to run simulations designed to estimate the relative effectiveness of each assessed countermeasure. A cost analysis was performed on the most effective system configurations to determine economic feasibility; the best-value system was recommended. The results of the project indicated that the P-Trap countermeasure, designed to entangle the pirate’s propellers with thin lines, is both effective and economically viable for wide-scale deployment. The further addition of a fire hose system using net projectiles to increase the difficulty of boarders to climb onto the vessel was found to enhance the system effectiveness, while remaining cost-effective...|$|R

40|$|Some of the world’s most ancient, {{but still}} viable, organisms have since the {{beginning}} of <b>maritime</b> <b>caused</b> problems for the industry. The problems affect both the longlivety and efficiency of ships which is caused by the mere presence of organisms attached to the ship hulls. The organisms, called biofoulers, causes problems with longlivety related to moisture and crevice corrosion which break down the hull material. The problem regarding efficiency of the ship is related to the added hydrodynamical resistance that the biofoulers cause. To limit fouling in the marine industry, paint poisonous to the biofoulers is applied to prohibit growth. Until recent the paint seemed to be a long-term solution but severe damage to the sea life has been traced to the use of antifouling paint. This master thesis aims on exploring one putative solution to the problems related to biofouling. In a maritime perspective, advanced stainless steels are modern materials with use limited to fittings and certain high strength parts. However, in 2014 a small ship constructed completely in super duplex stainless steel 2507 was launched. Immediately the longlivety of the ship increased by several times. The approach was that no antifouling paint was necessary, but biofoulers will grow on the now non-poisonous surface. Surprisingly, in some areas of the ship the biofoulers adhered seemed to detach when driving the ship in certain speeds. This lead to the initiative to examine this mechanism further in the form of this master thesis. The master thesis was held at Sandvik Materials TechnologyAB. The main hypothesis was that adhesion of biofoulers will decrease with decreasing surface roughness. Few studies on the subject stainless steel, biofouling and surface roughness have been performed. Even fewer studies on stainless steel with metallic surface coatings and biofoulers have been performed why another hypothesis was driven: There are surface coatings which will affect growth and adhesion of biofoulers. 22 different stainless steel 2507, 3207 and 316 L surface setups were produced by either polishing, coating, bending or magnetizing. Plates were analysed before being immersed in natural seawater in Brest, France for 70 days. After 70 days, the plates were taken up and two major tests were performed at site; fouling amount rank analysis and barnacle adhesion strength measurements. SEM and GDOES were used in the post-experment analysis. No sign of corrosion on the plates were found. The data was processed and results were obtained: Maximum corrosion potential, surface roughness, barnacle adhesion strength and biofouling has quite strong or strong correlations. The lowest barnacle mean adhesion strength was measured to 0. 02 MPa. In practical, based on experimental formulated formulas, the low adhesion barnacles would detach in a water flow of 11 m/s. ...|$|R
