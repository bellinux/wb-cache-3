25|$|The {{elevator}} is {{a vertical}} structure, developed along the Rua de Santa Justa, {{consisting of a}} <b>metal</b> <b>tower,</b> observation platform, walkway and base. Its base includes four vertical columns, each composed of two pillars. The largest part of the structure runs parallel to the Rua de Santa Justa. With a height of 45 metres, covering seven stories, the tower includes two elevator cabins, decorated in wood, mirrors and windows, and with an initial capacity for 24 passengers in each (updated to 29 people later). The structure includes a dozen transverse beams, forming a double lattice, supported at the top by foundations at the Escadinhas de Santa Justa. On {{the sides of the}} elevator, the walkway is articulated by means of bearings, {{as well as on the}} pillars, which is articulated at the base.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, a <b>metal</b> <b>tower</b> {{containing}} a siderostat for collecting the sun's rays and directing them by mirrors to an optical bench inside the observatory, was erected {{adjacent to the}} west wing for studies related to the upper atmosphere. [...] This project was abandoned after a few years. [...] This tower, with its mirrors still present, {{is no longer in}} use.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{happened}} {{until the}} beginning of 1886, but with the re-election of Jules Gr√©vy as President and his appointment of Edouard Lockroy as Minister for Trade decisions began to be made. A budget for the Exposition was passed and on 1 May Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition which was being held for a centerpiece for the exposition, which effectively made the choice of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion: all entries had to include a study for a [...] four-sided <b>metal</b> <b>tower</b> on the Champ de Mars. On 12 May a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals and on 12 June it presented its decision, which was that only Eiffel's proposal met their requirements. After some debate about the exact site for the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him one and a half million francs toward the construction costs. This was {{less than a quarter of}} the estimated cost of six and a half million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation during the exhibition and for the following twenty years. Eiffel later established a separate company to manage the tower.|$|E

50|$|When {{lightning}} strikes a <b>metal</b> <b>tower</b> or strikes near a building containing electrical equipment, a large, rapidly changing magnetic field is generated. This magnetic field induces current onto power lines, often disrupting electrical service, and also induces current into other electrical conductors such as electrical equipment and even structural metal used in construction, such as rebar used to reinforce concrete. These induced currents can easily damage electronic equipment.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, {{droughts}} led to series of devastating wildfires in the Adirondacks. New York's Forest, Fish and Game Commission (FFGC), a predecessor land-management agency to today's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), decided to follow Maine's example and build fire lookouts on strategically located mountains throughout the range. In 1912 a trail was cut and a wooden tower built atop Poke-O-Moonshine; five years later the current <b>metal</b> <b>tower</b> replaced it.|$|E
50|$|The {{radiation}} source within the Godiva device was a fissile metallic mass (usually highly enriched 235U), about 30 cm in diameter. This was {{located at the}} top of a two-metre-high <b>metal</b> <b>tower.</b> The burst of radiation was produced when a piston of fissile material was quickly inserted and extracted from a cavity within the larger fissile mass. During the time these two masses were combined, they formed a critical mass and a nuclear chain reaction was briefly sustained.|$|E

It was designed in the National Park Service Rustic style, {{and is one of}} only four similar structures in California, with the Crane Flat Fire Lookout being the only other in Yosemite. These lookouts were specifically designed to blend with their surroundings, in contrast to the <b>metal</b> <b>towers</b> used by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|R
50|$|Eigg {{lighthouse}} is {{an active}} lighthouse located on the islet of Eilean Chathastail, one of the Small Isles about 110 m off Eigg. The lighthouse was built in 1906 on project by David A. and Charles Alexander Stevenson; it is a cylindrical <b>metal</b> <b>tower</b> 8 m high with gallery and lantern painted white and is a minor light owned by Northern Lighthouse Board but managed by Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust. The light emits a white flash every 6 seconds.|$|E
50|$|It was {{at about}} that time Superman showed up to help the police break up the event. Willis' fans showed support for her by {{throwing}} stuff at the Man of Steel, when suddenly, lightning struck the stage, setting it on fire. Superman pushed Willis to safety as a second bolt of lightning electrified the <b>metal</b> <b>tower</b> on the stage; the electricity ran through Superman's body and into a wire on stage which Willis then stepped on, shocking Willis and changing her appearance.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} the {{expansion}} of the Castle between 1865 and 1873, it proved necessary to reposition the lights. In 1866, the Low Light - a white circular granite tower with a red lantern - was built to replace the Hurst Tower. In 1911, this light was itself replaced with a red square <b>metal</b> <b>tower,</b> standing on steel joists attached to the Castle wall. It has since been decommissioned, but both of these Low Lights remain in place, the former painted grey and the latter blue/battleship grey to camouflage them and prevent confusion for mariners.|$|E
