40|$|Wood-inhabiting fungi on {{pedunculate oak}} (Quercus robur) coarse woody debris (CWD) was {{investigated}} in 50 plots of 0. 1 ha in oak stands of different ages in Lithuania. In <b>maturing</b> <b>stands</b> (50 - 120 years) the average volume of oak CWD was 4. 7 m 3 /ha, and in <b>mature</b> <b>stands</b> (over 120 years) – 13. 9 m 3 /ha. Both in <b>maturing</b> and <b>mature</b> <b>stands,</b> the greatest fraction of CWD consisted of fallen oak branches (81 % and 84 % respectively), whereas fallen trunks comprised about 10 % of the total units of CWD. In total 1350 records of 203 species (49 ascomycetes and 154 basidiomycetes) were collected during 2 years of investigation. Species richness and abundance increased significantly {{with the increase of}} volume and abundance of CWD. Higher species richness was detected in <b>mature</b> <b>stands</b> than in <b>maturing</b> ones. Wood-inhabiting species composition varied greatly at stand scale, and one third of all detected species occurred only in one plot. Red-listed fungi were found only in <b>mature</b> <b>stands.</b> We conclude that, even in managed oak stands, oak CWD maintains a rather diverse species composition of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. However, the current practice of forestry in Lithuania of removing dying or dead wood of large volume, e. g. standing and fallen trunks, reduce the distribution of highly specialized, usually rare, and endangered fungi...|$|R
30|$|Although {{the scatter}} plots of Fig.  5 do not reveal any narrow stand stage which is optimal for fertilization, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that very young <b>stands</b> or dense <b>mature</b> <b>stands</b> should not be fertilized.

50|$|Virtually {{the entire}} Crow's Nest Peninsula is forested with an impressive, <b>mature</b> <b>stand</b> of mixed hardwoods. Hardwood forests of this extent are {{becoming}} increasingly rare in the Virginia and Chesapeake Bay coastal plain due to prevalent forestry practices and fragmentation of natural areas for development and agriculture. The size and continuity of this hardwood stand enhance its viability and its value in providing a large, unfragmented natural area for diverse organisms. Within {{a relatively short time}} (50-100 years), this forest will also comprise a substantial occurrence of old-growth forest with inestimable scientific, biological, and aesthetic values. Currently, trees greater than 60 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) are common, and very large relict tree specimens are scattered throughout the site.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} {{elements}} of modern agriculture {{are used in the}} context of the traditional intensive cropping patterns. To maximize year-round use of the land, two or more crops are planted each year where possible. Rice, wheat, cotton, vegetable, and other crop seedlings are sometimes raised in special seedbeds and then transplanted to fields. Transplanting shortens the time required for a crop to mature, which allows farmers the opportunity to squeeze in an additional crop each growing season. Another method to make optimum use of scarce land is to plant seedlings in a <b>mature</b> <b>stand</b> of another crop. For example, when planting winter wheat in October, farmers in the north leave spaces among the rows so that cotton seedlings can be planted or transplanted in April and May. Without intercropping, farmers could raise only one crop a year. Mechanization supports this intensive cropping pattern. Despite a huge rural labor force, labor shortages occur each season when farmers are required to harvest one crop and plant another in its place, all within the space of a few weeks. In the 1980s farmers invested in harvesting and planting machinery to overcome the shortage of labor. Seed breeders also supported intensive cropping patterns by selecting and breeding varieties that had shorter growing seasons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Different {{wildlife}} species respond {{differently to}} differ-ent seral stages of pinyon-juniper ecosystems. People also have widely different preferences and uses associated with {{different stages of}} succession. Bighorn sheep prefer early seral communities, while forage values for elk and mule deer are much higher in early to mid seral stages, and <b>mature</b> <b>stands</b> provide hiding and thermal cover. Trees used as Christmas trees are more common from young, open stands. Some birds require older stands for seed. Pinyon seed crops are important commercially and for personal use. Some wildlife species are cavity nesters and require large trees in <b>mature</b> <b>stands.</b> Firewood and cedar posts come from <b>mature</b> <b>stands.</b> Water-shed values can also vary with seral stage. Visual and intrinsic preferences vary greatly among individuals. To integrate such diverse values into management for multiple uses, managers use tools that include an inventory of ecological units, and studies and recorded observations for each ecological unit, to understand capa-bilities and values of separate units within landscapes. Application of such an inventory to multiple use management is explored...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the occurrence of}} carabid beetles along a forest succession gradient in central Finland (forest age classes: 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 years since clear-cutting). Species richness of carabids was higher in the two youngest age classes, while no clear differences were detected in carabid abundance. The high species richness in the young, open sites was due to invasion of open-habitat species. Many forest species were absent from or scarce in the young sites and became gradually more abundant towards the older forest age classes. The catches indicated a drastic decrease and assemblagelevel change in concert with canopy closure, i. e. 20 – 30 years after clear-cutting. Some forest specialists with poor dispersal ability may face local extinction, if the proportion of mature forest decreases further and the remaining <b>mature</b> <b>stands</b> become more isolated. We recommend that, while harvesting timber, connectivity between <b>mature</b> <b>stands</b> is ensured, <b>mature</b> <b>stands</b> are maintained close (a few tens of metres) {{to each other and}} the matrix quality is improved for forest species by green tree retention.

50|$|As aforementioned, the {{tallow tree}} is a {{non-native}} species to many {{places around the}} world. Its introduced status in North America along with the harm it causes to ecosystems makes the tree considered an invasive species there. Tallow trees present a danger of expansion that can hurt local ecosystems by out-competing native vegetation and creating a monoculture. The monoculture would then lower the species diversity and overall resilience of the area. The tree’s tenacious nature, high growth rates, and high reproductive ability contribute to its invasive success. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, tallow trees begin producing viable seed in as soon as three years. They can spread by root sprouts and cuttings and are quick to invade after a disturbance occurs in an area, due to the clearing out of land. A single tallow tree can produce nearly 100,000 viable seeds annually that can remain in the soil for several years before sprouting. A <b>mature</b> <b>stand</b> can produce 4,500 kilograms of seeds per hectare per year. These seeds are easily carried to different places by birds and water. Tallow trees can remain productive for 100 years. It is also extremely hard to kill—its poisonous features in its leaves and berries leave it with few to no predators, and its short generation time means even freshly cut trees can quickly regrow. Currently, herbicides and prescribed fire are the only effective treatments available to contain and control Chinese tallow.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 Browse {{production}} and use by moose (Alces alces gigas) in interior Alaska {{was investigated in}} 4 and 2 -year-old quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) coppice stands following clear-felling without removal of the mature aspen stems. Moose winter browse utilization, as related to distance from cover, coarse woody debris (CWD), and browse species composition, was quantified. Aspen terminal leaders were sampled to relate current annual growth (CAG) dry biomass (g) to leader diameter (mm). Stem density, current annual browse production, and browse use were estimated. Browse use was determined as 1) proportion of aspen stems browsed (stand scale), 2) proportion of browsed leaders per stem (stem scale), and 3) diameter-at-point-of-browsing (leader scale). Aspen sucker density ranged from 23, 000 - 43, 000 stems/ha. Terminal leader diameter {{was found to be}} a good estimator of individual stem CAG biomass. CWD did not impede moose utilization of stems. Browse use declined from <b>mature</b> <b>stand</b> edge to center (100 m). Beyond 15 m from <b>mature</b> <b>stand</b> edge browse use was low compared to that within 15 m of the stand edge.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Presentation date: 1999 - 02 - 12 Understory {{vegetation}} in artificially created {{tree canopy}} {{gaps in the}} Pacific Northwest was studied to determine 1) variation in understory vegetation cover between gap edges and gap centers, {{as well as between}} control and treatment plots, 2) spatial patterns of biomass and difference in biomass patterns among plots, 3) individual species responses to gap creation and 4) the relationships between species dominance and diversity by site and treatment. Data were collected in 1990 and 1997 in 16 plots (two controls and two treatments at each of four study sites: the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest and Martha Creek, Panther Creek, and Trout Creek in the Wind River Experimental Forest). Two of the sites are oldgrowth stands (250 - 500 years old), while the other two sites are mature stands (90 - 150 years old). Six growing seasons after gap creation, average percent cover of understory vegetation was greater within gaps than at gap edges. Vegetation cover had increased significantly in all artificial gaps, and it had increased more in gaps than in controls. Vegetation cover increased more at Martha Creek, a <b>mature</b> <b>stand,</b> than at H. J. Andrews and Trout Creek, the two old-growth stands, or at Panther Creek, a <b>mature</b> <b>stand.</b> Understory biomass increased more in gaps than in controls and the amount of increase varied by site. Initial understory biomass was highest in Panther Creek and Martha Creek, but the magnitude of biomass increase was greatest in Trout Creek and H. J. Andrews. Biomass patterns in 1990 and 1997 were more patchy in old-growth stands than in mature stands. Vegetation cover of most understory species increased from 1990 to 1997 in artificial gaps, but species' responses were often site specific. In some cases, species with advantageous dispersal mechanisms (such as rhizomes, stolons, or clonal growth, e. g. Rubus ursinus, or Acer cinncinatum) increased in cover and biomass more than species without such advantageous dispersal mechanisms. Cover of weedy species such as Epilobium angustfolium and Lactuca muralis increased dramatically (up to 25 times) in artificial gaps, but weedy species represented less than two percent of the total average cover in 1997. Species dominance and diversity did not respond consistently following gap creation. Species dominance was relatively high (species with highest dominance was 30 g/m 2) and diversity relatively low (38 species) at Martha Creek, a <b>mature</b> <b>stand,</b> whereas species dominance was low and diversity high at H. J. Andrews (9 g/m 2, 51 species), an old-growth site.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the long-term effects}} of clearcutting and slash treatment on understory plant species composition in Rocky Mountain coniferous forests, we collected comparable data from 30 - to 50 -year-old post-harvest <b>stands</b> and adjacent <b>mature</b> (> 100 -year-old) stands that originated after wildfire. In general, plant species richness was higher in the post-harvest stands than in adjacent <b>mature</b> <b>stands,</b> {{due in large part to}} the presence of species that benefit from disturbance. Species composition in post-harvest and <b>mature</b> <b>stands</b> was more similar in montane forests (2710 – 2805 m elevation) than in subalpine forests(2800 – 3164 m elevation), suggesting greater resilience of montane understories. Composition in post-harvest and <b>mature</b> <b>stands</b> was least similar when slash was piled and burned, and most similar when slash was lopped and scattered. Eighty-seven percent of the post-harvest stands had at least one exotic species, but total cover of exotic plant species in all post-harvest stands was ≤ 1 %. Exotic species were largely absent from mature forests. Our results suggest that understory species of low-elevation montane forests recover more quickly from disturbance than do those of subalpine forests, with slash treatment and species life history traits strongly influencing this recovery...|$|R
