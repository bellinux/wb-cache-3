We also intended to identify the components that most affected the effective operational cost. The data of three milk production systems with pure Holstein cows were used. The total and operational cost methodology was used for the profitability analysis. All three production systems present negative gross and net margin, therefore, they are undergoing undercapitalization and accumulating debt, because the revenues earned are not enough to pay, at least, the effective operating expenses. The component items of the effective operational cost that had higher impact in relation to the effective operational cost were, in decreasing order, feeding, rearing and fattening, labor, <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>expenditure,</b> sanitation, energy, milking, reproduction, machine rental, BST and taxes...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{key areas}} being {{emphasized}} in ISO 9001 Quality Management System (QMS) is performance measurement towards achieving continual improvement. Currently most of the quality performance indicators devised by ISO 9001 certified contractors are the physical parameters such as list of defects, number and category of nonconformances (NCR), number of customer complaints and scoring from customer feedback forms. However, these parameters are unable to be linked with the project cost performance. In view of the problem this research is carried out with the aim to develop a measurement tool {{that can be used}} to measure the project quality performance by ISO 9001 certified contractors with respect to cost. The objectives of the research are to evaluate the current knowledge and practice on quality cost, to identify construction activities affecting quality, and to develop the quality cost matrix that can serve as an effective tool to analyze quality cost in construction projects. The research was carried out in four distinct stages and employed two main instruments of data collection i. e. questionnaire survey and semi-structured interview with the experts. The results from the exploratory survey revealed that lack of knowledge on quality cost prevails among the project management team. This leads to low practice of quality cost in our construction industry. However, majority of the respondents agreed that quality cost can be a good quality performance indicator. The proposed quality cost matrix utilized the Preventive Appraisal Failure (PAF) model. Based on the results from the survey and semi-structured interviews a quality cost matrix that tailored to the local working environment was developed. The breakdown of the main components in the matrix is in accordance to QLASSIC basic assessment structure i. e. structural, architectural, M & E, and external work. In addition this matrix also includes other failure cost which comprises of wastage of material, Liquidated and Ascertain Damages (LAD), regulatory penalty, and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>expenditure.</b> In terms of causes of failure the research has grouped failures into four Ms i. e. material, method, machine and man. The developed matrix was validated through special focus group workshop which consisted of experts from the quality consultancy companies. One of the significant contributions from this research is that the quality cost matrix can be used to measure the effectiveness of the established quality plan for a given project. Furthermore the output of the research would enable to improve on data analysis by ISO 9001 certified contractor...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to compare household consumption patterns of the 27 countries of the European Union and their evolution during the period 1998 – 2005. We want to know if there is a general tendency revealed in their consumption and if consumption is related to recent theories of modernization. According to these theories, modernization produces convergence, equality, and individuation. Factor analysis distin-guishes two dimensions. The first dimension is positively correlated with GDP. Households in the countries which advance on this X-axis dedicate a smaller part of their budgets to food and alcoholic beverages. They dedicate more of their budget to recreation and culture, furnishings, transportation, and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The second dimension correlates negatively with the rate of female employment and with educational variables. Households in the countries situated on the positive part of this Y-axis spend a greater part of their budgets in restaurants, hotels and cafes, and on education.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine incremental health care resource utilization, incremental health care expenditures, incremental absenteeism, and incremental absenteeism costs associated with Osteoarthritis. An observational database analysis was conducted using information from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Individuals 18 years of age or older and employed during 2011 were eligible for inclusion in the sample for analyses. Individuals were identified with Osteoarthritis diagnosis based on ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis codes. Out of a sample of 26, 992 individuals, 1, 354 were diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Individuals with osteoarthritis were compared to individuals without osteoarthritis. ^ Incremental health care resource utilization examined included annual hospitalization, annual hospital days, annual emergency room visits, annual outpatient visits. Incremental health expenditures examined included annual inpatient expenditures, annual outpatient expenditures, annual emergency room <b>expenditures,</b> annual <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>expenditures,</b> annual medication expenditures and annual total expenditures. Incremental resource utilization, incremental resource expenditures, incremental absenteeism and incremental absenteeism costs were estimated using regression models, adjusting for other covariates including age, gender, sex, region, marital status, insurance coverage, comorbidities, anxiety, asthma, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Multivariate regression models revealed incremental mean annual resource use associated with osteoarthritis of 0. 07 hospitalizations, equal to 70 additional hospitalizations per 100 osteoarthritic patients annually, and 3. 63 outpatient visits, equal to 363 additional visits per 100 osteoarthritic patients annually. Mean annual incremental total expenditures associated with osteoarthritis were $ 2, 046. Mean annual incremental expenditures were largest for inpatient expenditures at $ 826, followed by mean annual incremental outpatient expenditures of $ 659, and mean annual incremental medication expenditures of $ 325. Mean annual incremental absenteeism was 2. 2 days and mean annual incremental absenteeism costs were $ 715. 74. ^ In conclusion, osteoarthritis was associated with considerable incremental health care resource utilization and expenditures. Presence of osteoarthritis was also associated with significant incremental absenteeism and incremental absenteeism costs. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The main {{aim of this study}} was the reconstruction of the life histories {{of the members of the}} Steam Engine Maker's Society during the period August 1835 to December 1876, to permit the analysis of labour mobility, unemployment, sickness, ageing, retirement, death and the interaction of these states and events over the life course. Main Topics : The Steam Engine Maker's Database is a relational database, which contains information from the records of the Steam Engine Maker's Society (SEM) about inter-branch transfers, payments of travelling benefit to members seeking work, unemployment benefit payments, sickness benefit payments, superannuation payments and funeral benefit payments. It is particularly useful for the analysis of labour mobility, unemployment, sickness, ageing, retirement, death and the interaction of these states and events over the life course. The database consists of 10 tables: Reports holds information about each SEM Annual Report published between 1835 and 1880. Br_names provides alternative versions of branch names which appear in any Annual Report up to 1879. Also handles any text strings used to identify a branch. Branches holds information about every SEM branch which existed up to those listed in the 1878 Annual Report. Members holds information taken from the branch membership lists and the footnotes in the SEM Annual Reports from 1835 until 1876. Also includes synthesised data covering the 1849, 1857 and 1870 reports, to replace missing data. Widows holds information about members' widows who were listed as entitled to funeral benefit at the end of the branch membership lists in the SEM Annual Reports from 1861 until 1876. Also includes synthesised lists covering the missing 1870 report. Payments holds all payments of sickness benefit to named members listed in the SEM Annual Reports from 1835 until 1876; all payments of unemployment benefit starting in 1837; all payments of superannuation from 1842; and all payments of strike pay from 1875. Items of <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>expenditure</b> are also included wherever there is a named beneficiary. Travelling holds payments of travelling benefit to members seeking work. The only benefit provided under the SEM's initial 1827 rules was travelling relief, whereby a member seeking work could claim from each branch visited 'his supper, one pint of beer, one night's lodging, his breakfast in the morning, and one penny for every mile he may have travelled since last relieved'. The tramping system this benefit formed part of declined in importance after 1850, and the union supplemented it by the payment of member's train fares when travelling to known vacancies. Holds information on the deaths of members, their wives and widows and the payment of funeral benefit taken from the Annual Reports up to the end of 1876. Gaps in the Annual Reports have been filled using data from the Monthly Reports. Reg_book holds information taken from the SEM's manuscript Registration Books, containing information on age, trade and marital status of members on their admission to the union. Rb_event holds information concerning subsequent events listed in the SEM Registration Book Ase_reg holds information taken from the Amalgamated Society of Engineers' (ASE) Registration Book. Many members of the SEM transferred to the ASE on the creation of the latter union in 1851, and in principle this table includes all such ex-members of the SEM, plus a selection of men joining the ASE by other routes. D_cert holds information taken from death certificates of SEM members, including age and cause of death...|$|E
40|$|Data {{obtained}} from 4 different capacity houses were evaluated to analyse the cultural energy and perfor- mance of broilers. Capacities of housings were 20, 000, 25, 000, 30, 000 and 60, 000 birds per production peri- od {{and they were}} assigned as HI, HII, HIII and HIV, respectively. The {{study was conducted in}} 2005 in which there were 6 production periods of 45 days. Data collected for each period were: date of starting and finish- ing; number of chicks entered and broilers sold; live weight at slaughter; carcass weight; feed consumption for starting, growing and finishing phase; labour; medication, vaccination and disinfectant; electricity con- sumption; heating and cooling methods and amount spent; distance for transportation of feed, chicks, broil- ers, wood shaving, limestone; and other <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Ross 308 chickens in all houses received the same commercial feed and water ad libitum. Chicks were reared under a conventional temper- ature regimen. Chicks were fed starter, grower and finisher diets according to their ages. Even though capac- ities for houses were different their stocking densities were 16. 36, 16. 00, 16. 38 and 16. 54 birds/m 2 for HI, HII, HIII and HIV, respectively. For cultural energy analysis, feed, transportation, labour, machinery, electric- ity, brooding, and other inputs were calculated and corresponding energy values for each input were {{obtained from}} literature. For the analysis it was assumed that carcasses would have 18. 2 % protein and 15. 2 % fat. Total cultural energy invested in broilers in HIII was lower than that of broilers in HI (P< 0. 05). Energy input per kg live weight gain and per kg carcass of HIII were lower than that of HI (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01, respective- ly). The HIII had lower cultural energy ratio for protein energy output than HI (0. 01). Energy efficiency (kcal input/kcal output) of HIII was better than that of HI (P< 0. 01). Results of the study showed that increasing capacity of housings decreases cultural energy input up to certain capacity and indicated that increasing housing capacity without interfering with performance could be a means for energy conservation in sustain- able agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{estimates}} of the demand characteristics of irrigation water are crucial to successful water policy formulation in the West. Although various studies concerning irrigation water demand exist in the literature, most are somewhat limited in scope and present their results in varied forms. Thus, comparison of results presents a problem. This study follows a more comprehensive approach by determining the demand characteristics, viz., water value, demand elasticities, etc., for major western irrigated regions. These results should prove useful in water policy formulation and evaluation. Eleven homogeneous regions were identified as major irrigated areas of the West. Agricultural output (in value terms) in each region was hypothesized to {{take the form of}} a multiplicative function with nine domain variables, i. e., irrigation water applied, value of land and buildings, hired labor expenditures, fuel and lubricant expenditures, fertilizer and lime expenditures, feed expenditures, value of machinery inventory, value of livestock inventory and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Using 1969 Census of Agriculture data, each regional function was statistically fit using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and ridge regression. As expected, parameter estimates under OLS were highly unstable due to high correlations among the explanatory variables (multicollinearity). One-third of the estimated coefficients took on nonsensical signs and the standard errors were generally high. To circumvent the multicollinearity problem ridge regression was employed. While admittedly a biased estimation technique, the credibility of the estimates appeared to increase. All parameter estimates, except for one out of 99, took on the expected positive sign and the standard errors were decreased in every case. Returns to scale were estimated to vary from a high of 1. 200 in the Northwestern Ogallala to a low of. 887 in the Lower Rio Grande Basin. Overall, the functions estimated with ridge regression were more compatible with theoretical expectations than those based on OLS estimates. From the fitted production functions, the demand for irrigation water was derived for the long run, two intermediate runs and the short run. Generally, water demand was found to be slightly elastic for all lengths of run considered with the more elastic demand in the Desert Southwest and Upper Colorado Basin, and slightly less elastic demand in the Snake-Columbia, Lower Rio Grande Basin and Northwestern Ogallala. The quantity of water applied was found to be most sensitive to product price in the Central California, Desert Southwest, Upper Colorado Basin and Northwestern Ogallala Regions. In terms of cross-factor effects, water application rates were found to be most responsive to changes in the prices of land and labor for all regions. Marginal irrigation water values for each length of run considered were estimated for 1969 at the respective regional mean values of water usage, fixed input levels and variable input prices. These estimated values varied from a high of $ 27. 79 for the long run in Central California to a low of $ 1. 71 in the short run for the Snake-Columbia Basin. It appears that the value estimates may be distorted in some instances due to the influence of livestock variables in the model. Subsequent research should attempt to correct this deficiency. Projections of values for 1974 (a census year) and 1978 were made with the assumption of no change in technology and level of "fixed" input and water - usage since 1969. Though a somewhat gross projection, water values were found to increase until 1974 and then decrease in 1978. These projections should serve as a basis for possible later validation by other researchers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is the {{application}} of four popular theoretically plausible consumer demand systems to a common cross-sectional data set that combines expenditure data from the quarterly BLS consumer expenditure surveys with price data that are collected quarterly in cost-of-living surveys conducted by ACCRA. Six broad categories of expenditure that exhaust total expenditure are analyzed: food consumed at home, housing, utilities, transportation, health care, and miscellaneous. The four demand systems investigated are the Almost-Ideal-Demand-System, the Linear Expenditure System, and the Indirect and Direct Addilog models. Despite absolute differences in magnitudes that in some instances are rather large, there is substantial agreement in the rank-orderings of elasticities. In general, the largest elasticities (for both own-price and total expenditure) are for transportation, <b>miscellaneous,</b> and housing <b>expenditures,</b> while the smallest elasticities (again for both own-price and total expenditure) are for food and utility expenditures. Engel’s Law for food is confirmed in all instances.

40|$|WOllaStOn {{are well}} {{documented}} in the literature concerning the platinum metals and their early utilisation in science and industry. He it was who first showed the way to produce malleable platinum on a com-mercial scale- incidentally the first successful example of powder metallurgy- {{and he was the}} discoverer of two new elements in native platinum which he named palladium and rhodium (I, 2). Fortunately he left a considerable quantity of notebooks and memoranda recording both his experiments and his financial transactions, most of these still preserved in the care of the University of Cambridge and others in the Science Museum, and it was in the course of examining his <b>miscellaneous</b> income and <b>expenditure</b> accounts that the writer came across an entry of particular interest. This records a payment to one Malacrida of the sum of 19 s for two platinum thermometers (3). It appears that one of these two thermo-meters was intended for the use of Wollaston’s scientific and financial partner Smithson Tennant, the discoverer of iridium and osmium, for among the miscellaneous Wollaston papers preserved at Cambridge there exists a loose sheet of paper on which is written “Platina Thermometer, for Mr Tennant”. The other was presumably employed by Wollaston himself. So far as the writer is aware no reference has been made in the literature to such a thermometer, nor has any description of it been given. There is some reason to suppose, however, that it was of the bimetallic type, with platinum as one of the compound metals and that it was a forerunner of the many kinds of thermostatic element’s that are now so widely employed.
