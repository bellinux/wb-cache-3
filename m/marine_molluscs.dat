5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} of fish are present in park waters, {{including}} more than fifty crustacean species ranging from isopods to giant blue land crabs, about two hundred species of birds and about 27 mammal species, both terrestrial and <b>marine.</b> <b>Molluscs</b> include a variety of bivalves, terrestrial and marine snails, sea hares, sea slugs and two cephalopods, the Caribbean reef octopus and the Caribbean reef squid.|$|E
5|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>molluscs</b> such as sea hares, cuttlefish, squid and {{octopuses}} {{give themselves}} a {{last chance to}} escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may mimic food or otherwise confuse predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.|$|E
25|$|The island's only {{permanent}} macro-organism inhabitants {{are common}} periwinkles and other <b>marine</b> <b>molluscs.</b> Small numbers of seabirds, mainly fulmars, northern gannets, black-legged kittiwakes, and common guillemots, use the rock for resting in summer, and gannets and guillemots occasionally breed successfully if the summer is calm with no storm waves washing over the rock. In total {{there have been}} just over twenty species of seabird and six other animal species observed (including the aforementioned molluscs) {{on or near the}} islet.|$|E

25|$|Several other {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} domesticated, both terrestrial and aquatic, including {{some such as}} Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and the freshwater cnidarian Hydra for research into genetics and physiology. Few {{have a long history}} of domestication. Most are used for food or other products such as shellac and cochineal. The phyla involved are Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes (for biological control), Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda (marine crustaceans as well as insects and spiders), and Echinodermata. While many <b>marine</b> <b>molluscs</b> are used for food, only a few have been domesticated, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, all used in research on behaviour and neurology. Terrestrial snails in the genera Helix and Murex are raised for food. Several parasitic or parasitoidal insects including the fly Eucelatoria, the beetle Chrysolina, and the wasp Aphytis are raised for biological control. Conscious or unconscious artificial selection has many effects on species under domestication; variability can readily be lost by inbreeding, selection against undesired traits, or genetic drift, while in Drosophila, variability in eclosion time (when adults emerge) has increased.|$|E
