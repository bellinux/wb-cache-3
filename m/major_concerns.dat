5|$|Large {{parts of}} Zimbabwe were once covered by forests with {{abundant}} wildlife. Deforestation and poaching {{has reduced the}} amount of wildlife. Woodland degradation and deforestation, due to population growth, urban expansion and lack of fuel, are <b>major</b> <b>concerns</b> and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of fertile soil. Local farmers have also been criticised by environmentalists for burning off vegetation to heat their tobacco barns.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>major</b> <b>concerns</b> {{following}} acute {{carbon monoxide}} poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur. Problems may include difficulty with higher intellectual functions, short-term memory loss, dementia, amnesia, psychosis, irritability, a strange gait, speech disturbances, Parkinson's disease-like syndromes, cortical blindness, and a depressed mood. Depression may occur in {{those who did not}} have pre-existing depression. These delayed neurological sequelae may occur in up to 50% of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days. It is difficult to predict who will develop delayed sequelae; however, advanced age, loss of consciousness while poisoned, and initial neurological abnormalities may increase the chance of developing delayed symptoms.|$|E

Population ageing {{was the most}} common concern in developed countries, where 79 per cent of the Governments considered it a <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> in 2009. Other <b>major</b> population <b>concerns</b> in developed countries were HIV/AIDS, low fertility and a relatively small or declining number of persons of working age. In developing countries, 90 per cent of the Governments considered HIV/AIDS as a <b>major</b> <b>concern.</b> High infant and child mortality and high maternal mortality were the second and third most common concerns in developing countries after HIV/AIDS. Governments of developing countries were also concerned about their population of working age but mainly because they needed to create sufficient jobs for their growing working-age population...|$|R
5|$|One of the <b>major</b> <b>concerns</b> for English fans {{attending}} the final was {{the acquisition of}} visas for entry into Russia. However, {{after a period of}} negotiations between representatives of Russia, the United Kingdom, UEFA and the two clubs, it was agreed that fans with tickets for the match would not require a visa, provided they were also able to produce a passport with at least six months before expiry and a completed immigration card on entry into Russia. The visa-free period was initially supposed to run for 72 hours between 19 May and 23 May, but this was later extended to an eight-day period lasting from 17 May to 25 May. Because of the difficulty and expense of acquiring a ticket and visa, fans who had not already got tickets were advised against travelling to Moscow by UEFA's William Gaillard, who also warned fans about Russia's strict laws regarding the consumption of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although <b>major</b> <b>concerns</b> about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E

25|$|Disease {{and land}} {{degradation}} {{are two of}} the <b>major</b> <b>concerns</b> in agriculture today. For example, an epidemic of stem rust on wheat caused by the Ug99 lineage is currently spreading across Africa and into Asia and is causing <b>major</b> <b>concerns</b> due to crop losses of 70% or more under some conditions. Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. In Africa, if current trends of soil degradation continue, the continent might be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to United Nations University's Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa.|$|E
