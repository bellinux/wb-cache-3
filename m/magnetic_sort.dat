Inconsistent isolation, purification, and recovery {{of large numbers of}} high-quality islets remain substantial impediments to progress in the field. Removing islets as soon as they are liberated from the pancreas during digestion and circumventing the need for density gradient purification is likely to result in substantially increased viable islet yields by minimizing exposure to proteolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen intermediates, and mechanical stress associated with centrifugation. This study capitalized on the hypervascularity of islets compared with acinar tissue to explore their preferential enrichment with magnetic beads to enable immediate separation in a magnetic field utilizing a quadrupole <b>magnetic</b> <b>sorting.</b> The results demonstrate that (1) preferential enrichment of porcine islets is achievable, but homogeneous bead distribution within the pancreas is difficult to achieve with current protocols; (2) greater than 70 % of islets in the dissociated pancreatic tissue were recovered by quadrupole <b>magnetic</b> <b>sorting,</b> but their purity was low; and (3) infused islets purified by density gradients and subsequently passed through quadrupole <b>magnetic</b> <b>sorting</b> had similar potency as uninfused islets.

Methods: We separately used <b>magnetic</b> cell <b>sorting</b> and flow cytometry sorting to identify CD 4 + CD 25 + Treg cells. After magnetic cell separation, we further used flow cytometry to analyze the purity of CD 4 + CD 25 + Treg cells, trypan blue staining to detect cell viability, and propidium iodide (PI) staining to assess the cell viability. We detected the immune inhibition of CD 4 + CD 25 + Treg cells in the in vitro proliferation experiments. Results: The results showed that compared to flow cytometry <b>sorting,</b> <b>magnetic</b> cell <b>sorting</b> took more time and effort, but fewer live cells were obtained than with flow cytometry sorting. The CD 4 + CD 25 + Treg cells, however, obtained with both methods have similar immunosuppressive capacities.

In order to isolate the bacterial clones that express peptides with high affinities to the target molecule, multiple rounds of manual <b>magnetic</b> activated cell <b>sorting</b> (MACS) followed by multiple rounds of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) are conventionally used. Although such manual methods are effective, alternative means of library screening which improve the reproducibility, reduce the cost, reduce cross contamination, and minimize exposure to hazardous target materials are highly desired for practical application. Toward this end, we report the first semi-automated system demonstrating the potential for screening bacterially displayed peptides using disposable microfluidic cartridges. The Micro-Magnetic Separation platform (MMS) is capable of screening a bacterial library containing 3 × 10 ¹⁰ members in 15 minutes and requires minimal operator training. Using this system, we report the isolation of twenty-four distinct peptide ligands that bind to the protective antigen (PA) of Bacilus anthracis in three rounds of selection. A consensus motif WXCFTC was found using the MMS and was also found in one of the PA binders isolated by the conventional MACS/FACS approach. We compared MMS and MACS rare cell recovery over cell populations ranging from 0. 1 % to 0. 0000001 % and found that both <b>magnetic</b> <b>sorting</b> methods could recover cells down to 0. 0000001 % initial cell population, with the MMS having overall lower standard deviation of cell recovery.

Cell handling and separation for research and clinical applications aims to efficiently separate specific cell populations. Here, we investigated the sorting of CD 8 lymphocytes from peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) products by affinity-bead-mediated acoustophoresis. PBPC samples were obtained from healthy donors (n = 4) and patients (n = 18). Mononuclear cells were labeled with anti-CD 8 -coated <b>magnetic</b> beads and <b>sorted</b> on an acoustophoretic microfluidic device and by standard <b>magnetic</b> cell <b>sorting</b> as a reference method.

40|$|Processing of {{peripheral}} blood progenitor cells (PBPC) for clinical transplantation or research applications aims to effectively isolate or deplete specific cell populations, utilizing primarily magnetic or fluorescence activated sorting methods. Here, we investigated {{the performance of}} microfluidic acoustophoresis for the separation of lymphocyte subsets from PBPC, and present a novel method for affinity-bead-mediated acoustic separation of cells which can otherwise not be acoustically discriminated. As the acoustic force on a particle depends on particle size, density and compressibility, targeting of cells by affinity specific beads will generate cell-bead complexes that exhibit distinct acoustic properties relative to nontargeted cells and are, thus, possible to isolate. To demonstrate this, PBPC samples (n = 22) were obtained from patients and healthy donors. Following density gradient centrifugation, cells were labeled with anti-CD 4 -coated magnetic beads (Dynal) and isolated by acoustophoresis and, for comparison, standard <b>magnetic</b> cell <b>sorting</b> technique in parallel. Targeted CD 4 + lymphocytes were acoustically isolated with a mean (±SD) purity of 87 ± 12 %, compared with 96 ± 3 % for control <b>magnetic</b> <b>sorting.</b> Viability of sorted cells was 95 ± 4 % (acoustic) and 97 ± 3 % (magnetic), respectively. The mean acoustic separation efficiency of CD 4 + lymphocytes to the target fraction was 65 ± 22 %, compared with a mean CD 4 + lymphocyte recovery of 56 ± 15 % for <b>magnetic</b> <b>sorting.</b> Functional testing of targeted CD 4 + lymphocytes demonstrated unimpaired mitogen-mediated proliferation capacity and cytokine production. Hematopoietic progenitor cell assays revealed a preserved colony forming ability of nontarget cells post sorting.

40|$|The {{presence}} of {{natural killer cells}} at lower evolutionary levels was investigated in the amphibian Xenopus laevis. Chromium release microcytotoxicity assays revealed that fresh splenocytes from early-thymectomised Xenopus displayed significant spontaneous cytotoxicity against allogeneic B(_ 3) B(_ 7) thymic tumor cell targets, unlike those from control Xenopus, suggesting that 'NK-like' activity is greater in thymectomised (T cell-deficient) animals. Addition of Concanavalin A- derived active supernatants to splenocytes from a thymectomised animal caused {{a significant increase in}} cytolytic activity, but had no effect on cells from a control animal. This finding of enhanced cytotoxicity was indicative of lymphokine-activated killing in Xenopus, and supported the concept that tumour cell lysis was mediated by NK - like cells. Attempts were made to enrich the splenocytes for natural killer cells through the selective depletion of other lymphocyte subsets, using the techniques of 'panning’ and 'magnetic bead' separation following monoclonal antibody labelling of cells. On comparison of the two techniques, it was found that both were able to deplete a splenocyte culture of B cells to the same extent, but that <b>magnetic</b> <b>sorting</b> produced far superior results for depletion of T cells. Optimum conditions for <b>magnetic</b> <b>sorting</b> were determined, and used to generate 'purified' populations which were tested for their cytolytic activity.

Conclusion: Agreement between these two very different methodologies has great implications for their respective use in both molecular studies and clinical trials employing molecular biomarkers. </p...|$|R

This paper {{introduces}} {{the status of}} micro-fine weakly magnetic iron ore separation technology, analyzes the various characteristics of each separation process,enumerates some production technology examples dealing with such iron ore and {{points out that the}} combined aggregation separation technology will have a wide development and application prospects in fine weakly <b>magnetic</b> iron ore <b>sorting</b> and processing areas...|$|R
40|$|Amniotic fluid (AF) {{has become}} an {{interesting}} source of fetal stem cells. However, AF contains heterogeneous and multiple, partially differentiated cell types. After isolation from the amniotic fluid, cells were characterized regarding their morphology and growth dynamics. They were <b>sorted</b> by <b>magnetic</b> associated cell <b>sorting</b> using the surface marker CD 117. In order to show stem cell characteristics such as pluripotency and to evaluate a possible therapeutic application of these cells, AF fluid-derived stem cells were differentiated along the adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic {{as well as the}} neuronal lineage under hypoxic conditions. Our findings reveal that <b>magnetic</b> associated cell <b>sorting</b> (MACS) does not markedly influence growth characteristics as demonstrated by the generation doubling time. There was, however, an effect regarding an altered adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation capacity in the selected cell fraction. In contrast, in the unselected cell population neuronal differentiation is enhanced...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{nanotechnology}} is to devise methods for preparing nanoparticles of different materials as well as structured arrays at the nanoscale [1 - 23]. One-, two-, and three-dimensional arrays have applications in electronics, photonics, biodiagnosis, chemical sensing, among other fields. When dealing with nanoparticles, some of the desired nanostructures are monolayers, linear strings, crystal arrays, branched patterns, etc. Some of these arrays {{can be obtained by}} methods such as biomolecular nanolithography [2], scanning probe microscopy lithography coupled with surface modification of the substrate [3, 4], <b>magnetic</b> <b>sorting</b> [5], dewetting [6, 24], or drying of liquid droplets [7, 25]; in some cases, the particles lie inside nanostructures such as those formed by block copolymers [8 - 11] or a polymer thin film matrix [12, 13]. In this work, we show {{that it is possible to}} obtain linear arrays of metallic nanoparticles by nucleating them inside the cylindrical micelles of microemulsions and then depositing the sample on a substrate. The arrays are composed of parallel lines of nanoparticles and extend over distances in the micrometer scale. These arrangements could be useful in applications such as photonics [26, 27], electronics [28, 29], plasmonics [12, 22, 23, 29], and biosensing [26]. The main interests of aligned nanoparticles are generation of an environment ordered to enhance the optical properties (optical response) of the system and to enhance the electrical conductivity and use of these features to applications like solar cells to obtain green energy.|$|R
40|$|Basophils are {{blood cells}} of low {{abundance}} associated with allergy, inflammation and parasite infections. To study the transcriptome of mature circulating basophils cells were purified from buffy coats by density gradient centrifugations and two-step <b>magnetic</b> cell <b>sorting.</b> However, after extensive analysis {{the cells were}} found to be transcriptionally inactive and almost completely lack functional mRNA. In order to obtain transcriptionally active immature basophils for analysis of their transcriptome, umbilical cord blood cells were therefore cultured in the presence of interleukin (IL) - 3 for 9 days and basophils were enriched by removing non-basophils using <b>magnetic</b> cell <b>sorting.</b> The majority of purified cells demonstrated typical metachromatic staining with Alcian blue dye (95 %) and expression of surface markers FceRI and CD 203 c, indicating a pure population of cells with basophil-like phenotype. mRNA was extracted from these cells and used to construct a cDNA library with approximately 600 000 independent clones. This library served as tool to determine the mRNA frequencies for a number of hematopoietic marker proteins. It was shown that these cells express basophil/mast cell-specific transcripts, i. e. b-tryptase, serglycin and FceRI a-chain, to a relatively low degree. In contrast, the library contained a high number of several eosinophil-associated transcripts such as: major basic protein (MBP), charcot leyden crystal (CLC), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO). Out of these transcripts, MBP and EPO were the most frequently observed, representing 8 % and 3. 2 % of the total mRNA pool...|$|R
