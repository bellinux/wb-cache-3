5000|$|The Don Sahong Hydropower Project {{would pose}} {{a major threat}} to the Mekong River's {{critically}} endangered population of Irrawaddy dolphin. The risk is considered very high for the small resident sub-population living in the Veun Nyang/Anlong Cheuteal pool that straddles the Lao/Cambodian border, and is the only remaining dolphin population in Laos. The Don Sahong Dam is predicted to cause the extirpation of dolphins from Laos. Threats to the dolphins include the blasting of large volumes of rock from the channel, the intensive heavy industrial activity at the site, and modifications to the river flows. The construction plan for the Don Sahong Project excludes underwater blasting downstream of the dam site. Almost all excavation will be from drained sections of the upper Hou Sahong, though blasting would still occur very near the dolphins behind a coffer dam. Despite this minor mitigation effort, damage to the dolphin's sensitive hearing structures is expected and could prove fatal. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>excavation</b> would also continue below the dam to very near the animals. Other risks identified include the long-term effects of disturbance and stress on the animals, and the demographic consequences if the sub-population near the dam was extirpated. The persistence of threats at the site means that only the lowest risk activities are compatible with dolphin persisting in the area, though developers state that [...] "construction impacts dolphins are necessary".|$|E
40|$|Between September of 1970 and February of 1971, the Texas Highway Department, now the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), {{carried out}} {{extensive}} hand and <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavations</b> at 41 TV 163, the Millican Bench site. The highway maintenance crew was ably directed by Frank Weir. Millican Bench represented the first archeological site excavated by the then Texas Highway Department (THD) under their archeological program. In 2001, TxDOT contracted with the Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio {{to provide an}} assessment of the documents and data and develop research topics that may be successfully pursued with the materials from the site. Based on the assessment it was determined that dependent on data types, four broad analytical units could be defined (Late Prehistoric, and Late, Middle and Early Archaic), and two diachronic and one synchronic research topic would be pursued: changes in subsistence strategies and lithic technological organization, and the evaluation of Feature 3, a possible structure noted at the site. The analysis of the faunal material from the site and comparison with other archeological collections indicates that hunter-gatherers may have pursued a broad-spectrum adaptation, even when bison were present in the region. The lithic assemblage, characterized by predominantly expedient and minimally retouched tool forms, supports this contention. The percentages of what we think are nonlocal raw materials increases through time. This increase hints at changes in the level or scope of mobility. Patterns in projectile point discard and replacement strategies suggest some premium on preventive tool replacement. Although the photographic documentation strongly supports the likelihood of Feature 3 representing a structure, we have little surviving direct data in support of this possibility. The artifactual data that we can investigate suggests, however, that the circular area may have at least represented some type of maintained space.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{possibility}} {{of increasing the}} performance of mechanical tools with the assistance provided by a high-velocity water jet has been explored in the last twenty years. The results of past research have often been controversial and found to vary within a wide range, mainly due to the different experimental conditions adopted. A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain the variability of the results {{as well as to}} disclose the mechanism of water jet assistance. In this paper, after a discussion of the main issues regarding the assistance of <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavation</b> with water jet, the results of an experimental work carried out at the University of Cagliari are illustrated and discussed. The research was aimed both at studying the processes by which <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavation</b> is improved and at quantifying the increment of the excavation performance parameters with water jet. In particular, the mechanisms involved in the rock-tool-water jet interaction have been studied with the goal of putting into evidence the contribution of the jet both as a way to weaken the rock and to increase the stress leading to scale formation. The better knowledge achieved will be useful {{for the development of the}} technology up to a commercial scale. ...|$|E

40|$|Tree {{roots are}} often damaged during {{construction}} projects, particularly during trenching operations for pipeline installation. Although <b>mechanical</b> soil <b>excavation</b> using heavy equipment, {{such as an}} excavator or backhoe is considered the fastest the most economical method, it damages and destroys tree roots {{and can lead to}} unintentional tree loss, poor public relations, fines, and litigation. In sensitive areas around tree roots, soil excavation can be completed by hand although this is very slow and expensive. Alternate soil excavation methodologies are available, including a special technique that uses supersonic air streams to explode soil around non-porous items such as pipes, fiber optic cables, sewer and phone lines, and tree roots. This paper discusses the use of this technique for “high value ” coast live oak trees (Quercus agrifolia) in urbanized areas. A case study is presented that discusses an appropriate application of the pneumatic soil excavation method. The pneumatic method is a valuable technique for root zone soil excavation.

40|$|Abstract. Rock is a {{heterogeneous}} and anisotropic compound material, containing many shear surfaces, cracks, weak surfaces and faults. Damage and failure {{in a rock}} mass can occur through sliding along persistent discontinuities, or fractures. A new micromechanical approach to modeling the <b>mechanical</b> behavior of <b>excavation</b> damaged or disturbed zone (EDZ) of anisotropic rock is presented based on knowledge of the inhomogeneity of rock. In this numerical model, damage is analyzed as {{a direct consequence of}} microcracks growth. A study of the effect of elastic and failure anisotropy plus inhomogeneity on the underground excavations reveals that the modes of failure can be significantly influenced by the rock structure on the small and large scales. Fractures that develop progressively around underground excavations can be simulated using a numerical code called RFPA (Realistic Failure Process Analysis). This code incorporates the microscopic inhomogeneity in Young’s modulus and strength characteristic of rock. In the numerical models of a rock mass, values of Young’s modulus and rock strength are realized according to a Weibull distribution in which the distribution parameters represent the level of inhomogeneity of the medium. Another notable feature of this code is that no a priori assumptions need to be made about where an...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Meuse/Haute-Marne Underground Research Laboratory (ANDRA) {{has been}} {{excavated}} {{to study the}} feasibility of a deep underground repository in the Callovo-Oxfordian argillite. The laboratory, lying at depth between 420 m and 550 m, has a complex structure due to the shape and location of various shafts and drifts. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse the mechanical behaviour of rock due to the excavation process, and the mechanical interaction between drifts and shafts during the excavation steps. Numerical analysis, which considers the geometry and excavation sequence of the Underground Research Laboratory (URL), is carried out using a finite element model having 2. 5 million degrees of freedom with relatively simple constitutive equations describing the argillite's behaviour.

40|$|This study {{applies the}} concept of the {{difficulty}} of tunnelling by drilling an blasting (D&B) to selected cases from the Brazilian tunnelling industry. The difficulty of tunnelling has been defined in previous work as the difference of specific drilling (SD) from industrial average trend: easier when SD is lower than average, more difficult when SD is higher than average. Results show how tunnels in Brazil tend to be unrealistically more difficult to excavate when compared to similar excavations in similar geologies elsewhere in the world. It is thoroughly discussed the reason for such anomaly (up to + 90 % SD compared to industrial average). One reason could be the lack of options amongst explosive products on the brazilian market. Only ANFO and explosive emulsions are available in Brazil. Lacking high VOD (Velocity of Detonation) products might result in reducing the maximum allowable burden amongst production holes, therefore increasing SD. Another reason could be found in the tunnel designers' tendency of choosing D&B as excavation method for weak rock masses that would benefit from <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavation.</b> The reason to this tendency can be partly found in the lack of availability of <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavation</b> machines in the brazilian market. Blasting in weak rock masses requires more careful smooth blasting, hence a closer spacing amongst contour holes to avoid costly overbreak: this increases SD. A third reason could be found in the lack of skill amongst the local workforce. When dealing with unskilled workers the blast designers naturally tend to avoid highly optimized blasts that require very skilled workforce to be realized on field. The designer in this case tends to leave the blast design simpler but more robust, at the cost of higher specific drilling and specific charge. The conclusions suggest that this unrealistic difficulty when compared to world average could be a simptom of the so-called "Brazilian cost" within the tunnelling industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} is to evaluate the most suitable exploitation technique in two underground gypsum quarries, both of them located in Piedmont (Italy). The methods currently adopted pertain to the "Rooms and Pillars" category, but the techniques employed in the two quarries are different, i. e. mechanical (by roadheader) and conventional (by Drill & Blast) respectively. The choice of an excavation technique results from a study which takes into account a number of parameters, such as morphology of the orebody, productivity, depreciation, workforce, plant engineering and consumptions. First of all, a thorough knowledge of the geological characteristics of the area is necessary, and geomechanical properties of gypsum must be known: a wide, bedded and regular orebody favors {{the use of the}} mechanical exploitation, whereas inhomogeneous, non-linear and small orebodies often require the great versatility of the explosive. The technical comparison has highlighted that the productivities obtained by the two excavation techniques are almost equivalent: gypsum allows minimal tools wear, optimizing production times of the cutter head, whereas its plasticity can require specific consumptions of explosive higher than in rocks of comparable hardness. As to the economical aspect, the total costs of excavation with Drill & Blast are 25 % higher than those with roadheader: indeed, even if the <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavation</b> will lead to higher investment costs for machinery and to large consumptions of electricity, it involves a very important saving on diesel fuel and explosives, which has a fundamental impact, i. e. a third of the costs of consumption, more than one sixth of the total costs of extraction, as well as an increase in labor costs. Another important aspect is the environmental sustainability of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavation,</b> with a diesel consumption much lower than the conventional method, and the possibility of an almost total abatement, if conveyor belts are employed instead of truck dumpers for muck transportatio...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of industrial safety law in Britain and New Zealand and {{the origins of}} construction, safety law are outlined in Part I. The administration and interpretation of the Construction Act 1959 are described in Part II, and Part III highlights the comparable statute law in three Commonwealth countries. The thesis will assist persons engaged in industry, lawyers and departmental officers {{in the understanding of}} the law and its application to construction work. The information presented on overseas law will assist those involved in the task of reviewing and consolidating the New Zealand industrial safety, health and welfare legislation. The history of the British Factories Acts leading on to the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, described in Chapter 1, highlights the importance of a self-regulating, integrated statutory system and a professional inspectorate with an advisory role and residual enforcement powers. New Zealand safety law has developed as the country's industrial needs have determined, as will be seen from Chapter 2. Generally, British statutes have been adopted, but construction safety law is the exception and Chapter 3 shows that, from the earliest Bill introduced by Richard John Seddon in 1892 up to the present, the legislation covering the construction industry has been initiated and drafted with industry representation. The more empirical subjects such as current policy and practice, sanctions, codes, education, other legislation and reform, as well as the purpose, effect, extent and application of the Construction Act 1959 are discussed in Chapter 4. The results of the author's legal research and analysis are contained in Chapters 5 and 6 under the headings of 'Liabilities' and 'Technical Law'. The responsibilities of employers, workmen, safety supervisors, inspectors and the Crown are set out and explained in terms of the statute and the interpretation from the case law.

40|$|Conditions {{encountered}} {{by the authors}} on several projects (tunnel boring, blast hole drill-ing, and large diameter pile socket drilling) were unanticipated, undetectable, and even difficult to identify even after they had been encountered. These conditions have caused failure of mechanical components, low penetra-tion rates, and remarkably high cutter wear. Coincidentally, all projects had one or more geotechnical conditions in common. The diffi-culties encountered, however, could not be attributed to geotechnical factors measurable by classical laboratory or field methods. The difficulties were not discernible or predictable by conventional exploration, rock mechanics testing, or analysis, prior to tender A study of common elements and an analysis of these conditions have {{shed some light on}} how to avoid similar difficulties. These prob-lems may be avoided using exploration and testing specifically tailored to <b>mechanical</b> <b>excavation,</b> and by investigation for conditions which have been associated with such difficul-ties in the past. What can be learned from these widely undoc-umented and unpublished experiences? How were these conditions missed? What are the underlying causes and motive mechanisms? How can such problems be avoided in the future? In all case histories presented here, problems or difficulties were encountered. It is the intent of this paper to use these negative experiences to produce new possibilities for avoiding them in the future...|$|E
40|$|Tetra Tech assists the U. S. EPA Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO) with {{design and}} {{construction}} management of sediment remediation projects in the Great Lakes region. Tetra Tech is currently managing two sediment remediation projects for GLNPO: the West Branch of the Grand Calumet River (WBGCR) in Hammond, Indiana, and the Ottawa River in Toledo, Ohio. The WBGCR flows through an industrialized area in northwest Indiana. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>excavation</b> of 32, 000 cubic yards of sediment was completed in August 2010. The design for additional sections of the river is underway with construction planned for December 2010. The Ottawa River {{is part of the}} Maumee River Area of Concern in northwest Ohio. Hydraulic dredging of about 250, 000 yards of sediment from the Ottawa River commenced in May 2010 and is scheduled to be completed in November 2010. The principal contaminant of concern is polychlorinated biphenyls at concentrations both above and below 50 ppm. This paper will compare and contrast the methods for sediment dredging, focusing on the specific site conditions that influenced selection of each approach as well as lessons learned during construction activities at both locations. Factors influencing remedy selection include sediment physical and chemical characteristics, site hydraulics, and site access...|$|E
