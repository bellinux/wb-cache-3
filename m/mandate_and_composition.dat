50|$|The Nepal Law Commission (NLC) {{was first}} {{constituted}} by an executive decision in 1953, {{immediately after the}} down of multiparty democracy. The second, third, fourth and fifth Commissions were constituted in 1960, 1963, 1972 and 1979 respectively. All those Commissions were temporary in nature. The NLC was given permanent status only in 1984. After the restoration of multiparty democracy in 1990, the NLC was restructured with the mandate commensurate with the changed context. It was again restructured in 2003 with timely changes in its <b>mandate</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition.</b> Now, the Commission is a statutory body under the Nepal Law Commission Act, 2007, which was promulgated on 14 January 2007. It is to note that until then {{it used to be}} constituted by the executive decision.|$|E

This chapter provides an analysis of the PACs in both countries. The committees have some similar features in terms of <b>mandate</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition,</b> but both have struggled to be effective, partly because of the difficulties in developing functioning committees in small jurisdictions and partly because of an unhelpful external context. Progress has been made in developing the internal environment of the PACs, but producing and demonstrating significant outputs and outcomes remain a major challenge...|$|E
40|$|The new security-political {{landscape}} which arose {{subsequent to}} the end of the Cold War brought with it paradigmatic changes to peacekeeping and civil-military cooperation. Traditional peacekeeping has developed into multidimensional third-generation peacekeeping. The new peacekeeping has a substantial non-military <b>mandate</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> in addition to its military component. Civil-military cooperation (CIMIC) is a military tool developed by NATO to facilitate coordination and cooperation between the NATO commander and the civilian agencies and players in the operational theatre. CIMIC is not a new concept in NATO, but has been subject to a comprehensive examination and revision based on the experiences in the Balkans during the 1990 s. The lack of a unified CIMIC doctrine and international consensus on what the concept of CIMIC should contain has triggered a variety of different national approaches to CIMIC in peace support operations. In February 2003 Norway deployed a CIMIC unit to the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how two explanatory models may explain a) the Norwegian decision to contribute with a CIMIC unit to Afghanistan; and b) the Norwegian approach to CIMIC in Afghanistan. The first model is Graham Allison’s rational policy model, and the second model is a culturalist theory developed by Elizabeth Kier. The analysis suggests that the rationalist variables have more explanatory power than the culturalist variables, and that the relationship between the rationalist and culturalist theories are complementary rather than competitive...|$|E
