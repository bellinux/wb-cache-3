5|$|Malaysia has {{its origins}} in the Malay kingdoms present in the area which, from the 18th century, became subject to the British Empire. The first British territories were known as the Straits Settlements, whose {{establishment}} {{was followed by the}} Malay kingdoms becoming British protectorates. The territories on Peninsular Malaysia were first unified as the Malayan Union in 1946. Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948, and achieved independence on 31 August 1957. Malaya united with North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia. Less than two years later in 1965, Singapore was expelled from the federation. The country is multi-ethnic and multi-cultural, which plays a large role in politics. About half the population is ethnically Malay, with large minorities of Malaysian Chinese which also form the second largest community of Overseas Chinese in the world, Malaysian Indians, and indigenous peoples. The constitution grants freedom of religion but recognised Islam as the established religion of the state. Despite being a majority <b>Muslim</b> <b>country,</b> Malaysia has been widely regarded as a rather moderate Muslim majority country. The government system is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system and the legal system is based on common law. The head of state is the king, known as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. He is an elected monarch chosen from the hereditary rulers of the nine Malay states every five years. The head of government is the prime minister. The country official language is Bahasa Malaysia or commonly known as Malay language. English remains as an active second language. English proficiency in Malaysia has been highly ranked as the second best in Asia after Singapore and 13th best in the world as of 2017.|$|E

S. is a more critical market to <b>Muslim</b> <b>countries</b> than the imports from <b>Muslim</b> <b>countries</b> are to the U. S., except for oil and gas. The U.

Although trade disputes with <b>Muslim</b> <b>countries</b> are rare, and several <b>Muslim</b> <b>countries</b> benefit from free or preferential trade agreements with the U.

As such, the comparisons between the selected 12 <b>Muslim</b> <b>countries</b> and EU indicate that manufacturing industries and agriculture in the GDPs show wide difference, but GDP growth rate, inflation rate and their average rates are not significantly different.

These countries spread from North Africa, to the Middle East, to the Balkans and Central Asia, to Southeast Asia. While many nations contain a strong Muslim presence, majority Muslim nations, by definition, have more Muslims as citizens than non-Muslims. Not all majority Muslim states, however, have Islam as their established religion. Turkey, for example, is a prominent <b>Muslim</b> <b>country</b> in which 99% of the population follows some form of Islam. However, there is no official religion. The state is secular.

The results show that the <b>Muslim</b> <b>countries</b> use taxes and seigniorage to finance their government expenditures.
