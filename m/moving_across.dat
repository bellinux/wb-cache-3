5|$|August 19–20, 1997: Tropical Storm Ignacio's {{remnants}} produced gusty winds {{over the}} outer waters of California, and passed {{directly over the}} San Francisco Bay Area, before <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> {{the interior of the}} Pacific Northwest. Sporadic moderate to heavy rainfall was recorded in both California and the states of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|By Tuesday, {{the storm}} was rapidly <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, it lost power quickly. This also meant less snowfall, both because of the fast motion of the storm {{and the lack of}} lake effect snow. All {{shipping}} was halted on Monday and part of Tuesday along the St. Lawrence River around Montreal, Quebec.|$|E

5|$|Cindy's remnant low <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> {{western and}} {{northern}} North Carolina {{combined with a}} frontal boundary to produce several supercell thunderstorms. These supercells spawned a number of tornadoes in western North Carolina, at {{the foothills of the}} Appalachian mountains, but their effects were minimal. Continuing north, Cindy brought over 5in (125mm) of rain to areas as distant as Salisbury, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance {{was expected}} to bring heavy, yet needed rainfall to the Bahamas. The precursor disturbance dropped heavy precipitation while <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> Florida, including in Indian River County, and also produced 6–8ft (1.8–2.4m) waves with moderate wind gusts.|$|E
5|$|At peak intensity, Mitch {{maintained}} maximum sustained {{winds of}} 180mph (285km/h) while off the northern coast of Honduras. Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of , {{which at the}} time was the lowest in the month of October and tied for the fourth lowest for any Atlantic hurricane. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north, threatening the Yucatán Peninsula. Instead, Mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active. Land interaction imparted weakening, and the hurricane made landfall on Honduras on October29 with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Turning westward, Mitch slowly weakened over land and maintained deep convection over adjacent waters. After <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> mountainous terrain in Central America, the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November1. The next day, the remnants reached the Gulf of Mexico and reorganized into a tropical storm on November3. Mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front, <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> the Yucatán Peninsula before striking southwestern Florida on November5. Shortly thereafter, the storm became an extratropical cyclone, which was tracked by the NHC until November9.|$|E

5|$|During June and July 1945 the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade saw combat against Australian {{forces in}} the Borneo Campaign. Its units were greatly under-strength at this time due to the {{casualties}} suffered while <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> Borneo, and the elements which engaged Australian forces were rapidly defeated. The remainder of the brigade withdrew into central Borneo, and surrendered to the Australians {{following the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|July 13, 1996- Tropical Storm Bertha crosses {{over the}} state with a peak wind gust of 58mph (93km/h) at Dover. The winds down {{scattered}} trees, signs, and power lines, leaving 3,200 homes without power for 8hours. The storm produces moderate rainfall across the state, causing drainage problems. Prior to <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> the state, Bertha causes rough surf, resulting in 40 water rescues. Overall damage is minor, and no deaths occurred.|$|E

5|$|The {{deaths of}} at least eleven people were {{attributed}} to Ernesto, which dumped heavy rains throughout its path, especially in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. While <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> the Caribbean, it affected several countries, and initially Ernesto posed {{a threat to the}} Gulf Coast of the United States around the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Damage in Virginia was estimated at over $118million (2006USD), prompting the declaration of a federal disaster area. Total damage in the United States was estimated at $500million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, the {{hurricane}} began to weaken while <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> Florida, falling to Category1 intensity only several hours after landfall late on September15. Eventually, it curved north-northeastward {{and approached the}} east coast of Florida again. Late on September16, the storm emerged into the Atlantic near St. Augustine and weakened to a tropical storm early on the following day. The cyclone made another landfall near the Georgia-South Carolina state line later on September17. The system continued to weaken and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near the border of North Carolina and Virginia early on September18.|$|E

5|$|While Erika's {{precursor}} disturbance was <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> Florida, {{it dropped}} heavy rainfall. In south Texas, Erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60mph (80 to 95km/h) along with light rain, causing minor and isolated wind {{damage in the}} state. In northeastern Mexico, Erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flooding. There, two people were killed when their vehicle was swept away by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September 16. It traversed steadily westward, with the southern portion of the wave axis <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> northern South America. On September 26 the wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean near Panama, and slowly organized. A weak low-level trough extended from the Caribbean Sea to south of Mexico, disrupting the normal flow of westward steering currents. On October 3, the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection, and began to drift eastward {{to the south of}} Mexico. Two days later a low-level circulation formed, and midday on October 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E while located about 250miles (410km) south-southwest of Huatulco in the state of Oaxaca.|$|E

5|$|A typhoon {{was first}} {{observed}} southwest of Guam on October 1, which progressed steadily westward. On October 4, the storm crossed the Philippines, entering from Borongan in Eastern Samar to Capiz {{and into the}} South China Sea. Heavy damage occurred along the path, and several boats were wrecked in Capiz, resulting in several fatalities. The island of Mindoro lost communications with Manila during the storm. Shifting to the west-northwest, the storm moved ashore eastern Vietnam on October 8 near Danang. Another typhoon followed a similar path, originating near Guam on October4 and progressing westward. Five days later, the storm struck the Philippine province of Camarines Norte, causing damage as it moved westward through Luzon. <b>Moving</b> <b>across</b> the South China Sea, the storm struck {{the east coast of}} what was then Indochina on October11.|$|E
5|$|Bilis {{made its}} first {{landfall}} in northern Taiwan on July 13, with an intensity of 55kt (100km/h, 65mph). After <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> northern Taiwan, Bilis made its second landfall in Fujian, China early on July 14 at the same intensity, then weakened into a tropical depression over land the next day. Bilis lingered as a tropical depression over southeastern China before degenerating into a remnant low on July 16. But the JMA carried {{the system as a}} tropical depression until July 17. Despite becoming a remnant low, the remnants of Bilis maintained their identity for several days while moving westward over China, bringing heavy rains to inland areas.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> {{the state}} as a minimal hurricane, there were no reports of hurricane-force winds on {{mainland}} Florida. The highest official recorded wind report was 60mph (97km/h) in Miami Beach, while the highest accurate wind gust was 71mph (114km/h) in Vero Beach. In addition to the National Weather Service Reports, the South Florida Water Management District reported higher wind gusts near Lake Okeechobee of up to 93mph (150km/h) in Belle Glade, though these were likely caused by small-scale meso-cyclone-induced downbursts. Irene produced heavy rainfall across southeastern Florida, peaking at 17.45inches (443mm) at Boynton Beach, though many areas in the Miami Metropolitan Area received from 10 to 15inches (255 to 380mm). One F1 and three F0 tornadoes touched down in Broward and Palm Beach Counties, injuring three people.|$|E
