40|$|The sympatholytic {{antihypertensive}} agent <b>moxonidine,</b> a centrally-acting I 1 -imidazoline receptor agonist, has {{in clinical}} studies shown a beneficial effect on insulin resistance in hypertensive patients.

Satellite cells from skeletal muscle biopsies (musculus vastus lateralis and musculus transversus abdominis) were differentiated into myotubes and stimulated with <b>moxonidine.</b> Studies of glucose uptake was performed with [2 - 3 H]-deoxyglucose. Further, the specificity of the glucose transport was explored by applying cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of glucose transporters. The intracellular signalling mechanism of <b>moxonidine</b> was investigated with Western blotting using antibodies against the intracellular kinases Akt and ERK, and the glucose transporter GLUT- 4, respectively.

40|$|<b>Moxonidine</b> {{inhibits}} Na+/H+ {{exchange in}} proximal tubule cells and cortical collecting duct. The imidazoline receptor agonist <b>moxonidine</b> has been recently introduced as an antihypertensive therapy.

Related substances such as various guanidinium derivatives have been shown to inhibit Na+/H+ exchange in several preparations. We therefore examined whether the renal effects of <b>moxonidine</b> could be mediated by an inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured microfluorimetrically with BCECF in proximal LLC-PK 1 cells and in the principal cells of rat cortical collecting ducts (CCD). In LLC-PK 1 cells <b>moxonidine</b> (10 µmol/liter) had no effect on the basal pHi; however, it reduced the Na+/H+ activity reversibly by 43 ± 4 % (N = 26) when the exchanger was activated by cellular acidification. In rat CCD cells <b>moxonidine</b> slightly decreased basal pHi by 0. 08 ± 0. 03 pH units (N = 12). After acidification the recovery rate of pHi was reduced with <b>moxonidine</b> by 45 ± 6 % (N = 18).

40|$|We {{investigated}} the cardiovascular effects of rilmenidine, <b>moxonidine</b> and clonidine in conscious wild-type and D 79 N α 2 A-adrenoceptor mice. The in vitro pharmacology of these agonists was determined at recombinant (human) α 2 -adrenoceptors and at endogenous (dog) α 2 A-adrenoceptors. In wild-type mice, rilmenidine, <b>moxonidine</b> (100, 300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) and clonidine (30, 100 and 300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) dose-dependently decreased {{blood pressure and}} heart rate. In D 79 N α 2 A-adrenoceptor mice, responses to rilmenidine and <b>moxonidine</b> {{did not differ from}} vehicle control.

40|$|AbstractThe {{antihypertensive}} drugs <b>moxonidine</b> and clonidine are α 2 -adrenoceptor and imidazoline (I 1) agonists.

Therefore, in the present study we verify whether the cardiovascular and sympathetic effects produced by <b>moxonidine</b> in the commNTS are dependent on GABAergic or glutamatergic mechanisms. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity (sSNA) were recorded in urethane-anesthetized, and artificially-ventilated male Wistar rats (250 – 350 g).

40|$|The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) {{contains}} the presympathetic neurons involved in cardiovascular regulation {{that has been}} implicated {{as one of the}} most important central sites for the antihypertensive action of <b>moxonidine</b> (an α 2 -adrenergic and imidazoline agonist). Here, we sought to evaluate the cardiovascular effects produced by <b>moxonidine</b> injected into another important brainstem site, the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract (commNTS). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity (sSNA) and activity of putative sympathoexcitatory vasomotor neurons of the RVLM were recorded in conscious or urethane-anesthetized, and artificial ventilated male Wistar rats. In conscious or anesthetized rats, <b>moxonidine</b> (2. 5 and 5 nmol/ 50 nl) injected into the commNTS reduced MAP, HR and sSNA. The injection of <b>moxonidine</b> into the commNTS also elicited a reduction of 28 % in the activity of sympathoexcitatory vasomotor neurons of the RVLM. To further assess the notion that <b>moxonidine</b> could act in another brainstem area to elicit the antihypertensive effects, a group with electrolytic lesions of the commNTS or sham and with stainless steel guide-cannulas implanted into the 4 th V were used. In the sham group, <b>moxonidine</b> (20 nmol/ 1 μl) injected into 4 th V decreased MAP and HR.

40|$|Abstract Background Systemic {{hypertension}} often accompanies chronic {{renal failure}} and can accelerate its progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Adjunctive <b>moxonidine</b> appeared to have benefits versus adjunctive nitrendipine, in a randomised double-blind six-month trial in hypertensive patients with advanced renal failure. To understand the longer term effects and costs of <b>moxonidine,</b> a decision analytic model was developed and a cost-effectiveness analysis performed. Methods A Markov model was used to extrapolate results from the trial over three years. All patients started in a non-ESRD state. After each cycle, patients with a glomerular filtration rate below 15 ml/min had progressed to an ESRD state. The cost-effectiveness analysis {{was based on the}} Dutch healthcare perspective. The main outcome measure was incremental cost per life-year gained. The percentage of patients progressing to ESRD and cumulative costs were also compared after three years. In the base case analysis, all patients with ESRD received dialysis. Results The model predicted that after three years, 38. 9 % (95 %CI 31. 8 – 45. 8) of patients treated with nitrendipine progressed to ESRD compared to 7. 5 % (95 %CI 3. 5 – 12. 7) of patients treated with <b>moxonidine.</b> Treatment with standard antihypertensive therapy and adjunctive <b>moxonidine</b> was predicted {{to reduce the number of}} ESRD cases by 81 % over three years compared to adjunctive nitrendipine. The cumulative costs per patient were significantly lower in the <b>moxonidine</b> group € 9, 858 (95 % CI 5, 501 – 16, 174) than in the nitrendipine group € 37, 472 (95 % CI 27, 957 – 49, 478). The model showed <b>moxonidine</b> to be dominant compared to nitrendipine, increasing life-years lived by 0. 044 (95 %CI 0. 020 – 0. 070) years and at a cost-saving of € 27, 615 (95 %CI 16, 894 – 39, 583) per patient. Probabilistic analyses confirmed that the <b>moxonidine</b> strategy was dominant over nitrendipine in over 98. 9 % of cases. The cumulative 3 -year costs and LYL continued to favour the <b>moxonidine</b> strategy in all sensitivity analyses performed. Conclusion Treatment with standard antihypertensive therapy and adjunctive <b>moxonidine</b> in hypertensive patients with advanced renal failure was predicted to reduce the number of new ESRD cases over three years compared to adjunctive nitrendipine.

Ventilation and gas exchange were also measured during exercise. In addition, plasma catecholamines were measured at rest and during exercise. The only parameter changed, at rest, by <b>moxonidine</b> was the blood pressure which was reduced. During exercise, <b>moxonidine</b> reduced plasma noradrenaline (NA), compared with the placebo (P< 0 · 01). The only change observed in HRV during exercise was a significant reduction of the continuous long-term standard deviation (SD 2) of the Poincaré scatter-plot of the R-R interval (P< 0 · 05). However, the potential and prognostic significance of this result needs to be further assessed...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To compare {{effects of}} {{enalapril}} {{in combination with}} long-acting nifedipine or <b>moxonidine</b> on blood pressure (BP), myocardial mass and diastolic function of left ventricular, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, platelet aggregation in patients with arterial hypertension (HT) and metabolic syndrome (MS). Material and methods. 50 patients with HT and MS were examined. 25 patients were treated with enalapril and long-acting nifedipine and 25 patients – with enalapril and <b>moxonidine.</b> 24 -hour BP monitoring, echocardiography, anthropometry, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism estimation, platelet aggregation testing were performed before and 6 months after treatment. Results. Both combinations allowed to achieve target BP levels, provided cardioprotective and positive metabolic effects in most patients. The combination of enalapril and long-acting nifedipine had more significant antihypertensive effect and more prominently decreased the platelet aggregation induced by collagen. The combination of enalapril and <b>moxonidine</b> had more significant positive effects on carbohydrate metabolism and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Conclusion. Enalapril in combination with long-acting nifedipine or <b>moxonidine</b> can be recommended for treatment of patients with HT and MS. </p...|$|E
40|$|The present article {{represent}} a pharmacoeconomic comparison of standard antihypertensive therapy {{and the same}} therapy plus <b>moxonidine</b> (Physiotens) in patients with arterial hypertension, overweight and diabetes mellitus type 2. The budget impact analysis was conducted on outpatient and inpatient care basis. <b>Moxonidine</b> showеd convincing advantages compared to standard antihypertensive therapy such as the stroke risk reduction by 6 percent, reduction of doses antihypertensive and hypoglycemic drugs, which resulted in substantial decrease of direct medical costs...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the effects of the {{centrally}} acting antihypertensive drugs rilmenidine, <b>moxonidine,</b> clonidine and guanabenz on sympathetic tone with their effects on noradrenaline release in the cerebral cortex. In particular, the hypothesis was tested that rilmenidine and <b>moxonidine,</b> due to their high affinity for sympatho-inhibitory imidazoline I 1 receptors and low affinity for α 2 -adrenoceptors, lower sympathetic tone without causing an α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of cerebrocortical noradrenaline release. In rats anaesthetized with urethane, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and the concentration of noradrenaline in arterial blood plasma was determined. The release of noradrenaline in the medial prefrontal cortex was estimated by microdialysis. Intravenous administration of rilmenidine (30, 100, 300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), <b>moxonidine</b> (10, 30, 100 and 300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), clonidine (1, 3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and guanabenz (1, 3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) led to dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia; the plasma noradrenaline concentration also decreased. After the two highest doses, all four drugs lowered noradrenaline release in the prefrontal cortex. At doses eliciting equal hypotensive and sympatho-inhibitory responses, rilmenidine and <b>moxonidine</b> inhibited cerebral cortical noradrenaline release at least as much as clonidine and guanabenz. The results show that rilmenidine and <b>moxonidine</b> lower cerebrocortical noradrenaline release at doses similar to those which cause sympatho-inhibition. This effect was probably due to an α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of the firing of locus coeruleus neurons and, in addition, to presynaptic inhibition of noradrenaline release at the level of the axon terminals in the cortex. The results argue against the hypothesis that rilmenidine and <b>moxonidine,</b> due to their selectivity for sympatho-inhibitory I 1 imidazoline receptors, do not suppress noradrenergic neurons in the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} chronic subcutaneous treatment with centrally-acting antihypertensive agents <b>moxonidine,</b> rilmenidine and clonidine on the baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) in conscious normotensive rabbits over 3 weeks. Infusions of phenylephrine and nitroprusside were performed at week 0 and at weeks 1 and 3 of treatment to determine mean arterial pressure (MAP) -HR baroreflex relationships. A second curve was performed after intravenous methscopolamine to determine the sympathetic baroreflex relationship. The vagal component of the reflex was determined by subtracting the sympathetic curve from the intact curve. Clonidine and <b>moxonidine</b> (both 1 mg/kg/day), and rilmenidine (5 mg/kg/day), reduced MAP by 13  3, 15  2 and 13  2 mmHg, respectively, but {{had no effect on}} HR over the 3 -week treatment period. Whilst all three antihypertensive agents shifted baroreflex curves to the left, parallel to the degree of hypotension, <b>moxonidine</b> and rilmenidine decreased the vagal contribution to the baroreflex by decreasing the HR range of the reflex whilst <b>moxonidine</b> also increased sympathetic baroreflex range and sensitivity. By contrast clonidine had little chronic effect on the cardiac baroreflex. The present study shows that second generation agents <b>moxonidine</b> and rilmenidine but not first generation agent clonidine chronically shift the balance of baroreflex control of HR toward greater sympathetic and lesser vagal influences. These changes if translated to hypertensive subjects, may not be particularly helpful in view of the already reduced vagal contribution in hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Central α 2 -adrenoceptors and the pontine lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) are {{involved}} in the control of sodium and water intake. Bilateral injections of <b>moxonidine</b> (α 2 -adrenergic/imidazoline receptor agonist) or noradrenaline into the LPBN strongly increases 0. 3 M NaCl intake induced by a combined treatment of furosemide plus captopril. Injection of <b>moxonidine</b> into the LPBN also increases hypertonic NaCl and water intake and reduces oxytocin secretion, urinary sodium, and water excreted by cell-dehydrated rats, causing a positive sodium and water balance, which suggests that <b>moxonidine</b> injected into the LPBN deactivates mechanisms that restrain body fluid volume expansion. Pretreatment with specific α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists injected into the LPBN abolishes the behavioral and renal effects of <b>moxonidine</b> or noradrenaline injected into the same area, suggesting that these effects depend on activation of LPBN α 2 -adrenoceptors. In fluid-depleted rats, the palatability of sodium is reduced by ingestion of hypertonic NaCl, limiting intake. However, in rats treated with <b>moxonidine</b> injected into the LPBN, the NaCl palatability remains high, even after ingestion of significant amounts of 0. 3 M NaCl. The changes in behavioral and renal responses produced by activation of α 2 -adrenoceptors in the LPBN are probably a consequence of reduction of oxytocin secretion and blockade of inhibitory signals that affect sodium palatability. In this review, a model is proposed to show how activation of α 2 -adrenoceptors in the LPBN may affect palatability and, consequently, ingestion of sodium as well as renal sodium excretion...|$|E
