However, what were the paths that native forest seed science had to walk down to reach this standardization? What are the prospects for the future relating to the native forest seed sector?

40|$|Because of {{the lack}} of {{varieties}} for organic agriculture, associations of organic farmers in several European countries have begun cultivating landraces and historic varieties, effectively practicing in situ conservation of agricultural biodiversity. To promote agrobiodiversity conservation, a special list for ‘‘conservation varieties’’ was implemented in 2008 by the EU because for any exchange and <b>marketing</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> in the EU, a variety must be registered in an official catalog. Our study aimed at improving knowledge on the phenotypic diversity and evolution of such varieties when cultivated on organic farms in Europe, in order to better define their specific characteristics and the implications for the registration process. We assessed multi-trait phenotypic evolution in eight European landraces and historic varieties of bread wheat and in two pureline variety checks, each grown by eight organic farmers over 2 years and then evaluated in a common garde experiment at an organic research farm. Measurements on each farmer’s version of each variety included several standard evaluation criteria for assessing distinctness, uniformity and stability for variety registration. Significant phenotypic differentiation was found among farmers’ versions of each variety. Some varieties showed considerable variation among versions while others showed fewer phenotypic changes, even in comparison to the two checks. Although farmers’ variety would not satisfy uniformity or stability criteria as defined in the catalog evaluation requirements, each variety remained distinct when assessed using multivariate analysis.

Seed supply systems {{come in a variety of}} forms, and operate at a range of levels (national, regional and local) and with different plant materials used for different purposes. In all cases, however, the public and the private sectors have complementary roles in ensuring that there is an effective seed supply system, which can meet consumer needs in terms of the range of plant materials available and the quantities and quality of seed required at an affordable price. Nationally, it is the government that sets the policy framework within which seed supply systems must operate, and also provides some supporting infrastructure.

The balance in terms of public–private sector roles and responsibilities differs from place to place and changes over time. This paper discusses the factors that help shape what is an effective seed supply system under a particular set of circumstances, but one that may not necessarily be as effective in other countries/regions or with a different product mix. It also considers the forces that lead to a gradual evolution of the system over time and to recent and more radical changes in major developed countries.

These factors have led to far-reaching structural changes in relation to commercial seed production and delivery in the developed world over the past decade. The recent changes in seed supply arrangements were focused initially on high volume arable food crops in the larger developed economies of North America and western Europe.

40|$|Communication le vendredi 20 juin 2008. Viable {{seeds for}} organic cultureThe {{currently}} established seed regulations {{conform to the}} dominant conception of the conventional agriculture industry, wherein the cultivated varieties answer to the criteria of DUS (Distinction, Uniformity, Stability) and the protocols of VCU (Value for Cultivation and Use). In 1998, the European Community established a directive – 98 / 95 /EC – regulating the <b>marketing</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> of landraces, conservation varieties, amateur varieties and seed mixtures. The Farm Seed Opportunities project aims at scientific support {{to the implementation of}} this directive by setting up coherent definitions of the varieties concerned and providing a survey and evaluation of national particularities. The project also expects to promote the recognition of the farmer's role in the on farm conservation and breeding of innovative varieties, taking into account the participatory plant breeding experiences of several groups of organic farmers. Diverse forms of agriculture and of marketing still exist in European countries. Farmers and other stakeholders in society (e. g. researchers, traders, consumers…) who are concerned about the safeguard of traditional, cultural and ecological values or wish to develop crop varieties which are better adapted to the specific needs of their local agricultural systems, need to keep access to a wider range of crop varieties than current registered ones. Organic Agriculture is one of these systems existing, which demands local adaptation of plants, as well as diversity in the range of products and multiple quality aspects demanded by consumers, therefore it requires a broadening of the seed market in order to facilitate its appropriate developmentFarm Seed Opportunities is managed by a consortium of public and private scientific institutions, peasant seed networks and organic farmers associations in six European countries. Our activities include three main aspects. The first one will consist of a survey on existing experiences, the expectations of the stakeholders and the limitations of current laws in EU countries including Hungary and Rumania. A second part will be devoted to an on farm experimental programme in three countries (Netherlands, France and Italy). Thirty farmers, mainly organic farmers, participate in these field trials. The farmers and some small scale breeders suggested their own landraces varieties of wheat, maize, spinach and beans. They have exchanged amongst each other’s the varieties. The aim of the trials is to describe how the farmers’ dynamic management and the natural pressure of selection allow them to evolve. The experimental data should be a reference to propose adaptations to the current regulations or to suggest regulation space for “peasant varieties”. The third part of the Farm Seed Opportunities programme aims to integrate all the information, to organise experts meetings and the dissemination of the results towards a broad public and to establish regulation propositions to policy makers. In all its activities, Farm Seed Opportunities will contribute to enlarging the basis of organic breeding and its farmers’ contribution. Organic agriculture and the diversity of life forms are intrinsically linked. IFOAM favours an awareness of this relationship by actions and statements on biodiversity. Our role is to reinforce the global strategy for the development of cultivated diversity...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{details the}} <b>seed</b> supply {{experiences}} <b>of</b> the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Malawi. ICRISAT has developed about five high yielding, marketpreferred and well-adapted improved groundnut varieties in Malawi, but no seed companies have shown {{any interest in}} producing and <b>marketing</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> these varieties due to low profit margins. ICRISAT, under Irish Aid funded Malawi Seed Industry Development (MSID) project initiated two seed production and distribution models in Malawi. First, certified <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> five improved groundnut varieties was produced by use of contracted farmers of NASFAM under a “buy back” scheme facilitated by ICRISAT. At the same time, the project also facilitated certified seed production by some seed companies for marketing through available agro-dealer networks. Much <b>of</b> the <b>seed</b> from this model was channeled through the agro-dealer networks under the Government’s Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP). In three years, from 2010 − 2012, about 400 t <b>of</b> certified <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> the most preferred improved variety, CG 7, was produced and distributed each year to resource-poor households in Malawi. In remote areas with poor road infrastructure, a second model <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> banks was initiated to deliver <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> improved groundnut varieties to farmers. These two seed delivery channels enhanced adoption of CG 7 from 20 % to about 90 %. Although the MSID project established formal and informal seed production structures in Malawi, the success <b>of</b> the <b>seed</b> delivery model was mainly attributed to FISP that was able to overcome the inaccessibility constraints <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> unavailability and unaffordability. One of the main lessons learnt is that a suitable seed delivery model is location specific, and is best determined by undertaking a situational analysis to determine the constraints. Further, a public-private sector partnership, even under FISP, {{is important for the}} success <b>of</b> any <b>seed</b> delivery model in use.

Usually Djenkol {{is sold in}} the <b>markets</b> by number <b>of</b> <b>seeds.</b> For transport, seeds, in particular young ones, should not {{be removed from the}} pods to avoid desiccation. One way to store the seeds is by processing it into chips (emping). Another possibility however could be its procession to flour. To date, due to the high moisture content, this is hardly done.|$|R

There is a 19 % higher probability <b>of</b> selling rice <b>seeds</b> among households who have deposited shares in CBSPOs than their counterparts. The seed price shows a significant positive impact on households’ decision {{to participate in the}} market. One unit increase in seed price (NRs kg- 1) increases the probability <b>of</b> households’ selling <b>seed</b> in the market by 7.1 %. Seed price has also an indirect impact on volume <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> sold in the market as shown from its marginal impact on seed sold volume (Table  2). One unit increase in seed price leads to an increase <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> sold volume by 11 %. The other variables such as family labour, education of HHH and roof type did not show a significant impact on seed marketing but {{it does not mean that}} they do not have any role in households’ decision in selling seed in the <b>market</b> and volume <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> sold.|$|R
40|$|Sunflower oil is {{the most}} {{preferred}} vegetable oil in Turkey. 35 % of total consumption of vegetable oil is sunflower oil. Sunflower seed import is approximately 500 - 650 thousand tons while sunflower seed production is 800 - 850 thousand tons in the last years. The main objective {{of this study is}} to determine the reasons of deficiency of vegetable oil in Turkey and to suggest some solutions. For this objective, the prospective situation and the <b>market</b> structure <b>of</b> sunflower <b>seed</b> in Turkey has estimated. “One product partial equilibrium analysis ” has been used to estimate the future <b>market</b> structure <b>of</b> sunflower <b>seed.</b> A simulation model from 2003 to 2015 has been created with partial equilibrium analysis. Turkey is a net importer of vegetable oils. Sunflower seed import is approximately 300 thousand tons while crude oil import is approximately 180 thousand tons in 2002. According to the results of simulation model, Turkey will continue to be a net importer for sunflower and other oil seeds. It has been estimated that the sunflower seed import will be approximately 1 million tons and crude oil import will be approximately 400 thousand tons at end of the simulation period (2003 - 2015).
