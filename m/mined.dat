The {{composition of the}} <b>mined</b> platinum group metal (PGM) mixtures varies widely, depending on the geochemical formation. For example, the PGMs <b>mined</b> in South Africa contain on average 11% ruthenium while the PGMs <b>mined</b> in the former USSR contain only 2% (1992). Ruthenium, osmium, and iridium are considered the minor platinum group metals.|$|E

5|$|Ironstone {{outcrops}} {{along the}} northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield were extensively worked for the production of iron and were important in the initiation of the Industrial Revolution in South Wales. Lead was <b>mined</b> at Pentre Halkyn in Flintshire during the Roman occupation of Britain and there were ore-bearing sites in Clwyd where lead, silver and sometimes zinc were <b>mined.</b> These metals were also <b>mined</b> in the upland areas of the Rivers Ystwyth and Rheidol. Manganese, titanium and numerous other minerals occur in various parts of Wales. Gold is found in southern Snowdonia and at Dolaucothi, and Snowdonia had a flourishing copper industry from the early 1800s.
