The effects of the antioxidants on broiler performance, carcass yield, and fatty acid composition of the white and dark meat lipid were investigated. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the n- 3 fatty acid composition of triglyceride, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and phosphatidyl choline fractions. The antioxidants influenced neither broiler performance nor yield. The birds did not utilize the experimental diets as efficiently as the corn-soybean meal diet. The fatty acid compositions of white and dark meat lipids of broilers were influenced by dietary fatty acids, but to different extents among the lipid fractions. Fatty acids with 20 or more carbon atoms were moderately distributed in the phosphatidyl choline fraction as compared with the triglycer-ide and phosphatidyl ethanolamine fractions. The presence or absence of antioxidants influenced the fatty acid composition and distribution in the phosphatidyl ethanolamine fraction of white meat. The white meat from birds fed FFS+T, FSS+C, and FFS+T+C diets had elevated levels of Ci 8 : 3 n 3, C 20 : 5 n 3, C 22 : 5 n 3 / and C 22 : 6 n 3 and reduced levels of total saturates and n- 6 :n- 3 as opposed to the FFS and corn-soybean meal groups.

40|$|Background: Epidemiologic {{studies have}} shown an inverse cor-relation between acute {{coronary}} events and high intake of dietary vitamin E. Recent clinical studies, however, failed to show any beneficial effects of -tocopherol on cardiovascular events. Absence of tocopherols other than -tocopherol in the clinical studies {{may account for the}} conflicting results. Objective: This study compared the effect of a mixed tocopherol preparation rich in -tocopherol with that of -tocopherol on platelet aggregation in humans and addressed the potential mech-anisms of the effect. Design: Forty-six subjects were randomly divided into 3 groups: -tocopherol, <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherols,</b> and control. ADP and phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate–induced platelet aggregation, nitric oxide (NO) release, activation of endothelial constitutive nitric-oxide synthase (ecNOS; EC 1. 14. 13. 39) and of protein kinase C (PKC), and ecNOS, superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1. 15. 1. 1), and PKC protein content in platelets were measured before and after 8 wk of administration of tocopherols. Results: ADP-induced platelet aggregation decreased signifi-cantly in the mixed tocopherol group but not in the -tocopherol and control groups. NO release, ecNOS activation, and SOD pro-tein content in platelets increased in the tocopherol-treated groups. PKC activation in platelets was markedly decreased in the tocopherol-treated groups. <b>Mixed</b> <b>tocopherols</b> were more potent than -tocopherol alone in modulating NO release and ecNOS activation but not SOD protein content or PKC activation.

Calves fed diets supplemented with α-T, γ-T for five days or no tocopherol supplement (T 0 E) were challenged with a low-level of LPS (0. 25 μg/kg, iv, E. coli 055 :B 5) sufficient to effect a liver nitration response. As fed, α-T or γ-T increased plasma and liver content of the respective tocopherols reflecting their relative abundance in the respective diets. Plasma or tissue mediators and biomarkers of the proinflammatory response [plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, P< 0. 001), nitrate+nitrite (NOx, P< 0. 01), and serum amyloid A (SAA, P< 0. 001) ], and general liver content of pNT (P< 0. 005) increased after LPS. LPS-mediated increases in TNF-α were not dif- ferent between diet treatments; both plasma NOx (P< 0. 05) and generalized liver pNT (P< 0. 03) responses were attenuated significantly in α-T and γ-T versus T 0 E calves. Plasma SAA was significantly decreased in γ-T calves at 24 h post-LPS relative to responses in α-T or T 0 E calves. The nitration of the mitochondrial proteins 24 h post-LPS was not only attenuated in α-T and γ-T vs T 0 E, but also the mitigating effect of γ-T on these specific nitration events was greater than that of α-T (P< 0. 01). Results are consistent with the concept that short-term α-T or γ-T supplementation can effectively decrease proinflammatory liver pNT after LPS; some mitochondrial nitration targets may be better protected with prophylactic supplementation with γ-,δ-tocopherol enriched oil...|$|R
40|$|Lipids such as omega- 3 {{fatty acids}} and citrus oils are {{important}} food components {{due to their}} nutritional and flavor benefits, respectively. Both of these food lipids are susceptible to chemical degradation resulting in formation of unacceptable off-flavors, nutrient and flavor loss. Oil-in-water emulsions {{could be used as}} an effective tool to protect these chemically sensitive lipids from deterioration by engineering the emulsion droplet interfacial membrane (e. g. charge and/or thickness) using proteins or multiple layers of emulsifiers. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of the interfacial characteristics of emulsions stabilized with proteins or multiple layers of emulsifiers in preventing oxidative deterioration of omega- 3 fatty acids and citrus oil flavor compounds. ^ Factors influencing the stability of protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions at pH 3. 0 were examined. Physical instability of whey protein isolate (WPI) -stabilized corn oil-in-water emulsions increased considerably after thermal processing at ≥ 70 °C in the presence of ≥ 150 mM NaCl. WPI-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions containing 25 wt% algal or menhaden oils at pH 3. 0 had good oxidative stability when pasteurized and stored at 4 °C. The addition of EDTA and <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherol</b> isomers further increased oxidative stability. These results suggest that WPI-stabilized algal or menhaden oil-in-water emulsions at pH 3. 0 containing EDTA may be used as an ingredient delivery system to incorporate ω- 3 fatty acids into functional foods. ^ Citral/hexadecane- or limonene/hexadecane-in-water emulsions were prepared with varying interfacial properties by coating the oil droplets with WPI, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), SDS-chitosan or gum arabic (GA). Emulsifier type had little influence on the rate of citral degradation. However, WPI and SDS-chitosan were more effective at retarding the oxidation of citral degradation products and limonene in comparison to emulsions stabilized by GA. Inhibition of oxidation by the WPI or SDS-chitosan systems could be due to the ability of these emulsifiers to produce cationic emulsion droplet interfacial membranes that inhibit the interactions between dispersed lipids and continuous phase prooxidants such as iron. This research may lead to development of new strategies to improve the stability of emulsified products containing citrus oils. ...|$|R

Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 55 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive (500 mg/day) (a) αT, (b) <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherols,</b> or (c) placebo for 6 weeks. Cellular tocopherols, plasma and urine F 2 -isoprostanes, erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities, plasma inflammatory markers, and ex vivo assessment of eicosanoid synthesis were analyzed pre-and postsupplementation. Results: Neutrophil αT and γT increased (both P < 0. 001) with mixed tocopherol supplementation, whereas αT (P < 0. 001) increased and γT decreased (P < 0. 005) after αT supplementation. Both αT and mixed tocopherol supplementation resulted in reduced plasma F 2 -isoprostanes (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 001, respectively) but did not affect 24 -h urinary F 2 -isoprostanes or erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities. Neither αT nor mixed tocopherol supplementation affected plasma C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-α, or monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1. Stimulated neutrophil leukotriene B 4 production decreased significantly in the mixed tocopherol group (P = 0. 02) but not in the αT group (P = 0. 15). Conclusions: The ability of tocopherols to reduce systemic oxidative stress suggests potential benefits of vitamin E supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes. In populations with well-controlled type 2 diabetes, supplementation with either αT or <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherols</b> rich in γT is unlikely to confer further benefits in reducing inflammation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{oxidized}} dietary lipid {{and the role}} of vitamin E on growth performance, health status, and muscle and liver quality of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were evaluated over a 9 -week feeding period. Four isonitrogenous experimental diets containing fresh or oxidized fish oil with or without added vitamin E (a-tocopherol or <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherols)</b> were fed to juvenile cod in duplicate tanks. The highly oxidized lipid used had a peroxide value of 94 meq/kg oil. No significant change (P> 0. 05) on growth performance or feed utilization was observed when oxidized dietary lipid was used. The erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF), referred to as susceptibility to hemolysis, of fish fed oxidized oil without added vitamin E was high in comparison with those fed unoxidized oil. Supplementation of δ-tocopherol appeared to decrease the hemolysis, but <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherols</b> had no significant effect (P> 0. 05) on EOF. The proximate composition of fish whole body was also affected by oxidized oil and vitamin E. Fatty acid composition of liver total lipid reflected that of dietary lipid. However, muscle lipid contained high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) compared to that of liver lipid, as expected. Both muscle and liver fatty acid composition followed the same trend among the treatments as those of dietary fatty acids. Fish fed fresh oil had a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in muscle and liver lipid than those fed oxidized oil. Fatty acid composition of neutral lipids and phospholipids in fish muscle tissue was also analyzed. A larger quantity of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was present in neutral lipid fraction, while phospholipids contained a higher amount of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Oxidized oil significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased the deposition of α-tocopherol in liver but not in muscle. Gamma- and δ-tocopherols from dietary tocopherols mixture were retained at very low levels in liver but higher retention was observed in muscle. The oxidative state of both liver and muscle, as measured by the 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and headspace propanal, negatively correlated with tissue vitamin E levels. It is suggested that oxidized oil affected juvenile Atlantic cod by causing vitamin E deficiency in certain tissues and that these effects could be alleviated by supplementation of a sufficient amount of vitamin E through diet. It is also indicated that <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherols</b> were good antioxidants for Atlantic cod, although less effective than α-tocopherol alone in many tissues with the exception of muscle, where γ-. and δ-tocopherols were deposited at considerably high levels.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} four commercially available antioxidants in two fish oils. The antioxidants were investigated to see which one of them is most efficient in preventing oxidation. Antioxidants were added in three levels to find the optimal concentration. In addition a possible synergistic effect between the antioxidants was investigated. Two different oils with different concentration of EPA and DHA were added antioxidants. Four of the antioxidants were single antioxidants. Two mixes with two antioxidants were added to investigate possible synergistic effect. The antioxidants were added in three different concentrations. The oils were stored at two different temperatures with access to oxygen. Peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AV) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) were methods used to evaluate extent of oxidation. Total oxidation value (TOTOX) was calculated based on PV and AV measurements. Gas chromatography was used to identify and quantify 14 selected volatile organic compounds (VOC) used to describe extent of oxidation. In addition the fatty acid profiles of the two oils were analyzed by gas chromatography. The storage temperature and type of oil showed to have significant effect on TOTOX. These two factors also influenced the concentration of VOC in the oil samples. The three levels of antioxidants showed no significant effect on TOTOX. Only the middle level of antioxidant was used when analyzing VOC. Ascorbyl palmitate and propyl gallate distinguished from the rest of the antioxidants. Oil with ascorbyl palmitate showed great variation and high values for PV and AV. Some of the oil samples with ascorbyl palmitate gave higher areas for specific VOC compared to reference samples without antioxidant. Ascorbyl palmitate distinguished as the least efficient antioxidant with regard to specific VOCs. Oil with propyl gallate showed less variation and lower PV and AV than the other antioxidants. Samples with propyl gallate distinguished from the other oil samples, including reference samples, with regard to VOC. <b>Mixed</b> <b>tocopherol,</b> either as single antioxidant or in mix with rosemary extract, also distinguished with regard to VOC. The reference samples were stored under the same conditions and were not added antioxidants. These samples were not significantly different from the other samples with antioxidants added with regard to PV and AV. A possible prooxidative effect was seen for some of the antioxidants. Total area of VOC, on the other hand, revealed higher areas for most of the reference samples. Evaluation of VOC revealed antioxidative effect of all the antioxidants, in more or less degree. The efficiency of the antioxidants applied in this study depended on type of oil and storage temperature.

In peanuts, the cocoa powder sample developed significantly lower levels of oxidation identifiers than the tocopherol or control samples. In peanut oil, there was no significant difference in levels of oxidation identifiers between the treatments. In peanut butter, the PV was significantly higher in the tocopherol sample than the cocoa powder or control samples, but no significant difference was observed in hexanal. The results of the sensory analysis indicated that the cocoa powder depressed the perception of both positive and negative attributes compared to the tocopherol and control samples.

Sensory analysis can be used to determine changes in products and to estimate products’ shelf-life. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate how increasing levels of oxidation in rendered protein meals used to produce extruded pet food affected the sensory properties and (2) determine the effect of shelf-life on pet owners’ acceptability of extruded pet food diet formulated without the use of preservative. Pet food diets contained beef meat bone meal (BMBM) and chicken byproduct meal (CBPM) in which the oxidation was retarded with ethoxyquin, <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherols,</b> or none at all, and then extruded into dry pet foods. These samples represented low, medium, and high oxidation levels, respectively. Samples were stored for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months at ambient temperature. Each time point, samples were evaluated by six highly trained descriptive panelists for sensory attributes related to oxidation. Samples without preservatives were chosen for the acceptability test, since the differences in sensory characteristics over storage time were more distinguishable in those samples. Pet owners evaluated samples for aroma, appearance and overall liking. Descriptive sensory analysis detected significant changes in oxidized-related sensory characteristics over storage time. However, the differences for CBPM samples were more pronounced and directional. The consumer study showed no differences in pet owners’ acceptability for BMBM samples.

40|$|Alpha and gamma {{tocopherol}} metabolism {{in healthy}} subjects and patients with end-stage renal disease. BackgroundThe metabolism of alpha and gamma tocopherol, the major components of vitamin E, {{have not been}} studied in uremic patients. The major pathway of tocopherol metabolism is via phytyl side chain oxidation, leaving carboxyethyl-hydroxychromans (CEHC) as metabolites. Alpha and gamma CEHC are water soluble, renally excreted, with known potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. MethodsWe examined serum alpha and gamma tocopherol and respective CEHC concentrations in 15 healthy subjects and 15 chronic hemodialysis patients. ResultsSerum alpha tocopherol levels were similar in hemodialysis patients (12. 03 ± 1. 34 μg/mL) and healthy subjects (11. 21 ± 0. 20 μg/mL), while serum gamma tocopherol levels were significantly greater in hemodialysis patients (3. 17 ± 0. 37 μg/mL) compared to healthy subjects (1. 08 ± 0. 06 μg/mL, P < 0. 0001). Serum alpha and gamma CEHC levels were tenfold and sixfold higher in hemodialysis patients compared to healthy subjects, respectively (both P < 0. 0001). Serum alpha and gamma tocopherol levels and CEHC metabolites were also measured after supplementation of alpha- or gamma-enriched <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherols</b> in both hemodialysis patients and healthy subjects. Tocopherol administration resulted in modest or nonsignificant changes in serum tocopherol concentrations, while markedly increasing serum CEHC concentrations in both healthy subjects and hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis resulted in {{no change in the}} serum alpha or gamma tocopherol concentrations while decreasing serum alpha CEHC and gamma CEHC levels by 63 % and 53 %, respectively (both P = 0. 001 versus predialysis). Fourteen-day administration of gamma-enriched but not alpha tocopherols lowered median C-reactive protein (CRP) significantly in hemodialysis patients (4. 4 to 2. 1 mg/L, P < 0. 02). ConclusionFirst, serum alpha and gamma CEHC accumulate in uremic patients compared to healthy subjects; second, supplementation with tocopherols dramatically increases serum CEHC levels in both healthy subjects and hemodialysis patients; and, finally, CEHC accumulation may mediate anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of tocopherols in hemodialysis patients...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceGrain Science and IndustryGreg AldrichRendered protein meal is an {{important}} source of dietary protein and fat in pet food. However, fats in rendered meals can oxidize rapidly if not protected. The most common measurement of oxidation is the peroxide value (PV), but the analysis is highly variable. Additionally, the incorporation of oxidized protein further shortens its shelf life. Therefore, our objectives were to evaluate methods to measure fat quality in rendered protein meals and to determine the effect of increasingly oxidized protein meals on the shelf life of extruded pet foods. In Experiment 1, samples of five chicken byproduct meals (CBPM) from each of three locations and five beef meat and bone meals (BMBM) from each of two locations were analyzed for PV, anisidine value (AV), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The PV varied by method and location (P 0. 01). In Experiment 2, one metric ton of each unpreserved CBPM and unpreserved BMBM were collected and left unpreserved (U) or preserved with either ethoxyquin (E) or <b>mixed</b> <b>tocopherols</b> (T). These were held at ambient conditions (25 °C, 51 % RH) and monitored for PV and AV until values plateaued (41 and 63 days for CBPM and BMBM, respectively). Each “aged” meal was then incorporated into a model extruded cat food diet (~ 30 % protein). Samples of kibble for each treatment were collected and stored at an elevated temperature and humidity (40 °C, 70 % RH) for 18 weeks and an ambient temperature and humidity (~ 22 °C, 45 % RH) for 12 months. The initial reduction (P < 0. 05) in PV of the U (highly oxidized) BMBM and CBPM after processing suggests oxidation levels were diluted by food production. The oxidized meal led to a shorter shelf life (P < 0. 05) in the finished food by PV analysis; but, sensory analysis by quick assessment did not completely corroborate these findings. These results suggest that PV doesn’t fully describe rendered protein meal stability or have a direct impact on shelf life for consumers; but may {{have a negative impact on}} pets due to oxidized lipid consumption...|$|E
