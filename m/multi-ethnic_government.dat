40|$|Affirmative action (AA) is a {{government}} policy permitting employers and universities to give preferential treatment to applicants from specific (e. g. racial) groups. We present a comparative analysis of AA in six countries (India, USA, Malaysia, Canada, South Africa, and Brazil) and explain similarities among these programs according to universal psychological mechanisms and variation according to cultural-historical contexts. It appears that similarities in contextual conditions (e. g. democratic <b>government,</b> <b>multi-ethnic</b> states) interact with ancient psychological mechanisms (e. g. fairness, cheater detection, alliance tracking) to provide {{at least part of}} the motivation for the development and expansion of AA, despite its problematic consequences.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the disintegration and collapse of empires cause wars and crises by creating some of the conditions and causes of war commonly identified by scholars. When empires disintegrate and collapse, the metropole withdraws its power from its peripheral territories and newly independent successor states emerge. This new situation gives rise to several problems: a power vacuum develops forcing successor states {{to provide for their}} own security and leading them and other states to try to fill the vacuum; successor states engage in state-building, which occurs at different rates for different states; ethnic groups are divided from their homelands; multi-ethnic states are created; and, territorial borders become issues of dispute. As a result of these problems,. five causes of war develop, which can lead to wars an crises. International rules of the game become unsettled and ambiguous because a new balance of power develops and new issues of international concern arise. Power shifts as successor states build institutions for self-rule, and alliances form and collapse in response to the ever changing situation. Third, the new situation that occurs as the empire disintegrates increases uncertainty about the capabilities of the successor states, about the alliances that exist, and about the intentions of states, making it difficult to determine the new balance of power and the intentions of other states. Fourth, nationalism grows as states seek to unite with their diaspora and protect them from the discrimination of the <b>multi-ethnic</b> state's <b>government.</b> Fifth, competition for leadership in successor states cause leaders to have a weak hold on power. To test this argument, I look at the seven wars and two crises that occurred when the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans disintegrated in the nineteenth century. This study serve three purposes. First, it studies the causes of war that result from the disintegration and collapse of empires. Second, and more relevant for today's policy-makers, this study can help us understand the consequences of the disintegration of multi-ethnic states and, in the process, provide guidance for policy-makers. Third, this dissertation tests several hypotheses about the causes of war. by Jonathan E. Ladinsky. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Political Science, 2001.

40|$|In Afghanistan, {{the state}} {{building}} enterprise began by Amir Abdur Rehman Khan (r. 1880 - 1901) culminated into the 1964 constitution, {{seems to have}} created a sense of nationhood among the various groups making up the country. Despite {{the recent history of}} war and feud between various factions, {{there seems to be a}} consensus on preserving a united Afghanistan. This thesis attempts to examine the constitution making process in Afghanistan, especially in the context of relations between the central government and the periphery. If a constitution is 'the soul of a nation', as a South African scholar puts it, I am tempted to add that the constitution-making experience of a nation&# 8212;the constitutional moment is an occasion fora nation's self interrogation on its past, present and future. It is a rendezvous with destiny. Successful constitutions are characterized by a capacity to strike a balance between the need to enshrine fundamental principles, on the one hand, and provisions for adaptation to changing circumstances, on the other. The latter includes the needs of achieving Security an([the developmental imperatives of a nation. One of the crucial questions that the drafters of a constitution face concerns the relationship between the central government and the regions and localities comprising the country. What degree of decentralization is granted to the regions is a matter to be determined in each case by the history and politics of each country. Thus the present study advocating federalism in Afghanistan is divided into the following chapters:Chapter I discusses the established principles of constitutional Jurisprudence and its relevance in the context of the constitutional-making process in Afghanistan. Unitary constitution failed in delivering stability and development to Afghanistan, hence, needs application of federal principles. Chapter 2 describes and explains the ethnic diversity in Afghanistan. It also discusses the inter-ethnic relations in broader political ambit, policy of the ruling Muhammad zai dynasty towards ethnic minorities, inter-ethnic relations during Afghan Jihad and the subsequent impact of the jihad in terms of fostering ethnic rivalries. Chapter 3 contains a brief overview of the events leading to the fall of Communist regime in Kabul and efforts to install a <b>multi-ethnic,</b> broad-based <b>government</b> in Kabul under the auspices of the United Nations. The ensuing internecine battle for power, the power struggle amongst various contenders and its impact on the delicate social fabric of the Afghan society, role of regional as well as global powers in widening the schism amongst various interest groups distinguishable on ethnic, linguistic, sectarian and cultural grounds are taken into account. Five regional political power 			centers are identified. The rise and fall of the Taliban the interim and transitional governments mandated to restore democracy and constitutional order in Afghanistan are assessed. Chapter 4 narrates the story as to how the administrative edifice of Afghanistan was structured through the ages more precisely since the days of Amir Abdur Rehman, creator of the administrative set-up still in vogue in Afghanistan. The focus of attention has been the centre-periphery relations, the judicial structure, the military and the finances. Chapter 5 studies the constitution making process set in [notion by the Bonn Agreement. The Constitution of Afghanistan 2003 is examined especially in the context of administrative structure it has raised...|$|R
