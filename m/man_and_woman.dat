The film focuses on the relationship between a <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> who are forced to share a room as they hide from the Arrow Cross {{toward the end of the}} Second World War. It garnered a Best Director award for Szabó at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards.|$|E

5|$|Both {{inside and}} outside battle, characters' {{relationships}} can be developed through interactions {{on and off the}} battlefield. As the strength of their relationships grow, certain abilities in battle are also strengthened. A feature introduced in Genealogy of the Holy War and used in later titles was an aspect of relationships. A <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> who fall in love will have a child, and that child will inherit certain skills and stats from them. One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death, a function in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed {{from the rest of the}} game with very few exceptions (the main character, a character pivotal to the main story). Up until Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Shadow, there was no option to disable permanent death. In New Mystery of the Emblem, a new Casual Mode was added, in which characters that died were revived at the end of a battle. Fates also added Phoenix Mode, in which characters slain during one turn are revived on the player's next turn. Another inclusion from Fates includes 'My Castle', a customisable castle that serves as the player's base of operations throughout the game.|$|E
