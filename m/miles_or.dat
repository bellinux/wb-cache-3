5|$|Astronomical {{distances}} {{are sometimes}} expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion <b>miles,</b> <b>or</b> 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10trillion kilometres or nearly 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.|$|E

5|$|Metrorail {{runs from}} the {{northwest}} in Medley through Hialeah, into the city of Miami, the downtown area, through Coral Gables and South Miami, and ending in southwest Miami-Dade at Dadeland Mall. There are 23 accessible Metrorail stations, one about every 1.25 <b>miles</b> (<b>or</b> 1.9 kilometers). Metrorail connects to the Metromover system at Government Center and Brickell stations and to South Florida's Tri-Rail suburban commuter rail system at the Tri-Rail Station (see below).|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides {{was sent}} to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for {{assistance}} before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 <b>miles)</b> <b>or</b> so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, {{in time to see the}} Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E
5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the wilderness area and even those stop after a few <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|She put to sea in late December with 103 Marines to {{reinforce}} their detachment at Johnston Island (about 750 nautical miles—860 <b>miles,</b> <b>or</b> 1,390km—west of Hawaii), and evacuated 47 civilians to Hawaii the following month. A convoy assignment took Mahan to Samoa, where she joined Task Force 17 (including the carrier , two cruisers and five destroyers). The task force carried out raids on Jaluit Atoll, Mili Atoll and Makin Atoll (Butaritari) in the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands. Mahan {{moved on to}} Canton Island in late February 1942, temporarily assigned to offshore patrol duty. By early April, she was at sea with a convoy bound for San Pedro, California. The ship then steamed north to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul, docking on 18 April 1942.|$|E

5|$|The primary (IK Pegasi A) is an A-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{displays}} minor pulsations in luminosity. It is categorized as a Delta Scuti variable star {{and it has}} a periodic cycle of luminosity variation that repeats itself about 22.9 times per day. Its companion (IK Pegasi B) is a massive white dwarf—a star that has evolved past the main sequence and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion. They orbit each other every 21.7 days with an average separation of about 31 million kilometres, or 19 million <b>miles,</b> <b>or</b> 0.21 astronomical units (AU). This is smaller than the orbit of Mercury around the Sun.|$|E
5|$|This line of {{occupation}} of Britain was consolidated {{as one of}} the limites (defensible frontiers) of the empire by its construction. It is a stone fortification built across the width of what is now northern England. The wall was 80 Roman miles (73.5 statute <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> 117 kilometres) long, its width and height dependent on the construction materials which were available nearby. East of the River Irthing the wall was made from squared stone and measured 3metres (9.7ft) wide and 5–6 metres (16–20ft) high, while west of the river the wall was originally made from turf and measured 6metres (20ft) wide and 3.5metres (11.5ft) high; it was subsequently rebuilt in stone. The wall was augmented by various ditches, berms, and forts.|$|E
5|$|With {{the formal}} {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat {{a shortage of}} manpower from wars against the Numidian king Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Soldiers would join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as <b>miles,</b> <b>or</b> soldiers, with the same state purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Safety overall has {{steadily}} improved in the United States for many decades. Between 1920 and 2000, {{the rate of}} fatal automobile accidents per vehicle-mile decreased {{by a factor of}} about 17. Except for a pause during the youth bulge of the 1960s (a time when many young, inexperienced drivers were on the road), progress in reducing fatal accidents has been steady. Safety for other types of U.S. passenger transportation has also improved substantially, but long-term statistical data are not as readily available. While the fatality rate roughly leveled off around 2000–2005 at around 1.5 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled, it has resumed a downward trend and reached 1.27 in 2008. The National Safety Council (whose data methodology differs slightly from the NHTSA) reports a rate (including deaths of pedestrians and cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents) of 1.25 deaths per 100 million vehicle <b>miles</b> (<b>or</b> 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles) traveled in 2016.|$|E
