Horizontal <b>bar</b> <b>training</b> has multiple categories. It is an emphasis for the re-search of related workers that categories of the training and match should be reduced. The application of data mining methods is discussed based {{on the problem of}} reducing categories of horizontal <b>bar</b> <b>training.</b> The BP neural network is applied to the cluster analysis and the principal component analysis, which are used to evaluate horizontal <b>bar</b> <b>training.</b> Two kinds of data mining methods are analyzed from two aspects, namely the operational convenience of data mining and the rationality of results. It turns out that the principal component analysis is more suitable for data processing of horizontal <b>bar</b> <b>training...</b>|$|R

They used many of {{the same}} tools for {{imprinting}} designs in human flesh as they did to create their woodblock prints, including chisels, gouges and, most importantly, unique ink known as Nara ink, or Nara black, the ink that famously turns blue-green under the skin. There is academic debate over who wore these elaborate tattoos. Some scholars say that it was the lower classes who wore—and flaunted—such tattoos. Others claim that wealthy <b>merchants,</b> <b>barred</b> by law from flaunting their wealth, wore expensive irezumi under their clothes.

However, discipline was weak and the members often exceeded their quotas.Well before the 1948 merger with Nord-Est, the products manufactured by Denain-Anzin had slowly diverged from those by the Valenciennes division of Nord-Est, allowing each firm to scale up production in their speciality with reduced competition.For example, the two companies produced the same quantities of girders in 1930, but by 1936 Nord-Est produced six {{times as much as}} Denain-Anzin.After the June 1940 defeat of France during World War II (1939-45), a law of 16 August 1940 created Sidenor, the Groupement des Industries Side-rugiques du Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Denain-Anzin and Nord-Est both came under the control of Sidenor, producing 80% of its steel.|$|R
