40|$|As the {{treatment}} of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) largely depends on self-management, patient compliance and satisfaction, diabetes-specific beliefs and fears need special consideration during <b>medical</b> <b>consultations</b> <b>by</b> means of effective communication. Communication patterns are likely to change through time. For that reason, the first three consultations between 18 newly reffered patients with poorly controlled NIDDM and their medical specialist were videotaped. Subsequently, changes in doctor's and patient's verbal and nonverbal communication behaviours during these 54 consultations were analyzed. Furthermore, an investigation was carried out to distinguish those communication behaviours most strongly related to patient satisfaction. Findings suggest that the first consultation is most important for building an effective doctor-patient relationship, the second for discussing treatment matters, and the third for addressing psychosocial issues. Further research incorporating clinical outcome measures is recommended to determine which were the behaviours with the greatest influence on patient health outcome. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

This study investigated, by means of a validated chronobiological method, whether severe relapses of MS, ones requiring <b>medical</b> specialty <b>consultation,</b> display seasonal differences, and whether they are linked with seasonal differences in local meteorological variables. Results We considered 96 consecutive patients with severe MS relapse (29 men, 67 women, mean age 38. 5 ± 8. 8 years), referred to the Multiple Sclerosis Center, Bellaria Hospital, Bologna, Italy, between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008. Overall, we analyzed 164 relapses (56 in men, 108 in women; 115 in patients aged p = 0. 030).

40|$|Problem Bangladesh has yet {{to develop}} a fully {{integrated}} health information system infrastructure that is critical to guiding policy development and planning. Approach Initial pilot telemedicine and eHealth programmes were not coordinated at national level. However, in 2011, a national eHealth policy was implemented. Local setting Bangladesh has made substantial improvements to its health system. However, the country still faces public health challenges with limited and inequitable access to health services and lack of adequate resources {{to meet the demands}} of the population. Relevant changes In 2008, eHealth services were introduced, including computerization of health facilities at sub-district levels, internet connections, internet servers and an mHealth service for communicating with health-care providers. Health facilities at sub-district levels were provided with internet connections and servers. In 482 upazila health complexes and district hospitals, an mHealth service was set-up where an on-duty doctor is available for patients at all hours to provide <b>consultations</b> <b>by</b> mobile phone. A government operated telemedicine service was initiated and by 2014, 43 fully equipped centres were in service. These centres provide <b>medical</b> <b>consultations</b> <b>by</b> qualified physicians to patients visiting rural and remote community clinics and union health centres. Lessons learnt Despite early pilot interventions and successful implementation, progress in adopting eHealth strategies in Bangladesh has been slow. There is a lack of common standards on information technology for health, which causes difficulties in data management and sharing among different databases. Limited internet bandwidth and the high cost of infrastructure and software development are barriers to adoption of these technologies. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Patient-centered care is an {{emerging}} healthcare model {{that is changing}} how people think about health and about the patients themselves.

However, in spite of the widespread adoption of telemedicine, existing telemedicine applications do not support patient centered-care. In this paper, we present our designed cloud based telemedicine system that supports patient-centered care. It exploits Personal Health Records (PHRs) in sharing patient’s clinical documents, and it manages <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> requests <b>by</b> exploiting a <b>Consultation</b> ontology.

40|$|Background: <b>Medical</b> {{peri-operative}} <b>consultation</b> {{plays an}} important role in the practice of the internist. It represents 13 - 33 % of the total <b>consultation</b> done <b>by</b> the internist. The value of preoperative <b>consultation</b> <b>by</b> the internist is still unclear and the place of the consultations is under discussion. Methods: Consecutive <b>medical</b> <b>consultations</b> - <b>by</b> internist-intensivists from the surgical ICU - of 408 patients in the department of Surgery of the University Hospital Groningen were retrospectively analyzed, with specific attention to the consultation request, the consultation report and the outcome of the consultation. Results: The main problems were cardiac (34 %) or pulmonary (20 %). In 78 % well defined questions about the patients were asked and in 29 % of the preoperative requests, thr requesting surgeon asked specific advice about diagnosis and management. In 49 % the requesting physician asked for an 'evaluation' of the patients. Of all consultations 271 (67 %) were preoperative consultations. In 12 % the findings of the preoperative consultation had a significant impact on the course of the patient, whereas in 7 % of the preoperative requests the operation was postponed. The consulting internist recommended in 2 % to cancel the operation for this admission, which was shared by the surgeon and anesthesiologist. In 10 % of all cases new diseases or processes were diagnosed, or were found not to be treated adequately before consultation, so the diagnosis or management was changed. Conclusions: Our data show that (semi-) elective <b>consultations</b> <b>by</b> internists at the department of Surgery, on indication of the surgeon, changes the course of a significant percentage of patients.

40|$|Introduction: Osteoporosis {{presenting}} as low-impact fractures to traumatology units {{is often}} undiagnosed and under-treated. Results from the Osteocare study in Lausanne (a nurse based intervention, passive pathway) showed that only 19 % of patients received management for osteoporosis, {{and in the}} literature [1], the rate is between 10 - 25 %. We have evaluated a different management concept, based on the systematic assessment of patients with osteoporotic fractures during and after hospitalization (active pathway). Methods: Inpatients admitted to the Department of Musculoskeletal Medicine for a fragility fracture were identified by a nurse according to a predefined questionnaire and were then clinically evaluated by a doctor. Based on the results, a management plan was proposed to the patients. Patients could choose between follow up either by their GP or by the Centre of Bone Disease of the CHUV. For patients who chose follow-up in our Centre, we assessed their adherence to medical follow-up 1 year inclusion. The results of patients who had been evaluated in our cohort between the 1 November 2008 and the 1 December 2009 were analysed. Results: 573 inpatients received specific management of their osteoporotic fracture over 18 months. The mean age was 77 y (31 - 99), 81 % were women (203 hip fractures, 40 pelvis fractures, 101 arm fractures, 57 vertebral fractures, 63 ankle fractures, and 25 others sites). During the study period, 303 patients received a proposition of a specific treatment. 39 (13 %) chose a follow up with the GP, 19 (6 %) dead and 245 (81 %) preferred a follow up in our Centre. After 1 year, 166 (67 %) patients are under follow up in our outpatient clinic. Conclusion: With an active clinical pathway that starts during the hospitalization, consisting on a nursing evaluation followed <b>by</b> a <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>by</b> an expert in osteoporosis, the adherence increased from 19 % to 67 % in terms of follow up.

MethodsProspective study including 100 newborns with risk factors for CP (relying on gestational age, birth weight, perinatal and neonatal brain injuries). The screening was conducted during a <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>by</b> a specialist and was based on clinical setting (neurological examination and neuromotor assessment) and radiological examination (cranial ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging). The clinical assessment was performed at the 1 st, 4 th, 9 th, 12 th, 18 th, 24 th months and at 5 years after selection of patients. ResultsThe different clinical factors were weak predictors of becoming during {{the first month of}} life. At 4 months, the factors correlated with the evolution to cerebral palsy were: the decrease of lower limbs’ spontaneous movements and the lower limb fixed in extension at suspension maneuvers (P< 0. 001), Babinski sign (P< 0. 001), as well as absence of an ulnar-palmar grip (P< 0. 01). At 9 months, we found more predictive signs of the evolution to CP, particularly the head holding problems (P< 0. 001), the absence of acquisition of sitting position (P< 0. 001), the absence of precision grip (P< 0. 001), the deficit of uprising the lower limbs, of hip abduction, of extension of the knee in the lateral inclinations and drawn-seated (P< 0. 001), hyperreflexia (P= 0. 004) and the Babinski sign (P< 0. 001). At 12, 15 and 18 months, neurological examination showed a peripheral hypertonia in 62 % of children. At 24 months, peripheral hypertonia is found only in 43 % of cases. 38 % of children had an adequate level of psychomotor development and a normal neurological examination hence the diagnosis of transient motor abnormalities (TMA) was retained. For imaging, normal cranial ultrasound was significantly more associated with TMA than CP (P< 0. 001). DiscussionNeurological examination focusing on reflexes and muscle tone is poorly predictive in the first months of life. Neuromotor assessment with the study of spontaneous movements may reflect functional limitations in the first months of life and have been shown to predict later CP. However, the distinction between CP and TMA remains difficult and requires a long follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{anticoagulant}} (OAC) {{therapy is}} currently gaining special importance {{due to the}} significant spread of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the population (especially in older age groups). The use of OAC in AF has an extensive evidence base, which confirms {{a significant decrease in}} the number of strokes and total mortality in the context of anticoagulation therapy (ACT) in AF. Currently, the "gold standard" of the OAC is warfarin, which has proved effectiveness in all categories of patients with AF. A whole group  of new OAC (NOAC) also appeared. In Russia, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban have been registered. All NOAC were studied in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in comparison with warfarin, mainly in patients with non-valvular AF, therefore, in valvular AF, as well as in patients with severe renal failure, warfarin remains the drug of choice. Advantages of warfarin in comparison with NOAC are the presence of known  antidote and standardized indicator of the efficacy and safety of the anticoagulation therapy – International Normalized Ratio (INR), as well as low price of the drug. The leading problem in the treatment of warfarin is the complexity and, at the same time, a strong  need to maintain INR within the therapeutic "window" of at least 60 % of the treatment time. Obviously, the optimal solution to this problem is the possibility of self-testing of this indicator by the patient himself and,  probably, the ability to adjust the dosage of warfarin independently, to achieve the necessary values of INR (self-management) or titrate the dose with the help of a <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>by</b> phone (self-monitoring). To date, several devices have been developed for self-monitoring of anticoagulation therapy – coagulometers. Their use leads to a {{decrease in the number of}} thromboembolic complications, and from the results of some RCTs – to a decrease in the number of large bleedings and total mortality, and to improve the quality of life of AF patients who  need  constant anticoagulation therapy. The high economic efficiency of using coagulometers has  also been  confirmed. Coagulometer CoaguChek  (Roche, Switzerland) has the largest evidence base for self-monitoring of INR and its impact on the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation therapy. </p...|$|R

All of the characteristics together explained 26. 0 % of the attributions by the GPs. More psychosocially-attributed fatigue was found to correlate with <b>consultations</b> characterized <b>by</b> less physical examination, more diagnostic procedures to reassure, fewer diagnostic procedures to discover underlying pathology, more counselling, less medical treatment, less prescription and a longer duration than consultations with more somatically attributed fatigue. It is concluded that GPs do not discriminate between social groups when attributing fatigue to either somatic or psychosocial causes. The presence and character of other complaints and underlying diseases/problems, rather, relate to the GPs' somatic-psychosocial attributions, which are then associated with particular aspects of the consultation.
