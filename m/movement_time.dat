The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 54 A, 1049 - 1068. The implicit benefit of learning without errors. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 54 A, 1049 - 1068] suggested that, following unsuccessful movements, the learner forms hypotheses about the probable {{causes of the}} error and the required movement adjustments necessary for its elimination. Hypothesis testing is an explicit process that places demands on cognitive resources. Demands on cognitive resources can be identified by measuring probe reaction <b>times</b> (PRT) and <b>movement</b> <b>times.</b> Lengthened PRT and <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> reflects increased cognitive demands. Thus, PRT and <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> should be longer following errors, relative to successful, movements. This hypothesis was tested using a motor skill (golf putting). Furthermore, the association between error processing and the preparation and execution phases of movement was examined. The data confirmed that cognitive demand is greater for trials following an error, relative to trials without an error. This effect was apparent throughout learning and in both the preparatory and execution phases of the movement. Cognitive effort also appeared to be higher during movement preparation, relative to movement execution. © 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|One {{possible}} way of haptically perceiving length is to trace {{a path with}} one’s index finger and estimate the distance traversed. Here, we present an experiment in which observers judge the lengths of paths across cylindrically curved surfaces. We found that convex and concave surfaces had qualitatively different effects: convex lengths were overestimated, whereas concave lengths were underestimated. In addition, we observed that the index finger moved more slowly across the convex surface than across the concave one. As a result, <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> for convex lengths were longer. The considerable correlation between <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> and length estimates suggests that observers take the duration of movement as their primary measure of perceived length, but disregard movement speeds.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} impact of {{exercise}} and virtual reality (VR) on the cognitive rehabilitation of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: Before-after trial assessed cognitive function after a 4 -week intervention program. A random allocation crossover assessed changes in reaction and <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> after a single bout of VR exercise and a no-exercise control condition. Setting: Brain injury rehabilitation unit in Edinburgh, Scotland. Patients: (1) Four-week intervention: a consecutive sample of 13 suitable TBI adults were compared to control populations (n > 25) of previous TBI patients of similar age, severity, and time postinjury. (2) Single-bout intervention: a consecutive sample of 13 suitable adults with moderate TBI, 6. 29 to 202. 86 weeks postinjury. Intervention: Nonimmersive VR exercise. Main Outcome Measures: (1) Tests of attention, information processing, learning, and memory. (2) Reaction and <b>movement</b> <b>times.</b> Results: After the 4 -week intervention patients performed significantly better than controls on the digit symbol (p <. 01), verbal (p <. 01), and visual learning tasks (p <. 05). Significant improvements in reaction times (p <. 01) and <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> (p <. 05) were gained following a single bout of VR exercise.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} if focusing attention externally produced faster <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> compared to instructions that focused attention internally or a control set of instructions that did not explicitly focus attention when performing an agility task. A second purpose of the study was to measure participants’ focus of attention during practice by use of a questionnaire. Participants (N = 20) completed 15 trials of an agility L run following instructions designed to induce an external (EXT), internal (INT) attentional focus or a control (CON) set of instructions inducing no specific focus of attention. Analysis revealed when participants followed the EXT instructions they had significantly faster <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> compared to when they followed the INT and CON set of instructions; consistent with previous research the INT and CON <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> were not significantly different from each other. Qualitative data showed when participants were in the external condition they focused externally 67 % of the time. When they were in the internal condition they focused internally 76 % of the time, and when they were in the control condition they did not use an internal or external focus of attention 77 % of the time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} trunk and knee strength in practitioners of hard-style martial arts. An additional objective was to examine reaction times in these participants by measuring simple reaction times (SRT), choice reaction <b>times</b> (CRT) and <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> (MT). Thirteen high-level martial artists and twelve sedentary participants were tested under isokinetic and isometric conditions on an isokinetic dynamometer. Response and <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> were also measured in response to simple and choice auditory cues. Results indicated that the martial arts group generated a greater body-weight adjusted peak torque with both legs at all speeds during isokinetic extension and flexion, and in isometric extension but not flexion. In isokinetic and isometric trunk flexion and extension, martial artists tended to have higher peak torques than controls, but they were not significantly different (p > 0. 05). During the SRT and CRT tasks the martial artists were no quicker in lifting their hand off a button in response to the stimulus [reaction time (RT) ] but were significantly faster in moving to press another button [movement time (MT) ]. In conclusion, the results reveal that training in a martial art increases the strength of both the flexors and extensors of the leg. Furthermore, they have faster <b>movement</b> <b>times</b> to auditory stimuli. These results are consistent with the physical aspects of the martial art...|$|R
50|$|Elementary {{cognitive}} tasks (ECTs) also correlate {{strongly with}} g. ECTs are, {{as the name}} suggests, simple tasks that apparently require very little intelligence, but still correlate strongly with more exhaustive intelligence tests. Determining whether a light is red or blue and determining whether there are four or five squares drawn {{on a computer screen}} are two examples of ECTs. The answers to such questions are usually provided by quickly pressing buttons. Often, in addition to buttons for the two options provided, a third button is held down {{from the start of the}} test. When the stimulus is given to the subject, they remove their hand from the starting button to the button of the correct answer. This allows the examiner to determine how much time was spent thinking about the answer to the question (reaction time, usually measured in small fractions of second), and how much time was spent on physical hand movement to the correct button (<b>movement</b> <b>time).</b> Reaction time correlates strongly with g, while <b>movement</b> <b>time</b> correlates less strongly.ECT testing has allowed quantitative examination of hypotheses concerning test bias, subject motivation, and group differences. By virtue of their simplicity, ECTs provide a link between classical IQ testing and biological inquiries such as fMRI studies.|$|E
