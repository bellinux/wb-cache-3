40|$|Abstract. In large {{software}} projects often multiple modeling {{languages are}} used in order to cover the different domains and views of the application and the lan-guage skills of the developers appropriately. Such “multi-modeling ” raises many methodological and semantical questions, ranging from semantic consistency of the models written in different sublanguages to the correctness of model transfor-mations between the sublanguages. We provide a first formal basis for answer-ing such questions by proposing semantically well-founded notions of a <b>multi-modeling</b> language and of semantic correctness for model transformations. In our approach, a <b>multi-modeling</b> language consists {{of a set of}} sublanguages and syntax of the sublanguages is given by MOF meta-models. The semantics of a <b>multi-modeling</b> language is given by associating an institution, i. e., an appropri-ate logic, to each of its sublanguages.

40|$|AbstractModels, created using {{different}} modeling techniques, usually serve different purposes and provide unique insights. While each modeling technique might {{be capable of}} answering specific questions, complex problems require multiple models interoperating to complement/supplement each other; we call this <b>Multi-Modeling.</b> This Multi- Modeling approach for solving complex problems is full of syntactic and semantic challenges. In this paper, a systematic methodology for addressing <b>Multi-Modeling</b> problems is presented. The approach is domain specific: Identification of the domain and the supporting modeling techniques is the first step. Then a new Domain Specific <b>Multi-Modeling</b> Workflow Language supported with a Domain Ontology is used to construct the workflow that defines the interoperation of the selected models. The Domain Ontology provides semantic guidance to effect valid model interoperation. The approach is illustrated using a case study from the Drug Interdiction and Intelligence domain. The Joint Inter-Agency Task Force (JIATF) -South, an agency well known for interagency cooperation and intelligence fusion, receives huge amounts of disparate data regarding drug smuggling efforts. Analysis of such data using various modeling techniques is essential in identifying best Courses of Action (COAs). The proposed methodology is illustrated by creating workflows of model interoperations involving Social Networks, Timed Influence Nets, Organization Structures and Geospatial models...|$|R

5000|$|The idea of <b>multi-model</b> {{databases}} can {{be traced}} back to Object-Relational Data Management Systems (ORDBMS) in the early 1990s and in a more broader scope even to federated and integrated DBMSs in the early 1980s. An ORDBMS system manages different types of data such as relational, object, text and spatial by plugging domain specific data types, functions and index implementations into the DBMS kernels. A <b>Multi-model</b> database is most directly a response to the [...] "polyglot persistence" [...] approach of knitting together multiple database products, each handing a different model, to achieve a <b>multi-model</b> capability as described by Martin Fowler. This strategy has two major disadvantages: it leads to a significant increase in operational complexity, and there is no support for maintaining data consistency across the separate data stores, so <b>multi-model</b> databases have begun to fill in this gap.|$|E

In this paper, the design methods of both proportional integral observers and unknown inputs observers for descriptor <b>multi-models</b> are described in detail. Sufficient conditions of stability analysis and gain matrices determination are per-formed by resolving a set of Linear Matrices Inequalities (LMIs). The design method offers all the degrees of design free-dom, which can be utilized to achieve various desired system specifications and performances and, thus, has great poten-tials in applications.

In this paper we provide an implementable formal algorithm for knowledge base equivalence verification based on the formal definition of knowledge base proposed by Plotkin B. and Plotkin T., and study some important properties of automorphic equivalence of models. We also describe the concept of equivalence and formulate the criterion for the equivalence of knowledge bases defined over finite models. Further we define <b>multi-models</b> and automorphic equivalence of models and <b>multi-models,</b> that is generalization of automorphic equivalence of algebras. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

40|$|Models {{developed}} {{using different}} modeling languages {{but the same}} data provide different insights of the human terrain. Interoperation of such models, i. e., <b>multi-modeling,</b> can produce a more robust modeling and simulation capability to support operational commanders or intelligence analysts. The C 2 Wind Tunnel is a platform that enables <b>multi-modeling</b> and the conduct of simulations and computational experiments. However, to establish that the interoperation of the models is valid, meta-modeling analysis is required. An approach using concept maps is described and then is illustrated through application to a human terrain example. No single model can capture the complexities of human behavior especially when interactions among groups with diverse social and cultural attributes are concerned. Each modeling language offers unique insights and makes specific assumptions about the domain being modeled.

Checking and maintaining consistency of information captured in such <b>multi-modeling</b> environments is known to be challenging. In this paper we describe an approach to systematically synchronize <b>multi-models.</b> The approach specifically addresses the problem of synchronizing business processes and domain models in a Service-oriented Architecture development environment. In the approach, the human effort required to synchronize independently developed models is supplemented with significant automated support. This process is used to identify concept divergences, that is, a concept in one model which cannot be matched with concepts in the other model. We automate the propagation of divergence resolution decisions across the conflicting models. We illustrate the approach using models developed for a Car Crash Crisis Management System (CCCMS), a case study problem used to assess Aspect-oriented Modeling approaches...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNonlinear {{dynamical}} systems {{identification and}} behavior prediction are di cult problems encountered {{in many areas}} of industrial applications such as fault diagnosis and prognosis. In practice, the analytical description of a nonlinear system directly from observed data is a very challenging task because of the the too large number of the related parameters to be estimated. As a solution, <b>multi-modeling</b> approaches have lately been applied and consist in dividing the operating range of the system under study into di erent operating regions easier to describe by simpler functions to be combined. In order to take into consideration the uncertainty related to the available data as well as the uncertainty resulting from the nonlinearity of the system, evidence theory is of particular interest, because it permits the explicit modeling of doubt and ignorance. In the context of <b>multi-modeling,</b> information of doubt may be exploited to properly segment the data and take into account the uncertainty in the transitions between the operating regions. Recently, the Evidential Evolving Gustafson-Kessel algorithm (E 2 GK) has been proposed to ensure an online partitioning of the data into clusters that correspond to operating regions. Based on E 2 GK, a <b>multi-modeling</b> approach called E 2 GKpro is introduced in this paper, which dynamically performs the estimation of the local models by upgrading and modifying their parameters while data arrive. The proposed algorithm is tested on several datasets and compared to existing approaches. The results show that the use of virtual centroids in E 2 GKpro account for its robustness to noise and generating less operating regions while ensuring precise predictions...|$|R
