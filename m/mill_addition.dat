40|$|Nutritive Value Of Chestnut Fruit (Anacardium Occidentale) Silage In Combination With Various Levels Of Cassava <b>Mill</b> <b>Addition</b> and Length Of Fermentation Time As Feed. The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to evaluate nutritive value of chestnut fruit silage in combination with various levels of casava <b>mill</b> <b>addition</b> and length of fermentation time. This research was conducted in 2 treatment factors with 3 replication. The I factor are : Various level of casava mill e. i. L 1 : 0 %, L 2 : 3 %, L 3 : 6 % and L 4 : 9 %, and the II factor are length of fermentation time e. i W 1 : 20 days, W 2 : 40 days and W 3 : 60 days. The result showed that silage technonogy manifestly (P< 0, 05) with various casava mill level and fermentation time can increase nutritive value chestnut fruit. Higher organic mater percen at 0 % casava mill with fermentation time of 20 days (97, 94 %). Higher ash percen at 0 % casava mill with fermentation time of 40 days (97, 94 %), and at 3 % casava mill with fermentation time of 60 days (3, 67 %). Higher crude fiber at 9 % casava mill with fermentation time of 60 days (7, 19 %) and low at 0 % casava mill with fermentation time of 20 days (6, 29 %). Higher extract ether at 3 % casava mill with fermentation time of 40 days (3, 73 %) and at 6 % casava mill with fermentation time of 40 days (3, 38 %).

40|$|Physical Quality of cashew (Anacardium occidentale) {{pseudocarp}} (the pear-shaped {{fruit of}} the cashew) Silage in Combination with Various Levels of Cassava <b>Mill</b> <b>Addition</b> and Length of Fermentation. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate physical quality of cashew pseudocarp silage in combination with various levels of cassava <b>mill</b> <b>addition</b> and length of fermentation. This study was designed with a factorial completely randomized design in two treatment factors with three replications. The first factor was various level of cassava mill i. e. L 1 : 0 %, L 2 : 3 %, L 3 : 6 %, and L 4 : 9 %, and the second factor was length of fermentation i. e. W 1 : 20 days, W 2 : 40 days and W 3 : 60 days. The result showed that the cassava mill levels {{and the length of}} fermentation did not affected to the damage and decrease level of cashew pseudocarp silage (P> 0. 05) but it affected to the level of acidity (P> 0. 01). The physical quality of cashew pseudocarp silage was very good with the damage level average was 1. 19 %, and the decrease level average was 6. 87 %. The level of acidity ranged from 3. 72 to 4. 14. The lowest acidity level was at L 4 W 1 (3. 72) and the highest one was at L 2 W 2 (4. 14) with the average of acidity was 3. 93. Thus, it can be concluded that the best physical quality of cashew pseudocarp silage was at 9 % level of cassava mill with 60 days of fermentation length. However, all treatment combinations of cassava mill level and fermentation length produced high physical quality of silage...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{studies on}} {{synthesis}} of nanocrystalline elements {{have discussed the}} effect of ball milling on lattice parameter, crystallite size, and micro-strain. For elemental milled powders, the anisotropic peak broadening does not change with increasing milling time. However, the effect of alloying addition on the anisotropic behavior of ball milled nanocrystalline powders remains an unexplored area. Here we report the effect of chromium and aluminum addition on the anisotropic behavior of iron in nanocrystalline Fe- 20 Cr- 5 Al (wt%) alloy powders synthesized by ball milling. The experimental {{results show that the}} anisotropic behavior of iron changes towards isotropic with milling. This change was also correlated to the theoretically calculated anisotropic factor from the change in elastic constant of iron due to <b>milling.</b> <b>Addition</b> of alloying elements exhibited a monotonic rise in the lattice parameter with crystallite size, which was attributed to the excess grain boundary interfacial energy and excess free volume at grain boundaries. Transmission electron microscopy image confirmed the crystallite size and nature of dislocation obtained using modified Williamson-Hall method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} work is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of one of the industrially most popular grinding aids (triethanolamine, TEA) on grindability, set and strength behavior of Portland cement in laboratory ball and vibrating disk mills when added at the same amount of 0. 06 % by the weight of the cement. The results show that TEA is more effective in ball mill than in vibrating disk mill. It increases the Blaine specific surface area of the mixtures of 95 % clinker and 5 % gypsum by 16 and 7. 6 % in ball and vibrating disk mills, respectively, compared to the blank test. The cement samples produced from the two mills were then tested for their initial and final setting times, spread diameter as a consistency measure and compressive strengths after 3, 7 and 28 days of curing.
