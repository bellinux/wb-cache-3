40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the potential <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticizers,</b> plastic components and additives and alkylphenols from several water plastic bottles. Compounds under study were phthalates (dimethyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, benzylbutyl phthalate, bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate), bis(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate, octylphenol, 4 -nonylphenol and bisphenol A. Polycarbonate (PC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) plastics used in the water bottling sector were tested using three kinds of total or specific migration tests: i) standard method UNE-EN ISO 177; ii) ultrasonic forced extraction extraction and iii) standard method UNE-UNE-EN 1186 EN 13130 - 1. In addition, bottled waters of different plastic material were analyzed to determine the potential <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticizers</b> and alkylphenolstarget compounds in real conditions. In all cases, samples were solid phase extracted using Oasis HLB 200 mg cartridges and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in a scan acquisition mode.

The migration of phthalate plasticizers from plasticized PVC to several petroleum oils was studied quantitatively by a method based on labelled plasticizers and measurements of the radioactivity of the medium. The results are compared with those obtained by methods of radioactivity and weight loss; differences are discussed. In most cases, the migration of plasticizer is accompanied by diffusion of oil into the polymer. The effects of the following factors on the migration process were examined: (a) the nature of petroleum oil; (b) {{the nature of the}} phthalate plasticizer; (c) the amount of plasticizer; (d) the plasticization process; (e) the temperature; and (f) the time. © 1975...|$|E

40|$|Plasticizer {{migration}} studies {{dealing with}} poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) sheets and liquid surrounding media revealed two parallel phenomena, <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticizer</b> and liquid penetration, {{that take place}} simultaneously. The present work was focused on correlating the structural differences of the PVC material with the aforementioned processes. The plasticizer and the liquid medium used were dioctyl phthalate and isopropanol, respectively. Emphasis was placed on any rearrangement of the polymer morphology occurring when elevated test temperatures were employed for a relatively {{long period of time}} (crystallization). The result was that the PVC structure seemed to become more compact, forcing the liquid medium that had already penetrated to come out. Furthermore, these experiments showed that plasticizer migration and liquid penetration were related to the polymer structure. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo set {{of single}} core cables with PVC {{insulation}} with different decreases of electrical resistivity have been analyzed {{to determine the}} aging mechanism responsible for this decrease of electrical properties. Four different aging mechanisms can be considered: oxidation, effect of water ingress, loss or <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticizers</b> and dehydrochlorination. IR spectroscopy has not revealed any oxidation nor the presence or the effect of water. IR microspectroscopy has confirmed the uniform composition of the polymer throughout the sample. SEM and EDX analyses have highlighted clusters of lead chloride. The presence of this compound results from {{the reaction of the}} thermal stabilizer due to the mechanism of dehydrochlorination. However, these techniques did not distinguish between the two samples of different resistivity. UV spectroscopy revealed the presence of double bonds in the two samples and show that the concentration is higher in the cable with the worse electrical properties. The formation of double bonds is a consequence of the dehydrochlorination and cannot result from one of the three other aging mechanisms considered. Although the measurement of chloride ion concentrations by coulometry should have confirmed this aging mechanism, the surprisingly low measured levels of chloride ions are discussed with regards to the adequacy of the method to measure lead chloride in cluster forms...|$|E
40|$|The {{migration}} of plastic components or additives from packaging to food {{can produce a}} risk for human health, in fact many of these plasticizers and additives are "Endocrine Distruptors", such as phthalates (PAEs), alkylphenols (APs), 2, 2 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) propane (bisphenol A or BPA) and di(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate (DENA). The evaluation of some PAEs, some APs, BPA and DEHA levels in common food packaging (oil and natural tuna cans, marmalade cap, yogurt packaging, polystyrene dish, teat, bread bag, film, baby's bottle, aseptic plastic laminate paperboard carton and plastic wine top) {{was carried out by}} migration tests. Furthermore to evaluate the potential <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticizers</b> and additives from plastic wine tops, two extraction methods were used, one through incubation at 40 degrees C for 10 days and one by ultrasounds extraction. The simulants employed were distilled water, acetic acid at 3 %, ethanol at 15 % for wine top. The food simulant was extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by GC-MS. Comparing these results with EU restrictions all samples showed contaminant migration lower than SML and OML established. Finally, about the comparison of two extraction methods, the extraction carried out for 10 days at 40 degrees C may be better than the other one in order to detect all compounds.

Nevertheless, <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticizer</b> causes severe {{variation of the}} mechanical performance of the end-products. In this work the common system plasticized PVC /di-octyl-phthalate /rigid PVC was studied under two-sided diffusion conditions, i. e. from a thin sheet of plasticized PVC to two sheets of rigid PVC, each in contact with {{one side of the}} plasticized sheet.

It was proved that the Fick's law approximation for short times can be used to describe the migration kinetics for this solid/solid system. On the other hand, macroscopic observations revealed that no plasticizer was accumulated at the interface, i. e. all plasticizer leaving the plasticized sheet entered the rigid ones.

40|$|The {{development}} of biodegradable polymers from renewable resources is of importance {{in order to}} prevent the depletion of fossil fuels and the increasing emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere caused by the commodity plastics of today. However, to be able to replace these non-environmentally friendly materials, production costs of biodegradable polymers have to be decreased and their physical properties need to be enhanced. This research has been devoted to poly (lactic acid), PLA; a biodegradable, semicrystalline thermoplastic that can be produced from renewable resources. The main focus was to overcome the inherent problem of brittleness in PLA in order to enable it for potential use in the packaging material industry. Blending PLA with suitable plasticizers in order to enhance its flexibility has been the explored route and obtaining sufficiently compatible blends {{in order to prevent}} phase separation and migration has been an important issue when modifying the physical properties of the polymer. It was found that the presence <b>of</b> <b>plasticizers</b> in the PLA matrix contributed to a more complete crystallization of the polymer because of the increased chain mobility {{as a consequence of the}} depressed glass transition temperature, Tg. The more efficient the plasticizer, the larger the decrement in Tg and, thus, the faster the aging process leading to phase separation and <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plasticizer.</b> It is clear that there exists a competition between the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>plasticizer</b> and the speed of the aging/cold crystallization in the material and it is imperative to find an optimum where the Tg is as low as possible without the plasticized material cold crystallizing too fast. Low molecular weight plasticizers, such as tributyl citrate, TbC, and diethyl bishydroxymethyl malonate, DBM, drastically decreased the Tg of PLA and the extent of the decrement was larger with an increasing amount <b>of</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> However, the blends were not stable over time since rapid cold crystallization caused a size reduction of the amorphous domains in PLA. Consequently, the ability of PLA to accommodate the plasticizer diminished with the increase in crystallinity and <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plasticizer</b> occurred. Increasing the molecular weight <b>of</b> the <b>plasticizers</b> by synthesizing oligoesters and olidoesteramides resulted in blends that displayed Tg depressions slightly smaller than with the low molecular weight plasticizers. The compatibility with PLA was dependent on the molecular weight of the oligomer and on the presence or not of polar amide groups that were able to positively interact with the PLA chains. Simulating current storage conditions in the packaging industry by aging the materials at ambient temperature revealed that cold crystallization did not take place in the films since the temperature was kept below the Tg:s of the blends. Thereby the enhanced flexibility in the plasticized films could be maintained...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} approaches to avoid <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticizer</b> from PVC material is to covalently attach the plasticizer to the polymer. In this thesis the plasticizers are attached to PVC using (2 + 3) azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions. In the first approach, PVC was modified by covalently linking triazole anologue {{of the most}} common phthalate plasticizer di(2 -ethylhexyl phthalate) (DEHP). Copper-free azide-alkyne (2 + 3) cycloaddition reaction of PVC-azide with electron-poor acetylene dicarboxylate is utilized to modify PVC. The glass transition temperature of the modified PVC was lower than the glass transition temperature of the unmodified PVC indicating successful plasticization. The derivatives of DEHP are covalently bonded to PVC using either thermal or copper-catalyzed (2 + 3) azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Two DEHP derivatives bearing a tether ending with a terminal alkyne were synthesized and covalently bonded to PVC. The derivative with ether-alkyne undergoes cycloaddition with PVC-azide under copper-catalyzed conditions whereas ester-alkyne derivative undergoes Huisgen thermal cycloaddition. The investigation of glass transition temperatures of these modified PVC samples indicate that the ether-alkyne derivative is more efficient in imparting plasticization to PVC compared to ester-alkyne derivative. Although bulk of this thesis work is on the plasticization of PVC, a part of this thesis deals with the synthesis and spin-trapping properties of polymer-supported trifluoromethylated cyclic nitrones for the detection of free radicals on the aerosol particles. Polystyrene tethered with fluorinated nitrone spin-trap is used as a solid phase in the continuous flow NMR and EPR study of free radicals. Three fluorinated alkoxyamine initiators are synthesized and used to study the effect of adding carbon dioxide-philic fluorinated fragment in the nitroxide-mediated precipitation polymerizations of styrene in supercritical carbon dioxide. Two alkoxyamines have fluorinated functional handles built on the nitroxide part of the alkoxyamine whereas the third initiator has fluorinated functional handle on the benzyl-initiating fragment of the alkoxyamine. The partitioning of fluorinated nitroxide derivatives in supercritical carbon dioxide impacts on the controlled/living character and broadening of the molecular weight distributions but does not have any significant effect on the rate of precipitation polymerization in supercritical carbon dioxide...|$|R

The ARMED 1 project aims to assess the <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> these <b>plasticizers</b> from medical devices and therefore the level of exposure in patients. For the first task of the project, eight methods were developed to directly detect and quantify the plasticizers in the PVC matrix of the MDs.

40|$|International audienceThe {{unsteady}} diffusion equation in a {{tube and}} the advection/diffusion equation in laminar flow in a liquid of a solute are theoretically established. The most important parameters are the migration strength α {{and the so-called}} Graetz number Gr. The former dimen-sionless number {{is the product of}} the partition coefficient of the solute at the solid/liquid interface, the ratio of the tube thickness to the interior radius and the ratio of diffusion coefficients of the solute in the liquid and in the solid. The Graetz number Gr is the ratio of the diffusion time scale in the liquid based on the interior radius of the pipe to the advection time over the tube length. The problem is applied to the plasticizer migration from a polyvinyl chloride material to a liquid with the safety food applications in mind. The <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plasticizer</b> is solved numerically for various tube sizes, flow conditions and partition coefficients <b>of</b> the <b>plasticizer</b> in the liquid.

The average plasticizer concentration in the liquid behaves following two main regimes as a function <b>of</b> the <b>migration</b> strength. When α is much smaller than one, the average plasticizer concentration in the liquid is an algebraic function of the axial coordinate, z, at the power two third and increases linearly with time. Conversely, when α is much larger than one, the average plasticizer concentration is linear as a function of axial distance and increases {{as a function of the}} square root of time. Moreover, the concentration is much smaller of few orders of magnitude in dynamic condition than in static working showing that in the context of food contamination the dynamic approach is more appropriate and relevant for demonstration of compliance with the safety authorities requirements...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{potential}} of kafirin (sorghum prolamin protein) films, up until now {{there has been no}} in-depth investigation on the plasticization of kafirin films, similar to that done on zein films. Since protein films tend to be very brittle, plasticization is a very important aspect. Cast films were produced from kafirin and plasticized with different combinations <b>of</b> <b>plasticizers</b> (glycerol (G), polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) and lactic acid (LA)) according to a rotatable central composite statistical design. The effects <b>of</b> the different <b>plasticizer</b> combinations on the film properties (tensile-, Tg-, moisture and oxygen barrier properties), were investigated through a series of tests performed on the films. Plasticization of kafirin films was investigated further by determining the effect of an emulsifier, diacetyl tartaric ester of monoglyceride (DATEM) and an acidulant, glucono-_-lactone (GDL) on the films. To investigate the distribution and <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plasticizers</b> in kafirin films, the films were studied by light microscopy. It was clear that G, PEG and LA together were necessary to plasticize kafirin films. G and PEG were found to be effective plasticizers, leading to a decrease in film strength and an increase in strain as the plasticizer amount increased. LA was, however, found to act rather as a solvent for kafirin during film casting, instead of acting as a plasticizer. An increase in plasticizer content also brought about a lowering in the Tg of the films, as well as an increase in film permeability to water vapour and oxygen. G and PEG were found to attract water from the atmosphere, which proved to be very influential on the properties of the films; the more plasticizer present in the film, the more moisture attracted, the greater the effect on the film properties. DATEM was not found to be a plasticizer for kafirin films. However, GDL did bring about changes in film properties, similar to G and PEG. It caused film strength to decrease and film strain to increase, but with less detrimental effects on the moisture barrier properties of kafirin films. Microscopy showed that the plasticizer migrated over time, apparently leading to plasticizer molecule coalescence, and the formation <b>of</b> <b>plasticizer</b> pools. The <b>plasticizer</b> combination <b>of</b> G, PEG and LA improved the qualities of kafirin films, reducing film brittleness, but it is not an ideal plasticizer combination {{due to the fact that}} it attracts water to the film and it is not stable over time. Moisture is another plasticizer to be taken into account, since it will be absorbed by the plasticizers in high relative humidity areas and will have an additional plasticizing effect on films properties. GDL proved to have potential as a kafirin film plasticizer as it affected the barrier properties of the films less. Further research is recommended into the plasticization mechanism of GDL.

Gamma irradiation at pasteurizing (5 kGy) and sterilizing (15, 25 kGy) doses produced an increasing trend in equilibrium <b>migration</b> value <b>of</b> DEHA (PVC) in aqueous solvents (40 oC) by 1, 4 - 1, 6 times (distilled water), 1, 7 - 1, 8 times (10 % ethanol) and 2, 1 - 2, 4 times (3 % acetic acid). Likewise, gamma irradiation at doses of 15 and 25 kGy contributed in an increase in equilibrium <b>migration</b> value <b>of</b> ATBC (PVC) into the aqueous solvents by 1, 2 - 1, 3 times and 1, 3 - 1, 5 times respectively. The most aggressive simulant seemed to be 3 % aqueous acetic acid for DEHA and 10 % aqueous ethanol for ATBC. In the case of aqueous simulants the losses of adipate (< 0, 5 %), as well as citrate (< 4, 0 %) from PVC were low. Gamma irradiation at doses of 5, 15 and 25 kGy did not induce a significant increase in equilibrium <b>migration</b> value <b>of</b> ATBC (saran) into the aqueous solvents. The loss from the copolymer did not exceed 1, 5 % and the highest concentrations of citrate were observed in 10 % aqueous ethanol. ...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel and hydrotreated {{vegetable}} oil (HVO) are currently viewed by the transportation sector as the most viable alternative fuels to replace petroleum-based fuels. The use of biodiesel has, however, been limited by the deteriorative effect of biodiesel on rubber parts in automobile fuel systems. This work therefore aimed at investigating the degradation of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) and fluoroelastomers (FKM) on exposure to biodiesel and HVO at different temperatures and oxygen concentrations in an automated ageing equipment and a high-pressure autoclave. The oxidation of biodiesel at 80 °C was promoted {{by an increase in}} the oxygen partial pressure, resulting in the formation of larger amounts of hydroperoxides and acids in the fuel. The fatty acid methyl esters of the biodiesel oxidized less at 150 °C on autoclave aging, because the termination reactions between alkyl and alkylperoxyl radicals dominated over the initiation reactions. HVO consists of saturated hydrocarbons, and remained intact during the exposure. The NBR absorbed a large amount of biodiesel due to fuel-driven internal cavitation in the rubber, and the uptake increased with increasing oxygen partial pressure due to the increase in concentration of oxidation products of the biodiesel. The absence of a tan δ peak (dynamical mechanical measurements) of the bound rubber and the appearance of carbon black particles devoid of rubber suggested that the cavitation was caused by the detachment of bound rubber from particle surfaces. A significant decrease in the strain-at-break and in the Payne-effect amplitude of NBR exposed to biodiesel was explained as being due to the damage caused by biodiesel to the rubber-carbon-black network. During the high-temperature autoclave ageing, the NBR swelled less in biodiesel, and showed a small decrease in the strain-at-break due to the cleavage of rubber chains. The degradation of NBR in the absence of carbon black was due only to biodiesel-promoted oxidative crosslinking. The zinc cations released by the dissolution of zinc oxide particles in biodiesel promoted reduction reactions in the acrylonitrile part of the NBR. Heat-treated star-shaped ZnO particles dissolved more slowly in biodiesel than the commercial ZnO nanoparticles due to the elimination of inter-particle porosity by heat treatment. The fuel sorption was hindered in HVO-exposed NBR by the steric constraints of the bulky HVO molecules. The extensibility of NBR decreased only slightly after exposure to HVO, due to the <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticizer</b> from the rubber. The bisphenol-cured FKM co- and terpolymer swelled more than the peroxide-cured GFLT-type FKM in biodiesel due to the chain cleavage caused by the attack of biodiesel on the double bonds formed during the bisphenol curing. The FKM rubbers absorbed biodiesel faster, and to a greater extent, with increasing oxygen concentration. It is suggested that the extensive biodiesel uptake and the decrease in the strain-at-break and Young’s modulus of the FKM terpolymer was due to dehydrofluorination of the rubber by the coordination complexes of biodiesel and magnesium oxide and calcium hydroxide particles. An increase in the CH 2 -concentration of the extracted FKM rubbers suggested that biodiesel was grafted onto the FKM at the unsaturated sites resulting from dehydrofluorination.

Di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), {{as an example of}} the most widely used of the phthalate esters, deserves particular emphasis. In general, the phthalate esters have been reported to have a low order of acute toxicity (9 - 11).

40|$|In {{the last}} 25 years, {{plastics}} have faced a massive demand in packaging technology {{due to their}} desirable properties, such as flexibility, light weight, etc. Moreover, their packaging applications have spread {{in the area of}} food and pharmaceutical products.
