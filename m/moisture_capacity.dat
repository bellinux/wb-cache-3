Different percentage compositions of these four components were tested to determine the optimal material composition for improving <b>moisture</b> removal <b>capacity</b> under varying inlet air temperature and humidity, and amount of moisture released under different regenerative temperature. For the first time, four-layered composite desiccants were developed and tested experimentally to determine their <b>moisture</b> removal <b>capacity</b> and <b>moisture</b> regeneration <b>capacity</b> at temperature of about 60 o C under inlet air conditions similar to Singapore’s tropical climate.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{moisture}} characteristics of spruce plywood are studied experimentally and numerically with special {{attention given to}} moisture storage and release as the indoor humidity changes diurnally. This {{is referred to as}} the <b>moisture</b> buffering <b>capacity.</b> Two test facilities (a glass jar facility and a transient moisture transfer facility) are used to measure {{the moisture}} accumulation and temperature and relative humidity profiles within spruce plywood. These measured data are used to determine the <b>moisture</b> buffering <b>capacity</b> of spruce plywood and validate a one-dimensional transient numerical model that can be used to calculate the transient heat and moisture transfer in spruce plywood. There is good agreement between the measured and simulated results over the range of test variables investigated. This validated numerical model is used to investigate the effect of initial conditions, boundary conditions, thickness and humidity step change on the <b>moisture</b> buffering <b>capacity.</b> In addition, sensitivity studies are performed to investigate the effect of variations in material properties used in the numerical model. The properties that are considered in these sensitivity studies are the sorption isotherm, effective thermal conductivity, heat of sorption and effective diffusion coefficient. These studies show that the sorption isotherm has the greatest effect on the <b>moisture</b> buffering <b>capacity,</b> as well as the temperature and relative humidity profiles within spruce plywood. For example, a ± 10 % change in sorption isotherm has a ± 7 %, ± 6 % and ± 10 % effect on the <b>moisture</b> buffering <b>capacity,</b> and the relative temperature and relative humidity change, respectively. This thesis also verifies the moisture diffusivity property for spruce plywood, which was developed by Olutimayin and Simonson (2005) to account for moisture storage in cellulose insulation for a single step change in humidity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>moisture</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{which is}} {{required}} to solve the isothermal moisture transport equation, is generally expressed by parametric functions covering both the hygroscopic and over-hygroscopic regime. The modality or number of analytical functions needed to describe the corresponding pore volume distribution is introduced as an important parameter for a proper description of the <b>moisture</b> <b>capacity</b> or capillary pressure curve.

Eleven mixtures were evaluated that varied in volumetric proportions of sand (30 % to 70 %), sandy or silt loam soil (0 % or 20 %), and organic compost (20 % to 70 %). Steady‐state infiltration rates were high for all mixtures, ranging from 87 to 178 cm h- 1, and followed the order of mixtures containing sand and compost only> mixtures containing sand, compost, and sandy soil> mixtures containing sand, compost, and silt loam soil.
