50|$|Conceição, {{along with}} the parishes of Matriz and Angústias, makes up the {{northern}} limit {{of the city of}} Horta. Topographically it is divided into two parts: an agricultural area, divided by an escarpment that extends from the Sítio of Volta to the western border with Flamengos, and a <b>more</b> <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> along the coast and Ribeira da Conceição, which is directly connected to the rest of Horta. The border extends across Espalamaca towards the Caminho Velho (Old Road) before cutting across the eastern extend of the Flamengos valley towards the Quinta do São Lourenço, cutting across a minor volcanic cone, before ending at the base of Monte Carneiro. The southern limit of the parish extends from the Estrada Regional E.R.2-2 towards the centre of the city of Horta, through the locality of Santo Amaro, before winding down the Ribeira da Conceição starting around the middle of the sítio of Volta to the Atlantic Ocean. From the Travessa do Mirante da Conceição, on the southern margin extends towards the municipal courthouse and traffic circle along the Avenida Marginal.|$|E

The road heads north mostly through forested areas though it skirts the easterly edges of small hills and passes {{to the east of}} Clearwater Pond. After passing a small farm with numerous work buildings, SR 148 makes a 90-degree bend to head east to the settlement of West Mills. Continuing east, the highway briefly enters the town of Starks in Somerset County and curves to the north. It briefly reenters Industry, Franklin County before curving back to the east to cross Lemon Creek and into Anson, Somerset County. It continues traveling through mostly wooded areas before reaching the settlement of Five Points where it intersects and forms a concurrency with SR 43 towards downtown Anson. The two routes enter the <b>more</b> <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> of Anson on Main Street passing a post office and the town hall before curving to the north at Kennebec River. The road reaches an intersection with US 201A and SR 8; at this point, the four routes cross the river into Madison.|$|E

It heads east through a mostly rural area passing the town hall of Bradford before climbing a small hill and making a 90-degree bend to the north at Bradford Corners. After passing the former town hall and the local post office, it alternates heading north and northeast before briefly entering Piscataquis County in its unincorporated Southeast Piscataquis. After leaving Piscataquis County, it re-enters Penobscot County {{in the town of}} Lagrange. In its town center, SR 155 intersects SR 6 and SR 16. SR 6 joins SR 155 on a concurrency northeast through rural areas of Lagrange before turning east as it enters Howland. After a long stretch of heading through forestland, SR 6 and SR 155 has an interchange with Interstate 95 at its exit 217. East of the interchange, the road, carrying the name Lagrange Road, heads past some small businesses before entering the <b>more</b> <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> of Howland with houses lining both sides of the street. The road reaches a roundabout with River Road and Coffin Street. SR 6 and SR 155 briefly head south along Coffin Street passing a general store before curving to the east along County Road.|$|E
40|$|Commuting {{distances}} in {{the life}} course Using data from a retrospective life-course survey conducted in the Netherlands {{in the beginning of}} the 1990 s, we investigate the influence of the dynamics in residential and work locations and of the importance of the residential location versus the household situation on commuting distances. We find that a longer duration of an episode between two changes in the residential or work location is associated with a shorter commuting distance. Residential relocations between municipalities lead to greater commuting distances than workplace mobility between municipalities. Living in a <b>more</b> <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> has a negative effect on commuting distance. We conclude that residential location choice is a crucial factor underlying commuting distances. It seems that bivariate associations between commuting distance and characteristics of the household and its housing are attributable to the fact that families and owner-occupied single-family housing are mainly found outside the more urbanized areas...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The World is {{undergoing}} rapid urbanization, with 70 % of the World population expected {{to live in}} urban areas by 2050. Nevertheless, nationally representative analysis of the health differences in the leading causes of avoidable mortality disaggregated by urbanization level is lacking. We undertake a study of temporal trends in mortality rates for deaths considered avoidable by the Concerted Action of the European Community on Avoidable Mortality for four different levels of urbanization in Taiwan between 1971 and 2008. We find that for virtually all causes of death, age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) were lower in <b>more</b> <b>urbanized</b> than less <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas,</b> either throughout the study period, or {{by the end of}} the period despite higher rates in <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> initially.

Ninety semi-structured interviews were performed, which resulted in 109 cited plant species. The sample included both men (n= 46) and women (n= 44), in different age categories: 18 - 40 years old (n= 18), 41 - 50 (n= 21), 51 - 60 (n= 28), and 61 + years old (n= 23), and in three different communities: Barra do Saí (n= 17), Itapema do Norte (n= 31) and Pontal do Norte (n= 42). Leaves are the plant parts most used by the communities (62 %), and are obtained primarily through cultivation. Cordia curassavica (Jacq.) Roem. & Schult. (Boraginaceae) is the species most cited in the interviews, locally known as 'erva-baleeira' or 'erva-de-baleia'. The elderly have greater knowledge of species, but no gender differences were noticed. Less knowledge of plants was noticed in the <b>more</b> <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> when compared to the less urbanized areas. The most used plants are not related to the most frequent ailments.

We present the efficiency of supporting location-dependent data on GOs with proposed ED. We investigate several membership functions to establish this proposed ED based on the degree of urbanization. In our evaluation, we show that the z-shaped membership function can flexibly adjust the ED. Thus, we obtain improved performance to provide the location-dependent data because we can differentiate the ED for very densely clustered GOs in <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas.</b> Key words: Location-Dependent Data, Pervasive Computing...|$|R
