Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a <b>monolayer</b> on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the <b>monolayer</b> to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E

5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer <b>monolayer</b> are then transported from the inner <b>monolayer</b> by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E

We hypothesized that septic alveolar epithelial <b>monolayers</b> would experience stretch-induced barrier dysfunction at a lower magnitude of stretch than healthy alveolar epithelial <b>monolayers.</b> Alveolar epithelial cells were isolated from rats 24 hours after cecal ligation and double puncture (2 CLP) or sham surgery. Following a 5 -day culture period, <b>monolayers</b> were cyclically stretched for 0, 10, or 60 minutes to a magnitude of 12 % or 25 % change in surface area (DSA). Barrier function, MAPk and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, tight junction (TJ) protein expression and actin cytoskeletal organization were examined after stretch. Significant increases in epithelial permeability were observed only in 2 CLP <b>monolayers</b> at the 12 % DSA stretch level, and in both 2 CLP and sham <b>monolayers</b> at the 25 % DSA stretch level. Increased permeability in 2 CLP <b>monolayers</b> was not associated with MAPk signaling or alterations in expression of TJ proteins. 2 CLP <b>monolayers</b> had fewer actin stress fibers before stretch, a more robust stretch-induced actin redistribution, and reduced phosphorylated MLCK than sham <b>monolayers.</b> Jasplakinolide stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in 2 CLP <b>monolayers</b> prevented significant increases in permeability following 60 minutes of stretch to 12 % DSA. We concluded that septic alveolar epithelial <b>monolayers</b> are more susceptible to stretch-induced barrier dysfunction than healthy <b>monolayers</b> due to actin reorganization...|$|R

25|$|Thus, by {{the early}} twentieth century the chemical, but not the {{structural}} nature of the cell membrane was known. Two experiments in 1924 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick. Although the results of this experiment were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Because the polar lipid headgroups are fully hydrated, they do not show up in a capacitance measurement meaning that this experiment actually measured the thickness of the hydrocarbon core, not the whole bilayer. Gorter and Grendel approached the problem from a different perspective, performing a solvent extraction of erythrocyte lipids and spreading the resulting material as a <b>monolayer</b> on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the <b>monolayer</b> to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses of this experiment showed several problems including an incorrect <b>monolayer</b> pressure, incomplete lipid extraction and a miscalculation of cell surface area. In spite of these issues the fundamental conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer- was correct.|$|E
