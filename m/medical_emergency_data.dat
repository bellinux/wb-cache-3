40|$|Crisis {{decision-making}} is {{an important}} responsibility of the resuscitation team leader but a difficult process to study. The purpose of this pilot {{study was to explore}} the potential of gaze-tracking technology to study decision-making and leadership behaviours in simulated <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> We studied five physicians with a broad range of experience in a simulated <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> using gaze-tracking glasses. Subjects were interviewed immediately after the scenario while viewing a first-person recording of their performance with a superimposed gaze indicator. The recordings were then studied independently by two reviewers, and rated for quality and their observations collated. Portable gaze-tracking devices were found to be useful and effective tools for studying information gathering and decision-making behaviours in simulated <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> The <b>data</b> obtained in this study provided information about the discrepancy between what each participant looked at compared to what each participant consciously noted. Analysis of the data also identified a number of recurrent gaze patterns performed by team leaders that could be used as end-points in future research. Gaze-tracking in resuscitation medicine is a new and promising field of study. The potential to study crisis decision-making behaviours, and cognitive load, as well as differences between novice and expert team leaders is substantial...|$|R
40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>emergency</b> {{monitoring}} {{body sensor}} networks (BSNs) monitor the occurrence of <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> and are helpful for the daily care of the elderly and chronically ill people. Such BSNs are characterized by rare traffic {{when there is no}} emergency occurring, high real-time and reliable requirements of <b>emergency</b> <b>data</b> and demand for a fast wake-up mechanism for waking up all nodes when an emergency happens. A beacon-enabled MAC protocol is specially designed {{to meet the demands of}} <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> monitoring BSNs. The rarity of traffic is exploited to improve energy efficiency. By adopting a long superframe structure to avoid unnecessary beacons and allocating most of the superframe to be inactive periods, the duty cycle is reduced to an extremely low level to save energy. Short active time slots are interposed into the superframe and shared by all of the nodes to deliver the <b>emergency</b> <b>data</b> in a low-delay and reliable way to meet the real-time and reliable requirements. The interposition slots can also be used by the coordinator to broadcast network demands to wake-up all nodes in a low-delay and energy-efficient way.

30|$|Mobile {{devices are}} often used in {{disaster}} areas, especially for <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies,</b> where <b>data</b> are delivered by DTN. The Mobile Agent Electronic Triage Tag System (Martin-Campillo et al. 2011) creates mobile agents that store and carry triage information about victims. Mobile agents are able to move through a MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network) created by mobile devices {{without the need for}} an end-to-end connection from source to destination. Mobile Maps (Monares et al. 2011) presents a low-cost mobile collaborative system, which may be used in emergency situations to overcome most communication problems of firefighters. This application provides ad-hoc communication, decision support and collaboration among firefighters in the field using mobile devices. The information accumulated can be analyzed after a crisis and studied for future emergencies. The DTN implemented on Android smartphones for an emergency scenario (Wang et al. 2013) allows users to interconnect without network facilities. This study shows that a DTN node can automatically transfer to other DTN regions whatever it receives in one DTN region. It can deliver rescuers’ messages including texts and videos using an epidemic routing protocol and IP Neighbor Discovery.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> {{can occur}} {{frequently}} in dental setting. Effective management {{of an emergency}} situation in the dental office is ultimately the dentist's responsibility. The lack of training and inability to cope with <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> can lead to tragic consequences and sometimes legal action. For this reason, all health professionals including dentists must be well prepared to attend to <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Providing basic life support [BLS] is dentist's most important contribution until definitive treatment for a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> can be given. Hence the study is aimed to assess the dental graduates (Interns) knowledge, skills and competency regarding dentistry-medical <b>emergency</b> interface. Methodology: <b>Data</b> were collected from 105 Interns of two dental colleges of Belgaum City using a structured questionnaire consisting of 7 item questionnaire (6 closed and 1 open ended). Results: Overall in all the years, syncope / faint was seen by 40. 9 % of the respondents, 37. 1 % with hypoglycemic attacks, allergic reactions by 17. 1 %, epileptic attacks by 7. 6 %, asthmatic attacks by 4. 5 % and angina 0. 9 %. The frequencies of the emergencies encountered were once or even more.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{develops}} {{the concept of}} epistemological alignment {{as a means of}} understanding how the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> entered into biomedical classification. The working hypothesis is that the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> could not develop as a paradigm from which knowledge could proliferate until a series of related concepts had been elucidated, and its epistemology became aligned. This argument is advanced by exploring the historically constructed lexicon of the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency’s</b> key components. In the process, a semantic network created by 18 th-century attempts to problematize sudden death is elucidated and explored. The paper concludes by arguing that the First World War served as a catalyst for the alignment of concepts central to the epistemology of the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} ability of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team {{criteria}} and the National Early Warning Score to discriminate cardiac arrest, unanticipated ICU admission and death within 24 hours of a vital signs measurement, and to quantify the associated workload. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A large U. K. National Health Service District General Hospital. PATIENTS: Adults hospitalized from May 25, 2011, to December 31, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We applied the National Early Warning Score and 44 sets of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria to a database of 2, 245, 778 vital signs sets (103, 998 admissions). The National Early Warning Score's performance was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve and compared with sensitivity/specificity for different <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (95 % CI) for the National Early Warning Score for the combined outcome (i. e., death, cardiac arrest, or unanticipated ICU admission) was 0. 88 (0. 88 - 0. 88). A National Early Warning Score value of 7 had sensitivity/specificity values of 44. 5 % and 97. 4 %, respectively. For the 44 sets of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria studied, sensitivity ranged from 19. 6 % to 71. 2 % and specificity from 71. 5 % to 98. 5 %. For all outcomes, {{the position of the}} National Early Warning Score receiver-operating characteristic curve was above and to the left of all <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria points, indicating better discrimination. Similarly, the positions of all <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria points were above and {{to the left of the}} National Early Warning Score efficiency curve, indicating higher workloads (trigger rates). CONCLUSIONS: When <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team systems are compared to a National Early Warning Score value of greater than or equal to 7, some <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team systems have a higher sensitivity than National Early Warning Score values of greater than or equal to 7.
