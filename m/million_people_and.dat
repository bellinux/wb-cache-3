5|$|While the Social Gospel {{was making}} inroads within the denomination, the {{ministry}} of baseball player turned evangelist Billy Sunday demonstrated that Evangelicalism and the revivalist tradition was still a force within the denomination. Sunday became the most prominent evangelist of the early 20th century, preaching to over 100 <b>million</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> leading an estimated million to conversion throughout his career. Whereas Stelzle emphasized the social aspects of Christianity, Sunday's focus was primarily on the conversion and moral responsibility of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six <b>million</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, PD {{affected}} 6.2 <b>million</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> {{resulted in}} about 117,400 deaths globally.

When it is seen in people before the age of 50, it is called young-onset PD. The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between 7 and 14 years. The disease is named after the English doctor James Parkinson, who published the first detailed description in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, in 1817. Public awareness campaigns include World Parkinson's Day (on the birthday of James Parkinson, 11 April) and the use of a red tulip as the symbol of the disease. People with parkinsonism who have increased the public's awareness of the condition include actor Michael J. Fox, Olympic cyclist Davis Phinney, and late professional boxer Muhammad Ali.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty on Increased Integration in the Economic and Humanitarian Fields {{signed in}} 1996 laid the first {{foundation}} for economic convergence. The treaty ensured {{the creation of}} a permanent executive organ to oversee integration of states that later would be part of the EEU. It served as the blueprint for the future common market for goods, services, capital and labour. The Single Economic Space established a single market across the territory of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2015 with the entry into force of the EEU Agreement, the single market was expanded to include Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The countries represent a market of some 183 <b>million</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> a combined GDP of around $4 trillion.|$|E
5|$|Under Mandela's presidency, welfare {{spending}} increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which {{had previously been}} set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 <b>million</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.|$|E

5|$|Selena's {{life and}} career were covered {{by a number of}} {{television}} programs, including The Oprah Winfrey Show, E! True Hollywood Story, VH1's Behind The Music, American Justice, Snapped, and Famous Crime Scene. Other networks including MTV, Investigation Discovery, The Biography Channel, and A Network have aired special programs about Selena, while Spanish-language networks regularly show documentaries to commemorate the anniversary of her death. These Spanish-language documentaries are among the most-watched programs in the history of American television, and often score record ratings for networks. A documentary titled Selena, A Star is Dimmed—one of the first about her—was broadcast on Univison's Primer Impacto on April 22, 1995; it was watched by 2.09 <b>million</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> became the second-most-viewed Spanish-language show in the history of American television at the time. Networks competed with each other to interview Saldívar about the shooting. When news that Arrarás was able to interview her broke, Univision was inundated with requests to use the interview from major networks as far away as Germany. The interview on Primer Impacto was watched by 4.5 million viewers; it was the most-watched program that night according to the Nielsen ratings, and became one of the most-watched Spanish-language programs in American television history.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Zambian census was {{conducted}} in Zambia in 2010 under {{the approval of the}} Government of Zambia, which recorded demographic data from 13 <b>million</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> 3.2 million households. The 2010 Census of Population and Housing {{was conducted}} between 16 October and 15 November 2010, with all parts of the country covered by 30 November 2010. It was the fifth national population census exercise of Zambia since its independence in 1964, with the previous censuses conducted in 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the processing started in April 2011 by the Central Statistical Office. Optical Mark Reading (OMR) and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology were used for data capture. The census was funded by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Kingdom AID (UKAID-formerly DFID), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), who contributed close to 60 per cent of the total expenditure and rest contributed by the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Zambia.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of China {{doubled in size}} during the 10th and 11th centuries. This growth {{was made possible by}} expanded rice cultivation in central and southern Song, the use of early-ripening rice from south-east and southern Asia, and the production of widespread food surpluses. The Northern Song census recorded a {{population of}} roughly 50 million, much like the Han and Tang dynasties. This data is found in the Standard Histories. However, it is estimated that the Northern Song had a population of some 100 <b>million</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> 200 million {{by the time of the}} Ming dynasty. This dramatic increase of population fomented an economic revolution in pre-modern China. The expansion of the population, growth of cities, and the emergence of a national economy led to the gradual withdrawal of the central government from direct involvement in economic affairs. The lower gentry assumed a larger role in grassroots administration and local affairs. Appointed officials in county and provincial centers relied upon the scholarly gentry for their services, sponsorship, and local supervision.|$|E
