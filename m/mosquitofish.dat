5|$|Many {{factors are}} thought to be {{responsible}} for the dramatic decline of this species in Australia, including habitat fragmentation, erosion and sedimentation of soil, insecticides and fertilisers contaminating water systems, the introduction of predatory fish, and alteration of drainage regimes. Population declines are closely related to the introduction of the eastern <b>mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia holbrooki), a species native to North America that was introduced to control mosquito larvae. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the eggs and tadpoles of the green and golden bell frog are extremely susceptible to predation by this fish, and in 77 of the 93 sites in New South Wales where the green and golden bell frog was known to have disappeared before 1990, eastern <b>mosquitofish</b> were found to be present. The frogs have been known to inhabit waters containing the fish, but breeding is rarely successful there, pointing to the fish's voracious eating of eggs and tadpoles. The fish are not yet present in eastern Victoria, where green and golden bell frog numbers have remained solid, but the fish likely will spread to rivers there, possibly inflicting heavy losses on the frogs.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the Canning River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. Stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the <b>mosquitofish.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several exotic {{freshwater}} fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, Atlantic and Chinook salmon, redfin perch, common carp, and <b>mosquitofish,</b> {{have been introduced}} to Australian waterways. The <b>mosquitofish</b> is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins of other fish. It {{has been linked to}} declines and localised extirpations of several small native fish species. The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, Macquarie perch and mountain galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the spotted tree frog. The common carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of south west Australia.|$|E
25|$|Birds in {{the region}} include American robin, bald eagle, California gull, Canada goose, dark-eyed junco, hairy woodpecker, mallard, {{mountain}} chickadee, red-tailed hawk, Steller's jay, western tanager, and yellow-headed blackbird. The region has numerous venomous spiders, such as the black widow, brown recluse, tarantula, and hobo spider. The mountain yellow-legged frog is also living throughout the area. Fish species in the lake include Tahoe sucker, mountain whitefish, brown bullhead catfish, smallmouth bass, <b>mosquitofish,</b> and brown trout.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent by}} which Searsville Reservoir {{serves as a}} source for {{non-native}} species was illustrated when Stanford biologists studied the aquatic fauna found in the plunge pool below the Searsville dam spillway. The plunge pool was drained in 2013 to allow for a safety inspection of the base of the dam. Native species found when the plunge pool was pumped dry include two steelhead trout, 26 California roach and 22 Sacramento suckers. In contrast, more than 1,500 non-native fishes were encountered during the dewatering process, including over 500 sunfish including green sunfish ((Lepomis cyanellus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and likely redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), two bullhead catfish (Ameiurus species) and over 1,000 <b>mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia affinis). Other non-native in the plunge pool included 500 bullfrogs and 150 Louisiana red swamp crayfish.|$|E
500|$|The {{sturdy and}} {{prolific}} eastern <b>mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia holbrooki) {{is a native}} of the southeastern United States and was introduced around the world in the 1930s and 40s to feed on mosquito larvae and thus combat malaria. However, it has thrived at the expense of local species, causing a decline of endemic fish and frogs through competition for food resources, as well as through eating their eggs and larvae. In Australia, the <b>mosquitofish</b> is the subject of discussion as to how best to control it; in 1989 it was said that [...] "biological population control is well beyond present capabilities", and this remains the position.|$|E
500|$|About 100bird species, {{several kinds}} of mammals, and a few fish species live in the watershed. Mammals {{commonly}} seen include beaver, raccoon, opossum, spotted skunk, Douglas squirrel, and Townsend's chipmunk; black-tail deer and coyotes are more rare. Fanno Creek supports non-migrating coastal cutthroat trout that spawn in the fast-flowing, gravel-bottomed headwaters and grow to as long as [...] Other fish species found in the creek include sculpins, <b>mosquitofish</b> and eel.|$|E
500|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog {{has been the}} subject of much {{research}} and monitoring, important to improving its conservation. Research focuses on the development of management measures to keep the introduced <b>mosquitofish</b> under control. These include poisoning the fish, but the waterways are large and trials have given mixed results. Predators of the <b>mosquitofish</b> have also been tried. Other strategies may allow for the development and improvement of suitable habitat, and to increase the reproductive success of the species. Parallel to these measures, community awareness programmes have also been proposed. One difficulty in protecting the frog is that only 20% of the known populations in New South Wales since 1990 occur in conservation parks. Of the eight populations that occur in conservation parks, only five are wholly located within them and one of these is not breeding. There have been calls for legislation to be introduced to stop habitat degradation on private land to prevent detrimental effects to the frogs. Many proposed developments have been subjected to legal action to protect the habitat, and some communities have started [...] "Friends of the Green and Golden Bell Frog" [...] action groups. As public awareness has increased, documentary and news segments on the deteriorating situation have become more frequent and references to the frog in environmental logos and artworks have increased. The effort to increase public consciousness of the green and golden bell frog has also been aided because its colours are the same as the national colours. Restrictions on logging close to areas inhabited by the frogs have been put in place. As green and golden bell frogs are mostly observed in environments disturbed by humans, targeted environmental interference is seen as a possible means of enhancing habitats.|$|E
500|$|Female Pacific blue-eyes {{are sexually}} mature at {{six months of}} age or when they have reached [...] in {{standard}} length. Males are mature at [...] standard length. A study published in 2003 showed that males will preferentially choose larger females—who are more fecund as a rule—unless more energy is required to do so, such as swimming further against a current. Fish can breed in fresh and salt water. The life span of the species is around 1–2 years in the wild, and around 2–3 years in aquariums, though some males may reach 4 years of age. In an aquarium, Pacific blue-eyes spawn in gravel or moss {{at the base of}} aquatic plants. An experiment housing Pacific blue-eyes and <b>mosquitofish</b> together showed that growth and breeding of the former fish were severely affected by the presence of the latter. The mechanism was unclear—there were some signs of direct aggression (bite marks on fins of Pacific blue-eyes) but stress from contact was thought to be a major factor.|$|E
500|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{generally}} {{reaches a}} total length of around [...] long; males can reach [...] and females [...] The size of Pacific blue-eyes found {{north of the}} Burdekin Gap increases directly with distance from the gap, males and females being the same size. South of the Burdekin Gap, the species exhibits marked size difference between sexes, which becomes more pronounced as {{the distance from the}} gap increases. The elongate body is partly transparent and pale yellow or olive with a silver operculum and belly. The scales are relatively large and longer vertically than horizontally. The eye is large and has a blue iris. There are two dorsal fins, the first arising in line with or just posterior to the longest pectoral fin ray. The forked tail fin has rounded tips. The bottom and top edges of the tail fin are edged with white. The male has extended filaments on its dorsal, anal and pelvic fins. There are black markings {{at the base of the}} anterior rays of the anal and rear dorsal fins, and the front (anterior edge) is sometimes white and the rear (posterior) edge greyish in colour. The male's fins may turn orange during breeding season. Preserved specimens generally discolour to yellow or tan. The Pacific blue-eye can be distinguished from the highly invasive and noxious introduced eastern <b>mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia holbrooki) by its forked tail fin.|$|E
2500|$|The Orange River has a {{relative}} paucity of species diversity. A 2011 survey of 13,762 fish found only 16 [...] {{species of fish}} present. Three of these, the [...] common carp, the Mozambique tilapia and the western <b>mosquitofish</b> are non-indigenous. Another exotic species, rainbow trout, {{is found in the}} river headwaters in Lesotho.|$|E
2500|$|The Waikato River and its hydro lakes {{are home}} to at least 19 types of native fish and 10 types of {{introduced}} fish. The introduced species include rainbow and brown trout providing {{what has been called}} [...] "the finest fly-fishing in the world". Other introduced species, like the carp and <b>mosquitofish,</b> have become major pests.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia holbrooki) can {{distinguish}} between doors marked with either {{two or three}} geometric symbols, only one of which allows the fish to rejoin its shoalmates. This can be achieved when the two symbols have the same total surface area, density and brightness as the three symbols. [...] Further studies show this discrimination extends to 4 vs 8, 15 vs 30, 100 vs 200, 7 vs 14, and 8 vs 12 symbols, again controlling for non-numerical factors.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{species of}} native fishes have been {{collected}} from Adobe Creek recently: [...] California roach, Sacramento sucker, three-spined stickleback, and prickly sculpin. Leidy reported the fish still inhabiting the Adobe Creek's lowest reach in 2007 – native California roach (Lavinia symmetricus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and non-native common carp (Cyprinus carpio), rainwater killifish (Lucania parva), and western <b>mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia affinis). A 2011 fish survey showed only native fish above El Camino Real: the reach above Redwood Grove and the Manresa Lane bridge in Los Altos included California roach, Sacramento sucker and three-spined stickleback – an assemblage that generally includes steelhead trout in other Bay Area streams. Further upstream, the fish assemblage steadily diminishes due to passage barriers and reduced stream flows from diversions and wells: at Moody Road just above Foothill College, only California roach and three-spined stickleback were collected, at Rhus Ridge bridge in Los Altos Hills only three-spined stickleback were collected, and at the Francemont Avenue bridge and along the Adobe Creek Trail at Hidden Villa no fish were found.|$|E
5000|$|Gambusia affinis (S. F. Baird & Girard, 1853) (<b>mosquitofish,</b> western <b>mosquitofish)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The western <b>mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia affinis) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish, also known commonly, if ambiguously, as simply <b>mosquitofish</b> or by its generic name, Gambusia, or by the common name gambezi. There is also an eastern <b>mosquitofish</b> (G. holbrooki).|$|E
50|$|The eastern <b>mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia holbrooki) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish, {{closely related to the}} western <b>mosquitofish,</b> Gambusia affinis. It {{is a member of the}} family Poeciliidae of order Cyprinodontiformes. The eastern <b>mosquitofish</b> is native to the eastern and southern United States from Florida to Delaware and inland to Alabama and Tennessee, while the western <b>mosquitofish</b> has a larger distribution throughout the United States.|$|E
50|$|However, {{from the}} 1920s to the 1950s, <b>mosquitofish</b> were {{a major factor}} in eradicating malaria in South America, {{southern}} Russia, and Ukraine. A somewhat famous example of <b>mosquitofish</b> eradicating malaria is on the coast of the Black Sea near Sochi in Russia. In Sochi, the <b>mosquitofish</b> is commemorated for eradicating malaria by a monument of the fish. In 2008, in some parts of California and in Clark County, Nevada, <b>mosquitofish</b> were bred in aquariums so people could stock stagnant pools of water with the <b>mosquitofish</b> {{to reduce the number of}} West Nile virus cases.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>mosquitofish</b> is {{a member}} of the family Poeciliidae of order Cyprinodontiformes. The genus name Gambusia is derived from the Cuban Spanish term gambusino, meaning [...] "useless". The common name, <b>mosquitofish,</b> is derived from their diet, which, under some circumstances, {{consists}} of large numbers of mosquito larvae. Classification of the western <b>mosquitofish</b> has been difficult due to their similarity to the eastern <b>mosquitofish,</b> and according to ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System), G. holbrooki (eastern <b>mosquitofish)</b> is an invalid taxonomic name and is rather a subspecies of G. affinis.|$|E
50|$|After birth, newborn <b>mosquitofish</b> {{are about}} 8 to 9 mm in length. As {{juvenile}}s, they {{grow at a}} rate of about 0.2 mm per day. Growth rates of juvenile <b>mosquitofish</b> reach their peak when the water temperature is within a range of 24 to 30 C. As temperatures rise above or dip below this range, growth rates decrease. Temperatures at or above 35 C are typically lethal, while growth stops when temperatures are at or below 10 C. For male <b>mosquitofish,</b> sexual maturity is reached in about 43 to 62 days. Female <b>mosquitofish</b> reach sexual maturity in about 21 to 28 days if born early within the reproductive season. The lifespan of a <b>mosquitofish</b> averages less than a year and the maximum is about 1.5 years. However, <b>mosquitofish</b> kept as pets can live much longer, with owners reporting lifespans of over three years. Male <b>mosquitofish</b> lifespans are considerably shorter than the hardier females.|$|E
50|$|In {{its native}} range, Eastern <b>mosquitofish</b> may be {{confused}} with the Western <b>Mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia affinis) or the sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna).|$|E
5000|$|Common <b>mosquitofish</b> (Gambusia affinis): The <b>mosquitofish</b> is a {{very small}} minnow which has {{received}} its name for its fondness for mosquito larvae. The <b>mosquitofish</b> usually reaches a length of only 2.5-5 cm (1-2 in) long. This is a peculiar fish because the male has a [...] "modified" [...] anal fin and female gives birth to live young, much like their related cousins the guppy.|$|E
5000|$|Based on diet, <b>mosquitofish</b> are {{classified}} as larvivorous fish. Their diet consists of zooplankton, small insects and insect larvae, and detritus material. <b>Mosquitofish</b> feed on mosquito larvae at all stages of life. Many mosquitos do not hatch due to improper fertility. Adult females can consume hundreds of mosquito larvae in one day. Maximum consumption rate in a day by one <b>mosquitofish</b> has been observed to be from 42%-167% of its own body weight. [...] They can suffer mortalities if fed only on mosquito larvae, and survivors show poor growth and maturation. <b>Mosquitofish</b> have also shown cannibalistic behavior in laboratory experiments; however, whether these traits are hereditary is unknown.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mosquitofish</b> were {{intentionally}} {{introduced in}} many areas with large mosquito populations to decrease the population of mosquitoes by eating the mosquito larvae. However, most introductions were ill-advised; in most cases native fish had already proven to supply maximal control of mosquito population and introducing <b>mosquitofish</b> has been more harmful to indigenous aquatic life than to the mosquito population. Introductions outside the mosquitofish's natural range can be harmful to the nonnative ecosystems. <b>Mosquitofish</b> {{have been known to}} kill or injure other small fish by their aggressive behavior and otherwise harm them through competition. They are now considered just slightly better at eating mosquitoes than at destroying other aquatic species. The ecological impacts of <b>mosquitofish</b> are partly dictated by their sex ratio, which can vary dramatically across their introduced range. <b>Mosquitofish</b> in Australia are considered noxious pests where they pose a threat to native fish and frog populations and no evidence indicates they have controlled mosquito populations or mosquito-borne diseases.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecological}} {{impact of the}} speckled <b>mosquitofish</b> in Australia is pronounced. Its diet has affected populations of both native and non-native fish. An example would be the non-native species Gambusia holbrooki. It has similar features as the mosquito fish, such as a high reproductive rate and use for mosquito control. However, its population in Australia has diminished since {{the introduction of the}} speckled <b>mosquitofish.</b> Furthermore, this <b>mosquitofish</b> has also affected the food chain, as they have become prey for native bird species.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mosquitofish</b> were {{introduced}} directly into ecosystems {{in many parts}} of the world as a biocontrol to lower mosquito populations which in turn negatively affected many other species in each distinct bioregion. <b>Mosquitofish</b> in Australia are classified as a noxious pest and may have exacerbated the mosquito problem in many areas by outcompeting native invertebrate predators of mosquito larvae. Several counties in California distribute <b>mosquitofish</b> at no charge to residents with manmade fish ponds and pools as part of their mosquito abatement programs. The fish are made available to residents only and are intended to be used solely on their own property, not introduced into natural habitat. On 24 February 2014, Chennai Corporation in India introduced western <b>mosquitofish</b> in 660 ponds to control the mosquito population in freshwater bodies.|$|E
50|$|Despite their adaptability, {{they have}} been {{displaced}} by invasive species, such as both species of <b>mosquitofish,</b> introduced from North America to Spain in 1921 by doctor Sadí de Buen Lozano {{in an attempt to}} control malarial mosquitoes.

5000|$|Reproduction of the <b>mosquitofish</b> {{starts with}} the male {{arranging}} the rays of the gonopodium (modified anal fin) into a slight tube. The male <b>mosquitofish</b> uses this tubular fin to secrete milt into the female's genital aperture {{in the process of}} internal fertilization. The female's genital aperture is located just behind the anal fin and is an opening for the milt to fertilize the ova within the ovary. <b>Mosquitofish</b> are within the infraclass Teleostei and as all teleosts, <b>mosquitofish</b> lack a uterus, so production of oocytes and gestation occur within the ovary of a female <b>mosquitofish.</b> Inside the female, sperm from multiple males can be stored to later fertilize more ova. Based on laboratory experiments, the female <b>mosquitofish</b> is believed to be vitellogenic in nature during spring when the average temperature reaches about 14 C, and then the oocytes finish maturing when the average temperature reaches about 18 C. Then late in the summer when the photoperiod is less than 12.5 hours long, the next clutch of oocytes lose vitellogenesis. In one reproductive season, a female may fertilize, with stored milt, two to six broods of embryos, with the size of the brood decreasing as the season progresses. [...] Reproduction rates are highly dependent on temperature and ration level. As temperature increases from 20 to 30 °C, mean age at first reproduction decreases from 191 to 56 days, and brood size and mass of offspring increase significantly. Interbrood interval estimates at 25 and 30 °C are 23 and 19 days, respectively.|$|E
