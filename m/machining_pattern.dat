40|$|The {{machining}} of a cone frustum as {{specified in}} National Aerospace Standard (NAS) 979 is widely {{accepted as a}} final performance test for five-axis machining centers. Although it gives a good demonstration of the machine’s overall machining performance, it is generally difficult to separately identify each error source in the machine from the measured error profile of the finished workpiece. This paper proposes a set of machining tests for a five-axis machine tool to identify its kinematic errors, {{one of its most}} fundamental error sources. In each <b>machining</b> <b>pattern,</b> a simple straight side cutting using a straight end mill is performed. The relationship between geometric errors of the finished workpiece and the machine’s kinematic errors is formulated based on the kinematic model of a five-axis machine. The identification of kinematic errors from geometric errors of finished workpieces is experimentally demonstrated on a commercial five-axis machining center, and the estimates are compared to those estimated based on ball bar measurements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the <b>machining</b> <b>pattern,</b> {{mechanics}} of material removal and theory of micro-indentation, {{in previous studies}} the models of material removal rate of hard-brittle materials was discussed through the relatively influencing factors of machining parameters from various aspects, reflecting the research advances on {{mechanics of}} material removal of hard-brittle materials. However, those models of material removal rate have limitations, which results from impercipient theory of fracture of new kinks of materials, randomicity of practical machining process, inappropriate assumptions and simplification of the machining conditions and so on. In this work firstly, previous models of material removal rate of hard-brittle materials machining with ultrasonic assistance were reviewed briefly. Subsequently, the models of material removal rate of complex ceramics machining with two-dimensional ultrasonic vibration assistance were established based on fracture theory of micro- indentation in fracture regime and plastic removal mechanics in ductile regime respectively. The material removal rate is affected {{not only by the}} properties of material and machining parameters, but also by the character of grinding wheel and parameters of ultrasonic vibration...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{influence}} of micro patterns on the wetting transition of a hydrophilic material. Surfaces with a designed pattern with various groove widths are machined by ultra-precision raster milling. The impact of different groove widths of the <b>machined</b> <b>patterns</b> on wetting transition will be discussed by studying the spreading of droplets on respective patterns. Contact angle and elongation length were measured using a contact angle goniometer. The present work revealed that machined surfaces on a hydrophilic material with micro patterns can achieve composite solid-liquid-air interfaces when the scales of the <b>machined</b> <b>pattern</b> fall into a critical range.

40|$|Analysis of {{the thermal}} effect and {{machining}} properties of PC (polycarbonate) and ABS (polyacrylonitrilebutadienestyrene) polymers when ablated using a KrF excimer laser is described. PC has less thermal {{effect on the}} geometric distortion than ABS in laser ablation. The cumulative heat during laser ablation results in geometric deformation in ABS micromachining. The number of laser pulses generates a greater geometric deformation in ABS than in PC according to experimental laser ablation observations. The PC ablation rate {{is proportional to the}} laser fluence, whereas ABS shows an exponential profile. The pulse repetition rate has no significant influence on PC during laser ablation, but affects the ablated patterns in ABS. During laser ablation, PC does not produce debris on the <b>machining</b> <b>patterns,</b> but debris is produced on the <b>machining</b> <b>patterns</b> with ABS...|$|R

40|$|Embossing by {{patterned}} rollers {{is one of}} {{the most}} efficient machining approaches for manufacturing plastic films with patterned microstructures, and the precision roller with patterned microstructures is the key tooling component in the roll-to-roll process. Single-point diamond turning with a slow or fast tool servo is an enabling and efficient ultra-precision machining process to fabricate microstructures through a simple process to achieve optical surface finish directly. Most of the current studies on slow or fast tool servo machining processes either focus on face <b>machining</b> of <b>patterned</b> microstructures, or on tool servo machining of microstructures in the radial direction of precision rollers. Relatively little research work is found in relation to <b>machining</b> <b>patterned</b> microstructures on a precision roller by using the tool servo in the axial direction.
