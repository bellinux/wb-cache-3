A large [...] "bullet car" [...] was used instead of a {{standard}} moving barrier. Weights {{were placed in the}} nose of the car to help it slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. The vehicle headlights were turned on to provide a possible ignition source. The fuel tank was completely filled with gasoline rather than partially filled with non-flammable Stoddard fluid as was the normal test procedure. In a later interview the NHTSA engineer was asked why the NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing a 35mph test given that most small cars of the time would not have passed.

5000|$|Critical {{response}} to the film was largely negative. In one critical review, Elizabeth Weitzman from the New York Daily News writes, [...] "It’s not an insult to say the black-and-white film looks like a grad-school thesis project, since that’s what it is (for Franco’s MFA at NYU)[...] [...]But that does <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be prepared for some high-minded pretension, lots of self-consciously arty shots, and long stretches of apparently profound nothingness."

In a lot of ways, I listen to that record now and think I thought way too hard on this. To me, it’s sort of missing something… even though Im so proud of that record and I think a lot of the songs are good.
