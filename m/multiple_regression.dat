25|$|The ELEMENT study {{dealt with}} {{determinants}} {{of academic achievement}} in Berlin. It {{was carried out in}} Berlin, where some of the pupils started at a Gymnasium after the 4th grade, while others stayed in primary school until 6th grade and started at different schools after the 6th grade. Factors correlated with academic achievement tend to be intercorrelated (that means that they are also correlated with other factors that determine academic achievement). The number of books owned by a pupil's parents, for example, is correlated with the parents' education. Because of this <b>Multiple</b> <b>Regression</b> Analysis was used. <b>Multiple</b> <b>Regression</b> allows us to understand the influence of one variable when the other variables are held fixed.|$|E

25|$|Recall {{that the}} R-square {{statistic}} in <b>multiple</b> <b>regression</b> reflects {{the percent of}} variance accounted for in the Y variable using all X variables. Thus, the change in R-square will reflect the percent of variance explained by the variable added to the model. The change in R-square is more appropriate than simply looking at the raw correlations because the raw correlations {{do not reflect the}} overlap of the newly introduced measure and the existing measures.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} in the Netherlands by Dr. Dirk van Kampen has indicated that the authentic rhythm of Gregorian chant in the 10th century includes both proportional elements and elements that are in agreement with semiology. Starting {{with the expectation that}} the rhythm of Gregorian chant (and thus the duration of the individual notes) anyway adds to the expressivity of the sacred Latin texts, several word-related variables were studied for their relationship with several neume-related variables, exploring these relationships in a sample of introit chants using such statistical methods as correlational analysis and <b>multiple</b> <b>regression</b> analysis.|$|E

40|$|Firms need {{to rely on}} {{different}} financing sources, {{but the question is}} how capital structure is determined for a particular industry. Our aim is to undertake an investigation into the factors which determine capital structure in the UK retail industry. Our initial sample consists of 163 (final sample: 100) UK retail companies, using data from 2000 in order to analyse capital structure from 2002 to 2006. Nonlinear models tend to be unduly neglected in capital structure research, and so we apply generalized regression neural networks (GRNNs), which are compared with conventional <b>multiple</b> <b>regressions.</b> We utilize a hold-out sample for the <b>multiple</b> <b>regressions</b> to make them comparable with the GRNNs. Stability of the data is also confirmed. Our main findings are: net profitability and the depreciation-to-sales ratio are key determinants of capital structure based on GRNNs, while two more variables are added in the <b>multiple</b> <b>regressions,</b> namely size and quick ratio; there is strong support for the pecking-order theory; both root-mean-square errors and mean absolute errors are much lower for the GRNNs than those for the <b>multiple</b> <b>regressions</b> for overall, training and testing datasets. The potential benefit of this research to financial managers and investors in the UK retail sector is the identification of the overriding role of net profitability in reducing the financial risk from high levels of gearing...|$|R

[...] Nearly all real-world regression models involve multiple predictors, and basic descriptions of linear regression are often phrased {{in terms of the}} <b>multiple</b> <b>regression</b> model.

2500|$|When {{performing}} statistical analysis, {{independent variables}} that affect a particular dependent variable {{are said to}} be orthogonal if they are uncorrelated, since the covariance forms an inner product. In this case the same results are obtained for the effect of any of the independent variables upon the dependent variable, regardless of whether one models the effects of the variables [...] individually with simple regression or simultaneously with <b>multiple</b> <b>regression.</b> If correlation is present, the factors are not orthogonal and different results are obtained by the two methods. This usage arises from the fact that if centered by subtracting the expected value (the mean), uncorrelated variables are orthogonal in the geometric sense discussed above, both as observed data (i.e., vectors) and as random variables (i.e., density functions).|$|E
