40|$|This paper draws {{attention}} {{to the role of the}} English language in creating an increasingly interconnected and globalised world. The argument of the paper is developed by contemplating the use of language and discourse by those agents who are deeply involved and implicated in the making of such global realities, viz. international managers. Such contemplation follows the trajectory provided by the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel. Within its narrative logic three discursively based, yet different, conceptualisations of international <b>management</b> (<b>engineer,</b> cultural negotiator, translator) are offered and aligned to three linguistic traditions (determinism, relativity, translation studies) and three understandings of globalisation (convergence, cultural difference, complexity). In concluding, it is advised that future research might concern itself with the nexus of ties between language systems and discourses and how they inform the making of organisational worlds...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a functional assessment system, a component of a management information system (MIS) that supports a comprehensive rehabilitation facility. Products of the subsystem document the functional status of rehabilitation clients through process evaluation reporting and outcomes reporting. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the design of this MIS component. The environment supported, the integration requirements and the needed development approach is unique, requiring significant input from health care professionals, medical informatics specialists, statisticians and program evaluators. Strategies for the implementation of the functional assessment system are the major results reported in this paper. They are most useful to the systems designer or <b>management</b> <b>engineer</b> in a human service delivery setting. MIS plan development, computer file structure and access methods, and approaches to scheduling applications is described. Finally, the development of functional status measures is discussed. Application of the methodologies described will facilitate similar efforts towards systems development in other human service delivery settings...|$|E

This result establishes the standard deviation of a game as a crucial determinant of a slot player 2 ̆ 7 s experience.

For example, virtual players began with 100 units, terminating play at bankruptcy or 200 units. As players focus {{on the outcome of}} single visits, understanding the determinants of PPLP (or time on device) will help <b>management</b> <b>engineer</b> desirable customer experiences at the trip level. In part, this can be achieved by altering the product mix to better match the expectations of the clientele. Given the remarkable bankruptcy rate of the trip simulations, proxies for value such as PPLP serve as crucial evaluation standards in the satisfaction process...|$|E
