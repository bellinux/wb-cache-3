40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} high-density silicone oil (HDSO) as a tamponade agent for retinal detachment secondary to myopic macular hole. Methods: 12 eyes of 12 patients with macular hole retinal detachment underwent pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling and HDSO tamponade. No posturing was required postoperatively and HDSO was removed 3 - 4 months later. Outcome measures included macular hole closure and retinal attachment rates, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 67. 8 years and the mean spherical equivalent refractive error was - 13. 4 diopters. After the removal of HDSO, 10 (83 %) eyes had macular hole closure with retinal reattachment without any tamponade. One eye had retinal reattachment after re-operation and the other refused further surgery. At the last follow-up, the median BCVA improved from 20 / 800 to 20 / 600 (p = 0. 046). A transient increase in intraocular pressure was observed in 5 (42 %) eyes and one eye each developed <b>mild</b> <b>oil</b> emulsification and transient peripheral choroidal detachment. None of the eyes was found to have severe intraocular inflammation post-operatively. Conclusions: HDSO seemed to be an effective tamponade agent for myopic macular hole retinal detachment. Further prospective controlled studies seem warranted. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{to evaluate the use}} of High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC) of polar compounds of refined, mild deodorized, extra virgin olive oils as well as of their blends, in attempting to reveal significant differences in the amounts of the substance classes constituting polar compounds among these oils. Two sets of blends were prepared by mixing an extra virgin olive oil with both refined and <b>mild</b> deodorized olive <b>oils</b> in increasing amounts. The obtained data highlighted that the triacylglycerol oligopolymers were absent or present in traces in the extra virgin olive oil, while their mean amount was equal to 0. 04 g/ 100 g and 0. 72 g/ 100 g in mild deodorized and refined olive oils, respectively. Oxidized triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols were more abundant in <b>mild</b> deodorized <b>oil</b> and refined oil than in extra virgin olive oil. The Factorial Discriminant Analysis of the data showed that the HPSEC analysis could reveal the presence of refined/mild deodorized oils in extra virgin olive oils. In particular, the classification functions obtained allowed designation of mixtures containing at least 30 g/ 100 g of <b>mild</b> deodorized <b>oil</b> and all those containing refined olive oil as deodorized oil, therefore as oils subjected to at least a mild refining treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program {{was to develop a}} method of removing oxygen from rapeseed oil in order to prepare the petroleum-comparative hydrocarbons under relatively <b>mild</b> conditions. Rapeseed <b>oil</b> was deoxygenated at various temperatures (220 − 300 °C) and pressures (15 – 70 bar) using different amounts of 66 % Ni/SiO 2 − Al 2 O 3 and Raney Ni catalysts (2 – 20 %) in a laboratory batch reactor over the time period between 1 and 6 h. Reaction products contained hydrocarbons, saturated mono-, di- and triglycerides, and carboxylic acids as the main components. The yield of hydrocarbons increased significantly with the increasing amount of the catalyst and/or reaction duration. The influence of temperature and pressure was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|The European Forecasting Network (EFN) is a {{research}} group of European institutions, founded in 2001 {{under the auspices of}} the European Commission. · The world economy is recovering, largely driven by upswings in most emerging market economies. Although growth in these regions is apparently calming down at present, the euro area will still be benefiting from the momentum of a healthily expanding world trade for much of the remaining year. · Rising exports will be the main driver of the recovery in the euro area during the first half of 2010. We expect euro area GDP to grow by around 1. 0 % in 2010 and 1. 6 % in 2011, respectively. Due to this increase in external demand, the growth rate of the industrial production index has also gained momentum: during 2010 the industrial production index is expected to grow around 7 %, though only at about 3 % in 2011. · In the coming winter, the momentum coming from external demand will decline and the effects of fiscal consolidation in Europe will increasingly be felt, but private consumption and investment should then recover and more than offset the negative effects from the slowdown in exports and the fiscal tightening. · The main risks for this forecast come, once again, from turmoil in financial markets: At present, worries about the financial strength of some euro area states and banks appear to amplify each other. Banks suffer from overexposure to public debt of dubious quality, while governments face the risk of new burdens from failing banks, in particular due to their overexposure to ailing construction sectors. · Inflation is expected to remain stable around a 1. 5 % year on year rate during 2010 and 2011. These projections assume a <b>mild</b> increase in <b>oil</b> prices during the forecasting horizon and a relatively stable euro/dollar exchange rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} in Calendula oil quality from fractions obtained after seed classification is enormous. The oil quality varies from excellent to very poor, according to important aspects {{such as in}} the hulls and dust fraction, high free fatty acid values (13 % vs. 0. 6 %) are found. This {{can be explained by the}} presence of active lipase enzymes in this fraction, possibly from fungal or microbial sources. In general, Calendula oil deterioration will occur after long periods of post-harvest storage due to seed damage and unfavourable quality conditions regarding moisture, temperature and enzymatic activity. The dark oil colour is probably caused by chemical/enzymatic oxidation and hydrolyzation and is very persistent during the chemical refining steps as degumming, refining, bleaching and deodorising. Processing the oil directly after harvesting, combined with nitrogen flushing and cold storage will probably prevent the formation of a dark colour. Lab-scale refining has shown that an excellent oil quality can be produced using a good initial oil quality. The use of high temperatures (200 °C or higher) for oil deodorisation will cause modification and polymerisation and the formation of calendic acid isomers. Calendula oil is rich in gamma (1800 - 1900 ppm) and alpha (270 ppm) tocopherol and its content is not affected by processing or refining and is relatively high compared to other tocopherol-rich sources such as soybean or maize oil. Recovery of these tocopherols can be of interest, both as a by-product (vitamin E) and to obtain reactive oils (low in anti-oxidant). However, special care must be taken to avoid changing the reactive character of the conjugated triens present in the oil. High temperatures should similarly be avoided while developing a <b>mild</b> process for <b>oil</b> deodorisation and tocopherol removal. Chemicals/CAS: alpha tocopherol, 1406 - 18 - 4, 1406 - 70 - 8, 52225 - 20 - 4, 58 - 95 - 7, 59 - 02 - 9; gamma tocopherol, 7616 - 22 -...|$|R
