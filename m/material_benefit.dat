500|$|Johnson {{made friends}} at Pembroke and read much. In later life, he told {{stories of his}} idleness. He was later asked by his tutor to produce a Latin {{translation}} of Alexander Pope's Messiah as a Christmas exercise. Johnson completed half of the translation in one afternoon and the rest the following morning. Although the poem brought him praise, it did not bring the <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> he had hoped for. The poem later appeared in Miscellany of Poems (1731), edited by John Husbands, a Pembroke tutor, and is the earliest surviving publication of any of Johnson's writings. Johnson {{spent the rest of}} his time studying, even during the Christmas holiday. He drafted a [...] "plan of study" [...] called [...] "Adversaria", which was left unfinished, and used his time to learn French while working on his Greek.|$|E
500|$|At Pembroke, Johnson {{made many}} friends, but {{neglected}} {{many of the}} mandatory lectures, and ignored calls for poems. He did complete one poem, {{the first of his}} tutorial exercises, on which he spent comparable time, and which provoked surprise and applause. He was later asked by his tutor to produce a Latin translation of Alexander Pope's Messiah as a Christmas exercise. Johnson completed half of the translation in one afternoon and the rest the following morning. Although the poem brought him praise, it did not bring the <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> he had hoped for. The poem was brought to Pope's attention; according to Sir John Hawkins, Pope claimed that he could not tell if it was the original or not. However, Johnson's friend John Taylor dismissed this [...] "praise" [...] because Johnson's father had already published the translation before Johnson sent a copy to Pope, and Pope could have been remarking about it being a duplication of the published edition.|$|E
2500|$|A {{factitious}} disorder {{is a condition}} in which a person, without a malingering motive, acts as if they have an illness by deliberately producing, feigning, or exaggerating symptoms, purely to attain a patient's role. [...] Factitious disorder imposed on another ("{{factitious disorder}} by proxy", also called Munchausen's syndrome by proxy) is {{a condition in which}} a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates the symptoms of someone in their care. [...] In either case, the perpetrator's motive is to attain (for themselves or for another) a patient's role. [...] Factitious disorder differs fundamentally from malingering in that the malingerer simulates illness with a view to obtaining a <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> or avoiding an obligation or responsibility.|$|E

2500|$|Canada's {{economic}} development in colonial times {{was based on the}} economic policy of [...] mercantilism. This economic idea sought to derive the maximum <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> from the colony, for the homeland, with a minimum of imperial investment in the colony itself. The ideology was embodied in New France through the establishment under Royal Charter of a number of corporate trading monopolies including La Compagnie des Marchands, which operated from 1613 to 1621 and the Compagnie de Montmorency, from that date until 1627. It was in turn replaced by La Compagnie des Cent-Associés created in 1627, by the King of France, Louis XIII and the Communauté des habitants in 1643. These were the first corporations to operate in what is now Canada.|$|E

60|$|But {{there are}} some minds which do not attach much value to moral {{influence}}, and to which <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> is an all-powerful argument. Well, then, to these we would address ourselves, but, in passing, would remark that moral influence goes far to secure for us material advantage. It is just because so many hundreds of human living souls are annually preserved to us that men turn with glowing gratitude to the rescuers and to the Institution which organises and utilises the latent philanthropy and pluck of our coast heroes. On an average, 800 lives are saved every year; while, despite our utmost efforts, 600 are lost. Those who know anything about our navy, and our want of British seamen to man our ships, cannot fail {{to see that the}} saving of so many valuable lives is a positive <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> to the nation. But to descend to the lowest point, we maintain that the value of the lifeboats to the nation, in the mere matter of saving property, is almost incredible. In regard to these things, it is possible to speak definitely.|$|E
60|$|If you {{chance to}} be an alumnus of Cornell you may recall Professor Arthur Maxon, a quiet, slender, white-haired gentleman, who for several years was an {{assistant}} professor in one of the departments of natural science. Wealthy by inheritance, he had chosen the field of education for his life work solely from a desire to be of some <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> to mankind since the meager salary which accompanied his professorship was not of sufficient import to influence him in the slightest degree.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the incitement of parental confusion {{in order to avoid}} infanticide, female primates that exhibit promiscuous behavior also reap non-genetic <b>material</b> <b>benefits.</b> A female that uses vocalizations after copulating with her mate attracts other males, with whom she is also likely to engage in multiple acts of mating. As a consequence male mates provide non-genetic benefits, such as food, to the female they mated with. Such vocalization-facilitated promiscuity heightens the female's reproductive success. The strategy to mate with multiple partners in order to obtain <b>material</b> <b>benefits</b> can equally be observed in non-primates.|$|R

60|$|When he had gazed on {{the sketch}} {{for an instant}} with surprise, Fenella took the book from his hand, laid her finger upon the drawing, and slowly and sternly shook her head, with a frown which seemed to {{prohibit}} the meeting which was there represented. Julian, however, though disconcerted, was in no shape disposed {{to submit to the}} authority of his monitress. By whatever means she, who so seldom stirred from the Countess's apartment, had become acquainted with a secret which he thought entirely his own, he esteemed it the more necessary to keep the appointed rendezvous, that he might learn from Alice, if possible, how the secret had transpired. He had also formed the intention of seeking out Bridgenorth; entertaining an idea that a person so reasonable and calm as he had shown himself in their late conference, might be persuaded, when he understood that the Countess was aware of his intrigues, {{to put an end to}} her danger and his own, by withdrawing from the island. And could he succeed in this point, he should at once, he thought, render a <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> to the father of his beloved Alice--remove the Earl from his state of anxiety--save the Countess from a second time putting her feudal jurisdiction in opposition to that of the Crown of England--and secure quiet possession of the island to her and her family.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{one said}} to {{me the other day}} that they {{considered}} this story to be of a pestilent example. I am not inclined to imagine we shall ever be put into any practical difficulty from a superfluity of Greenvilles. And besides, I demur to the opinion. The worth of such actions is not a thing to be decided in a quaver of sensibility or a flush of righteous common-sense. The man who wished to make the ballads of his country coveted a small matter compared to what Richard Greenville accomplished. I wonder how many people have been inspired by this mad story, and how many battles have been actually won for England in the spirit thus engendered. It is only with a measure of habitual foolhardiness that you can be sure, in the common run of men, of courage on a reasonable occasion. An army or a fleet, if it is not led by quixotic fancies, will not be led far by terror of the Provost-Marshal. Even German warfare, in addition to maps and telegraphs, is not above employing the [...] "Wacht am Rhein." [...] Nor is it only in the profession of arms that such stories may do good to a man. In this desperate and gleeful fighting, whether it is Greenville or Benbow, Hawke or Nelson, who flies his colours in the ship, we see men brought to the test and giving proof of what we call heroic feeling. Prosperous humanitarians tell me, in my club smoking-room, that they are a prey to prodigious heroic feelings, and that it costs them more nobility of soul to do nothing in particular, than would carry on all the wars, by sea or land, of bellicose humanity. It may very well be so, and yet not touch the point in question. For what I desire is to see some of this nobility brought face to face with me in an inspiriting achievement. A man may talk smoothly over a cigar in my club smoking-room from now to the Day of Judgment, without adding anything to mankind's treasury of illustrious and encouraging examples. It is not over the virtues of a curate-and-tea-party novel that people are abashed into high resolutions. It may be because their hearts are crass, but to stir them properly they must have men entering into glory with some pomp and circumstance. And that is why these stories of our sea-captains, printed, so to speak, in capitals, and full of bracing moral influence, are more valuable to England than any <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> in all the books of political economy between Westminster and Birmingham. Greenville chewing wine-glasses at table makes no very pleasant figure, any more than a thousand other artists when they are viewed in the body, or met in private life; but his work of art, his finished tragedy, is an eloquent performance; and I contend it ought not only to enliven men of the sword as they go into battle, but send back merchant-clerks with more heart and spirit to their book-keeping by double entry.|$|E

60|$|As you obligingly found {{space in}} your journal for {{observations}} of mine upon the intended Kendal and Windermere Railway, I venture {{to send you}} some further remarks upon the same subject. The scope of the main argument, it will be recollected, was {{to prove that the}} perception of what has acquired the name of picturesque and romantic scenery is so far from being intuitive, that it can be produced only by a slow and gradual process of culture; and to show, as a consequence, that the humbler ranks of society are not, and cannot be, in a state to gain <b>material</b> <b>benefit</b> from a more speedy access than they now have to this beautiful region. Some of our opponents dissent from this latter proposition, though the most judicious of them readily admit the former; but then, overlooking not only positive assertions, but reasons carefully given, they say, 'As you allow that a more comprehensive taste is desirable, you ought to side with us;' and they illustrate their position, by reference to the British Museum and National Picture Gallery. 'There,' they add, 'thanks to the easy entrance now granted, numbers are seen, indicating by their dress and appearance their humble condition, who, when admitted for the first time, stare vacantly around them, so that one is inclined to ask what brought them hither? But an impression is made, something gained which may induce them to repeat the visit until light breaks in upon them, and they take an intelligent interest in what they behold.' Persons who talk thus forget that, to produce such an improvement, frequent access at small cost of time and labour is indispensable. Manchester lies, perhaps, within eight hours' railway distance of London; but surely no one would advise that Manchester operatives should contract a habit of running to and fro between that town and London, for the sake of forming an intimacy with the British Museum and National Gallery? No, no; little would all but a very few gain from the opportunities which, consistently with common sense, could be afforded them for such expeditions. Nor would it fare better with them in respect of trips to the lake district; an assertion, the truth of which no one can doubt, who has learned by experience how many men of the same or higher rank, living from their birth in this very region, are indifferent to those objects around them in which a cultivated taste takes so much pleasure. I should not have detained the reader so long upon this point, had I not heard (glad tidings for the directors and traffickers in shares!) that among the affluent and benevolent manufacturers of Yorkshire and Lancashire are some who already entertain the thought of sending, at their own expense, large bodies of their workmen, by railway, to the banks of Windermere. Surely those gentlemen will think a little more before they put such a scheme into practice. The rich man cannot benefit the poor, nor the superior the inferior, by anything that degrades him. Packing off men after this fashion, for holiday entertainment, is, in fact, treating them like children. They go at the will of their master, and must return at the same, or they will be dealt with as transgressors.|$|E
