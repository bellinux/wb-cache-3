40|$|This {{paper is}} written {{to create a}} deeper {{understanding}} of how social <b>media</b> and mobile <b>phones</b> have influenced individuals' social interaction. The empirical data were collected through interviews with four different groups based on age and gender. These were then analyzed with Anders Persson's interpretation of Goffman's sociology. Through this I have answered my purpose: How social <b>media</b> and mobile <b>phones</b> changed the essence of social interaction. In the area of social <b>media</b> and mobile <b>phones,</b> there isn’t access to so much previous research, since the phenomenon is relatively new. The previous research available has been displayed a greater social contact with other individuals with an increased use of the internet. But this is only up to a certain limit of usage after the limit has been reached social interaction face to face between individual’s drops. The results show that social interaction changed character, but can be a tool for individuals in communication with others. Contact with other individuals is now easier and can be performed on several levels simultaneously. This has resulted in that individuals have a larger network now than before whit more shallow relationships. They still have a deeper contact with certain individuals. This contact also benefit from social <b>media</b> and mobile <b>phones.</b> But social <b>media</b> and mobile <b>phones</b> can´t replace the physical contact between people.

50|$|<b>Media</b> <b>phone</b> is {{basically}} a replacement for a traditional home cordless telephone. All calls (voice only by Verizon Hub, AT&T Home Manager and voice&video by Korea Telecom Wave Home) are IP based. The call functionality is provided by embedded software - by a voice engine for voice-only calls and by a voice&video engine for video calls. The voice&video engine is required {{to compensate for the}} commonly known IP-related issues (delays, packet loss, jitter, congestion, etc.) and to make IP calls as reliable and convenient as conventional PSTN calls.|$|E

These features create a new advertising platform for businesses and a revolutionary new home security format which provides <b>Media</b> <b>Phone</b> users the ability to monitor their home or business remotely from any computer or smart phone. This same remote viewing feature also allows 911 dispatchers to identify potential threats such as intruders, fire or EMS needs before dispatching emergency responders.|$|E

The Verizon Hub did not require the owner to have Verizon Fios. and connected to a wireless network. It featured a wireless handset and speakerphone. The hub also allowed users to send text and photo messages, but only to other Verizon Wireless phones. Because the device utilized voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology, users were able set the hub to forward calls to another phone number {{in the event of}} a power or internet outage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{emphasis}} in research points to youth stemming {{back from the}} 1990s exposure to cell phones, social <b>media,</b> <b>phone</b> gaming, messaging,etc. Modern technology has encompassed and enhanced features of phones in order to appeal to younger users. Young and old generations have examples of mobile panic, however young generations have the current target consumer market. Exposure to sexuality or violence as a youth has been debated and discussed as to the implications later in individuals life. Questions and concerns about exposure to overload of information as a youth {{and the effects of}} potential attention deficit behavior or other mental health issues have also been raised. Further research has been expressed as lacking or underrepresented for the potential severity of the issue. [...] "Research partnerships involving scholars of communication, technology and society, criminology, youth studies and other cognate disciplines should be more actively fostered to comprehensively explore the significance of mobile communications in the overall context of youth development, and investigate issues of boundary-testing and delinquency for youths-at-risk"(Lim, 2013).|$|E

30|$|Networks are {{ubiquitous}} to {{most parts}} of society; we live in social networks (we are social animals) and use online social networks as means of communication (social <b>media,</b> <b>phone</b> networks, SMS, etc.); we deal with malicious threats (cyber-attacks to computer networks, terrorism, disruptions to infrastructure, etc.); we use resources such as electricity and the Internet; the structure of these networks relate directly to their resilience; we worry about pandemics {{and the spread of}} disease {{as a function of the}} connectivity of networks (of contacts between people, flight patterns); networks of authors, musicians, actors, and athletes may help us understand what leads to success in these fields; to name just a few examples. Ultimately, understanding networks may enable better solutions to such problems as well as applications to other complex systems.|$|E
30|$|With {{advances}} in technology, humans have begun {{using a variety}} of new communication channels. It is known that the different networks of interactions (physical contacts, online social <b>media,</b> <b>phone</b> calls, etc.) correspond to different types of communication and can be the proxy for the strength of the social ties. Due to the varying function of these communication modes, it is interesting to ask the question: Are the same individuals central in all networks? Here we studied differences among individuals that are central in two fundamentally diverse environments: the network of physical proximity contacts and in digital communication networks (Facebook interactions and phone calls). By locating central members within all three networks for a single coherent population, we find that the central members are described by qualitatively different presence and activity patterns in the physical contact networks. We note however, that our population of students is not representative of a general population. Therefore, {{further research is needed to}} validate the generality of our findings.|$|E
