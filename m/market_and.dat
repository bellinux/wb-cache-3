40|$|The {{structuring}} of <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> {{communication management}} within key organisations in South Africa is changing. These changes are affecting {{the relationship between}} <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication practitioners, {{as well as the}} key tasks they are responsible for within the organisation. Globally, companies are downsizing, restructuring and eliminating hierarchy. This article investigates how key South African companies have responded to these changes, by looking at how the <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication functions are structured within the organisation. <b>Marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication managers from top South African companies were interviewed telephonically. Findings from the study indicate that the two functions are progressively moving towards an integrated approach. However, a commonly agreed organisational structure is still not pervasive. Each organisation structured the <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication functions differently, and various perspectives existed on the key tasks of both <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication managers. From these findings, it is evident that the relationship between <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication, as well as the role <b>and</b> tasks of <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication managers, is still very diverse in the South African context...|$|R

5|$|By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable {{market had}} {{developed}} {{on the south}} side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both the <b>market</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century it had become a well-known red-light district. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler's neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter <b>Market,</b> <b>and</b> in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the New Covent Garden Market about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.|$|E
