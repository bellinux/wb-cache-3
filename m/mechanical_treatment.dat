Both the short-needle and long-needle forest types received either prescribed fire or <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments,</b> while the red fir group was only treated with mechanical methods. Mechanical methods included hand cutting and piling of fuels, which were sometimes burned; thinning; thinning followed by chipping; mastication; and whole tree biomass removal.

25|$|The Bohr–Sommerfeld {{model was}} {{fundamentally}} inconsistent {{and led to}} many paradoxes. The magnetic quantum number measured the tilt of the orbital plane relative to the xy-plane, and it could only take a few discrete values. This contradicted the obvious fact that an atom could be turned {{this way and that}} relative to the coordinates without restriction. The Sommerfeld quantization can be performed in different canonical coordinates and sometimes gives different answers. The incorporation of radiation corrections was difficult, because it required finding action-angle coordinates for a combined radiation/atom system, which is difficult when the radiation is allowed to escape. The whole theory did not extend to non-integrable motions, which meant that many systems could not be treated even in principle. In the end, the model was replaced by the modern quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatment</b> of the hydrogen atom, which was first given by Wolfgang Pauli in 1925, using Heisenberg's matrix mechanics. The current picture of the hydrogen atom is based on the atomic orbitals of wave mechanics which Erwin Schrödinger developed in 1926.|$|E

The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of three <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments</b> on fibre and paper properties. The wing defibrator, the E-compactor, and the Valley beater were used for treating chemical softwood pulp. It was found that the type and intensity of <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments</b> significantly affect the formation of fibre deformations, and thus the resulting properties of paper.

500|$|The revised 2010 forest plan {{recognized}} the need to develop plans to manage wildfires at the wildland–urban interface, use prescribed fire as a tool to manage ecosystem health, and meet air quality requirements set by the Clean Air Act. The forest operates a fire management plan under federal fire policy that gives fire personnel direction for responding to unintended ignitions. Occasionally, area closures and restrictions on use, such as prohibition of campfires, are implemented to aid in wildfire prevention. Following severe fires, area closures may be put in place to protect the public from risks such as falling trees and landslides. Proactive fire management strategies include prescribed burns and mechanical reduction of fuel levels.

500|$|Edward Teller ( [...] ; January 15, 1908– September 9, 2003) was a Hungarian-American {{theoretical}} physicist who {{was born}} in Hungary, and is known colloquially as [...] "the father of the hydrogen bomb", although he claimed he did not care for the title. He made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (in particular the Jahn–Teller and Renner–Teller effects), and surface physics. His extension of Enrico Fermi's theory of beta decay, in the form of Gamow–Teller transitions, provided an important stepping stone in its application, while the Jahn–Teller effect and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry.

30|$|There {{are three}} general fire and fuels {{management}} approaches for achieving resource objectives {{in the southern}} Sierra Nevada: <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments,</b> prescribed fire, and wildfires managed to meet resource management objectives. These fire management tools have specific advantages and constraints when applied exclusively or in combination at different spatial scales (Collins et al. 2010, Quinn-Davidson and Varner 2011, Ryan et al. 2013). The extent to which land managers implement each of these approaches varies among the federal agencies in the ecoregion, with relatively greater use of wildland fire by the NPS, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments</b> by the FS and BLM.

40|$|The Piedmont Region of South Carolina {{experienced}} one of {{the heaviest}} attacks of southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimm.) in history during {{the early part of}} this decade. Managers with both commercial objectives and restoration objectives needed information on how prescribed burning or <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments</b> can be used to reduce the heavy fuels resulting from these attacks, without neglecting their primary management objectives. Prescribed burning is of concern because intensities are expected to be high and fires may damage soils, neighboring trees, or target vegetation. Methods of predicting fire behavior and fuel consumption are unavailable. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>treatments</b> will reduce fuels but are expensive and may not control vegetation that would out-compete planted pines, oak sprouts, or other target vegetation...|$|R
30|$|When devising fuel treatments, land {{managers}} {{should consider the}} effect of the treatment on many factors, including potential wildfire behavior, fuels, vegetation, wildlife, aquatic systems, water, air, soils, cultural resources, and economics (Peterson and Johnson 2007). The decision between using mechanical methods and prescribed fire is not often straightforward. While prescription burning restores fire to the landscape and reduces surface fuel loads, issues such as smoke management, risk of fire escape, and difficulty of burn implementation can limit the ability to use prescribed fire (Stephens and Moghaddas 2005 b, Stephens and Ruth 2005). <b>Mechanical</b> <b>treatments</b> have increased precision and do not create hazards associated with prescribed fire such as smoke and risk of escape (Stephens and Moghaddas 2005 b, Huggett et al. 2008). However, <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments</b> can cause soil disturbance (Neary et al. 1999), disruption to nutrient cycling (Jurgensen et al. 1997), and possible damage to trees left after treatment. Two of the many reasons <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments</b> were chosen over prescribed fire for this study were proximity to homes and the need to alter forest and fuel structure before reintroducing fire to the treatment area.|$|R
30|$|Although {{rate of spread}} {{does not}} have {{distinct}} categories as do flame length and fire line intensity, {{it can also be}} used to assess treatment effectiveness. Lower ROS coupled with lower FL and FI can result in smaller fire extent and affords fire suppression resources more opportunity to control a fire. Prescribed fire reduced ROS under both wind scenarios. The decrease of FL, FI, and ROS due to prescribed fire is not surprising given the reduction in surface fuels, which is similar to findings in past research (van Wagtendonk 1996, Knapp et al. 2005, Stephens and Moghaddas 2005 a, Keifer et al. 2006, Vaillant et al. 2009). As with fire type, <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments</b> had varied effects on ROS under both windspeeds. This mixed effect is likely due to the variety of <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments,</b> their associated impact on surface and canopy fuels, and the assumptions used to characterize these changes when applying fire behavior models. Consequently, when evaluating the effectiveness of <b>mechanical</b> <b>treatments,</b> it is important to take into consideration the treatment prescription, the treatment objective, and the resultant impact on surface and canopy fuels.|$|R

In 1928, Linus Pauling published a review putting together the work of Burrau with the work of Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule.|$|E
