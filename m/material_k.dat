Although {{it is now}} introduced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, spin on deposition (SOD) process is more promisible because of superior cap fill property for narrow and high aspect ratio trench as well as low cost process. Generally, ILD materials required very strong mechanical, thermal, and chemical stabilities because of severe IC built up process. Silicon oxides were often used for this application, which could be introduced by SOD process with sol precursor solution followed by vitrification in high temperature. However, repetition of drastic temperature changes sometimes gives rise to crack in the ILD and/or the interface between the ILD and the metal line. In this study, we developed novel ILD material, which was not necessary for any vitrification process.

A method for isotopic determination of S by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in soil samples is proposed. The procedure involves the oxidation of organic S to sulphate (S-SO 4 (2 -)), which was determined by dry combustion with alkaline oxidizing agents. The total S-SO 4 (2 -) concentration was determined by turbidimetry and the results showed that the conversion process was adequate. To produce gaseous SO 2 gas, BaSO 4 was thermally decomposed in a vacuum system at 900 ºC in the presence of NaPO 3.

Our recent observation of SC at 6. 1 K in correlated electron <b>material</b> <b>K</b> 2 Cr 3 As 3 (J. K. Bao et al., arXiv: 1412. 0067) represents an obviously different paradigm, primarily because of its quasi-one-dimensional (Q 1 D) nature. The new material is structurally featured by the (Cr 3 As 3) 2 - double-walled subnano-tubes composed of face-sharing Cr 6 / 2 (As 6 / 2) octahedron linear chains, which are well separated by columns of K+ counterions. Later, an isostructural superconducting Rb 2 Cr 3 As 3 was synthesized, thus forming a new superconducting family.

The already-reported causes of these effects upon doping KNN were critically discussed and a {{mechanism of the}} effects’ formation was suggested and experimentally supported with advanced analytical methods. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses proved that the Sr occupies the perovskite A-sublattice, and locally modifies the KNN monoclinic structure to cubic. With the help of Sr K-edge EXAFS and wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, the Sr {{was found to be}} homogenously distributed in the KNN perovskite lattice with 0. 5, 1 and 2 % Sr and no Sr segregation on the nano level was found in any of the studied samples with transmission electron microscopy. Introducing Sr into the A-sublattice, as well as accounting for the charge-compensating A-site vacancies in the starting composition, causes increasing lattice disorder and microstrain, as determined from a Rietveld refinement of the synchrotron X-ray diffraction data. Above 2 % Sr the system segregates the A-site vacancies in a secondary phase in order to release the chemical pressure, as revealed by Raman spectroscopy.
