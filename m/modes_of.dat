5|$|In various {{applications}} to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms {{the foundation for}} the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> vibration that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, that represent the fundamental <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> vibration in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> vibration of the violin string.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This is good for longitudinal <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E

40|$|The task of {{this article}} is to analyze the {{political}} economy of Wikipedia. We discuss the specifics <b>of</b> Wikipedia’s <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production. The basic principles of what we call the info-communist <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production will be presented. Our analysis is grounded in Marxist philosophy and Marxist political economy, and is connected to the current discourse about the renewal and reloading of the idea of communism that is undertaken by thinkers like Slavoj Žižek and Alain Badiou. We explore to which extent Wikipedia encompasses principles that go beyond the capitalist <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production and represent the info-communist <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production. We present the subjective dimension <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production (cooperative labor), the objective dimension <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production (common ownership of the means of production), and the subject–object dimension <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production (the effects and products <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production) ...|$|R
50|$|For Marx, {{the whole}} 'secret' of why/how a social order exists and {{the causes of}} social change must be {{discovered}} in the specific <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production that a society has. He further argued that the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production substantively shaped the nature <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> distribution, the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> circulation and the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> consumption, all of which together constitute the economic sphere. To understand the way wealth was distributed and consumed, {{it was necessary to}} understand the conditions under which it was produced.|$|R
