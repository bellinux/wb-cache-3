40|$|Surface tention (ST) is a physical-chemical {{parameter}} {{that informs}} {{about the presence}} of surface-active agents (surfactants) in the aqueous environment. The article proposes to obtain experimentally ST (1 ST) time dependence of the controlled aqueous environment and to judge by the equilibrium ST value (EST) about the surfactant concentration in such an environment, based on the previously received calibration dependence of EST on the concentration of respective surfactant in the aqueous environment. EST dependence of controlled aqueous environment is recommended to get though ST measurements by pulsing <b>meniscus</b> <b>method</b> based on the measurement of maximum pressure in the bubble (MPB) without its separation. The essence of pulsing <b>meniscus</b> <b>method</b> has been described. The advantage of this method over usual MPB method is that in the process of obtaining 1 ST dependence and EST value one should use the same air meniscus surface at the end of metering capillary submerged in the sample of the investigated aqueous environment. It considerably speeds up the process of getting 1 ST dependence and EST value of aqueous environment. The article contains a block diagram, appearance and work description of a device that implements pulsing <b>meniscus</b> <b>method</b> with the application of microcontrollers and hydraulic damper of depth of the metering capillary submersion in the controlled aqueous environment.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an improved method of straightening DNA molecules for use in optical restriction mapping. The DNA was straightened on 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated glass slides using surface tension generated by a moving <b>meniscus.</b> In our <b>method</b> the <b>meniscus</b> motion was controlled mechanically, which provides advantages of speed and uniformity of the straightened molecules. Variation in the affinity of the silanized surfaces for DNA was compensated by precoating the slide with single-stranded non-target blocking DNA. A small amount of MgCl 2 added to the DNA suspension increased the DNA-surface affinity and was necessary for efficient restriction enzyme digestion of the straightened surface-bound DNA. By adjusting the amounts of blocking DNA and MgCl 2, we prepared slides that contained many straight parallel DNA molecules.

40|$|The {{stresses}} {{acting in}} interfacial adsorption layers with surface shear elasticity are, in general, anisotropic and non-uniform. If a pendant drop or buoyant bubble {{is covered with}} such elastic layer, the components of surface tension acting along the "meridians" and "parallels", σ s and σ ϕ, can be different and, then, the conventional drop shape analysis (DSA) is inapplicable. Here, a method for determining σ s and σ ϕ is developed for axisymmetric <b>menisci.</b> This <b>method,</b> called 'capillary <b>meniscus</b> dynamometry' (CMD), is based on processing data for the digitized drop/bubble profile and capillary pressure. The principle of the CMD procedure for data processing is essentially {{different from that of}} DSA. Applying the tangential and normal surface stress balance equations, σ s and σ ϕ are determined in each interfacial point without using any rheological model. The computational procedure is fast and could be used in real time, during a given process. The method is applied to determine σ s and σ ϕ for bubbles and drops formed on the tip of a capillary immersed in solutions of the protein HFBII hydrophobin. Upon a surface compression, meridional wrinkles appear on the bubble surface below the bubble "equator", where the azimuthal tension σ ϕ takes negative values. The CMD method allows one to determine the local tensions acting in anisotropic interfacial layers (films, membranes), like those formed from proteins, polymers, asphaltenes and phospholipids. The CMD is applicable also to fluid interfaces (e. g. surfactant solutions), for which it gives the same surface tension as the conventional methods. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Ligament and meniscal damage {{can cause}} joint disease. Arthritic joints contain {{increased}} amounts of {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) protein, and polymorphisms in EGFR are associated with arthritis risk. The role of endogenous EGFR regulation during joint disease due to ligament and meniscal trauma is unknown. Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG- 6) can reduce EGFR phosphorylation and downstream signaling. We examined the effect of EGFR modulation by MIG- 6 on joint disease development after ligament and <b>meniscus</b> injury. <b>Methods</b> Knee ligament transection and meniscus removal were performed surgically on mice homozygous for a global inactivating mutation in MIG- 6 (Mig- 6 −/−) and in wild-type (WT) animals. Results Two weeks after surgery, Mig- 6 −/− mice had bone erosion as well as greater fibrous tissue area and serum RANKL concentration than WT mice. Four weeks after surgery, Mig- 6 −/− mice had less cartilage and increased cell proliferation relative to contralateral control and WT knees. Increased apoptotic cells and growth outside the articulating region occurred in Mig- 6 −/− mice. Tibia trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) {{and the number of}} trabeculae were lower in surgically treated knees relative to the respective control knees for both groups. BMD, as well as trabecular thickness and number, were lower in surgically treated knees from Mig- 6 −/− mice relative to WT surgically treated knees. Phosphorylated EGFR staining in surgically treated knees decreased for WT mice and increased for Mig- 6 −/− mice. Fewer inflammatory cells were present in the knees of WT mice. Conclusion Mig- 6 −/− mice have rapid and increased joint damage after ligament and meniscal trauma. Mig- 6 modification could lessen degenerative disease development after this type of injury...|$|R
40|$|Background Although {{relatively}} uncommon, spontane-ous healing from a meniscus injury {{has been}} observed even within the avascular area. This {{may be the result}} of the existence of mesenchymal stem cells in synovial fluid. Questions/purposes The purpose of this study was to investigate whether mesenchymal stem cells existed in the synovial fluid of the knee after <b>meniscus</b> injury. <b>Methods</b> Synovial fluid was obtained from the knees of 22 patients with meniscus injury just before meniscus surgery and from 8 volunteers who had no history of knee injury. The cellular fraction of the synovial fluid was cul-tured for 14 days followed by analysis for multilineage potential and presentation of surface antigens characteristic of mesenchymal stem cells. Colony-forming efficiency and proliferation potential were also compared between the two groups. Results Cells with characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells were observed in the synovial fluid of injured knees to a much greater degree than in uninjured knees. The colony-forming cells derived from the synovial fluid of the knee with meniscus injury had multipotentiality and surface epitopes identical to mesenchymal stem cells. The average number of colony formation, obtained from 1 mL of synovial fluid, in meniscus-injured knees was 250, higher than that from healthy volunteers, which was 0. 5 (p 0. 001). Total colony number per synovial fluid vol-ume was positively correlated with the postinjury period (r = 0. 77, p 0. 001). Conclusions Mesenchymal stem cells were found to exist in synovial fluid from knees after meniscus injury. Mes-enchymal stem cells were present in higher numbers in synovial fluid with meniscus injury than in normal knees. Total colony number per synovial fluid volume was posi-tively correlated with the postinjury period.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveIn this {{observational}} {{longitudinal study}} we estimate knee joint cartilage glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, {{in patients with}} an acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, {{with or without a}} concomitant <b>meniscus</b> injury. <b>Methods</b> 29 knees (19 men/ 10 women) were prospectively examined by repeat delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC), approximately 3 weeks and 2. 3 ± 1. 3 (range 4. 5) years after the injury. We estimated the GAG content (T 1 Gd) in the central weight-bearing parts of the medial and lateral femoral cartilage and compared results with a reference cohort (n= 24) with normal knees and no history of injury examined by dGEMRIC at one occasion previously. ResultsThe healthy reference group had longer T 1 Gd values compared with the ACL-injured patients at follow-up both medially: 428 ± 38 vs 363 ± 61 ms (P< 0. 0001) and laterally: 445 ± 41 vs 396 ± 48 ms (P= 0. 0002). At follow-up T 1 Gd was lower in meniscectomized patients compared to those without a meniscectomy, both medially (− 84 ms, P= 0. 002) and laterally (− 38 ms, P= 0. 05). In the injured group, the medial femoral cartilage showed similar T 1 Gd at the two dGEMRIC investigations: 357 ± 50 vs 363 ± 61 ms (P= 0. 57), whereas the lateral femoral cartilage T 1 Gd increased: 374 ± 48 vs 396 ± 48 ms (P= 0. 04). ConclusionsThe general decrease in cartilage T 1 Gd in ACL-injured patients compared with references provide evidence for structural matrix GAG changes that seem more pronounced if a concomitant meniscal injury is present. The fact that post-traumatic OA commonly develops in ACL-injured patients, in particularly those with meniscectomy, suggests that shorter T 1 Gd may be an early biomarker for OA...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} Ge(sub 1 -x) Si(sub x) crystal growth {{experiments}} are {{planned to be}} conducted in the Low Gradient Furnace (LGF) onboard the International Space Station. The primary objective of the research {{is to determine the}} influence of containment on the processing-induced defects and impurity incorporation in germanium-silicon alloy crystals. A comparison will be made between crystals grown by the normal and 'detached' Bridgman methods and the ground-based float zone technique. 'Detached' or 'dewetted' Bridgman growth is similar to regular Bridgman growth in that most of the melt is in contact with the crucible wall, but the crystal is separated from the wall by a small gap, typically of the order of 10 - 100 microns. A meniscus bridges this gap between the top of the crystal and the crucible wall.

Materials and <b>methods.</b> <b>Meniscus</b> and joint cartilage specimen obtained during total knee replacement were placed in a normal saline. All experiments were conducted no later than in 2 hours after obtaining and followed by histology of biopsy specimens. In the first series of experiment the authors performed meniscus dissection with ultrasound instrument «Scalpel», cold plasm ablator and surgical scalpel. Results. The first series of experiments demonstrated disruption of fibers orientation on meniscus rim after dissection with scalpel; necrosis depth after coblation is 0, 7 - 0, 8 mm. Ultrasound dissection devices leave necrosis depth of 0, 1 - 0, 2 mm and smooth cartilage surface. The second series of experiments proved that after shaver application cartilage surface was coarse; certain necrosis sections of 16 - 90 nm were observed on relatively smooth cartilage surface after coblation. Application of ultrasound «Miller» device leaves smooth cartilage surface with no fibers, no signs of cartilage thinning and necrosis not exceeding 15 nm. Conclusion. The results of experiments confirm that use of low frequency ultrasound dissection devices is advantageous as compared to mechanical and ablation cutting techniques while ensuring histologically proven atraumatic handling of biopsy specimens of meniscus and hyaline cartilage. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveRepair {{approaches}} for the non-vascular meniscus are rarely developed. Recent strategies use scaffold-based techniques and inducing factors. The {{aim of the}} study was the investigation of cell recruitment and re-differentiation inducing factors for a scaffold-based <b>meniscus</b> repair approach. <b>Method</b> 3 D cultivation of in vitro expanded human meniscus-derived cells was performed in high-density cultures supplemented with 25 % hyaluronic acid (HA), 10 % human serum (HS) or 10  ng/ml transforming growth factor (TGF-ß 3) compared to untreated controls. The in vitro cell recruitment potential of different HS concentrations was tested by chemotaxis assay. Analysis of chondrocytic markers (type I, II, IX collagen and proteoglycans) was performed on protein and gene expression level. ResultsCells were attracted by 1 – 20 % HS. 3 D cultures supplemented with 10 % HS and 25 % HA showed meniscus-like gene expression profiles at day 7 with significantly increased cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and aggrecan expression levels in the HS group and a slightly increased profile in the HA group compared to control. The TGF-ß 3 group showed an additional induction of gene expression levels for type II and type IX collagen. Histological findings confirmed these results by proteoglycan and type I collagen staining in all groups and type II collagen staining only in the TGF-ß 3 group. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that human meniscus cells are attracted by HS and allow for meniscal matrix formation in 3 D culture in the presence of HA and HS, whereas TGF-ß 3 additive does not initiate meniscal tissue.

Specifically, we present an implementation of a knee surgery assistance system that includes novel techniques for 3 D knee model reconstruction, motion simulation, biomechanical visualization, and virtual surgery. First, we present a new reconstruction technique that generates patient-specific 3 D knee models from patient s magnetic resonant images (MRIs).

40|$|Objectives Meniscal {{damage is}} a {{recognised}} feature of knee osteoarthritis (OA), although its clinical relevance remains uncertain. This study describes vascular penetration and nerve growth in human menisci, providing a potential {{mechanism for the}} genesis of pain in knee OA. <b>Methods</b> <b>Menisci</b> obtained post mortem were screened {{on the basis of}} high or low macroscopic tibiofemoral chondropathy as a measure of the presence and degree of OA. Forty cases (20 per group) were selected for the study of meniscal vascularity, and 16 (eight per group) for the study of meniscal innervation. Antibodies directed against α-actin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were used to localise blood vessels and nerves by histochemistry. Image analysis was used to compare vascular and nerve densities between groups. Data are presented as median (IQR). Results Menisci from knees with high chondropathy displayed degeneration of collagen bundles in their outer regions, which were more vascular than the inner regions, with an abrupt decrease in vascularity at the fi brocartilage junction. Vascular densities were increased in menisci from the high compared with low chondropathy group both in the synovium (3. 8 % (IQR 2. 6 – 5. 2), 2. 0 % (IQR 1. 4 – 2. 9), p= 0. 002) and at the fi brocartilage junction (2. 3 % (IQR 1. 7 – 3. 1), 1. 1 % (IQR 0. 8 – 1. 9), p= 0. 003), with a greater density of perivascular sensory nerve profi les in the outer region (high chondropathy group, 144 nerve profi les/mm 2 (IQR 134 – 189); low chondropathy group, 119 nerve profi les/mm 2 (IQR 104 – 144), p= 0. 049). Conclusion Tibiofemoral chondropathy is associated with altered matrix structure, increased vascular penetration, and increased sensory nerve densities in the medial meniscus.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Liquid menisci in small pores exhibit a curved surface across {{which there is a}} significant pressure difference. The capillary properties of such surfaces are important in many areas of science and technology. Pores of uniform section can be broadly classified according to whether the perimeter is smooth (as in cylindrical tubes) or angular (as in triangular tubes). A meniscus that is entirely bounded by the pore walls has a curvature that is inversely proportional to the tubes' hydraulic radius. A meniscus in an angular tube, however, has liquid wedges in the corners and this reduces the effective area of the pore. In the past it has been difficult to calculate the curvatures, of this class of menisci. Some recent studies have shown that a relatively straightforward, but hitherto neglected, method originated by Mayer & Stowe (1965) and Princen (1969 a) can be applied to analyse wedging <b>menisci.</b> However, the <b>method</b> has lacked a comprehensive experimental verification. This investigation follows on from the previously limited studies. A standardised method for the application of the analysis is described, the results from which are compared to observations made using modified experimental procedures. The behaviour of the capillary surfaces formed in several model pores are analysed with the method. The model systems studied are rectangular ducts, the pores formed by a rod in an angled corner, by two contacting rods and a plate and the space between a rod and a plate. For the latter two shapes the analysis is extended to include systems of mixed wettability which have a particular bearing on enhanced oil recovery operations. Experiments in which curvatures are inferred from observations of capillary rise, are performed using two comparative techniques.
