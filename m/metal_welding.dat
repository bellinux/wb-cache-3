40|$|Typically, when gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (GTAW) is employed to join near-alpha titanium alloys, the resulting weld fusion zone (FZ) {{is much harder}} than that of the base metal (BM), thereby leading to lost ductility. The aim of this investigation was to improve FZ ductility of Ti- 5 Al- 1 Sn- 1 V- 1 Zr- 0. 8 Mo by modifying filler metal chemistry. In this regard, metallic yttrium was added to the filler metal and aluminum concentration reduced. It was believed that additions of yttrium would lead to formation of yttria in the weld melt, thereby promoting heterogeneous nucleation. Since oxygen and aluminum both act as alpha-stabilizers, expected pickup of oxygen during the welding process will be offset by the aluminum reduction. Tensile testing indicated that modified filler <b>metal</b> <b>welds</b> showed a dramatic increase in ductility of the FZ. Fracture toughness testing showed that while JIC values decreased in all welds, the tearing modulus, T, in modified filler <b>metal</b> <b>welds</b> was significantly higher than that of matching filler <b>metal</b> <b>welds.</b> Microhardness mapping of the weld zones illustrated that modified filler <b>metal</b> <b>welds</b> were significantly softer than matching filler <b>metal</b> <b>welds.</b> Microstructural examinations were completed through the use of optical, SEM and TEM studies, indicating that there was a presence of nano-particles in the weld FZ. XPS analysis identified these particles as yttrium oxysulfate. WDS analysis across the welds' heat affected zones demonstrated that there is an internal diffusion of oxygen from the BM into the FZ. Research results indicate yttrium oxysulfide particles form in the weld pool, act as a drag force on the solidification front and limit growth of prior-beta grain boundaries. The reduced prior-beta grain size and removal of interstitial oxygen from the matrix in modified filler <b>metal</b> <b>welds,</b> further enhanced by oxidation of yttrium oxysulfide to yttrium oxysulfate, leads to increased ductility in the weld's FZ.
