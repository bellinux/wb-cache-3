A new refurbished bus zone was also built as a result. (A temporary bus zone was constructed adjacent to Kmart Tyre & Auto during construction).|$|E

The follow-up [...] "Birthday Party" [...] {{went on to become}} a hit as well. In 1981 Grandmaster Flash released [...] "The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel", This was a <b>multi</b> <b>deck</b> live recording of one of Grandmaster flash's routines featuring, Queen's [...] "Another One Bites the Dust" [...] and Chic's [...] "Good Times". It also marked the first time that scratching & turntablism had been actually recorded on a record.|$|E
40|$|In Europe, Ecodesign and Energy Labelling {{regulations}} for refrigerated retail display cabinets {{will come into}} force in January 2017 and manufacturers are seeking new technologies to maximise the efficiency of their products. Conventional <b>multi</b> <b>deck</b> cabinets have a single column of cold air from the top {{to the bottom of}} the merchandising envelope. The colder, denser air causes a stack effect and pressure builds at the base of air curtain causing cold air spillage from the cabinet and compromising temperature stability and energy efficiency. By contrast, with short air curtains the merchandising envelope can be divided into separate cells between shelves. The smaller cells have a shorter air column and independent management of air movement. The net result is a substantial reduction in cold air spillage from the case and improved temperature stability. This paper presents a technical and performance comparison between short air curtain technology and conventional cabinets...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} in electronic detonators has increased due to its reported ability to define sequences that can significantly improve blasting results and lower environmental impact {{in relation to the}} mining and quarrying industry. However, few actual scientific studies have been carried out and published. This thesis investigates the use of electronic detonator with the aim of controlling and minimising the environmental impact of blasting. Its use was examined by comparing their performance to current non-electric detonators by performing a series of full scale like-for-like experiments under strict operational procedures in a variety of rock hosts. In addition, two single hole <b>multi</b> <b>deck</b> blasts were carried out to assess the influence of both distance and individual location response. The results obtained indicate that {{it is not possible to}} select one electronic detonator timing interval that will give rise to the absolute lowest Peak Particle Velocity for all observation points. However, it showed that it is possible to choose the 'least worst' option for all or just a number of specific monitoring locations. From this it has been possible to establish a methodology that could be used to reduce the peak particle velocities at multiple locations by using single hole blast vibration signatures in conjunction with specific electronic detonator timing intervals. The study has concluded that this would only be possible if, as the blasting pattern encroaches on specific properties, that periodically single hole signature blasts were carried out to establish the shape ofthe relevant actual vibration envelopes. These wave envelopes could be used as the basis for choosing the specific electronic detonator timing intervals to give the lowest common peak particle velocity for the properties concerned thus controlling the environmental impact of blasting.
