Samples are usually core samples composited over {{the height of}} the <b>mining</b> <b>bench.</b> [...] For hardness parameters, the variogram often increases rapidly near the origin and can reach the sill at distances significantly smaller than the typical drill hole collar spacing. For this reason the incremental model precision due to additional test work is often simply a consequence of the central limit theorem, and secondary correlations are sought to increase the precision without incurring additional sampling and testing costs. These secondary correlations can involve multi-variable regression analysis with other, non-metallurgical, ore parameters and/or domaining by rock type, lithology, alteration, mineralogy, or structural domains.|$|E

Determination {{of the impact of}} <b>mining</b> <b>bench</b> height on the recovery of ore, including the estimation of dilution and ore loss, is critical to the economics of the operation. Conditional simulation was used to derive a number of gold estimation scenarios within a typical volume of the deposit. These scenarios were interrogated for a selection of <b>mining</b> <b>bench</b> heights and ore block dimensions. The results were reported as a range of grade tonnage relationships and compared to the kriged resource model. This allowed the resource model to be calibrated to a specific <b>mining</b> <b>bench</b> height and ore block size. Once calibrated, more realistic dilution and ore loss values for a number of <b>mining</b> <b>bench</b> heights were calculated from the resource model. These values were then used to determine the economic sensitivity of particular mining methods.

30|$|The {{optimization}} {{is achieved}} by considering the entire mining system {{instead of focusing on}} a single subsystem. By this way, the relationship among the interrelated subsystems in open-cast mining operations is considered in the optimization model. The methodology was applied in an open-cast coal mine.

The results of the case study show that the total mining cost is reduced $ 26, 641 for the bench which corresponds a 16.8 % decrease for one <b>mining</b> <b>bench.</b> If the usage of this methodology is extended to the other blasting benches throughout the mine, the total gain increases. Furthermore, the results of the sensitivity analysis show that the total mining cost highly depends on the unit cost of haul trucks, explosive cost and electricity price.

One of these zones was a higher grade vein set that could be solid modelled and estimated separately. A geological mineralisation envelope was applied to constrain the estimation. This represented a broad, relatively continuous envelope {{in keeping with the}} geology of the orebody and was loosely based on a 0. 1 g/t Au cut-off. Data was composited to 9 m to reflect the intended <b>mining</b> <b>bench</b> height and the true variability expected from those benches. Waste dykes were only excluded from this compositing if they were considered large enough to be practically avoided when mining. Variograms of the composited data were not particularly clear for either Au or Cu, and a Gaussian transform was applied to help determine a model. Gold and copper do not exhibit the same anisotropy and there is significant variability at less than, or equal to,the average drill spacing. Tests were conducted to determine the suitability of the Gaussian approach. This approach best represents a “diffusion model ” of spatial continuity. These tests indicated that the Gaussian approach was suitable at Wandoo. A global evaluation of resources was carried out using the Discrete Gaussian Model. This was a first quick estimate of resources at cut-off that was useful as an order of magnitude check on the final local estimates. There was a requirement to represent selectivity in mining for a local resource estimate. It was unrealistic to try to achieve this by directly estimating such a small block size taking into consideration the average drillhole spacing. Therefore, the technique of Uniform Conditioning was applied to calculate the expected proportions above a cut-off. Previous experience has shown that this is a relatively robust method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{deforming}} soil mass of {{two major}} lignite mines in Greece is being monitored by conventional underground and surface methods, namely, inclinometers, total station surveying using control targets and differential GPS. While the inclinometer data can indicate {{the early stages of}} the landslide process, it provides little information about regressive and progressive movements of the soil mass under consideration. Thus, the effective monitoring of <b>mine</b> <b>benches</b> is based solely on surveying data. This paper describes two different approaches for the detailed analysis of data to predict the deformation rate of the soil mass. In the first approach, univariate time series analysis is used to transform the deformation rate of each survey target into an appropriate ARIMA model. The main limitation of this approach is the white noise which is generated when dealing with low deformation rates. The second approach is implemented through neural networks and a feed forward type is described. Both approaches are implemented through in-house developed open source software and results are given using data from the lignite mines. 1...|$|R

40|$|Artisanal mining {{is basic}} mining {{characterized}} by manually intensive work methods utilizing primitive or simple equipment conducted by individuals or small groups working either illegally, or when legally sanctioned, exploiting deposits {{too small to}} constitute a mineral resource. Artisanal mining in Rwanda and Burundi is further complicated in that the mining techniques applied are often inadequate, with low productivity and poor recoveries, workers are paid low wages, and owners are reluctant to reinvest in the operations. A consequence to this vicious circle is that working conditions are often poor, with miners operating under unsafe and/or unhealthy working conditions, with the additional problem of mining {{in a manner that}} is detrimental to the environment. Artisanal mining is commonly more dangerous than large-scale modern mining operations. Artisanal operations are generally subsistence activities, with the miners focusing more on immediate concerns than the long-term consequences of their activities. When miners have no other source of income, they will usually find ways to evade controls and carry on working. The introduction of machinery is expensive and is often far beyond the reach of most artisanal miners, and therefore there is a general tendency for workers to focus on labour-intensive and riskier mining methods. This paper proposes the introduction of small-scale mechanization with labour-intensive manual <b>mining</b> utilizing a <b>bench</b> <b>mining</b> approach in artisanal mines operating in central Africa. From the 1950 s to 1980 s, <b>bench</b> <b>mining</b> was successfully conducted in Burundi utilizing manual labour. In order to achieve a balance between job creation and project economics, a combination of manual and mechanized mining is proposed. Manual mining offers the benefit of local job creation, while providing good mining techniques such as minimizing mining loses and dilution. Through the introduction of mechanized loading and hauling, areas of high stripping ratios can be viably mined, thus increasing the resources that can be exploited. The use of a loader and tractor-trailer arrangement is proposed, thereby improving throughput, productivity, and workers safety, and reducing the impact on the environment...|$|R
40|$|In coal mining, {{spontaneous}} combustion {{can occur in}} many areas such as stockpiles, underground workings, waste dumps, coal faces, in-pit ramps and backfill areas. Spontaneous combustion {{has been defined as}} an oxidation reaction, which occurs without an external heat source.

These fires pose a serious risk to the safety of workers in the coal mines. This phenomenon also has an environmental impact, which can affect {{the quality of life for}} future generations. Extensive research work has been done and recorded about spontaneous combustion in coal stockpiles, dumps and coal faces, but very limited work has been conducted on raw coal storage bunkers. This study investigated the occurrence of spontaneous combustion in coal storage bunkers, and established that there is no single document available that addresses the problem adequately. Therefore, a need was identified to create a guideline with decision analyser steps to be able to arrive quickly at a possible solution to the problem. This work does not address spontaneous combustion in underground workings, waste dumps, stockpiles, coal faces, in-pit ramps and backfill areas. It was found that important factors affecting the possibility of SC occurring were the type of coal being supplied to the bunker, the mining practice with regard to the standing time of the loose cubic metres of coal on the <b>mining</b> <b>benches,</b> and the impact of the physical factors around the bunker.

40|$|In any mining enterprise, the {{extraction}} of the ore from the orebody is of vital importance. This activity is stoping. The gold mines of the Witwatersrand and its extensions in the Klerksdorp, Welkom, and Evander areas form the most extensive goldfield in the world. This address reviews stoping technology and improvements in this technology {{since the end of}} the Second World War. Although the reefs that make up the Witwatersrand orebody are uniquely extensive, they are not suited to mechanized mining. This is due to a number of factors such as the depth of the orebody, its narrowness, and the hardness and abrasiveness of the quartzite forming the orebody. The most notable improvements in stoping technology have been brought about because of our better under-standing of rock-engineering problems. This has resulted in better layouts, stoping geometry, systems of alleviating rock stresses, and support systems. It has enabled the industry, at ever-greater mining depths, to maintain and even increase productivity. These improvements, based on rock engineering, have significantly reduced the accidents due to rockbursts. There are many differences between today's stoping and that practised forty years ago.

40|$|Abstract Background NAC domain {{transcription}} {{factors are}} important transcriptional regulators involved in plant growth, development and stress responses. Recent studies have revealed several classes of NAC transcriptional factors crucial for controlling secondary cell wall biosynthesis. These transcriptional factors mainly include three classes, SND, NST and VND. Despite progress, most current analysis {{is carried out}} in the model plant Arabidopsis. Moreover, many downstream genes regulated by these transcriptional factors are still not clear. Methods In order to identify the key homologue genes across species and discover the network controlling cell wall biosynthesis, we carried out comparative genome analysis of NST, VND and SND genes across 19 higher plant species along with computational modelling of genes regulated or co-regulated with these transcriptional factors. Results The comparative genome analysis revealed that evolutionarily the secondary-wall-associated NAC domain transcription factors first appeared in Selaginella moellendorffii. In fact, among the three groups, only VND genes appeared in S. moellendorffii, which is evolutionarily earlier than the other two groups. The Arabidopsis and rice gene expression analysis showed specific patterns of the secondary cell wall-associated NAC genes (SND, NST and VND). Most of them were preferentially expressed in the stem, especially the second internodes. Furthermore, comprehensive co-regulatory network analysis revealed that the SND and MYB genes were co-regulated, which indicated the coordinative function of these transcriptional factors in modulating cell wall biosynthesis. In addition, the co-regulatory network analysis revealed many novel genes and pathways that could be involved in cell wall biosynthesis and its regulation. The gene ontology analysis also indicated that processes like carbohydrate synthesis, transport and stress response, are coordinately regulated toward cell wall biosynthesis. Conclusions Overall, we provided a new insight into the evolution and the gene regulatory network of a subgroup of the NAC gene family controlling cell wall composition through bioinformatics data <b>mining</b> and <b>bench</b> validation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this is paper is to review {{the current state of}} knowledge and practice in highwall mining (HWM). HWM has become a widely-applied method in surface mining, commonly used alone or in conjunction with contour or slot mining. It provides 800 -feet to 1, 200 -feet of additional recovery when the economic stripping ratio is reached in contour mining or in slot mining when surface access to a reserve is limited. A significant attribute of the highwall miner is its versatility. HWM has been used successfully to mine abandoned pre-reclamation law highwalls, points or ridges uneconomic to mine by underground or other surface methods, outcrop barriers left adjacent to underground <b>mines,</b> separate <b>benches</b> of the same seam where the parting thickness or quality differences between benches render complete extraction uneconomic, previously augered areas containing otherwise inaccessible additional reserves and close or widely spaced multiple seams. The theory and design methods to assess roof, pillar, and floor stability are presented followed by three case histories. Simple design charts for sizing HWM web and barrier pillars are also presented. A recommended web pillar width may be obtained from the design charts given the overburden depth, the HWM cut width, and the mining height. Given the depth and panel width for a set of HWM cuts, another set of charts gives a suggested barrier pillar width. The case histories, from Northern and Southern Appalachia are used to illustrate the application of rock mechanics to quantify the stability of the highwall, roof, web pillars, and floor. The case histories involve 1) mining through a previously augered highwall, 2) mining under back-stacked spoil and 3) selective mining of closely spaced benches of the same seam. Because each site is unique, the appropriate pre-mining geotechnical analyses range from the calculation of roof, web pillar, and floor bearing capacity stability factors to detailed numerical modeling of the auger and underground mine workings. When operating in the vicinity of existing underground mine or auger workings, the determination of ground deformation and strains resulting from highwall mining is a necessary facet of a ground control investigation...|$|R

40|$|Mining method {{selection}} lies at {{the basis}} of every mining operation and is essential for maximizing economic return. Especially in the current market with decreasing metal prices selecting the right method {{can mean the difference}} between a viable and a non-viable operation. More importantly the right mining method increases the safety of employees and secures the production. The Kylylahti underground copper mine, owned by Altona Mining ltd. is located in Northern-Karelia, Finland. This deposit consists of two orebodies, the upper Wallaby and the lower Wombat. Longitudinal bench stoping is proposed for the Wallaby and Wombat orebodies. The Wallaby orebody is currently mined using the proposed method. However, different orebody characteristics suggest a more suitable mining method for the Wombat orebody. This work determines the mining method which maximizes economic return for the Wombat orebody. This is a three phase process. First phase is the mining method selection on technical suitability to the orebody; for which two methods are. The UBC method is applied first resulting in the selection of the area of sublevel stoping methods. Later a new technique is introduced to optimize the mining method selection process and to control the wide spectrum of mineral deposits. This technique is called the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process approach and is based on Multiple Criteria Decision Making. Six factors specifically applicable to the Kylylahti mine are used as input for the approach resulting in transverse bench stoping as the most suitable method for the Wombat orebody. In the subsequent phase, the rock mass properties of the ore zone and the host rock masses are calculated using the Q-classification method. These values are combined with the results of in situ stress measurements to determine the stability of the open stopes at different depths. Dimensions of the stopes are determined depending on the resulting stability limits on stope height, width and length. Applying these stope limits a preliminary mine design was made, resulting in a reserve estimation of 3. 4 Mt of ore in place. This gives a life of mine of 6 years and 3 months for the Kylylahti <b>mine</b> using transverse <b>bench</b> stoping. The combination of all obtained data is the input for the financial analysis phase for the Wombat orebody; comparing the proposed longitudinal bench stoping to transverse bench stoping, as recommended in this thesis. The sensitivity of the net present value to metal price is investigated in two different metal price forecasting scenarios resulting in an economic return. In both scenarios transverse bench stoping maximized the economic return delivering $ 52 million and $ 63 million extra profit at the end of mine life.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to examine the}} geotechnical conditions at the Engeb&# 248;fjell in Naustdal Municipality, Sogn og Fjordane, Norway with regard to a proposed open pit mine there. Another aim was to develop design parameters for the <b>mine,</b> i. e. <b>bench</b> angles, inter-ramp slope angles and overall slope angles. Finally, the economical ramifications of changes in the design parameters were examined. Geotechnical field mapping campaigns were conducted according to described standards and the results were processed by methods such as stereographic analysis in Rocsciences Dips 6. 0. In addition, previously drilled cores were re-examined to extract geotechnical information, such as Rock Quality Designation (RQD). Using gathered data, the pit area was divided into geotechnical domains, and a kinematic analysis was performed for each domain. The analyses were carried out in Dips 6. 0 as well. Empirical methods were applied to find supplementary estimates of overall slope angle and rock mass conditions. Rock Mass Ratings (RMR) were calculated for each of the domains. The Barton-Bandis failure criterion was used in conjunction with tilt tests to estimate the shear strength of the discontinuities in the rock mass. Scale corrections were applied to the Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) and the Joint Compressive Strength (JCS). It is concluded that three separate joint sets exist in the rock mass and that their dip-directions are: West (steep), North (steep) and SSW (low incline). The discontinuities have tight apertures with a moderate spacing and are commonly fresh and clean, however some staining was observed. The persistence of the discontinuities was concluded to lie in the interval 3 - 10 m. Results from the rock mass analysis indicated good rock mass quality. The following scale corrected results stem from the field mapping: JRC is approximately 7 and JCS=[56, 115]MPa(depending on lithology). Basic friction angles were found to lie in the region [25 deg, 32 deg], which implicated joint friction angles of [46 deg}, 54 deg}]. Based on the kinematic analysis it is concluded that maximum stable bench face angles can be in the range of [60 deg, 80 deg],while inter-ramp angles are [47 deg, 63 deg]and overall slope angles are [45 deg, 59 deg]. Different stability problems were expected to occur in different regions of the pit: the northern part was exposed to toppling, the south-western to planar failure and the south-eastern to both wedge and planar failure. The large scale stability of the pit has been discussed and it was concluded that large scale structures could affect the stability of the pit, and since these are likely to be parallel to the discontinuity sets further efforts should be directed towards uncovering such features. Drilling cores perpendicular to the expected orientations was recommended. It is noted that, should such features be encountered, the frictional properties of each one of them must be estimated. It has been shown that the benefits of steepening an open pit wall are significant for the project as a whole. Recommendations to couple sensitivity analyses of pit design parameters with the geotechnical investigations were made. In this way, the money that is set aside for geotechnical work will be put to the best possible use. </p...|$|R

Once movement of a rock perched {{on the top of}} a slope (bench) has been initiated, the most important factor controlling its fall trajectory is the geometry of the slope (bench). The best possible knowledge of rockfall trajectories and energies is important in order to determine accurate risk zoning and for the design and construction of adequate defence systems near the threatened areas. This study attempts to determine the influence of bench geometries, and the coefficient of restitution of rock, on rockfall behaviour. A study of literature was carried out to review previous studies and other relevant information on rockfalls and their analysis. The literature may be divided into two categories: experimental methods involving physical modelling, and computer models involving rockfall analyses using computers analysis methods. Rockfall computer simulation is considered to be applicable, quick to carry out and reproducible. The accuracy of the results depends on the knowledge of site conditions and slope geometry. The use of the Modified Ritchie criterion for the design of catch benches in open pit mines was also investigated. The assessment of bounce height, maximum run-out distance and kinetic energy achieved during the fall of rocks on the catch bench were the bases of the evaluation of the results obtained in this project. The computer program, Rocfall Version 4, was used for the purposes of the research. The following parameter variables were considered in the analyses: three types of rock; slopes with three stack configurations; four bench heights; and four bench face angles. The results show that, for all stack configurations and rock types, the maximum runout distance and maximum bounce height increase as functions of bench height at a specific bench face angle. A single bench configuration provides a maximum run-out distance of falling rocks larger than the value determined using the Modified Ritchie criterion for all rock types and bench face angles. Multiple bench stack configurations provide maximum run-out distances less than the value determined using the Modified Ritchie criterion only for the 90 o bench face angle in all rock types; those with 60 o, 70 o and 80 o bench face angle provide a larger maximum run-out distance. Therefore, the validity of the Modified Ritchie criterion for the design of catch bench widths in open pit <b>mines</b> with inclined <b>benches</b> must be questioned. According to Ritchieâ€™s study (1963), rocks that fall in trajectory (free fall) seldom give high bounces after impact on a catch bench. This project shows that this finding is valid for rocks with low coefficients of normal restitution. Rocks with lower coefficients of normal restitution provide larger run-out distances with flatter bench face angles compared with rocks with higher coefficients. In contrast, rocks with higher coefficients provide larger run-out distances than those with lower coefficients for steeper angles. The consideration of the influence of geometry (shape) of falling rocks on rockfall behaviour showed that, for a flatter slope, as could logically be expected, the maximum run-out distance is greatest for rounder rocks and smallest for flatter slabby iv rocks. This is due to the fact that on a flatter slope, the mode of falling of rounder rocks is rolling down the slope. This mode provides essentially no resistance to motion, resulting in largest maximum run-out distance. In contrast, for long flat slabs, the mode of movement will be sliding, which results in a smaller maximum run-out distance. The maximum run-out distance as function of rock shape reduces as the normal coefficient of restitution increases. For all rock types, the maximum bounce height reduces as a function of the friction angle for flatter slopes. This is due to the fact that rocks are in contact with the slope during the rockfall. As the coefficient of normal restitution increases, an increase in the maximum bounce height results...|$|R
