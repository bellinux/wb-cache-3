25|$|Alfalfa is {{considered}} an insectary, a place where insects are reared, and has been proposed as helpful to other crops, such as cotton, if the two are interplanted, because the alfalfa harbours predatory and parasitic insects that would protect the other crop. Harvesting the alfalfa by <b>mowing</b> <b>the</b> entire crop area destroys the insect population, but this can be avoided by mowing in strips so {{that part of the}} growth remains.|$|E
25|$|Most {{mechanical}} {{means of}} kudzu removal {{practiced in the}} southeastern United States involve <b>mowing</b> <b>the</b> vine or cutting it back. These methods, though more effective than herbicides, are more time consuming. Vines must be mowed down just above ground level every month or two {{during the growing season}} in order to prevent them from growing back. When using this method of kudzu control, all of the plant material must be removed and/or destroyed (burned) to prevent the vines from taking root and re-growing. Another method of mechanical removal is to remove the crown of the plant. This part must also be destroyed to prevent re-implantation.|$|E

[...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, Beyoncé appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She is cooking in a skillet while one of her neighbors drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where Beyoncé and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying. This is followed by scenes of Beyoncé, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests.

2500|$|When U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was overheard sarcastically {{remarking}} on Fox News on July 20 {{that the}} operations in Shuja'iyya were [...] "a {{hell of a}} pinpoint operation,” according to Mark Perry, his comments reflected U.S. military assessments of a battle in which Israel's use of 11 artillery battalions was equivalent to what the U.S. deployed for 2 divisions, or even a full corps. The only explanation for adopting the massive firepower unleashed by a mix of Soltam M-71 guns and U.S. Paladin M109s was, according to one U.S. military expert, [...] "to kill {{a lot of people}} in as short a period of time as possible,” adding that, “It’s not <b>mowing</b> <b>the</b> lawn. It’s removing the topsoil.” 'Mowing the lawn' is an Israeli idiom referring to periodic operations conducted by the IDF in the Gaza Strip. Lieutenant General Robert G. Gard, Jr. noted that technically, even if 10% of the shells fired on Shuja'iyya hit close to their targets, at a minimum in the range of 700 lethal shells would have landed amidst the civilian population overnight 20–21 July. 155-mm howitzer shells have a kill radius of 164 feet.|$|E

As he acclimated to Bermuda, he noticed what he called [...] "the almost predominant black-on-black violence that is unfortunately pervasive throughout the local neighborhoods", and in 2011 created the nonprofit organization Beyond Rugby Bermuda, using rugby union to provide young people with an alternative to gangs.

2500|$|On May 27, 1983 at {{approximately}} 9:15 AM, eleven workers were on duty when {{a cache of}} M-80 and M-100 explosives, flash powder, and other chemicals in the [...] barn detonated producing a massive explosion, instantly killing all eleven workers and leveling the barn. The initial blast was followed by several smaller blasts witnesses described as sounding like shotguns, and {{are believed to have}} been of individual firework cases that were not detonated in the initial blast. Dan Lee Webb's cousin Tommy Lee Webb, who was <b>mowing</b> <b>the</b> grass near the site, was reported to have been thrown more than 70 yards. The blast also threw debris as far as 200 yards away from the site, and produced a shock wave that leveled trees as far as 100 yards away. Bodies were hurled through the roofs of the nearby house and carport and as far away as 500 feet from the site. Nothing in the barn was left intact; all of the bodies had lost limbs and six were decapitated. Some were stripped by the force of the blast. Several witnesses claimed to have seen a white mushroom cloud which was estimated to be 600 to 800 feet tall, and the blast was heard and felt in Cleveland over 20 miles away. Several 911 calls were received moments after the initial blast, and within minutes, several police units arrived on the scene. Tommy Lee Webb, who was critically injured, was taken to Erlanger Medical Center in Chattanooga with burns on about 35 % of his body. A Tennessee Emergency Management Association (TEMA) crew, which included forensic anthropologist Dr. William M. Bass, later arrived on the scene to identify the victims.|$|E

40|$|High-resolution {{grain size}} and {{magnetic}} susceptibility {{records from the}} eastern Gulf of Cadiz (site MD 99 - 2339; 1170 m water depth) reveal contourites formed by <b>the</b> Mediterranean Outflow (<b>MOW)</b> during <b>the</b> last 47 kyr BP.
