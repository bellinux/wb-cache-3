25|$|A Kofler bench is a <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> with a {{temperature}} gradient (range from room temperature to 300°C). Any substance {{can be placed}} on {{a section of the}} strip revealing its thermal behaviour at the temperature at that point. Differential scanning calorimetry gives information on melting point together with its enthalpy of fusion.|$|E
25|$|A {{tape measure}} or {{measuring}} tape is a flexible form of ruler. It {{consists of a}} ribbon of cloth, plastic, fiber glass, or <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> with linear-measurement markings. The design on which most modern spring tape measures are built was invented and patented by a New Haven, Connecticut resident named Alvin J. Fellows on July 14, 1868.|$|E
25|$|The fuse {{elements}} may {{be shaped}} to increase heating effect. In large fuses, current may be divided between multiple strips of metal. A dual-element fuse may contain a <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> that melts instantly on a short-circuit, and also contain a low-melting solder joint that responds to long-term overload of low values {{compared to a}} short-circuit. Fuse elements may be supported by steel or nichrome wires, so that no strain {{is placed on the}} element, but a spring may be included to increase the speed of parting of the element fragments.|$|E

25|$|Between {{the towers}} is a two-story span. Its lower level, the mezzanine, is faced in {{concrete}} and {{divided into three}} sections divided by square pilasters. All have a recessed triple casement window; that in the central portion is flanked by two similar double windows. Traffic lights are mounted {{on the west side}} and western portion of the central section below window level. At the top of each pilaster is a mosaic tile. A smooth <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> runs across the top. Above it is an apparent second story, sided in the vertical plywood that shelters the platform. It is recessed slightly from the mezzanine, with its fenestration echoing that below.|$|E
25|$|A fuse {{consists}} of a <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> or wire fuse element, of small cross-section compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between a pair of electrical terminals, and (usually) enclosed by a non-combustible housing. The fuse is arranged in series to carry all the current passing through the protected circuit. The resistance of the element generates heat due to the current flow. The size and construction of the element is (empirically) determined so that the heat produced for a normal current does not cause the element to attain a high temperature. If too high a current flows, the element rises to a higher temperature and either directly melts, or else melts a soldered joint within the fuse, opening the circuit.|$|E

50|$|A denshi block (or {{electronic}} block) is a {{small plastic}} box containing an electronic component. Each block has conductive <b>metal</b> <b>strips</b> on its sides, and when two blocks are placed side-by-side, their <b>metal</b> <b>strips</b> touch allowing electricity to flow between them. The top of each block is labelled with a schematic representation of the component it contains.|$|R

The marímbula is usually classified as part of the lamellophone family of musical instruments.|$|R
2500|$|Fashionable silk designs {{changed with}} the seasons, but general trends can be seen over longer periods. Sprays of botanically-accurate flowers appear in Garthwaite's work from 1743; these were brocaded in silk against a figured ground, using an {{adaptation}} of the tapestry weaver's points rentrés technique to produce near-three-dimensional floral patterns through careful shading. Many of the designs Garthwaite sold to Lekeux featured silver patterns combined with naturalistic florals. [...] A note {{at the bottom of}} Garthwaite's design for the silk waistcoat indicates the three types of metal thread to be used in executing the design. In the drawing, dark yellow represents [...] "plate" [...] (lamé), a flat metal strip; light yellow represents [...] "plain" [...] (filé), <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> wound around a silk or linen core; and gray represents [...] "frosted" [...] (frisé), a thread with an overtwisted silk core to produce a sparkling effect.|$|E

50|$|Coins are {{sometimes}} struck on planchets {{that are either}} too thin or too thick producing underweight or overweight coins. This can be because the equipment settings cause the <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> to be rolled to an incorrect thickness or because the <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> was intended for another coin denomination such as a quarter planchet cut from a metal roll intended for dimes.|$|E
50|$|Slotted angle (also {{sometimes}} referred to as slotted angle iron) is a system of reusable <b>metal</b> <b>strips</b> used to construct shelving, frames, work benches, equipment stands and other structures. The name derives, first, from the use of elongated slots punched into the metal at uniform intervals to enable assembly of structures fixed with nuts and bolts, and second, from the longitudinal folding of the <b>metal</b> <b>strips</b> to form a right angle.|$|R

40|$|A novel low pH {{magnesium}} silicate hydrate cement system for encapsulating nuclear industry wastes {{have been developed}} using blends of MgO, silica fume (SF), MgCO 3 and sand. Aluminium and Magnox swarf were encapsulated in both this new system and in a BFS/PC control system used in the nuclear industry. The interaction of the optimised mortar with the <b>metal</b> <b>strips</b> has been investigated, {{both in terms of}} rate of continued corrosion as well as the phases that form by reaction of the binder with different <b>metal</b> <b>strips.</b> Magnox swarf was better bound into the BFS/PC system than MgO/SF system whereas Al 1050 <b>metal</b> <b>strips</b> were bound better into the MgO/SF samples than into the BFS/PC reference mortar. No H 2 generation was recorded when aluminium or magnox were encapsulated in the new binder, which is substantially better than what can be achieved with the reference system. Hence, the newly developed binder could potentially encapsulate mixtures of reactive metals better than the existing solution...|$|R
