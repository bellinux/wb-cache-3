In 1996 aspects of the High Court's jurisdiction to hear matrimonial cases were transferred to a dedicated Family Court, which is constituted as a District Court.

2500|$|Between 15 May 1991 and 2 March 1995, Rajah {{served as}} a Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Singapore. During his time on the Bench, he decided a number of {{significant}} family law cases. In Lim Ying v. Hock Kian Ming Eric, he held that the gender of a transsexual person was to be determined according to biological criteria, which meant that sex reassignment surgery did not alter a person's gender. Thus, a marriage between an individual who had undergone female-to-male sex reassignment surgery and a woman was void, being a marriage between two persons of the same gender. The decision prompted Parliament to amend the Women's Charter to permit transsexual people to marry in the capacity of their new gender.(2) It is hereby declared that ... a marriage solemnized in Singapore or elsewhere between a person who has undergone a sex re-assignment procedure and any person of the opposite sex is and shall be deemed always to have been a valid marriage.(3) For the purpose of this section —}} In 1992, Rajah J.C. annulled the marriage of a 21-year-old woman whose family had forced her into an arranged marriage. This was believed to have been the first judicial decision of its kind in Singapore. Two years later, in another landmark case, he applied to a house-husband the principle that a divorced woman who has not contributed financially towards the acquisition of <b>matrimonial</b> <b>assets</b> is nonetheless entitled to a substantial share of them in view of her indirect contributions in the form of paying towards the household expenses or caring for the family.|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} in law of pension benefits and expectancies, as a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>asset</b> {{which may be}} subject to certain claims (and counterclaims), occured in South Africa in 1989. The starting point of this development was an investigation in 1984, on: "the possibility of making provisions for a divorced woman to share in the pension benefits of her former husband ". This investigation came about, in South Africa, after the matter had already been accepted, in many foreign legals systems, as a well-established, and most important concept of family law. The obvious question for the South African legislature was which of the pension-sharing schemes throughout the world would best serve as a model. Since the South African accrual system was largely based on the German Zugewinngemeinschaft, it seemed only natural that a close comparative study should be made of Germany's Versorgungsausgleich scheme. It is one of the aims of this thesis to point out whether and to what extent South Africa followed the German example. To do so, {{it will be necessary to}} examine first the different legal situations which were prevalent before and after the legal changes in the two countries and to elaborate on the reasons which led to these changes. The discussion in chapter three of how the German system of equalisation of pension expectancies, the so-called Versorgungsausgleich, is applied, will facilitate a comprehensive comparison with the South African scheme. The questions to be answered in the fifth chapter are whether it is appropriate to examine the equalisation of pension expectancies under South African law, which was only recently introduced, in a comparison with the German system and whether it is possible to speak of a Versorgungsausgleich when referring to the South African situation. Whenever possible, I have attempted to suggest solutions that may appear acceptable. To conclude the thesis, certain pension sharing problems arising under South African private international law will be briefly commented upon. Private LawLL...|$|R
40|$|The {{provisions}} of art. 312 of the Civil Code establish: a legal system, {{that is the}} community property regime and two types of conventional regimes: the regime of separation of goods and the regime of conventional community (the latter includes conventional derogation from community property regime). Legal <b>matrimonial</b> regime includes <b>assets</b> acquired by each spouse during marriage, except property required by law, which represents each spouse’s own assets. Community legal regime will apply in all situations in which prospective spouses opt for separation of property regime or the regime of conventional community. Separation of property regime {{is characterized by the}} fact that each of the spouses is the exclusive owner of their current assets and of those acquired alone after the dissolution of marriage, for the adoption of this regime the spouses being forced to draw up an inventory of movable property belonging to each one at the contracting of marriage. Conventional community regime is applicable when by matrimonial agreement, it derogates from the provisions on legal community regime, and the matrimonial convention concluded in this case can narrow or broaden the community of goods...|$|R
50|$|Matrimonial {{property}} can {{be divided}} any time during or after the separation, divorce, or death. All <b>matrimonial</b> <b>assets</b> and property is presumed to be split evenly between spouses. The scope of divisible <b>matrimonial</b> <b>assets</b> varies between provinces. Most provinces include all assets acquired during the marriage and any other assets pooled together. The most significant divisible assets include matrimonial home and pensions. Assets excluded typically include inheritances and monetary damages for personal injuries. Business assets may also be excluded in some provinces. Business assets are typically limited to assets that produce an immediate gain in some entrepreneurial capacity.|$|E

Complicating matters further, the matrimonial home was registered under only Mr Calderbank’s name (due to fiscal reasons) and he continued to live in this property after the divorce.|$|E

50|$|In May 2014, {{the divorce}} made {{headlines}} when a Geneva court awarded Rybolovlev's ex-wife a record settlement of $4.8 billion. June 2015 saw a major {{turn in the}} case, however, after Rybolovlev's lawyers successfully appealed the 2014 ruling. The Geneva court reversed the earlier decision, ruling that Rybolovleva's settlement be reduced to 564 million Swiss francs, significantly less than the 800 million Swiss francs that Rybolovlev had repeatedly offered her. Of particular significance was {{the decision of the}} court to confirm the validity of the family trust structures, which were set up long before the divorce process began; and to apply a rate of capital appreciation to <b>matrimonial</b> <b>assets</b> only up until the time of the divorce. The correct application of Swiss matrimonial law thereby led to the massive settlement reduction decided by the court, Rybolovlev's lawyers said.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of different marital property regimes on health, well-being and health related behavior. In particular, it provides an empirical assessment of {{the effects of}} a change from a separate property regime towards a more equal distribution of <b>matrimonial</b> <b>assets</b> on subjective health, psychological well-being and investments in health capital, using the variance occurring after a decision by the English House of Lords in 2000. I use a Difference-in-Difference approach, taking advantage of the panel structure of the British Household Panel Survey. Results show that neither wives nor husbands experience higher self-assessed health status or psychological well-being after the reform. The results are mixed with regards to wives' investment choices in health, where the empirical analysis suggests that wives substitute leisure time devoted to training activities for health services including physiotherapy and psychotherapy. However, the results are not robust over different model specifications. MSc in Economic...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the {{practice}} of sulh (mutual agreement) in dividing matrimonial asset after divorce, upon {{the death of a}} spouse and polygamous marriage. The study adopted qualitative method where analysis is conducted on a purposive sampling of unreported cases collected within the period of 2000 - 2012. The samples are collected from six zones representing Shariah Courts in Malaysia. Analysis on the sampling is made based on several variables such as the types of matrimonial property, factors for consideration and proportion of distribution of the assets. This study discovers that philanthropic element of kindness, gift and generosity has been implemented in the majority of cases involving claims of a matrimonial property when they are practically settled by way of sulh (amicable settlement). In determining the division through sulh, the parties is in fact more generous when dealing with the interest of children to the level that the husband is willing to transfer the whole interest in the asset to the existing wife who is rarely achieved in other litigation processes. The parties also voluntarily waive each party right by granting the matrimonial asset as a gift to the children. This study suggests that the mutual consent on proportion of asset by way of sulh to be widely practised when dealing with the division of <b>matrimonial</b> <b>assets</b> to promote harmonious settlement and to prevent a costly and lengthy litigation process. This study suggests for specific governing mechanism in ensuring the establishment of justice among the disputing parties...|$|E
