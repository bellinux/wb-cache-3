2500|$|On June 18, Rowley {{addressed}} Bolden's {{allegations in}} testimony {{provided to the}} Warren Commission. Rowley explained that Bolden was selected to rotate through the White House detail for 30 days {{in the summer of}} 1961 as part of an orientation program, and that Bolden's allegations referred to a 5-day span in Hyannis Port. When J. Lee Rankin, general counsel for the Warren Commission, asked him when he received Bolden's complaint, Rowley replied: [...] "The fact is he never informed me. He never informed any of his supervisors or anyone on the detail." [...] Rankin then interrupted his questioning of Rowley to state: [...] "I think the record should show, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chairman,</b> that we were never advised that he wanted to testify, nor had we any inquiry or anything about the matter, until after we learned about it in the newspapers. And, even then, he didn't ask to testify. And we asked the FBI to check into it, and he had counsel and they refused to tell anything about the matter at that time." [...] Rowley later stated that there was [...] "no truth to the charges of misconduct". He added that Bolden had leveled eleven charges and that there was partial truth to one of the charges (that the agents had purchased two or three cases of beer which were available to agents coming off duty), but that his investigation found that there were no violations of Secret Service regulations. In response to Rankin's questioning, Rowley answered that Bolden's indictment {{was the first time he}} could recall that a criminal complaint was lodged against a Secret Service agent.|$|E
