Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also {{features}} singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with {{a real sense of}} history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album." ...|$|E

500|$|No {{one in my}} {{large family}} wrote poetry. But the first Russian woman poet, Anna Bunina, was the aunt of my {{grandfather}} Erasm Ivanovich Stogov. The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection {{during the time of}} Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more distinguished family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells us that this marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses – Praskovia Yegorovna – married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was <b>my</b> <b>grandmother.</b> She died when my mother was nine years old, and I was named in her honour. Several diamond rings and one emerald were made from her brooch. Though my fingers are thin, still her thimble didn't fit me.|$|E
500|$|Victoria's {{husband died}} in London in September 1921. After meeting {{her at the}} Naval and Military Club in Piccadilly, he complained of feeling unwell and Victoria persuaded him to rest in a room they had booked in the club annexe. She called a doctor, who {{prescribed}} some medicine and Victoria went out to fill the prescription at a nearby pharmacist's. When she came back, Louis was dead. On her widowhood, Victoria moved into a grace-and-favour residence at Kensington Palace and, {{in the words of}} her biographer, [...] "became a central matriarchal figure in the lives of Europe's surviving royalty". In 1930, her eldest daughter, Alice, suffered a nervous breakdown and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. In the following decade Victoria was largely responsible for her grandson Philip's education and upbringing during his parents' separation and his mother's institutionalisation. Prince Philip recalled, [...] "I liked <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> very much and she was always helpful. She was very good with children... she took the practical approach to them. She treated them in the right way—the right combination of the rational and the emotional." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{being named}} Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{at the prestigious}} Boston Shootout and {{acknowledged}} as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: [...] "Contact my coach. I do not want <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> and aunt upset about calls at all {{times of the day}} and night. I'm not the only person who lives in this house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, {{when it comes time to}} make my decision, I'll take those things into account." [...] Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. [...] Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. [...] By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.|$|E

Philip Levin {{abandoned}} the family and moved to South Africa when Levin was three. The two children were brought up {{with the help of}} their maternal grandparents, who had emigrated from Lithuania {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. Levin wrote of his childhood, [...] "My home was not a religious one; my grandfather read the scriptures to himself silently and struggled through a little English; <b>my</b> <b>grandmother,</b> who could read no language at all, lit a candle on the appropriate days, as did my mother, though for her it was not really a religious sign. My uncles were quite secular ... and had hardly anything to do with the religion of their father and grandfathers". In The Guardian after Levin's death, Quentin Crewe wrote, [...] "His illiterate grandparents' stories about life in Russia must have instilled in him the passionate belief in the freedom of the individual that lasted his whole life. In return, as he grew older, he used to read to them. Bernard could not read Hebrew, but he could get by in Yiddish".|$|E
