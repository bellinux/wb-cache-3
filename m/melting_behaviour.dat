Specifically, {{the physical}} nature and resulting <b>melting</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the mantle source is addressed by novel approaches. This thesis ranges in scope from broad global perspectives (Chapter 2) to specific investigation of single volcanic edifices (Chapter 4, 5). In particular, I use the moderately incompatible major element titanium (chapter 2) and U-series isotopes (chapter 3, 4, 5) to address mantle melting. Examination of global OIB Ti concentrations, {{reveals that the}} source region of most OIB require addition of ~ 1 0 % or less recycled mafic oceanic crust. Analytical methods for U-series measurement have been refined (Chapter 3). Detailed examination of one OIB locality (Pico, Azores, Chapter 4) reveals that recycled crust cannot directly contribute to the lavas. Instead, recycled crust must be 'distilled' through the overlying mantle by interaction of eclogitic melts with the surrounding peridotite. At the eventual onset of peridotitic melting, the source carries an enriched signature reflecting mafic crustal addition, but no record of its disparate <b>melting</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Finally, investigation of Sao Miguel, Azores enforces the notion that recycled lithologies do not exert major control on source <b>melting</b> <b>behaviour.</b> This {{is illustrated by the}} lack of correlation between the wide range of long-lived isotopic compositions and U-series isotopes.

Furthermore, the two melting endotherms, which are observed, can be partially ascribed to a melting–recrystallization process.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study of <b>melt</b> flow <b>behaviour</b> of ABS plastic through the melt flow tube of the liquefier {{head of the}} Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) rapid prototyping process using the finite element analysis. Main flow parameters including temperature, velocity and pressure drop have been investigated. Liquefier head of FDM machine has been modelled parametrically {{and the effects of}} physical modifications including nozzle angle variation on the melt flow parameters have been investigated accordingly. Results provide promising information on flow behaviour of new ABS based composites for processing in the FDM system to fabricate new products...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the designs and results of experimental investigations into gelation and <b>melting</b> point <b>behaviour</b> for polymer gel electrolytes. The study {{used one of}} the most prominent types of materials in the commercial world—polyvinylidene fluoride-based (PVDF) gel electrolytes—focussing on the effects of gelation temperature and gel composition on the properties of its solid electrolytes. While PVDF was used as the polymer matrix, propylene carbonates (PC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) were used as solvents. Lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF 4) and lithium bisoxalatoborate (LiBOB) were used as the electrolyte salts. Gelation from molten PVDF solutions was studied isothermally, using 30...|$|R
