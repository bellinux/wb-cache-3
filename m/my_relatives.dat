500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address my songs back in my head to Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a big jump for me to move away from all <b>my</b> <b>relatives,</b> all my friends, everything I know".|$|E

This is where Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people fought over the resources of this great country and they happened to kill a large number of <b>my</b> <b>relatives</b> and my mother's relatives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2001, Zhang was {{transferred}} to the eastern coastal province of Shandong to become governor. He began serving as provincial party chief, the first-in-charge of the province, beginning in 2002. In Shandong, Zhang told a gathering of assembled local officials, [...] "whether it is <b>my</b> <b>relatives,</b> children, friends; if they go to where you are, please do not go out of your way to receive them, do not curry favour with them, and do not offer to do things for them." [...] This was seen as Zhang trying to send a signal that he intended to distance himself from a political culture rife with corruption and complex rules around guanxi. In Shandong, Zhang was known to conduct 'undercover visits' to survey the lives of ordinary people. When Zhang left office, Shandong's GDP had exceeded 2 trillion yuan (~$300 billion), ranking second among provinces in the country.|$|E

But consider, <b>my</b> <b>relative</b> was sixty years old, and I was twenty- one. <b>My</b> <b>relative</b> took several months to consider, and had the advice of her lawyers before she acceded to my request. And I made it at the {{instigation}} of Mr. Brough, who dictated the letter which I wrote, and who I really thought then was as rich as Mr. Rothschild himself." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} the {{four members of}} the band after they were hit by pies. Guitarist Brian James recalled: [...] "That was organised by this photographer called Peter Kodick, Stiff had assigned him to do the thing. They thought it was a jolly wheeze to surprise us with a few cream cakes, little knowing that we would relish it, get into to it and enjoy the whole experience". After the photo session, Damned bassist Captain Sensible noted: [...] "...I had more pie on my face {{than any of the other}} buggers and on the back of the sleeve I had my back to the picture, so I went down a photo booth and got some pictures, cut one out and said 'put that on there' so I would have something to show <b>my</b> <b>relatives,</b> because I didn't think we'd be invited to make another album".|$|E
2500|$|When some Portuguese {{proposed}} {{to buy a}} free transit document (one silver royal for each man) to avoid fighting, the [...] Cardinal Mendoza counselled [...] Ferdinand to send an order to spare any prisoner and to not offer resistance to those Portuguese who tried to cross the frontier, because other way, they would have no alternative except to fight and thereby prolonging the war and destruction inside [...] Castile: [...] "when this was known to the King, it was debated in his council if they should permit the returning of the Portuguese to Portugal in security. Some chevaliers and other men from the King's army whose sons and brothers and relatives were killed and wounded on the battle (...) worked to provoke the King (...). And brought into the King's memory the injuries and the cruel deaths inflicted by the Portuguese to the Castilians {{in the battle of}} Aljubarrota (...).The cardinal of Spain said: (...) Pero Gonzalez de Mendoza my great grandfather, lord of Aleva, was killed on that so called battle of Aljubarrota (...) and in the same way perished some of <b>my</b> <b>relatives</b> and many of Castile's important personalities. (...) do not think in revenge (...). It is sure that if the passage was made impossible for those [...] who go, they will be forced to stay in your kingdoms, making war and bad things (...). After hearing the cardinal's reasons, the King sent an order to not preclude the passage of the Portuguese, and to not cause them harm in any way." [...] (Pulgar). It was a variant of the principle attributed to [...] Sun Tzu: [...] "when enemy soldiers leave your country cover them with gold", except that in this case it was the enemy soldiers who left silver in Castilian territory in exchange for their free transit.|$|E
