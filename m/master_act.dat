What secret trouble had he--was it that his affairs were in a bad way, or was he quarrelling with his wife? No, nothing of the kind; it was a long story--this secret trouble of the Ellerbys, and with his unconquerable reticence in regard to other people's private affairs he would have passed it off with a few general remarks.|$|E

There was a copy of the Wrykynian lying on the mantelpiece, and I picked it up and started reading it. So there wasn't any noise to show anybody outside that there was some one in the room. And then I heard Burgess and Spence jawing on the steps. They thought the place was empty, of course. I couldn't help hearing what they said. The pav.'s like a sounding-board. I heard every word. Spence said, 'Well, it's about as {{difficult}} a problem as any captain of cricket at Wrykyn has ever had to tackle.' I had a sort of idea that old Billy liked to boss things all on his own, but apparently he does consult Spence sometimes. After all, he's cricket-master, and that's what he's there for. Well, Billy said, 'I don't know what to do. What do you think, sir?' Spence said, 'Well, I'll give you my opinion, Burgess, but don't feel bound to act on it. I'm simply saying what I think.' 'Yes, sir,' said old Bill, doing a big Young Disciple with Wise <b>Master</b> <b>act.</b> 'I think M.,' said Spence. 'Decidedly M. He's a shade better than R. now, and in a year or two, of course, there'll be no comparison.'" ...|$|E

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{examines the}} theme of divine activity as {{found in the literature}} of religion and science over the past quarter century. After a brief historical chapter, reflections on divine action from authors in the philosophy of religion are considered. In chapters 2 and 3, concepts such as intervention, deism, <b>master</b> <b>act</b> and subacts, primary and secondary causation, double agency and the causal joint are outlined. Following this, chapters 4 and 5 concentrate on the work of Whitehead. The amount of space devoted to the treatment of process thought in this investigation reflects the attention it has given to the topic of divine activity. The focus then turns to scientific subjects and how they may inform the question of divine action. Some of the themes highlighted {{in the case of the}} large-scale world (chapter 6) include natural laws, evolution, the anthropic principle and the implicate order. Those concepts more appropriate for the small-scale world (chapter 7) involve quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and chaos theory. The positioning of process thought between the two fields of science and the philosophy of religion is strategic in the sense that process thinking claims to have built a bridge between science and religion, physics and metaphysics. In the concluding chapter, the various positions are plotted on three graphs. This approach illumines their relation to the others as well as the facet each can be expected to bring to the overall discussion of divine activity. A resolution to the issue, if any, will likely exhibit Whiteheadian and/or Bohmian contours...|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} mastery is an {{important}} one across Buddhist traditions. Masters are vital to Buddhist traditions and their practices because aspirants look to them for guidance and inspiration. <b>Masters</b> <b>act</b> as lineage holders who transmit what they have learned, exemplars of skillful behavior, and as guides along the path to enlightenment. A master is determined by various attributes: by her attainments, her understanding of the doctrines, her ethical standards, and by how seamlessly she has embodied her realizations. Generally, masters are recognized in one of the following ways: by the master or lineage who trained her, by the disciples who follow her, or by her reputation.|$|R
