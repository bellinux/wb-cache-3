For his tutor at Yale, Morris was {{assigned}} future Yale president Timothy Dwight IV, {{who would be}} an influential force in coeducation in his own right.

500|$|Is it {{reasonable}} for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while {{the producer of}} poor efficiency continues to produce? That is crooked logic. If I reduce, what happens to my market share? The price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, US shale oil producers will take <b>my</b> <b>share...</b> We {{want to tell the}} world that high-efficiency producing countries are the ones that deserve market share. That is the operative principle in all capitalist countries... One thing is for sure: Current prices [...] do not support all producers.|$|E

500|$|Bahadur Shah sent {{a letter}} to Azam Shah asking him to be content with Southern India, the part of India which had been willed to him by their father Aurangzeb. He also wrote that, if he was not happy with his part, then he was ready to give him the territories of Gujarat and Ajmer. He added that, if Azam Shah was not {{satisfied}} with this offer, he would have to use the [...] "sword to decide" [...] the monarch of the kingdom. In his reply, Azam wrote: <b>My</b> <b>share</b> is from the floor to the roof of the house. Yours is from the roof to the firmament.|$|E
500|$|While some {{commentators}} claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public, others {{claimed he was}} [...] "openly gay". In December 1974, when asked directly, [...] "So how about being bent?" [...] by the New Musical Express, Mercury replied, [...] "You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: {{there were times when}} I was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had <b>my</b> <b>share</b> of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further." [...] Homosexual acts between adult males over the age of 21 had been decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, only seven years earlier. In the 1980s, he would often distance himself from his partner, Jim Hutton, during public events. In October 1986, The Sun claimed Mercury had [...] "confessed to a string of one-night gay sex affairs".|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Kapadia {{appeared}} in Mehul Kumar's Krantiveer, alongside Nana Patekar. She played journalist Meghna Dixit, a past rape victim who now tries to persuade an alcoholic and unemployed village {{man to be}} a champion of justice for those around him. Kapadia later called the film [...] "out and out a Nana Patekar vessel," [...] but asserted, [...] "I had <b>my</b> <b>share</b> too," [...] crediting the part with allowing her [...] "the freedom to perform". The film became an economic success, emerging as India's third-highest grossing picture of the year. For her performance, Kapadia received her fourth Filmfare Award, {{this time in the}} Best Supporting Actress category. Mrinal Sen's 1995 Bengali drama Antareen was the first non-Hindi project Kapadia took part in since Vikram (1986). She played a woman caught in a loveless marriage. Insisting on playing her part spontaneously, Kapadia refused to enrol in a crash-course in Bengali as she wrongly felt that {{she would be able to}} speak it convincingly. Her voice was eventually dubbed by actor Anushua Chatterjee, something Kapadia was unhappy with.|$|E

40|$|This {{empirical}} paper {{describes a}} study that explored the lived experience of ‘recovery’ for six male patients who were detained in a low secure service. Interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to capture the subjective meanings that participants ascribed to this process. Participants also discussed the <b>My</b> <b>Shared</b> Pathway initiative as a helpful format for embedding recovery principles. Five superordinate themes were identified: It’s a journey; We’re vulnerable in here; Relationships with staff; Loss; and Hope. These {{findings are consistent with}} those seen in the forensic recovery literature and suggest that <b>My</b> <b>Shared</b> Pathway helps promote recovery in a number of ways. Clinical implications and suggestions for further research are given...|$|R

60|$|Let me {{describe}} {{the process as}} I saw it myself. Twenty years ago a poet friend of mine, who, like all poets, delighted in combats, insisted on <b>my</b> <b>sharing</b> his interest in pugilism, and took me about to all the boxing competitions of the day. I was nothing loth; for, <b>my</b> own <b>share</b> of original sin apart, any one {{with a sense of}} comedy must find the arts of self-defence delightful (for a time) through their pedantry, their quackery, and their action and reaction between amateur romantic illusion and professional eye to business.|$|R

[...] "Officials [...] didn’t lie, and I wasn’t fed a line," [...] she wrote. Miller acknowledged that [...] "there was no shortage of mistakes about Iraq, and I made <b>my</b> <b>share</b> of them.

Both he and his wife were among the original cast members of the production, which opened in 1952 at the Ambassadors Theatre and as of 2014 is still running at the St Martins Theatre. They took a 10 percent profit-participation in the production, which was paid for out of their combined weekly salary ("It proved to be the wisest business decision I've ever made... but foolishly I sold some of <b>my</b> <b>share</b> to open a short-lived Mayfair restaurant called 'The Little Elephant' and later still, disposed of the remainder in order to keep Gandhi afloat.") ...|$|E

[...] Kadirgamar commented later [...] "There was a storm of protest in Australia. A TV interviewer asked me whether I had ever played cricket. [...] I said I had played before he was born – without helmets and thigh guards, on matting wickets that were full of holes and stones, and I had <b>my</b> <b>share</b> of broken bones to show of it. My friend the Australian foreign minister was drawn into the fray. He phoned me. We decided to cool things down... When the whole episode was over I sent a bouquet of flowers to my Australian counterpart. Flowers are also for sissies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Smith's {{major new}} car program {{prior to the}} 1984 reorganization, GM10 (also known as W-body), has been called [...] "The biggest {{catastrophe}} in American industrial history." [...] Beginning in 1982, and costing $7 billion, {{the plan was to}} replace all midsize cars produced by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick. The plan was huge in scope, calling for seven plants that would each assemble 250,000 of the cars, or 21% of the total U.S. car market. It was badly executed from the start, but the 1984 reorganization wrought havoc on the program and it never recovered. By 1989, the year before the last of the original GM10s were launched, GM was losing $2000 on every one of the cars it produced. When asked by Fortune why GM10 was such a catastrophe, Smith replied, “I don't know. It's a mysterious thing. I've said I'll take <b>my</b> <b>share</b> of the blame on all those things. I was part of the team.” Nonetheless, the W-body platform that sprouted from the GM10 program lasted in production in some form until 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Misha B's {{breakthrough}} {{into the}} music industry came in 2011, [...] through her appearance on the eighth series of [...] UK version of The X Factor.

Noted for her [...] "Lauryn Hill-like rap-singing style", she was mentored by American recording artist Kelly Rowland and finished fourth. A variety of sources including The Daily Telegraph, Digital Spy and bluesandsoul.com have regarded Misha B {{as one of the}} more gifted and exciting acts ever to have come out of a talent competition. BBC 1xtra noting her [...] "show-stopping performances", considered her {{to be one of the}} most credible artists to emerge from the show and a [...] "break from the traditional X Factor contestant". In a review of the series, The Daily Telegraph picked her performance of [...] "Rolling in the Deep"(Adele) as one of the highlights of the series, saying she [...] "oozed star quality from the start... Like a 21st century Grace Jones or an urban Lady Gaga, the teenager seemed like a proper pop star already." [...] Bryan was involved in a controversy during the third live show when Tulisa Contostavlos accused her of making [...] "mean comments" [...] and [...] Louis Walsh accused her of being a [...] "bully" [...] backstage. No evidence was ever provided to support either allegation and both accusers apologised the next day. The other two judges and her fellow contestants defended Misha B during and after the show. Judge Gary Barlow later said he believed the wrongful allegations had ended Misha B's chances of winning the competition. Bryan asked about her experience on X Factor said [...] "I one hundred percent appreciate the platform it gave me...but it's not for the faint-hearted lol.

[...] Misha B spoke to grammy.com in 2013, [...] "I experienced not only highs but <b>my</b> <b>share</b> of lows on The X Factor, but it has set me up with the thick skin needed for this industry...
