40|$|Light {{manipulations}} such as spin-direction locking propagation, robust transport, quantum teleportation and reconfigurable electromagnetic pathways {{have been}} investigated at the boundaries of photonic systems. Recently by breaking Dirac cones in time-reversal invariant photonic crystals, valley-pseudospin coupled edge states have been employed to realize selective propagation of light. Here, without photonic boundaries, we realize the propagation of pseudospin states in three-dimensional bulk <b>metacrystal</b> waveguides by employing the ubiquitous valley degree of freedom. Valley-dependent pseudospin bands are achieved in three-dimensional <b>metacrystal</b> waveguides without Dirac cones. Reconfigurable photonic valley Hall effect is proposed after studying the variation of pseudospin states near K' and K valleys. Moreover, a prototype of photonic blocker is realized by cascading two inversion asymmetric <b>metacrystal</b> waveguides in which the pseudospin direction locking propagation exists. In addition, valley-dependent pseudospin bands are also discussed in a realistic metamaterials sample. These results show an alternative way towards molding the pseudospin flow in photonic systems.

40|$|In two- and {{three-dimensional}} structures, topologically-protected chiral edge modes offer {{a powerful}} mean to realize robust light transport. However, {{little attention has}} been paid so far to robust one-way transport in one-dimensional systems. Here it is shown that unidirectional transport, which is immune to disorder and backscattering, can occur in certain one-dimensional <b>metacrystals</b> with long-range hopping without resorting to topological protection. Such <b>metacrystals</b> are described by an effective Hermitian Hamiltonian with broken time reversal symmetry, and transport does not require adiabatic (Thouless) pumping. A simple implementation in optics of such one-dimensional <b>metacrystals,</b> based on transverse light dynamics in a self-imaging optical cavity with phase gratings, is suggestedComment: 5 pages, 4 figures, comments and suggestions are welcom...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new way of {{nano-engineering}} graphene using defect domains. These regions have ring structures that depart from the usual honeycomb lattice, though each carbon atom still has three nearest neighbors. A set of stable domain structures is identified using density functional theory (DFT), including blisters, ridges, ribbons, and <b>metacrystals.</b> All such structures are made solely out of carbon; the smallest encompasses just 16 atoms. Blisters, ridges and <b>metacrystals</b> rise up out of the sheet, while ribbons remain flat. In the vicinity of vacancies, the reaction barriers to formation are sufficiently low that such defects could be synthesized through the thermally activated restructuring of coalesced adatoms.

40|$|Topological {{acoustic}} and {{elastic waves}} have recently {{emerged as an}} exciting interdisciplinary field which is still mainly focused on low-dimensional structures and model systems. Here we demonstrate numerically an elastic-wave analogue of topological node-lines in three-dimensional mechanical <b>metacrystals</b> with ribbon- or drumhead-like surface states. These two-dimensional topological surface states offer unprecedented, robust subwavelength confinement of elastic waves. Design principles for topological mechanical metamaterials, from both material and symmetry aspects, are unveiled and connected to fundamental conservation laws and nonsymmorphic space group.

Users can control the query coordination process {{at the level of the}} individual search terms or at the level of the search engines to be consulted. This paper addresses the usability issue of the level at which visual query tools can provide the greatest benefit to users searching the Internet. <b>MetaCrystal</b> and its Category View and Cluster Bulls-Eye tools are used to visualize the degree of overlap between the results returned by different query formulations or search engines. It is shown that certain types of similarity relationships between ranked lists give rise to unique visual patterns in the Cluster Bulls-Eye.

40|$|Nonlinear {{processes}} are often governed by selection rules {{imposed by the}} symmetries of the molecular configurations. The most well-known examples include the role of mirror symmetry breaking for the generation of even harmonics, and the selection rule related to the rotation symmetry in harmonic generation for fundamental beams with circular polarizations. While the role of mirror symmetry breaking in second harmonic generation has been extensively studied in plasmonic systems, the investigation on selection rules pertaining to circular polarization states of harmonic generation has been limited to crystals, i. e. symmetries at the atomic level. Here we demonstrate the rotational symmetry dependent third harmonic generation from nonlinear plasmonic <b>metacrystals.</b> We show that the selection rule can be imposed by the rotational symmetry of meta-crystals embedded into an isotropic organic nonlinear thin film. The results presented here may open new avenues for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical responses with tailored plasmonic nanostructures. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|<b>MetaCrystal</b> aims to help users {{find the}} {{documents}} that {{are most likely to}} be relevant. It compares the results returned by multiple search engines and displays the documents based on the number of engines that found them and their rank positions in the result lists. First, this paper examines the validity of the <b>MetaCrystal</b> design approach by calculating the probability that a document is relevant based on the number of engines that found it and its rank positions in the result lists. Using TREC data, it is shown that MetaCrystal’s visual design is sound because it visually emphasizes documents based on their likelihood of being relevant.

40|$|Photonic {{analogue}} of topological insulator {{was recently}} predicted by arranging epsilon/mu (permittivity/permeability) -matched bianisotropic metamaterials into two-dimensional superlattices. However, the experimental observation of such photonic topological insulator is challenging as bianisotropic metamaterial is usually highly dispersive, {{so that the}} epsilon/mu-matching condition can only be satisfied in a narrow frequency range. Here we experimentally realize a photonic topological insulator by embedding non-bianisotropic and non-resonant <b>metacrystal</b> into a waveguide. The cross coupling between transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes exists in <b>metacrystal</b> waveguide. Using this approach, the epsilon/mu-matching condition is satisfied in a broad frequency range which facilitates experimental observation. The topologically non-trivial bandgap is confirmed by experimentally measured transmission spectra and calculated non-zero spin Chern numbers. Gapless spin-filtered edge states are demonstrated experimentally by measuring the magnitude and phase of the fields. The transport robustness of the edge states is also observed when an obstacle was introduced near the edge...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores how {{information}} visualization {{can provide}} {{insights into the}} effectiveness of different query formulations or the same query submitted to multiple search engines. Different queries or search methods are deemed more effective if the fusion of their results leads to a new result set that contains an increased number of relevant documents. The <b>MetaCrystal</b> toolset {{can be used to}} visualize the degree of overlap and similarity between the results returned by different queries or engines. The work presented is guided by two working hypotheses: 1) documents found by multiple methods {{are more likely to be}} relevant; 2) high degrees of overlap and/or systematic relationships between the ranked lists being compared will not lead to fusion results that contain more relevant documents. <b>MetaCrystal</b> visually identifies documents found by multiple queries or engines. The number and distribution patterns of documents found by multiple methods can be used as a visual measure of the fusion effectiveness.

40|$|Achieving robust {{transport}} {{has attracted}} much attention in both electronic and photonic systems. Time-reversal invariant photonic crystal can be employed to realize backscattering-immune chiral state, but the chiral bandgap is topologically trivial. Here, we designed and fabricated a <b>metacrystal</b> comprising non-resonant meta-atoms sandwiched between two metallic plates and the system exhibits topological phase transition as established by group classification. The nontrivial bandgap was confirmed by experimentally measured transmission spectra, calculated nonzero spin Chern number and Z 2 index. Gapless spin-filtered edge states were demonstrated experimentally by measuring the magnitude and phase of the fields. The transpsort robustness of the edge states were also observed when an obstacle is introduced near the edge. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Photonic {{crystals}} and dielectric metamaterials represent {{two different}} classes of artificial media but are often composed of similar structural elements. The {{question is how}} to distinguish these two types of periodic structures when their parameters, such as permittivity and lattice constant, vary continuously. Here we discuss transition between photonic crystals and dielectric metamaterials and introduce the concept of a phase diagram, based on the physics of Mie and Bragg resonances. We show that a periodic photonic structure transforms into a metamaterial when the Mie gap opens up below the lowest Bragg bandgap where the homogenization approach can be justified and the effective permeability becomes negative. Our theoretical approach is confirmed by microwave experiments for a <b>metacrystal</b> composed of tubes filled with heated water.
