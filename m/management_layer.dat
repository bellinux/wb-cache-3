Horizontally, there were changes that removed role conflicts or goal conflicts between the sub-units in the organization.

40|$|Abstract—The {{basic idea}} behind cloud {{computing}} is that resource providers offer elastic resources to end users. In this paper, {{we intend to}} answer one key question {{to the success of}} cloud computing: in cloud, can small-to-medium scale scientific communities benefit from the economies of scale? Our research contributions are three-fold: first, we propose an innovative public cloud usage model for small-to-medium scale scientific communities to utilize elastic resources on a public cloud site while maintaining their flexible system controls, i. e., create, activate, suspend, resume, deactivate, and destroy their high-level <b>management</b> entities—service <b>management</b> <b>layers</b> without knowing the details of management. Second, we design and implement an innovative system—DawningCloud, at the core of which are lightweight service <b>management</b> <b>layers</b> running on top of a common management service framework. The common management service framework of DawningCloud not only facilitates building lightweight service <b>management</b> <b>layers</b> for heterogeneous workloads, but also makes their management tasks simple. Third, we evaluate the systems comprehensively using both emulation and real experiments. We found that for four traces of two typical scientific workloads: high throughput computing (HTC) and many task computing (MTC), DawningCloud saves the resource consumption maximally by 59. 5 % and 72. 6 % for HTC and MTC service providers, respectively, and saves the total resource consumption maximally by 54 % for the resource provider with respect to the previous two public cloud solutions. To this end, we conclude that small-to-medium scale scientific communities indeed can benefit from the economies of scale of public clouds {{with the support of the}} enabling system...|$|R

30|$|In {{a similar}} move, the service {{activities}} {{were removed from}} the regional units and consolidated in a global unit. Yet the managers in the service units are still located in the same regions, and they continue to participate in the regional leadership team meetings (illustrated with the dotted line in Fig. 4). Hence, with respect to the service unit, a partial matrix structure remains (for some senior managers). In order to reduce costs, FMC Subsea also initiated a general downsizing of staff and reduced the number of <b>management</b> <b>layers</b> as part of this re-organization. The number of <b>management</b> <b>layers</b> within a region was reduced from 8 to 3. As a consequence, the average span of control for managers increased from 5 to 12. A number of process improvements were also made in order to reduce costs. As an example of one such initiative, FMC was able {{to reduce the number of}} technical documents in one engineering process from 450 to 150; the managers that were interviewed were confident that this had been achieved without any reduction in the quality of the process.|$|R
