50|$|The F2 {{could also}} mount the Nikon MF-1 (33/10 feet/meters film = 250 frames; {{required}} two Nikon MZ-1 <b>film</b> <b>cassettes)</b> and MF-2 (100/30 feet/meters film = 750 frames; required two MZ-2 <b>film</b> <b>cassettes)</b> bulk <b>film</b> backs. These were very useful if a photographer had a motor drive mounted {{and needed to}} take more than seven seconds worth of photographs. Note that the MF-2 and its MZ-2 cassettes are very rare.|$|R
5000|$|First he {{retrieved}} the <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> from the Panoramic Camera and returned {{that to the}} cabin. After inspecting the [...] "V-over-H" [...] sensor on the Mapping Camera he retrieved its <b>film</b> <b>cassette.</b> He {{found that there was}} nothing obscuring the sensor as had been postulated by Mission Control as a cause for its problems. Later analysis would find that the problem was related to the optical signal-to-noise ratio.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the mission, {{the crew}} took the <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> and other items they were {{returning}} to Earth and stowed them in the descent module. The retrofire, re-entry, and landing took place without incident on 23 September.|$|R
50|$|The Leica 250 Reporter {{is a body}} {{variant of}} the Leica screw mount rangefinder. It was {{designed}} to take bulk film by rolls of 10 metres, allowing 250 exposures. The film was charged in special <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> (code KOOBF).|$|R
5000|$|While Kodak {{had invented}} the Kodak 135 daylight-loading <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> in 1934, prior to 1938 they only offered the German made Kodak Retina {{to work with}} this cartridge. US built 35mm cameras used the 828 paper backed 35mm roll-film (Bantam Series).|$|R
50|$|Since the 1980s <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> {{have been}} {{marked with a}} DX {{encoding}} pattern; conforming cameras detect this and set their light meters according to film speed. Different films are sensitive to light at different degrees; this film speed is standardised by ISO.|$|R
50|$|A <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> {{is similar}} to a film can in that it is a {{light-tight}} enclosure containing a spool of <b>film.</b> However a <b>cassette</b> also has a light trap, usually a set of lips covered with velvet, that allow film through without allowing light into the can. This allows a cassette to be loaded into a camera in daylight, then the camera back closed and light-sealed before use.|$|R
50|$|Apollo 15 {{spent one}} more day in lunar orbit, {{continuing}} Worden's observations. After releasing a subsatellite, they ignited their Service Propulsion system {{to put them on}} a trajectory back to Earth. The next day, Worden performed an EVA to retrieve the <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> from the SIM bay cameras.|$|R

5000|$|An AEC {{system uses}} {{one or more}} {{physically}} thin radiation ionization detectors (the [...] "AEC detector") which is positioned between the patient being x-rayed and the x-ray <b>film</b> <b>cassette.</b> Where low energy x-rays are used such as in mammography the AEC detector is placed behind the image receptor to avoid creating a shadow.|$|R
50|$|Mission Control {{ran over}} the stowage of {{items in the}} cabin. It was {{extremely}} important that stowed items were placed such that the spacecraft's centre-of-gravity was within the set limits. Especially important were items like the rock samples weighing 170 lb (77 kg) and the 55 lb (25 kg) <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> from the Panoramic Camera.|$|R
50|$|Bray Studios is a {{film and}} {{television}} facility at Bray, near Maidenhead, Berkshire, England. The model and <b>miniature</b> <b>filming</b> for the film Alien was shot there, as well as The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It {{is best known for}} its association with Hammer Film Productions and contains four stages, plus offices and workshops.|$|R
5000|$|The El Rio del Tiempo {{boat ride}} at the Mexico {{pavilion}} at World Showcase, {{which has since}} been modified into the Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros, includes films projected onto small screens embedded in elaborate sets.

5|$|Alien {{was filmed}} over {{fourteen}} weeks from July 5 to October 21, 1978. Principal photography {{took place at}} Shepperton Studios near London, while model and <b>miniature</b> <b>filming</b> was done at Bray Studios in Water Oakley, Berkshire. The production schedule was short due to the film's low budget and pressure from 20th Century Fox to finish on time.|$|R
50|$|When still cameras using 35 mm film, {{originally}} {{used for}} cinematography, were introduced they were widely known as miniature cameras to distinguish {{them from the}} then commonplace rollfilm cameras. While the term {{could be used for}} a camera larger than a subminiature and smaller than a rollfilm camera, it was mostly used for cameras taking 135 <b>film</b> <b>cassettes,</b> or other 35 mm cassettes.|$|R
40|$|Alignment of the {{co-ordinate}} {{reference frame}} and <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> with the x-ray source {{and the control}} of image magnification and distortion due to diver-gence of the x-rays were resolved by Leksell (1949) in the following manner. Three drills are used to fix the rectangular co-ordinate reference frame firmly to the patients skull. The x-ray source is coupled magnetically and aligned with the co-ordinate frame by a counter...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} an improved apparatus {{for use in}} the X-ray inspection of samples of grain or seeds to determine internal insect infestation and other internal physical anomalies. It particularly relates to a novel <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> and sample holder which helps to produce a clear radiograph of the sample which is held in an orderly alignment, thereby permitting rapid visual inspection and analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{stereometric camera}} was {{designed}} for close-range techniques in biostereometrics. The camera focusing distance of 360 mm to infinity covers a broad field of close-range photogrammetry. The design provides for a separate unit for the lens system and interchangeable backs on the camera {{for the use of}} single frame film exposure, roll-type <b>film</b> <b>cassettes,</b> or glass plates. The system incorporates the use of a surface contrast optical projector...|$|R
50|$|The Minolta 16 can {{be traced}} back to the Mica Automat built by Konan in 1947. Minolta bought out Konan in the early 1950s and {{continued}} producing cameras under the Konan name for several years. The first camera labeled Minolta 16 rather than Konan 16 was the Minolta 16 Automat of 1955. The Minolta 16 used a newly designed <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> which was not compatible with the Konan models.|$|R
5000|$|The course {{comprised}} {{a self-contained}} kit of course materials, <b>film</b> <b>cassettes,</b> visual aids, and games. Some {{of the activities}} were very imaginative; a game based upon reindeer [...] had a loaded die to introduce discussion about instincts, and a paper seal would be cut up and shared among class members representing various people in the Netsilik community, according to a ritual governing who was entitled to which part of the animal.|$|R
500|$|At a {{distance}} of about [...] from Earth, Mattingly performed a [...] "deep-space" [...] extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, during which he retrieved several <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> from the CSM's SIM bay. While outside the spacecraft, Mattingly set up a biological experiment, the Microbial Ecology Evaluation Device (MEED). The MEED experiment was only performed on Apollo 16. The crew carried out various housekeeping and maintenance tasks aboard the spacecraft and ate a meal before concluding the day.|$|R
40|$|Extendible booms used {{to convey}} <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> {{weighing}} 56. 7 kg (125 lb) between the Airlock Module and the Apollo Telescope Mount are described {{along with the}} dispensing mechanism. Problems encountered with the mechanism during the test program are discussed. These problems were mainly associated with operation in cold temperature, lubrication, and the motor/gearhead assembly. Another set of problems which arose during crew training in the MSFC water tank is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Photographers {{praise the}} {{beautiful}} intermediate gray or color gradation {{that results from}} making prints this way. Each print is necessarily {{the same size as}} the corresponding image on the negative. This makes contact prints from large-format negatives, especially 5×7 inch and larger, most usable for fine-art work. Smaller contact prints, from films and formats such as 135 <b>film</b> <b>cassettes,</b> 35 mm (24×36 mm images), and 120/220 roll film (6 cm), are useful for evaluation of exposure, composition, and subject.|$|R
5000|$|At a {{distance}} of about 170000 nmi km from Earth, Mattingly performed a [...] "deep-space" [...] extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, during which he retrieved several <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> from the CSM's SIM bay. While outside the spacecraft, Mattingly set up a biological experiment, the Microbial Ecology Evaluation Device (MEED). The MEED experiment was only performed on Apollo 16. The crew carried out various housekeeping and maintenance tasks aboard the spacecraft and ate a meal before concluding the day.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1980, the West German Federal Ministry of Finance {{told the}} Bundestag that between January 1978 and December 1979, [...] "200 {{shipments}} of right-wing content, including books, periodicals, symbols, decorations, <b>films,</b> <b>cassettes,</b> and records" [...] had been intercepted entering West Germany; these shipments [...] "came overwhelmingly from Canada." [...] On April 23, 1981, the West German government {{sent a letter}} to the Canadian Jewish Congress, confirming that the source of the material was Samisdat Publishers.|$|R
50|$|DX Encoding (Digital indeX), or DX coding was {{initially}} developed by Kodak in the 1980s, and eventually adapted by all camera and film manufacturers. It {{provides information on}} both the <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> and on the film regarding the type of film, number of exposures, speed (ISO/ASA rating) of the film. It consists of three types of identification. First is a barcode near the film opening of the cassette, identifying the manufacturer, film type and processing method (see image below left). This is used by photofinishing equipment during film processing. The second part is a barcode {{on the edge of}} the film (see image below right), used also during processing, which indicates the image film type, manufacturer, frame number and synchronizes the position of the frame. The third part of DX coding, known as the DX Camera Auto Sensing (CAS) code, consists of a series of 12 metal contacts on the <b>film</b> <b>cassette,</b> which beginning with cameras manufactured after 1985 could detect the type of film, number of exposures and ISO of the film, and use that information to automatically adjust the camera settings for the speed of the film.|$|R
30|$|Rosemberg’s view, {{described}} in 1988 [93], {{is useful to}} evaluate the lateral compartment of the knee. The patient stands on both legs with thumbs pointing ahead and the patellae touching the <b>film</b> <b>cassette.</b> The knees are at 45 ° of flexion (25 ° between the femora and the cassette, and 20 ° between the tibiae and the cassette), and the X-ray beam is directed posterior to anterior, 10 ° caudal, so the posterior and the anterior margins of the tibial plateau are superimposed.|$|R
50|$|During {{the three}} day explorations of the Moon by Scott and Irwin, Worden had a busy {{schedule}} of observations. Apollo 15 {{was the first}} mission to carry the SIM bay, which contained a panoramic camera, gamma ray spectrometer, mapping camera, laser altimeter and mass spectrometer. Worden had to operate the shutter and lenses on the camera and turn {{on and off the}} various instruments. During the coast back to Earth, he would perform an EVA to retrieve <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> from the cameras.|$|R
