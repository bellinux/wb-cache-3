25|$|Rubella {{can cause}} {{congenital}} rubella syndrome in the newborn. The syndrome (CRS) follows intrauterine infection by the rubella virus and comprises cardiac, cerebral, ophthalmic and auditory defects. It may also cause prematurity, low birth weight, and neonatal thrombocytopenia, anemia and hepatitis. The risk of <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> or organogenesis is highest for infection in the first trimester. CRS {{is the main reason}} a vaccine for rubella was developed.|$|E

25|$|Braille {{was based}} on a tactile {{military}} code called night writing, developed by Charles Barbier in response to Napoleon's demand for a means for soldiers to communicate silently at night and without a light source. In Barbier's system, sets of 12 embossed dots encoded 36 different sounds. It proved to be too difficult for soldiers to recognize by touch and was rejected by the military. In 1821 Barbier visited the Royal Institute for the Blind in Paris, where he met Louis Braille. Braille identified two <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> of the code: first, by representing only sounds, the code was unable to render the orthography of the words; second, the human finger could not encompass the whole 12-dot symbol without moving, and so could not move rapidly from one symbol to another. Braille's solution was to use 6-dot cells and to assign a specific pattern to each letter of the alphabet.|$|E
500|$|The {{system did}} not perform as {{effectively}} as expected, however. This was due to two <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> in the design. The riveted joint that connected the interior torpedo bulkhead {{to the bottom of}} the hull was not strong enough to sustain the tremendous shear loadings associated with direct contact explosions. The joints failed even in cases of non-contact explosions; this prevented the hollow drum from collapsing as designed and resulted in massive flooding. The fineness of the hull shape prevented the 3800mm thickness from being maintained for the entire central citadel; the width of the drum was reduced significantly abreast of the main battery, down to [...] The ability of the drum to absorb explosive shock correspondingly fell in relation to its size.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{association}} between increased nuchal translucency thickness and <b>major</b> cardiac <b>defects</b> in chromosomally normal fetuses. Setting Tertiary referral unit for fetal medicine and fetal cardiology. Methods During a 4 -year period (January 1997 to January 2001), detailed echocardiography was performed in 1319 chromosomally normal fetuses with increased nuchal trans-lucency thickness at 10 – 14 weeks of gestation. The incidence of <b>major</b> cardiac <b>defects</b> was examined {{in relation to the}} fetal NT at the 10 – 14 -week scan. Results <b>Major</b> cardiac <b>defects</b> were diagnosed in 60 (4. 5 %) of the 1319 fetuses. In fetuses with a nuchal translucency thick-ness in the range of 2. 5 – 3. 4 mm, the incidence of <b>major</b> cardiac <b>defects</b> was 2. 5 % (18 / 722; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 – 3. 9) and in those with a nuchal translucency thickness ≥ 3. 5 mm, it was 7 % (42 / 597; 95 % confidence interval, 5. 1 – 9. 4). Conclusion Specialist echocardiography is indicated in all fetuses with increased nuchal translucency thickness because, in such fetuses, the incidence of <b>major</b> cardiac <b>defects</b> is sub-stantially higher than in pregnancies with maternal diabetes, family history and exposure to drugs, where fetal echocardi-ography is widely considered to be necessary...|$|R
