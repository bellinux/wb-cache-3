25|$|The {{citizens}} of Sacramento adopted a city charter in 1849, which {{was recognized by}} the state legislature in 1850. Sacramento is the oldest incorporated city in California, incorporated on February 27, 1850. During the early 1850s, the Sacramento valley was devastated by floods, fires and cholera epidemics. Despite this, because of its position just downstream from the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode</b> in the Sierra Nevada, the new city grew, quickly reaching a population of 10,000.|$|E
25|$|The Bocamina de San Ramón mine {{is one of}} the city’s early mines, {{with the}} deposit found by some {{travelers}} in the early 16th century. In 1548, its <b>mother</b> <b>lode</b> was found. Today, the mine is a tourist attraction in which visitors can descend into the earth through the old shafts. The complex has a patio area, a gallery of minerals and a bar called El Petardo, which once was the gunpowder storage room.|$|E
50|$|When {{the mines}} {{failed in the}} 1890s, Sandy faltered, then {{underwent}} a significant economic transformation into an agricultural community. The fact that Sandy did not disappear, {{like so many other}} mining towns that dwindled with their <b>mother</b> <b>lodes,</b> was due to its location, resources, and the spirit of its inhabitants.|$|R
5000|$|In 1848, Jose Maria Amador, {{with several}} Native Americans, {{established}} a successful gold mining camp near the present town of Amador City. In Spanish, the word amador means [...] "one who loves". Some of the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode's</b> most successful gold mines {{were located in}} Amador County, including the Kennedy, Argonaut, and Keystone.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} gold mines in Amador County including the Argonaut Mine, the Kennedy Mine, the Central Eureka, and the Lincoln. The Kennedy Mine in Jackson was the deepest gold mine of its time. The federal government closed {{all of the}} <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode's</b> mines in 1942 because they were considered non-essential to the war effort. Recently the Sutter Gold Mining Company has attempted to re-open the Lincoln Mine just north of Sutter Creek. If the mine successfully reaches the operation phase, {{it will be the}} first corporately funded, large scale underground gold mine in the area in over 70 years.|$|R
25|$|The {{life of a}} miner in the <b>mother</b> <b>lode</b> of California {{might have}} been {{somewhat}} of a shock to Fairfax, who grew up as a gentleman farmer, but he stuck with the endeavor for a while. He prospected extensively, only to lose whatever money he made {{as fast as he}} got hold of it. There were stories of him working for others, pushing a wheelbarrow, or tending a mule pulling a cart of gravel and sloshing about in the mud of the diggings.|$|E
25|$|This bizarre {{method of}} {{insemination}} probably evolved as male bed bugs competed {{with each other}} to place their sperm {{closer and closer to the}} <b>mother</b> <b>lode</b> of eggs, the ovaries. Some male insects evolved long penises with which they enter the vagina but bypass the female's storage pouch and deposit their sperm further upstream close to the ovaries. A few males, notably among bed bugs, evolved traumatic insemination instead, and eventually this strange procedure became the norm among these insects.|$|E
25|$|The 1982 film <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode</b> {{made use}} of a Canadian-registered former United States Army de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver on floats as the {{neglected}} mount of character Jean Dupré (Nick Mancuso), who embarks on {{a search for a}} missing friend in northern British Columbia. During the filming the aircraft actually crashed while landing on a lake and sank. This accident was not in the original script, but the footage was retained and incorporated into the film's plot. The aircraft was recovered from the lake, repaired, restored and exported to the United States.|$|E
50|$|Jackson, {{named after}} Colonel Alden Jackson, {{was founded in}} 1848 around a year-round spring. Settlement of the region by American pioneers was stimulated by the {{discovery}} of gold in the Sierra foothills around 1848. The settlement was named for a local lawyer who was liked by miners named Alden Appola Moore Jackson. Although Amador County was an important mining center, its County seat of Jackson was not typical of the early gold camps. The camp grew quickly, as besides being a popular mining spot, {{it was also a}} convenient stopping place on the road from Sacramento to the Southern Mines. The camp became an important supply and transportation center for the neighboring towns, and by 1850 the population had reached an estimated 1,500. Jackson grew first as a watering hole for cattle, then as one of the earliest and most durable of the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode's</b> hard rock mining areas.|$|R
500|$|The {{second and}} most {{dramatic}} boom {{resulted from the}} Klondike Gold Rush, which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of 1893. In a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the S.S. Portland docked with its famed [...] "ton of gold", and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon. Few of those working men found lasting wealth. However, it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like Everett, Tacoma, Port Townsend, Bremerton, and Olympia, all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than <b>mother</b> <b>lodes</b> for extraction, of precious metals. The boom lasted well into {{the early part of}} the 20th century, and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old James E. Casey borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the American Messenger Company (later UPS). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer. Seattle brought in the Olmsted Brothers landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} I {{focus on the}} {{question}} of wheth-er nanotechnology is giving rise to new ethical problems rather than merely to new instances of old ethical prob-lems. Firstly, I demonstrate how important it is tomake a general distinction between new ethical problems and new instances of old problems. Secondly, I propose one possible way of interpreting the distinction and offer a definition of a “new ethical problem”. Thirdly, I exam-ine whether {{there is good reason to}} claim that nanotech-nology is giving or will give rise to new ethical prob-lems. My conclusion is that there are no new ethical problems in nanotechnology but merely new occur-rences of certain well-known types of ethical problems. Fourthly, I consider three arguments by van de Poel (NanoEthics 2 : 25 – 28, 2008) which contradict my con-clusion. I argue that my negative conclusion is consis-tent with the claim that certain ethical issues arising in nanotechnology may require new normative standards or new analytical tools. I conclude that it is likely that a number of ethical issues arising in nanotechnology will have a considerable impact on our ethical theories and values – and that ethical reflection on nanotechnology will be one of the <b>mother</b> <b>lodes</b> of future ethical research – in spite of the fact that no ethical problem in nanoethics will actually be “new”...|$|R

25|$|Mega Man Legends 2, {{known in}} Japan as , is an action-adventure game {{released}} by Capcom in 2000, {{acting as the}} sequel to Mega Man Legends. It was released for the PlayStation in 2000 for Japan and North America, and 2001 in Europe. Unchanged Japanese ports of the game were also released for the PC in Japan and parts of Asia in 2003 and for the PlayStation Portable in 2005. The game features Mega Man Volnutt's quest to find four keys hidden in the planet in order {{to aid in the}} search of the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode,</b> a legendary treasure thought to be an infinite energy source.|$|E
25|$|A {{news conference}} {{is held by}} Professor Barrel Caskett and his old friend Werner Von Bluecher about the {{upcoming}} journey to the Forbidden Island in a large airship called the Sulphur Bottom {{to search for the}} <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode.</b> Barrel recognizes a reporter, Yuna, as his lost daughter, Matilda Caskett, who warns them of the catastrophe that could transpire if they pursue their journey. Yuna escapes with her servant, a Reaverbot flying machine-like being named Gatz to break the windows for her escape. Ignoring her warning Bluecher continues {{to the center of the}} island. Yuna orders Gatz to give warning shots but due to the hostile retaliation of the Sulphur Bottom, Gatz damages the engine, forcing the airship to descend to the island below.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Engineering {{became part}} of the new Department of Public Works in 1921, and the California Highway Commission was entirely {{separated}} as its own department in 1923. In order to pay for the roads, a 2-cent per gallon gasoline tax was approved in 1923. The legislature continued to add highways to the system, including the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode</b> Highway (now part of SR 49) in 1921 and the Arrowhead Trail (now I-15 north of Barstow) in 1925. In January 1928, the California State Automobile Association and Automobile Club of Southern California, which had already been placing guide and warning signs along state highways, marked the U.S. Highways along several of the most major state highways. The California Toll Bridge Authority was created in 1929 to acquire and operate all toll bridges on state highways, including the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and Carquinez Bridge.|$|E
500|$|Mining {{activity}} was initially {{concentrated in the}} eastern (upper) valleys of the Trinity River around Weaverville, as the hostile Native Americans and treacherous gorges around Burnt Ranch precluded the transport of rations and equipment to places further west. For about two decades the area was extremely productive, {{second only to the}} Sierra Nevada (the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode)</b> itself. The rate at which gold was extracted, and new methods pioneered to access the harder to reach deposits, was feverish. Author James Hilton remarked that Weaverville was a [...] "Shangri-La, that strange and wonderful somewhere which is not a place but a state of mind." [...] The area was soon profiting $1.5 million a year, with hundreds of claims along the Trinity River equipped with flumes, waterwheels and other apparatus to separate fine gold from river gravel.|$|E
500|$|At this time, US 50 was {{improved}} but unpaved east of Placerville. As part of {{the state}} project to pave this portion, the old road was bypassed in several areas, completing the final two-lane alignment. These realignments included Broadway, bypassing Smith Flat Road, at Smith Flat (1932), a new route around Slippery Ford Grade east of Strawberry (1931), and a new route through South Lake Tahoe, leaving behind Pioneer Trail (1931). The crossing of the Sierra crest at Johnson Pass was bypassed in 1940 by a better-quality route over Echo Summit; the lower {{part of the}} current road east of the summit opened in 1947, bypassing Meyers Road. West of Placerville, several major two-lane relocations were built. A bypass (now <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode</b> Drive) around El Dorado and the winding Forni Road was completed in 1938, and the improvement was extended west to Shingle Springs in 1947. A short relocation north of White Rock, between Bidwell Street and Bass Lake Road, opened in 1940, and was extended west beyond Hazel Avenue, bypassing Folsom, in 1949.|$|E
500|$|Yogo sapphires {{were not}} {{initially}} recognized or valued. [...] Gold was discovered at Yogo Creek in 1866, and though [...] "blue pebbles" [...] were noticed alongside {{gold in the}} stream alluvium by 1878, {{it was not until}} 1894 that the [...] "blue pebbles" [...] were recognized as sapphires. Sapphire mining began in 1895 after a local rancher named Jake Hoover sent a cigar box of gems he had collected to an assay office, which in turn sent them to Tiffany's in New York, where an appraiser pronounced them [...] "the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States". Hoover then purchased the original <b>mother</b> <b>lode</b> from a sheepherder, later selling it to other investors. [...] This became the highly profitable [...] "English Mine", which flourished from 1899 until the 1920s. A second operation, the [...] "American Mine", was owned by a series of investors in the western section of the Yogo dike, but was less profitable and bought out by the syndicate that owned the English Mine. In 1984, a third set of claims, known as the Vortex mine, opened.|$|E
2500|$|During the Gold Rush, Livermore's ranch {{became a}} popular [...] "first day" [...] {{stopping}} point for prospectors and businessmen leaving San Francisco or San Jose {{and headed for}} Sacramento and the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode</b> gold country. Most horse traffic went by way of Altamont Pass just east of Livermore. Robert Livermore was a very accommodating host and welcomed nearly all that stopped by with lodging and meals.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{geologic}} context, the San Joaquin River can {{be divided}} into two major segments. The upper [...] above Friant Dam in the Sierra is characterized as a steep-gradient, rocky mountain stream. Over millions of years, the upper San Joaquin, as well as the upper reaches of most of its tributaries, have eroded enormous amounts of rock and sediment from the mountains. Most of the Sierras are underlain by granitic igneous and metamorphic rock dating back to the Mesozoic Era (250-66 MYA); in addition many of the San Joaquin's tributaries flow across a foothills region of metamorphosed volcanic rock more famously known as the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode</b> Gold Belt.|$|E
2500|$|In 2017 Eagleman and {{co-author}} Anthony Brandt (a music composer) wrote The Runaway Species, {{an examination of}} human creativity. [...] The book was described by the journal Nature as [...] "A lively exploration of the software our brains run {{in search of the}} <b>mother</b> <b>lode</b> of invention… It sweeps the reader through examples from engineering, science, product design, music and the visual arts to trace the roots of creative thinking." [...] The Wall Street Journal wrote that [...] "the authors look at art and science together to examine how innovations — from Picasso’s initially offensive paintings to Steve Jobs’s startling iPhone — build on what already exists... This manifesto of sorts shows how both disciplines foster creativity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Claims {{that the}} mountain's viewshed {{is the largest}} in the worldor second largest after Mount Kilimanjaroare ill founded. It does boast one of the largest viewsheds in the Western United States and {{played a key role in}} California history. Countless peaks in the state are taller, but Mount Diablo has a {{remarkable}} visual prominence for a mountain of such low elevation. Its looming presence over much of the bay area, delta, and Central Valley, and good visibility even from the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode,</b> all key regions during the gold rush and early statehood, made it an important landmark for mapping and navigation. [...] The summit is used as the reference datum for land surveying in much of northern California and Nevada.|$|E
2500|$|Mega Man Legends 2 {{brings back}} several {{characters}} from its predecessor. This includes the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt (whose original name is Mega Man Trigger), a Digger {{in charge of}} exploring ruins to find Refractors, Roll Caskett, his spotter, who is searching for her missing parents, and Data, a mechanical monkey who contains all of Mega Man's original memories. Roll's grandfather, Barrel Caskett, also appears alongside his old friend Werner Von Bluecher {{in search of the}} <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode,</b> a legendary treasure supposed to have infinite energy. The pirates [...] "the Bonnes", made up of siblings Teisel, Tron, and Bon, return once again as antagonists of the series but allied with three new members: a blonde-haired man named Glyde previously seen in The Misadventures of Tron Bonne who uses Birdbots as servants, and Bola and Klaymoor, a floating samurai and an enormous man wearing armor, respectively. Other characters include Yuna and Sera, whose purposes remain unknown during the game's start, as well as the Master: a 3000-year-old man who {{is referred to as the}} last [...] "true" [...] human.|$|E
2500|$|The Legends series {{takes place}} on a flooded Earth. Because of the flooding, only a few sparse islands exist and energy sources are rare. In order to satisfy this {{increasing}} demand for energy to power up machinery, quantum refractors found in ancient ruins are used. These refractors are valuable; they serve as an energy source, and their shards are used as currency. However, the main goal of every person {{is to find the}} <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode,</b> an item of supposed infinite power that can fill the need for the energy in one swoop. Those who try to excavate these ruins are called [...] "Diggers" [...] ("Digouters" [...] in the Japanese version). The protagonist of the game is Mega Man Volnutt, a Digger living in a ship called Flutter. He lives there alongside Roll Caskett, his Spotter who is searching for her missing father, Barrel Caskett, Roll's grandfather, and Data, a mysterious monkey that talks in gibberish only Mega Man himself can understand. The game's antagonists are pirates known as the Bonnes who want to steal Kattelox's secret treasure in order to become rich. They consist of Teisel Bonne, the leader of the group. His sibling is Tron Bonne, who builds most of their robots used in their elaborate schemes (and develops feelings for Mega Man), and the youngest brother, Bon Bonne, who can only say one word—"Babu!" [...] The Bonnes are accompanied by forty Servbots, robots under the care of Tron.|$|E
6000|$|Smoke laughed cheerfully, {{and ran his}} eye up {{the glistening}} face of the tiny glacier that filled {{the head of the}} valley.

60|$|In {{the early}} spring he and Shorty had come up the Stewart River and {{launched}} out into the amazing chaos of the region where Surprise Lake lay. And all of the spring {{and half of the}} summer had been consumed in futile wanderings, when, on the verge of turning back, they caught their first glimpse of the baffling, gold-bottomed sheet of water which had lured and fooled a generation of miners. Making their camp in the old cabin which Smoke had discovered on his previous visit, they had learned three things: first, heavy nugget gold was carpeted thickly on the lake bottom; next, the gold could be dived for in the shallower portions, but the temperature of the water was man-killing; and, finally, the draining of the lake was too stupendous a task for two men in the shorter half of a short summer. Undeterred, reasoning from the coarseness of the gold that it had not traveled far, they had set out in search of the <b>mother</b> <b>lode.</b> They had crossed the big glacier that frowned on the southern rim and devoted themselves to the puzzling maze of small valleys and canyons beyond, which, by most unmountainlike methods, drained, or had at one time drained, into the lake.|$|E
5000|$|According to the American Film Institute, {{the film}} {{is based on the}} {{theatrical}} play <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode</b> (1934). The play was written by George O'Neil and Dan Totheroh. [...] The working title for the film was <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode.</b>|$|E

The gold of the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode</b> is in quartz veins within phyllite, schist, slate, and greenstone. Through 1959, the <b>Mother</b> <b>Lode</b> produced about 13.3 million troy ounces (414 tonnes) of gold.|$|E
