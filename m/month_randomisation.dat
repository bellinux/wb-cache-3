40|$|QuestionDoes {{a program}} of {{quadriceps}} exercises or dietary advice, or both, reduce knee pain and improve knee function in {{people living in the}} community with knee pain?DesignFactorial, randomised, controlled trial. SettingFive general practices in the United Kingdom with interventions delivered through home visits. ParticipantsCommunity dwellers aged at least 45 years, who were overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 28) and complained of knee pain on most days of the past <b>month.</b> <b>Randomisation</b> of 389 participants allotted 82 to the quadriceps exercise group, 122 to the dietary advice group, 109 to the quadriceps exercise and dietary advice group, and 76 to a control group. InterventionsThe exercise groups were taught the exercises at home by a dietitian and received up to 6 further home visits over 24 months. Exercise participants were asked to complete ≥ 2 exercises a day, with 5 to 20 repetitions of each exercise. The exercises progressed from quadriceps setting exercises, to exercises with elasticised bands, to functional activities such as stepping up and down off a step. The dietary groups received individualised advice to reduce weight, newsletters with recipe ideas, and one home visit per month over 24 months. The control group received an advice leaflet. Outcome measuresThe primary outcome was pain reduction by ≥ 30 % on the pain subscale of the Western Ontario McMaster (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index at 24 months. Secondary outcome measures were change in the WOMAC pain, stiffness, and physical function subscales, hospital anxiety and depression rating scale, and the bodily pain and physical function domains of the Short Form 36 (SF- 36). Results 289 (74 %) participants completed the study. At 24 months, those in the exercise groups were more likely to experience > 30 % reduction in pain compared to the non-exercise groups (relative risk 1. 36, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 1. 76) with number needed to treat of 9 (95 % CI 5 to 55). Compared to the non-exercise groups the exercise groups showed improvement in WOMAC physical function of − 3. 64 units (95 % − 6. 01 to − 1. 27), WOMAC stiffness (− 0. 35 units, 95 % CI − 0. 66 to − 0. 03), and improvements in the SF- 36 subscales of bodily pain and physical function. The dietary advice groups lost weight (2. 95 kg, 95 % CI 1. 44 to 4. 46 kg) and reduced depression at 24 months compared to the non-dietary groups, but showed no evidence of an effect on any other outcomes. ConclusionA 2 -year homebased quadriceps exercise program reduced knee pain and increased knee function in overweight and obese people with knee pain. The effect size was moderate. Dietary advice resulted in a modest weight loss that did not change pain or function, but did reduce depression...|$|E
40|$|A {{caesarean}} section (CS) {{can cause a}} defect or disruption of the myometrium {{at the site of}} the uterine scar, called a niche. In recent years, an association between a niche and postmenstrual spotting after a CS has been demonstrated. Hysteroscopic resection of these niches is thought to reduce spotting and menstrual pain. However, there are no randomised trials assessing the effectiveness of a hysteroscopic niche resection. We planned a multicentre randomised trial comparing hysteroscopic niche resection to no intervention. We study women with postmenstrual spotting after a CS and a niche with a residual myometrium of at least 3 mm during sonohysterography. After informed consent is obtained, eligible women will be randomly allocated to hysteroscopic resection of the niche or expectant management for 6 months. The primary outcome is the number of days with postmenstrual spotting during one menstrual cycle 6 <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation.</b> Secondary outcomes are menstrual characteristics, menstruation related pain and experienced discomfort due to spotting or menstrual pain, quality of life, patient satisfaction, sexual function, urological symptoms, medical consultations, medication use, complications, lost productivity and medical costs.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Infectious and immune-mediated encephalitides are {{important}} but under-recognised causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} in childhood, with a 7 % death rate and up to 50 % morbidity after prolonged follow-up. There is a theoretical basis for ameliorating the immune response with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which is supported by empirical evidence of a beneficial response following its use in the treatment of viral and autoimmune encephalitis. In immune-mediated encephalitis, IVIG is often used after a delay (by weeks in some cases), while diagnosis is confirmed. Wider use of IVIG in infectious encephalitis and earlier use in immune-mediated encephalitis could improve outcomes for these conditions. We describe the protocol for the first ever randomised control trial of IVIG treatment for children with all-cause encephalitis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 308 children (6  months to 16  years) with a diagnosis of acute/subacute encephalitis will be recruited in ∼ 30 UK hospitals and randomised to receive 2 doses (1  g/kg/dose) of either IVIG or matching placebo, in addition to standard treatment. Recruitment will be over a 42 -month period and follow-up of each participant will be for 12 <b>months</b> post <b>randomisation.</b> The primary outcome is andapos;good recoveryandapos; (score of 2 or lower on the Glasgow Outcome Score Extended-paediatric version), at 12  <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation.</b> Additional secondary neurological measures will be collected at 4 - 6  weeks after discharge from acute care and at 6 and 12  <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation.</b> Safety, radiological, other autoimmune and tertiary outcomes will also be assessed.

40|$|Introduction: A Cochrane review, {{evaluating}} treadmill training (TT) after stroke, found current {{evidence to}} be inconclusive and highlighted {{the need for}} further well-designed large-scale trials. It was noted that insufficient data existed to undertake analysis of outcomes related to activities of daily living (ADLs) and quality of life (QoL) and the inclusion of these outcome measures in future research was recommended. As part of a recently completed trial evaluating the impact of TT after stroke, outcomes were collected to evaluate the impact on ADLs and QoL. Method: A phase II randomised controlled trial was undertaken across four hospitals in Lothian. Participants were randomised to either a control group, who continued to receive ‘usual’ physiotherapy sessions, or an experimental group that received TT as part of ‘usual’ physiotherapy sessions. The intervention period lasted for 8 weeks. The Barthel Index and Stroke Impact Scale were collected at baseline, and at 8 weeks and 6 <b>months</b> post <b>randomisation.</b> Results: Seventy-seven participants were recruited. Thirty-eight were randomised into the control group and thirty-nine into the TT group.

This paper reports the 6 month follow up of mobility outcomes from a phase II feasibility randomised-controlled trial investigating an eight week TT programme with ambulant and non-ambulant people with sub-acute stroke. Method: Sub-acute stroke patients within 3 months of stroke onset were recruited from four stroke rehabilitation units. Randomisation based on side of lesion and initial independence or dependence in walking allocated participants to receive either an eight week programme of ‘‘usual physiotherapy’’ (control) or physiotherapy including TT (experimental). Mobility outcomes taken at baseline and 6 <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation</b> included: the Modified Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI); Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC); Timed Up and Go (TUG); 10 min walk test (10 mwt); and the 6 min walk test (6 mwt). Results: Seventy-seven participants were recruited, 39 were randomised to control, and 38 to experimental. At 6 <b>months</b> post <b>randomisation,</b> while both groups had improved their mobility scores, Mann–Whitney U-tests showed {{no significant differences between}} the groups for RMI (U= 481. 5; p= 0. 421); FAC (U= 488; p= 0. 457); TUG (U= 204; p= 0. 678); 10 mwt (U= 262; p= 0. 956) or 6 mwt (U= 194. 5; p= 0. 892).

We report, for the first time, a detailed comparison of health care resource use and costs over 12 months, {{as part of the}} Arterial Revascularisation (ART) Trial. Methods: 3102 patients in 28 hospitals in 7 countries were randomised to CABG surgery using BIMA (n= 1548) or SIMA (n= 1554). Detailed resource use data were collected covering surgery, the initial hospital episode, and for 12 <b>months</b> post <b>randomisation.</b> Using UK unit costs, total costs were calculated and compared between trial arms and for sub-groups. Results: Patients randomised to BIMA spent 20 minutes longer in theatre (95 % CI 15 to 25, p< 0. 001), and also required more treatment for sternal wound problems. Mean (SD) total costs per patient at 12 months were £ 13, 839 (£ 10, 534) for BIMA and £ 12, 717 (£ 9, 719) for SIMA (mean cost difference £ 1122, 95 % CI £ 407 to £ 1, 838, p= 0. 002). No tests for interaction between subgroups and treatment allocation were significant. Conclusions: At 12 <b>months</b> from <b>randomisation,</b> mean costs were approximately 9 % higher in BIMA than SIMA patients, primarily due to longer time in theatre and inhospital stay, and slightly higher costs related to sternal wound problems during follow-up.

DESIGN [...] Randomised controlled study of n of 1 trials versus standard practice. SETTING [...] Tertiary care center outpatient department. SUBJECTS [...] 31 patients with irreversible chronic airflow limitation who were unsure that theophylline was helpful after an open trial. INTERVENTIONS [...] n Of 1 trials (single patient randomised multiple crossover comparisons of theophylline against placebo) followed published guidelines. For standard practice patients theophylline was stopped and resumed if their dyspnoea worsened; if their dyspnoea then improved theophylline was continued. For both groups a decision to continue or stop the drug was made within three <b>months</b> of <b>randomisation.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Exercise capacity as measured by six minute walking distance, quality of life {{as measured by the}} chronic respiratory disease questionnaire at baseline and six <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation,</b> and proportions of patients taking theophylline at six months.

40|$|Background: Persistent throat {{symptoms}} and Extra Oesophageal Reflux (EOR) {{are among the}} commonest reasons for attendance at a secondary care throat or voice clinic. There is a growing trend to treat throat symptom patients with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to suppress stomach acid, but most controlled studies fail to demonstrate a significant benefit of PPI over placebo. In addition, patient views on PPI use vary widely. Methods/design: A UK multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial for adults with persistent throat symptoms to compare the effectiveness of treatment with the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) lansoprazole versus placebo. The trial includes a six-month internal pilot, during which three sites will recruit 30 participants in total, to assess the practicality of the trial and assess the study procedures and willingness of the patient population to participate. If the pilot is successful, three additional sites will be opened to recruitment, and a further 302 participants recruited across the six main trial sites. Further trial sites may be opened, as necessary. The main trial will continue for a further 18 months. Participants will be followed up for 12 <b>months</b> from <b>randomisation,</b> throughout which both primary and secondary outcome data will be collected. The primary outcome is change in Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score, the ‘area standard’ {{for this type of}} assessment, after 16 weeks (four months) of treatment.

Our study undertook a psychometric validation of the 5 level EQ- 5 D (EQ- 5 D- 5 L) using clinical trial data to measure health-related {{quality of life in}} patients with severe and complex obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline (before <b>randomisation)</b> and six <b>months</b> later in 189 patients in a randomised controlled trial of bariatric surgery. Patients completed two generic health-related quality of life instruments, the EQ- 5 D- 5 L and SF- 12, which were used together for the validation using data from all patients in the trial as the trial is ongoing. Psychometric analyses included construct and criterion validity and responsiveness to change. Of the 189 validation patients, 141 (75 %) were female, the median age was 49 years old (range 23 - 70 years) and body mass index ranged from 33 - 70 kg/m 2.

Overall, 164 individuals with knee OA fulfilling 1986 American College of Rheumatology criteria will be recruited in three tertiary care centres in France and randomised to receive oral resveratrol, 40 [*]mg (two caplets) two times per day for 1 [*]week, then 20 [*]mg (one caplet) two times per day or a matching placebo {{for a total of}} 6 <b>months.</b> <b>Randomisation</b> will be centralised and stratified by centre. The allocation ratio of assignments will be 1 : 1. The primary outcome will be the mean change from baseline in knee pain on a self-administered 11 -point pain Numeric Rating Scale at 3 months. Secondary outcomes will be the mean change in knee pain at 6 months, the function subscore of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index score, patient global assessment, proportion of responders according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International–Outcome Measures in Rheumatology criteria at 3 and 6 months, and self-reported number of intra-articular injections of corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid and consumption of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs since the last contact. Other interventions will be allowed and self-reported. Adherence will be monitored by capsule counts and a booklet and adverse events recorded at 3 and 6 months. Statisticians, treating physicians and participants will be blinded to the allocated treatment. Ethics and dissemination: The oral resveratrol in knee osteoarthritis (ARTHROL) trial has been authorised by the AgenceNationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé and ethics were approved by the Comité deProtection des Personnes Île-de-France III. The findings of the study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated at conferences. The design of ARTHROL will warrant the translation of its findings into clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Background: Effective {{programmes}} to {{help children}} manage their weight are required. ‘Families for Health’ focuses on a parenting approach, designed to help parents develop their parenting skills to support lifestyle change within the family. Families for Health version 1 showed sustained reductions in mean body mass index (BMI) z-score after 2 years in a pilot project. Objective: The aim was to evaluate its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Design: The trial was a multicentre, investigator-blind RCT, with a parallel economic and process evaluation, with follow-up at 3 and 12 <b>months.</b> <b>Randomisation</b> was by family unit, using a 1 [*]:[*] 1 allocation by telephone registration, stratified by three sites, with a target of 120 families. Setting: Three sites in the West Midlands, England, UK. Participants: Children aged 6 – 11 years who were overweight (≥[*] 91 st centile BMI) or obese (≥[*] 98 th centile BMI), and their parents/carers. Recruitment was via referral or self-referral. Interventions: Families for Health version 2 is a 10 -week, family-based community programme with parallel groups for parents and children, addressing parenting, lifestyle, social and emotional development. Usual care was the treatment for childhood obesity provided within each locality. Main outcome measures: Joint primary outcome measures were change in children’s BMI z-score and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained at 12 months’ follow-up (QALYs were calculated using the European Quality of Life- 5 Dimensions Youth version). Secondary outcome measures included changes in children’s waist circumference, percentage body fat, physical activity, fruit/vegetable consumption and quality of life. Parents’ BMI and mental well-being, family eating/activity, parent–child relationships and parenting style were also assessed. The process evaluation documented recruitment, reach, dose delivered, dose received and fidelity, using mixed methods. Results: The study recruited 115 families (128 children; 63 boys and 65 girls), with 56 families randomised to the Families for Health arm and 59 to the ‘usual-care’ control arm. There was 80...|$|R
40|$|Background: Task sharing {{mental health}} care through {{integration}} into primary health care (PHC) is advocated {{as a means of}} narrowing the treatment gap for mental disorders in low-income countries. However, the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and sustainability of this service model for people with a severe mental disorder (SMD) have not been evaluated in a low-income country. Methods/Design: A randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial will be carried out in a predominantly rural area of Ethiopia. A sample of 324 people with SMD (diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) with an ongoing need for {{mental health care}} will be recruited from 1) participants in a population-based cohort study and 2) people attending a psychiatric nurse-led out-patient clinic. The intervention is a task-sharing model of locally delivered mental health care for people with SMD integrated into PHC delivered over 18 months. Participants in the active control arm will receive the established and effective model of specialist mental health care delivered by psychiatric nurses at an out-patient clinic within a centrally located general hospital. The hypothesis is that people with SMD who receive mental health care integrated into PHC will have a non-inferior clinical outcome, defined as a mean symptom score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, expanded version, of no more than six points higher, compared to participants who receive the psychiatric nurse-led service, after 12 months. The primary outcome is change in symptom severity. Secondary outcomes are functional status, relapse, service use costs, service satisfaction, drop-out and medication adherence, nutritional status, physical health care, quality of care, medication side effects, stigma, adverse events and cost-effectiveness. Sustainability and costeffectiveness will be further evaluated at 18 <b>months.</b> <b>Randomisation</b> will be stratified by health centre catchment area using random permuted blocks. The outcome assessors and investigators will be masked to allocation status. Discussion: Evidence about the effectiveness of task sharing mental health care for people with SMD in a rural, low-income African country will inform the World Health Organisation’s mental health Gap Action Programme to scale-up mental health care globally...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that nurse led follow-up programmes are effective and cost effective in improving quality of life after discharge from intensive care. Design A pragmatic, non-blinded, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. Setting Three UK hospitals (two teaching hospitals and one district general hospital).

40|$|Introduction. Elevated plasma matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) {{levels have}} been {{suggested}} to precede the development of microalbuminuria. As angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors effectively reduce urinary albumin excretion (UAE), {{in the present study}} we have investigated the potential association of plasma MMP- 9 levels with UAE and treatment effects of ACE-inhibition. Material and methods. In a placebo-controlled randomised trial we determined plasma MMP- 9 levels at baseline and after three <b>months</b> of <b>randomisation</b> to either placebo (n= 202) or fosinopril (20 mg/day, n= 204) treatment. Results. Baseline plasma MMP- 9 levels were not related to baseline UAE (r=- 0. 008, p= 0. 871). Three months of fosinopril treatment effectively reduced UAE compared to placebo treatment (- 10. 4 +/- 2. 4 vs. 1. 8 +/- 1. 3 mg/ 24 hours, p Conclusion. The effective reduction of UAE with fosinopril was not related to plasma MMP- 9 levels...|$|R
40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} is a sleep-related {{breathing}} disorder that {{is caused by}} a collapse of the upper airway due to insufficient muscular tone of the tongue and/or airway dilator muscles. Current standard therapy is the CPAP therapy, which is limited in its effectiveness due to poor compliance. A new functional therapy approach is the stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve (HNS) by an implantable device to restore the tone of the upper airway dilator muscles. A systematic literature review yielded 2 RCTs and 7 single arm studies. One RCT showed a worsening of symptoms one week after withdrawal of the therapy, but only in a selected population of respondents to prior therapy. A second RCT did not show any significant differences between study groups 6 <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation</b> to HNS vs. sham stimulation.

40|$|Background: Psychological therapies are {{first-line}} {{interventions for}} depression, but existing provision is not accessible for many adults with intellectual disabilities. We investigated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a behavioural activation intervention (BeatIt) {{for people with}} intellectual disabilities and depression. BeatIt was compared with a guided self-help intervention (StepUp). Methods: We did a multicentre, single-blind, randomised, controlled trial with follow-up at 4 months and 12 <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation.</b> Participants aged 18 years or older, with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and clinically significant depression were recruited from health and social care services in the UK. The primary outcome was the Glasgow Depression Scale for people with a Learning Disability (GDS-LD) score at 12 months. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ISCRTN, number ISRCTN 09753005. Findings: Between Aug 8, 2013, and Sept 1, 2015, 161 participants were randomly assigned (84 to BeatIt; 77 to StepUp); 141 (88...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Demographic and {{clinical}} variables {{were examined in}} a post hoc analysis of the PROlonged Migraine Prevention with Topiramate (PROMPT) study to determine potential contribution to relapse. METHODS: After a six-month open-label (OL) topiramate phase, patients were randomised to continue topiramate or switch to placebo in a six-month double-blind (DB) phase. 'Relapse' was investigated in terms of change in monthly migraine days after randomisation compared with the <b>month</b> before <b>randomisation,</b> and was analysed during the first ('initial relapse') and last month ('sustained relapse') of the DB phase. More than 40 potential predicting factors were entered into analyses of variance and covariance. RESULTS: For initial relapse, variable-by-treatment interactions were significant for the Headache Impact Test (HIT- 6) at DB baseline, and decline in acute medication intake or reporting of 'anxiety' in the OL phase. For sustained relapse, no statistically significant interactions were observed. CONCLUSION: Relapse after topiramate discontinuation in migraine prophylaxis appears to be unaffected by patient characteristics or baseline migraine frequency. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many {{people with}} {{intellectual}} disabilities {{find it hard}} to control their anger and this often leads to aggression which can have serious consequences, such as exclusion from mainstream services and the need for potentially more expensive emergency placements. Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention for anger management in people with intellectual disabilities. Method: A cluster-randomised trial of group-based 12 -week CBT, which took place in day services for people with intellectual disabilities and was delivered by care staff using a treatment manual. Participants were 179 service users identified as having problems with anger control randomly assigned to either anger management or treatment as usual. Assessments were conducted before the intervention, and at 16 weeks and 10 <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation</b> (trial registration: ISRCTN 37509773).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use {{of liquid}} medium (MGIT 960) for {{tuberculosis}} (TB) diagnosis was recommended by WHO in 2007. However, {{there has been}} no evaluation of its effectiveness on clinically important outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A pragmatic trial was carried out in a tertiary hospital and a secondary health care unit in Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. Participants were 16 years or older, suspected of having TB. They were excluded if only cerebral spinal fluid or blood specimens were available for analysis. MGIT 960 technique was compared with the Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) method for laboratory diagnosis of active TB. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had their initial medical management changed within 2 <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation.</b> Secondary outcomes were: mean time for changing the procedure, patient satisfaction with the overall treatment and adverse events.

40|$|Background - Exercise {{programmes}} {{that can}} demonstrate evidence of long-lasting clinical effectiveness {{are needed for}} people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Objective - The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of a practically implemented exercise programme on self-directed exercise behaviour and important health outcomes in PwMS to nine months of follow-up. Methods - We conducted a parallel-arm, randomised controlled trial: 120 PwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 1. 0 - 6. 5) randomised to a three-month exercise intervention plus usual care, or usual care only. Two supervised plus one home-exercise session (weeks 1 - 6) were followed by one supervised and two home-exercise sessions (weeks 7 - 12). Cognitive-behavioural techniques promoted long-term exercise behaviour change. Outcomes were blindly assessed at baseline and at three and nine <b>months</b> after <b>randomisation.</b> The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of offering antenatal screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia in primary care as a way of facilitating earlier uptake of screening. Design: Partial factorial cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: 25 UK general practices from deprived inner city areas. Participants: Anonymised data on all pregnant women attending participating practices during a six <b>month</b> period before <b>randomisation</b> and a seven <b>month</b> period after <b>randomisation.</b> This included 1708 eligible women. Intervention: Practices were randomised to three groups for seven months: parallel testing in general practice (tests for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia offered to both parents when pregnancy was first reported); sequential testing in general practice (tests offered to mothers when pregnancy was first reported, and subsequently to the partners of women who were found to be carriers); and midwife care (tests offered to mothers at first consultation with a midwife). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome (available for all women) was the proportion of eligible women screened before 10 weeks’ (70 days’) gestation. Secondary outcomes were an offer of screening to women before 10 weeks’ gestation, gestational age at testing, mean interval from first visit to the general practice visit to screening, and women’s knowledge of the carrier status of their baby’s father before 77 days’ (11 weeks’) gestation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{devised a}} {{randomised}} controlled trial {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and efficiency of an intervention based on case management care for frequent emergency department users. The aim of the intervention is to reduce such patients' emergency department use, to improve their quality of life, and to reduce costs consequent on frequent use. The intervention consists of a combination of comprehensive case management care and standard emergency care. It uses a clinical case management model that is patient-identified, patient-directed, and developed to provide high intensity services. It provides a continuum of hospital- and community-based patient services, which include clinical assessment, outreach referral, and coordination and communication with other service providers. METHODS/DESIGN: We aim to recruit, {{during the first year of}} the study, 250 patients who visit the emergency department of the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland. Eligible patients will have visited the emergency department 5 or more times during the previous 12 <b>months.</b> <b>Randomisation</b> of the participants to the intervention or control groups will be computer generated and concealed. The statistician and each patient will be blinded to the patient's allocation. Participants in the intervention group (N[*]=[*] 125), additionally to standard emergency care, will receive case management from a team, 1 (ambulatory care) to 3 (hospitalization) times during their stay and after 1, 3, and 5 months, at their residence, in the hospital or in the ambulatory care setting. In between the consultations provided, the patients will have the opportunity to contact, at any moment, the case management team. Participants in the control group (N[*]=[*] 125) will receive standard emergency care only.
