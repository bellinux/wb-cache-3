Both private and government-controlled industries met the needs of a growing Chinese population in the Song. Artisans and merchants formed guilds that the state had to deal with when assessing taxes, requisitioning goods, and setting standard workers' wages and prices on goods.|$|E

It consists of six episodes. Spooks follows the actions of Section D, a counter-terrorism division of the British Security Services (MI5). Among the storylines, main character Tom Quinn faces dilemmas living a double life with his girlfriend, who at first does not know he is really a spy, and Tessa Phillips is running phantom agents for <b>monetary</b> <b>gain.</b> Matthew Macfadyen, Keeley Hawes, David Oyelowo, Peter Firth, Jenny Agutter, Lisa Faulkner, Esther Hall, Heather Cave, Hugh Simon and Greame Mearns are listed as the main cast.|$|E

Following completion of this task, they completed two personality questionnaires - Barratte 2 ̆ 7 s Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS).

These illnesses are feigned not for <b>monetary</b> <b>gain</b> or to avoid inconvenient situations, but to attract compassion or to control others. Chronic manifestation of factitious disorder is often called Munchausen syndrome, after a book about the exaggerated accounts of the adventures of Baron Munchausen, a German cavalry officer in the Russian Army, that was written by Rudolf Erich Raspe. When the symptoms of another person, such as a child or an elderly parent, are purposely induced by the caregiver, it is called factitious disorder by proxy, or Munchausen syndrome by proxy.|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} covered {{extensively}} by the country's newspapers. In The Straits Times of Singapore, lawyers who were interviewed said anime fans {{would not have}} a strong defence against Odex if proof of uploading or downloading of unauthorised videos was presented. In his analysis, Thomas Koshy—a legal academic writing in Today—questioned the legality of Odex's threatening criminal prosecution of downloaders. Koshy maintained that only the Attorney-General had the power to prosecute {{and that there was no}} indication that he had authorised Odex to conduct prosecutions on his behalf. Moreover, Koshy opined that it was improper for Odex to have combined its demand for compensation with a threat of criminal prosecution; although Odex's letters alleged [...] "illegal downloading activity", the company threatened punishment associated with the more serious offence of distributing materials which infringed copyrights. Koshy noted that Odex had cited a legal provision intended to regulate people's file sharing for <b>monetary</b> <b>gain</b> rather than downloading by a casual consumer. Burton Ong, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, suggested that an anime fan who downloaded a few episodes may have been able to rely on [...] "fair dealing" [...] as a defence against the charge of copyright infringement. One of the criteria for pursuing this line of defence would have been proving that the download subsequently boosted, rather than undermined, the commercial viability of the anime industry.|$|E
500|$|However, {{at other}} times, Kyle is an {{enthusiastic}} participant in Cartman's schemes and Cartman is sometimes seen actually being nice to Kyle in some instances; {{although this is}} generally to put aside their hatred momentarily for a common goal, or for manipulation.

Kyle {{has a tendency to}} make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, and often loses these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman's motivation in this regard is not merely <b>monetary</b> <b>gain,</b> but an obsession with scoring a victory over Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part episode [...] "" [...] (season 11, 2007). This obsession has also proven itself to actually trump other goals Cartman wishes to achieve, for instance, in [...] "Christian Rock Hard" [...] Cartman makes a bet with Kyle that he can make a platinum album before Kyle can. After recruiting Butters and Token, Cartman creates a Christian rock band called [...] "Faith+1" [...] and [...] "writes" [...] Christian songs by merely taking love songs and replacing words such as [...] "baby" [...] with [...] "Jesus" [...] (which humorously implicates sexual relations with Jesus). Against all odds, the band becomes largely successful, managing to sell over a million copies (and potentially gain millions of dollars). However, since Christian rock bands cannot truly get a platinum album (which is not true in real life), Cartman loses the bet. Despite having amassed a large fan base as well as a large, steady income, Cartman only becomes enraged since he was unable to win a bet with Kyle. Careless in his anger accepting the [...] "Myrrh" [...] album in front of a large Christian crowd, Cartman goes into an Anti-Christian rant which drives away all of the fans as well as profits. Cartman has also been shown to have a high sadistic streak when concerning Kyle. He has repeatedly expressed desire in seeing him suffer.|$|E

40|$|Controversial {{results have}} been {{reported}} concerning the neural mechanisms involved in the processing of rewards and punishments. On the one hand, there is evidence suggesting that <b>monetary</b> <b>gains</b> and losses activate a similar fronto-subcortical network. On the other hand, results of recent studies imply that reward and punishment may engage distinct neural mechanisms. Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) we investigated both regional and interregional functional connectivity patterns while participants performed a gambling task featuring unexpectedly high <b>monetary</b> <b>gains</b> and losses. Classical univariate statistical analysis showed that <b>monetary</b> <b>gains</b> and losses activated a similar fronto-striatallimbic network, in which main activation peaks were observed bilaterally in the ventral striatum. Functional connectivity analysis showed similar responses for gain and loss conditions in the insular cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus that correlated with the activity observed in the seed region ventral striatum, with the connectivity to the amygdala appearing more pronounced after losses. Larger functional connectivity was found to the medial orbitofrontal cortex for negative outcomes. The fact that different functional patterns were obtained with both analyses suggests that the brain activations observed in the classical univariate approach identiﬁ es the involvement of different functional networks in the current task. These results stress the importance of studying functional connectivity in addition to standard fMRI analysis in reward-related studies...|$|R
