During most of his section of the song, Kelly sings of shining, drinking and two-stepping in a club, and he promises to kiss any place on Mariah's body she wants: [...] "Girl, if you let me, I'm gonna touch it / But if I touch it, I'm gonna wanna hit it." [...] Later, he mimics Carey's bridge: [...] "If some honies up in here that want me to touch her body / Touch it / Let <b>me</b> <b>hear</b> you say, 'I-i-i-i do.'" [...] According to Kelly, the remix is unofficial, and his lyrics are freestyle rap.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has gained}} {{attention}} {{due to its}} explicit lyrics. The song begins with the lyrics [...] "I got a body full of liquor and a cocaine kicker", during the song [...] "a slew of f-bombs" [...] can be heard, and varied graphic descriptions such as: [...] "You got your legs {{up in the sky}} with the devil in your eyes / Let <b>me</b> <b>hear</b> you say you want it all" [...] and the chorus [...] "You and me, baby, making love like gorillas!". Overall, the lyrics portray the subject of having a [...] "romantic evening" [...] of making love like wild animals (gorillas), despite being high from cocaine and drunk from liquor. On September 11, 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that Dannielle Miller, co-founder of Enlighten Education, decided to appeal to mainstream radio in order to ban [...] "Gorilla", due to its sexual and violent lyrics towards women.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, who directed Beyoncé's videos, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy". The video is inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon and has a Studio 54 style. Paired with Usher, Beyoncé dances seductively and flirts with him to portray a naughty girl. She {{felt that they were}} a [...] "perfect match" [...] for the dancing scenes in the video. According to Usher, the video is a homage to classic [...] "ultimate entertainers"; including dancers, singers and actors. He further talked about the collaboration on the video, saying, [...] "Beyoncé and me have been talking about doing a record together. She reached out to me and said she had an idea and really wanted me to be the lead in her video... I was like, 'Well let <b>me</b> <b>hear</b> the idea.' It sounded like something totally different than what had been on TV." ...|$|E

500|$|Montana told MTV News {{about working}} with Cyrus, [...] "I was in L.A. and she {{happened}} {{to be doing the}} 'Ain't Worried About Nothin'' remix for me. She came by the studio and let <b>me</b> <b>hear</b> her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We just went in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E
500|$|The Shadow of the Glen, {{based on}} a story about an unfaithful wife, was {{attacked}} in print by the Irish nationalist leader Arthur Griffith as [...] "a slur on Irish womanhood". Years later Synge wrote: [...] "When I was writing The Shadow of the Glen some years ago I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a chink in {{the floor of the}} old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let <b>me</b> <b>hear</b> what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen." [...] This encouraged more critical attacks alleging that Synge described Irish women in an unfair manner. Riders to the Sea was also attacked by nationalists, this time including Patrick Pearse, who decried it because of the author's attitude to God and religion. Pearse, Arthur Griffith and other conservative-minded Catholics claimed Synge had done a disservice to Irish nationalism by not idealising his characters. However, later critics have attacked Synge for idealising the Irish peasantry too much. A third one-act play, The Tinker's Wedding, was drafted around this time, but Synge initially made no attempt to have it performed, largely because of a scene in which a priest is tied up in a sack, which, as he wrote to the publisher Elkin Mathews in 1905, would probably upset [...] "a good many of our Dublin friends".|$|E

This gave {{him the opportunity to}} attend and review numerous first nights at the London theatres. One review angered actor-playwright Wilson Barrett and he demanded a meeting with Caine.

Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken.
