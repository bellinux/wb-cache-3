Most of this work tries to understand the refugee crisis which followed from the perspective of "topdown" governmental and institutional factors such as interstate relations, state fragility, and regional insecurity. The key innovation of this paper is that it explores "bottomup" factors. The focus of this paper is on the perceptions, interests, and perceived predicaments of displaced Iraqis themselves as contrasted with the perceptions of them by international players locally based in the Middle East region. As such the paper focuses on factors such as: livelihood strategies, economic engagement, protection rights, and alternatives to refugee/forced <b>migration</b> <b>statuses.</b> By reorienting analysis to local people-based perceptions the paper provides new ways of understanding not only the conditions of protracted displacement but also a broader scope for durable solutions...|$|R

We examine the effects of rural labor out-migration on local communities by analyzing the differences between household groups with different labor <b>migration</b> <b>statuses</b> regarding participation in general and environment-related community activities. The results suggest that rural migration presents both detrimental and beneficial potentials for community interaction in rural origin areas.

Given that migration is often viewed {{as a way for}} individuals to locate prospective returns fitting for their qualifications, analysis of migration behavior offers an opportunity to examine the impact of status inconsistency. Key findings indicate that under-rewarded individuals, specifically relatively highly educated individuals in low status and low paying occupations, are more likely to migrate than are status consistent individuals. Over-rewarded individuals are less likely to migrate. These findings vary across metropolitan and nonmetropolitan places: individuals in nonmetropolitan areas who are under-rewarded or have mixed statuses have higher odds of <b>migration</b> than <b>status</b> consistent respondents. Individuals in metropolitan areas with inconsistent statuses are not more likely to migrate than status consistent respondents once other determinants of migration are entered in the analysis.

The negative effects of isolation and remoteness on migrants' physical and mental health, as well as their legal outcomes, have been well documented. We argue, however, that detainees and others are countering the effects of isolation with the use of technology. Ethnographic research conducted on the islands within Australian and Indonesian migrant detention networks suggests that asylum seekers detained in remote sites across the region are combating the isolation of detention with the use of mobile phones, internet access, and social media networks. They communicate with friends, relatives, legal representatives, advocates, activists, and members of the public beyond prison walls to transmit information, facilitate advocacy inside and outside of detention facilities, and construct transnational support networks.

40|$|The {{question}} asked by this thesis is when and why, {{as a matter}} of principle, should there be judicial scrutiny on the merits of administrative decisions on <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> (âmigration status decisionsâ) in the United Kingdom? It argues that this is a moral question, engaging concerns of fair treatment. The first two chapters examine the question theoretically. It is argued that access to justice is not a gift of citizenship and that <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> decision-making should be reviewable on the merits to avoid the appearance and/or occurrence of injustice {{in the light of the}} effects of migration control on individual migrants and the nature of <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> decision-making as âvery imperfect procedural justiceâ (save where a decision is not based on the judgment discretion of an administrator). The latter five chapters apply the normative claims to the United Kingdom constitutional context, including the relevant European regimes (European Convention on Fundamental Rights and European Union). First, as background to the argument, a history of recourse from <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> decision-making in the UK from the initial establishment of a review system in 1905 is sketched out. The history demonstrates the absence of a coherent or principled account of <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> appeals. The history is followed by a three-part critique of the current system of recourse in the UK. First rights of appeal in three case studies (deportation, offshore visitors and students) are examined. Secondly, the three standards of review available under judicial review (rationality, anxious scrutiny and proportionality) are critiqued, and thirdly, the contribution of European and international norms is considered. In general terms the thesis concludes that the current UK system of recourse is deficient in certain respects and suggests reform to the current appeals system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Undocumented {{immigrants}} {{are likely to}} be missing from population databases, making it impossible to identify an accurate sampling frame in migration research. No population-based data has been collected in Chile regarding the living conditions and health status of undocumented immigrants. However, the CASEN survey (Caracterizacion Socio- Economica Nacional) asked about <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> in Chile {{for the first time in}} 2006 and provides an opportunity to set the base for future analysis of available migration data. We explored the living conditions and health of self-reported immigrants and respondents who preferred not to report their <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> in this survey. Methods Cross-sectional secondary analysis of CASEN survey in Chile in 2006. O utcomes : any disability, illness/accident, hospitalization/surgery, cancer/chronic condition (all binary variables); and the number of medical/emergency attentions received (count variables). Covariates : Demographics (age, sex, marital status, urban/rural, ethnicity), socioeconomic status (education level, employment status and household income), and material standard of living (overcrowding, sanitation, housing quality). Weighted regression models were estimated for each health outcome, crude and adjusted by sets of covariates, in STATA 10. 0. Results About 1 % of the total sample reported being immigrants and 0. 7 % preferred not to report their <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> (<b>Migration</b> <b>Status</b> - Missing Values; MS-MV). The MS-MV lived in more deprived conditions and reported a higher rate of health problems than immigrants. Some gender differences were observed by health status among immigrants and the MS-MV but they were not statistically significant. Regressions indicated that age, sex, SES and material factors consistently affected MS-MVs’ chance of presenting poor health and these patterns were different to those found among immigrants. Great heterogeneity in both the MS-MV and the immigrants, as indicated by wide confidence intervals, prevented the identification of other significantly associated covariates. Conclusion This is the first study to look at the living conditions and health of those that preferred not to respond their <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> in Chile. Respondents that do not report their <b>migration</b> <b>status</b> are vulnerable to poor health and may represent undocumented immigrants. Surveys that fail to identify these people are likely to misrepresent the experiences of immigrants and further quantitative and qualitative research is urgently required. </p...|$|E
