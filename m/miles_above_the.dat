The expedition comprised at least 150 men (including expert riflemen and American militia) and carried supplies for at least five new trading posts. The group built the new posts along the Missouri River in the fall of 1809. The expedition traveled as far as Fort Lisa on the Yellowstone River {{at the mouth of the}} Bighorn, where they wintered over.

25|$|Through {{repeated}} computerized test {{simulations of}} trajectories through the Neptunian system conducted in advance, flight controllers determined {{the best way}} to route Voyager 2 through the Neptune-Triton system. Since the plane of the orbit of Triton is tilted significantly with respect to the plane of the ecliptic, through mid-course corrections, Voyager 2 was directed into a path about three thousand <b>miles</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> north pole of Neptune. At that time, Triton was behind and below (south of) Neptune (at an angle of about 25 degrees below the ecliptic), close to the apoapsis of its elliptical orbit. The gravitational pull of Neptune bent the trajectory of Voyager 2 down in the direction of Triton. In less than 24 hours, Voyager 2 traversed the distance between Neptune and Triton, and then observed Triton's northern hemisphere as it passed over its north pole.|$|E
25|$|In 1700 {{several hundred}} French Huguenots {{migrated}} from England to the colony of Virginia, where the English Crown had promised them land grants in Lower Norfolk County. When they arrived, colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 <b>miles</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> falls of the James River, at the abandoned Monacan village known as Manakin Town, now in Powhatan County. Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County. On 12 May 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 {{settlers in the}} isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas. Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbours. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honour, as were many local features, including several schools, including Huguenot High School.|$|E
25|$|Space shuttle Discovery {{successfully}} docked {{with the}} space station at 07:44 UTC (03:44 EDT) on 7 April 2010 as the two spacecraft sailed 220 <b>miles</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean. The crew performed six successful engine firings {{to set up the}} on-time docking. Prior to docking commander Poindexter guided Discovery through the standard Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver (RPM). Station commander Oleg Kotov and flight engineer T.J. Creamer took more than 350 photos of Discoverys heat shield. Once Discovery docked to the International Space Station (ISS), a series of leak checks were done {{on both sides of the}} hatch by the shuttle and station crews. The hatches between the two vehicles were opened at 09:11 UTC (05:11 EDT), which was 30 minutes earlier than planned. Once the hatches were opened the STS-131 crew got a safety briefing from the station crew, then began to transfer items that would be needed for later in the day and early on flight day 4. Two items that were transferred were the two EMUs that will be used for the three spacewalks. The crew also completed a grapple of the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) with the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) also known as Canadarm2. Once the OBSS was grappled it was unberthed from the starboard sill of the space shuttle payload bay, and handed off to the SRMS. Throughout the day, after docking to the station, the shuttle crew began downlinking all of the inspection video from flight day 2, and launch imagery and video.|$|E

NASA participated in the marketing of the film despite its lack of involvement with previous films. Though it turned down a request for Interstellar to be screened on the ISS, The Martian was screened on board 402km (250 <b>miles)</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Earth's surface on September 19, 2015, and also at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral on October 1, 2015.|$|E

Her vocals are as strong as ever and even when the vocal effects are laid on thick her voice doesn’t get drowned in them. You can still hear her clearly." [...] Overall, the reviewer felt it was a great debut track for the North American audience. Asian Junkie member Random J reviewed the song on his personal blog site, and his response was mixed. He felt the song was [...] "boring" [...] and [...] "bog standard" [...] upon its release. However, he stated, [...] "But in comparison {{to the rest of the}} album, the song is actually rather decent and a highlight. A definite grower." ...|$|E

[...] However, a more formidable version was built in stages on the orders of López I. [...] He started the work hurriedly in 1854 during conflict with Brazil over boundaries and navigation, when Paraguay was threatened by a Brazilian flotilla; [...] fortunately for López, the Brazilians were delayed by the low state of the river. [...] The Paraguayan author and diplomat Gregorio Benítes − {{who was in the}} Paraguayan army at the time − gives a different explanation. [...] López I, hearing the Brazilian squadron was on its way, immediately transferred 6,000 troops from Paso de Patria to Humaitá; working night and day, in 15 days they fortified that place, including furnaces for making red hot cannonballs. [...] The Brazilian squadron desisted because of the strength of the fortifications; the low state of the water is mentioned only incidentally. [...] Thomas Jefferson Page USN wrote an independent account that tends to confirm Benites' version.|$|E

With the fate of the album in jeopardy, Stone Sour recruited Mayorga, ex-Soulfly, as a session drummer. Mayorga recorded drums for all but two tracks on the album, Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin performed on the track [...] "30/30-150" [...] and guitarist Root performed drums on the bonus track [...] "The Day I Let Go".

500|$|Between 1850 and 1854 the U. S. Army {{explored}} the lower {{reach of the}} Colorado River from the Gulf of California, looking for the river to provide a less expensive route to supply the remote post of Fort Yuma. [...] First in November 1850 to January 1851, by its transport schooner, Invincible under Captain Alfred H. Wilcox and then by its longboat commanded by Lieutenant George Derby. [...] Later Lieutenant Derby, in his expedition report, recommended that a shallow draft sternwheel steamboat would {{be the way to}} send supplies up river to the fort. [...] The next contractors George Alonzo Johnson with his partner Benjamin M. Hartshorne, brought two barges and 250 tons of supplies arriving at the river's mouth in February 1852, on the United States transport schooner Sierra Nevada under Captain Wilcox. [...] Poling the barges up the Colorado, the first barge sank with its cargo a total loss. [...] The second was finally, after a long struggle poled up to Fort Yuma, but what little it carried was soon consumed by the garrison. [...] Subsequently, wagons again were sent from the fort to haul the balance of the supplies overland from the estuary through the marshes and woodlands of the Delta. [...] At last Derby's recommendation was heeded and in November 1852, the Uncle Sam, a 65-foot long side-wheel paddle steamer, built by Domingo Marcucci, became the first steamboat on the Colorado River. [...] It was brought by the schooner Capacity from San Francisco to the delta by the next contractor to supply the fort, Captain James Turnbull. [...] It was assembled and launched in the estuary, 30 <b>miles</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Colorado River. [...] Equipped with only a 20-horsepower engine, the Uncle Sam could only carry 35 tons of supplies, taking 15 days to make the first 120-mile trip. [...] It made many trips up and down the river, taking four months to finish carrying the supplies for the fort, improving its time up river to 12 days. Negligence caused it to sink at its dock below Fort Yuma, and was then washed away before it could be raised, in the spring flood of 1853. [...] Turnbull in financial difficulty, disappeared. [...] Nevertheless, he had shown the worth of steamboats to solve Fort Yuma's ls supply problem.|$|E
