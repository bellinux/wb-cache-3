5|$|The novel {{began as}} Clarke's, but when ill health and a {{psychological}} (or possibly neurological) form of writer's block {{prevented him from}} <b>making</b> <b>progress,</b> he handed over his notes and the incomplete manuscript to Pohl, who, in close consultation with Clarke, completed the novel. Clarke reviewed the final manuscript in early March 2008, just days before he died.|$|E
5|$|To {{help him}} out, Bart gets Buck {{a job on}} Krusty the Clown's show, but Buck gets drunk and makes a fool of himself on air, {{crushing}} Bart. Seeing this, Marge and Homer decide to help Buck overcome his alcoholism, so they clean out Buck's house and enroll him in an Alcoholics Anonymous program. Despite <b>making</b> <b>progress,</b> Buck is not restored to hero-status for Bart.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2005 season, an NCAA {{investigation}} found that eleven ineligible players had played for the Yellow Jackets between the 1998 and 2005 seasons. These players played while not <b>making</b> <b>progress</b> towards graduation on the NCAA-approved schedule. The football victories for that season were initially revoked, and Georgia Tech was put on two years of NCAA probation. Twelve football scholarships were stricken from Georgia Tech's allotment for the 2006 and 2007 freshman classes. The Georgia Tech Athletic Department appealed this decision by the NCAA, and the records were restored but scholarship reductions and probation remained. Athletic Director Dave Braine retired in January 2006, and Dan Radakovich was hired as Athletic Director.|$|E

5|$|Shiren the Wanderer was {{developed}} by Chunsoft for the Super Famicom, with the core concept of repeated play, with the player improving their equipment and items each time they play, <b>making</b> <b>progress</b> through several playthroughs. The developers noted that Shiren the Wanderer differed from other Mystery Dungeon titles in that the Chunsoft staff create characters themselves, allowing them to express the Mystery Dungeon series more fully than with the other titles, which are set in already created worlds which Chunsoft cannot change. The game {{was developed}} in parallel with the Game Boy game Shiren the Wanderer GB, which used modified source code from the Super Famicom game.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the odds}} against him, the Batavian captain engaged Stag, Yorke laying his ship {{alongside}} Alliantie and the frigates exchanging broadsides for {{an hour before the}} Batavian captain, his situation hopeless and his ship outnumbered and battered, surrendered at 17:15. While Stag and Alliantie fought their duel, the action continued elsewhere, with the remaining Batavian ships <b>making</b> <b>progress</b> eastwards along the Norwegian coastline with the British squadron attempting to cut them off from the channel between Eigerøya and the Norwegian mainland in which the Batavian ships could shelter, protected by Danish neutrality. Vlugheid rapidly outdistanced pursuit, but Argo was slower and came under heavy but distant fire from Reunion and Isis, replying in kind. Argo was subsequently found to have been hit thirty times by 24-pounder shot and had much of its sails and rigging torn away, requiring extensive repairs. Eventually the Batavian persistence paid off, and Vlugheid and Argo successfully escaped into the neutral harbour of Eigerøya before Alms could intercept them.|$|E
5|$|Parallel with {{improvements}} in sound-on-film technology, {{a number of}} companies were <b>making</b> <b>progress</b> with systems that recorded movie sound on phonograph discs. In sound-on-disc technology from the era, a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical interlock to a specially modified film projector, allowing for synchronization. In 1921, the Photokinema sound-on-disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to D. W. Griffith's failed silent film Dream Street. A love song, performed by star Ralph Graves, was recorded, as was a sequence of live vocal effects. Apparently, dialogue scenes were also recorded, but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them. On May 1, 1921, Dream Street was re-released, with love song added, at New York City's Town Hall theater, qualifying it—however haphazardly—as the first feature-length film with a live-recorded vocal sequence. There would be no others for more than six years.|$|E

5|$|The strike {{lasted until}} August 10, 1974 when the players {{returned}} to training camp without a new CBA, instead choosing to pursue free agency through the Mackey lawsuit filed three years before. While the courts {{ruled in favor}} of the players in 1976, the union found that <b>making</b> <b>progress</b> in bargaining was more difficult to achieve. The Rozelle Rule was invalidated by the court which found it constituted a refusal to deal and was therefore in violation of the Sherman Act as it deterred franchises from signing free agents. However, the change did not achieve true free agency as compensation remained tied to draft picks that were awarded based on the salary of the departing free agent and teams still maintained a right of first refusal. The NFL and NFLPA agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in March 1977 that ran until 1982.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time <b>making</b> <b>progress</b> on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E
