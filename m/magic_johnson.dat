5|$|In the 1980s, Cosby also {{appeared}} in public service announcements. To increase black participation in the 1990 United States Census, the bureau recruited Cosby, <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Alfre Woodard, and Miss America Debbye Turner as spokespeople.|$|E
5|$|Paul has won {{the most}} steal titles, with six. Micheal Ray Richardson, Robertson, Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson all follow with three. <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Mookie Blaylock, Baron Davis and John Stockton are the only other players to win more than one steal title, with two.

5|$|The rivalry {{had been}} less intense since the retirements of <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals {{for the first time}} since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in 7 games. Since 1960, the Lakers are 4-2 against their fiercest rival in the Finals.|$|E
5|$|According to Johnson {{this was}} his {{favorite}} play of all-time. Games 6 and 7 also featured a feud, this time between Pistons forward Dennis Rodman and Johnson. In Game 6, which the Pistons won, Rodman taunted Johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head. When the Celtics took Game 7, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments {{of the game and}} mimicked his taunting gesture. In the 1987 NBA Finals, however, the Celtics succumbed to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2 as Lakers playmaker and Finals MVP <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> put up a great performance, averaging 26 points and 13 assists throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|Before Ryan White, AIDS was {{a disease}} stigmatized as an illness {{impacting}} the gay community, {{because it was}} first diagnosed among gay men. That perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent HIV-infected people such as <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Arthur Ashe and the Ray brothers appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his rise}} to fame, Jason McElwain {{wrote a book}} titled The Game of My Life. The book is written mainly by Jason, but {{includes}} sections written by his family, coach, and teammates. The Game of My Life is 243 pages long and was published on February 5, 2008 by New American Library. Editorial reviews were left by celebrities such as <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Doug Flutie, Rodney Peete, Holly Robinson Peete, and Tony Dungy. The book was co-written by Daniel Paisner.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Tony Parker co-directed with Jean-Marie Antonini a 1-hour film, 9 – Un chiffre, un homme (meaning 9, a number, a man). The biographical {{documentary}} film narrated by Benoît Allemane {{was produced by}} Parker. Celebrities featured included basketball players Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Sean Elliott, <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Michael Jordan, Steve Nash, and David Robinson, as well as footballers Thierry Henry and Zinédine Zidane, judo player David Douillet, and musician and DJ Cut Killer, as well as Parker and Eva Longoria.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{and current}} and former NBA players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bill Russell, as well as Maya Moore from the WNBA, played a {{basketball}} game with President Barack Obama as an exhibition {{for a group of}} military troops who had been injured in action. The game was played at a gym inside Fort McNair, and reporters covering the President were not allowed to enter. The basketball game was part of festivities organized to celebrate Obama's 49th birthday.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, Nash {{was named}} to his eighth All-Star Game. At the time, he was leading the NBA in assists per game. On 21 April 2012, Nash passed Oscar Robertson for career assists versus the Denver Nuggets. Despite his stellar play the Suns missed {{the playoffs for the}} second {{consecutive}} time. He finished the season averaging 12.5 points and 10.7 assists per game on 53.2% shooting from the field (tying his career high). Near the end of the 2011–12 season, Nash was named the winner of the PBWA's <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> Award.|$|E
5|$|Jordan had {{completely}} recovered {{in time for}} the 1986–87 season, and he had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only two players to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting. In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season. Despite Jordan's success, <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> won the league's Most Valuable Player Award. The Bulls reached 40 wins, and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year. However, they were again swept by the Celtics.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 2013, Ginóbili re-signed {{with the}} Spurs on a two-year deal. In 2013–14, the Spurs had a league-best 62–20 record. Ginóbili {{finished}} third in the voting for Sixth Man of the Year. In Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the Thunder, Duncan-Ginóbili-Parker won their 110th career game in the playoffs, matching <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Cooper from the Los Angeles Lakers. The Spurs reached the NBA Finals again, where they faced the Heat {{for the second year in}} a row. This time, they dominated the series, winning 4–1 to claim that franchise's fifth championship; Ginóbili won his fourth championship as a Spur.|$|E
5|$|On February 21, 2017, media sources {{reported}} that the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) were set to hire Pelinka to serve as general manager {{as part of a}} management shakeup that included the hiring of <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> as executive vice president of basketball operations in place of Jim Buss and dismissing former GM Mitch Kupchak. On March 7, 2017, Pelinka was officially named the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers, signing a five-year deal with the team.|$|E
5|$|On May 2014, Tony Parker {{alongside}} Manu Ginóbili and Tim Duncan {{tied the}} record for most wins in Playoffs History by a trio of players playing together; record held by LA Lakers trio of <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Cooper at 110 wins. The Spurs went on to beat the Thunder in six games and advance to the NBA Finals {{for the second straight}} year. San Antonio would once again face the Miami Heat and would win the 2014 NBA Finals in five games. This victory gave Parker his fourth championship and the fifth championship to the Spurs.|$|E
5|$|Ryan White {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of highly visible people with AIDS in the 1980s and early 1990s who helped change the public {{perception}} of the disease. Ryan, along with actor Rock Hudson, was one of the earliest public faces of AIDS. Along with later public figures who became associated with HIV/AIDS, such as the Ray brothers, <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Arthur Ashe, The Brady Bunch's Robert Reed, Tim Richmond, Elizabeth Glaser, Liberace, Freddie Mercury and Charlie Sheen, Ryan White helped to increase public awareness that HIV/AIDS was a significant epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 McDonald's NBA All-Star Celebrity Game {{was played}} on Friday, February 13 at the Phoenix Convention Center. A total of 16 celebrities {{took part in}} the game, {{including}} several former NBA players. Basketball Hall of Famers <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> and Julius Erving, who combined for 23 NBA All-Star appearances, served as coaches for the celebrity teams. NBA legends, Dominique Wilkins and Clyde Drexler, were joined by former players, Dan Majerle and Rick Fox, in the celebrity team roster. WNBA stars Lisa Leslie and Kara Lawson also participated in the game along with four Harlem Globetrotters players.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{qualified}} for the playoffs just twice between 1976 and 1984, {{a period in which}} the team used eight different head coaches, including former player Jerry Sloan. They had a chance to win the first pick of the 1979 NBA Draft, which would have allowed them to select future Hall of Famer <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson.</b> However, they lost a coin flip to the Los Angeles Lakers, and went on to choose David Greenwood with the second pick. Although Greenwood averaged 12.6 points over six seasons with the Bulls, he never became an NBA All-Star.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{freelance}} writer Howard Gewirtz and directed by Mark Kirkland. Basketball player <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> of the Los Angeles Lakers made a guest appearance in the episode as himself, becoming the first professional athlete to do so on the show. He appears in two sequences, one of which sees him calling Homer to congratulate him on saving the plant. The second appearance comes later in the episode in a basketball game sequence that Lakers sportscaster Chick Hearn also guest stars in.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} late February 2006, Jason McElwain {{and his family}} started {{receiving}} inquiries from over twenty-five film companies, including The Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros., about making a film based on his story. In April 2006, {{it was announced that}} Columbia Pictures had bought the rights to produce the film. Laura Ziskin, producer of the Spider-Man film series, was signed on to produce the film about McElwain's life. <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> has also been attached as producer, while two-time Academy Award winner Alvin Sargent is in talks to write the film. However, there currently is no timetable for the movie as contracts are being finalized and the script is still being written.|$|E
5|$|In his 13-year, 924-game NBA playing career, Cousy {{finished}} with 16,960 points, 4,786 rebounds and 6,955 assists, translating to averages of 18.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game. He {{was regarded as}} the first great point guard of the NBA, winning eight of the first 11 assist titles in the league, all of them en bloc, and had a highly successful career, winning six NBA titles, one MVP award, 13 All-Star and 12 All-NBA First and Second Team call-ups and two All-Star MVP awards. With his eye-catching dribbling and unorthodox passing, Cousy popularized modern guard play and raised {{the profile of the}} Boston Celtics and the entire NBA. His fast-paced playing style was later emulated by the likes of Pete Maravich and <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson.</b>|$|E
5|$|Looking for a 3-peat, the Heat {{dominated}} the 2014 postseason, going 12–3 {{in the first}} three rounds. They reached the 2014 NBA Finals and faced the Spurs in a rematch of the 2013 Finals. With James limited in Game 1 due to leg cramps, the Spurs ended the game on a 31–9 run, winning the game 110–95. The Heat would win Game 2, but that would be their only win of the series, as the Spurs would win Games 3, 4, and 5 to win the Championship, their first since 2007 and the fifth and final title of Duncan's career. Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP, becoming the third-youngest Finals MVP after Duncan and <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{advanced}} to the NBA Finals {{for the first time}} in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award, and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers {{have had}} three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982). The Lakers {{have also had}} five Lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected 10th overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected 10th overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected 7th overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected 2nd overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected 2nd overall in 2016), and Lonzo Ball (selected 2nd overall in 2017). Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A. C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher, and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers {{would lose}} 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, but were bounced {{in the first}} round. During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season {{that would result in}} the Lakers failing to make the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 1976. <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> would coach the final 16 games of the season with former {{teammate}} Michael Cooper as his lead assistant. Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1987–1988 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6points and 8.7rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend Annie had a daughter they named Alexis.|$|E
5|$|Russell {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} and decorated athletes in North American sports history. His awards and achievements include 11 NBA championships as a player with the Boston Celtics in 13 seasons (including two NBA championships as player/head coach), and he is credited with having raised defensive play in the NBA to a new level. By winning the 1956 NCAA Championship with USF and the 1957 NBA title with the Celtics, Russell became the first of only four players in basketball history to win an NCAA championship and an NBA Championship back-to-back (the others being Henry Bibby, <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> and Billy Thompson). He also won two state championships in high school. In the interim, Russell collected an Olympic gold medal in 1956. His stint as coach of the Celtics was also of historical significance, as he became the first black head coach in major U.S. professional sports when he succeeded Red Auerbach.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers {{selected}} Chuck Hanger {{with their}} first pick, ninth overall in the 1948 BAA draft. The Lakers got their first overall draft pick in 1958 by choosing Elgin Baylor, {{who went on to}} be selected as the only NBA Rookie of the Year to be on the Lakers. The Lakers also drafted <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> in 1979 with their second first overall pick, who was rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time by ESPN in 2007. The Lakers had no first round draft picks in 1967, 1976, 1978, 1980, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The Lakers had no first or second round draft picks from 1983, 1987, and 2001. Throughout the years, the Lakers had traded away some of their picks as well as traded for other teams' picks. As a result of the various trades, the Los Angeles Lakers had five first and second round picks in 1979.|$|E
5|$|West {{ended his}} playing career with 14 All-Star, 12 All-NBA Team and five All-Defensive Team selections, and scored 25,192points, 6,238assists and 5,366rebounds in 932 games, {{translating}} {{to an average}} of 27.0points, 6.7assists and 5.8rebounds per game. Among retired players, only Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain surpass his 27.0 points per game average. He led the Lakers in scoring in seven seasons, only Jordan had a higher career scoring average in the playoffs (33.5 versus 29.1). In 1979, West was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and the Lakers retired his No. 44 jersey in 1983. In March 2008, ESPN voted West the third greatest shooting guard of all time. As a coach, West led the Lakers into three consecutive playoff campaigns, and then went on to win seven NBA championships as a general manager, building the 1980s Lakers dynasty under coach Pat Riley and players <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy and the 2000s under coach Phil Jackson and players Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.|$|E
5|$|The first {{championship}} came at {{the expense}} of the Los Angeles Lakers, which also saw the last appearance in the Finals for <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson.</b> Billed as a showdown between the aging Johnson and the upstart Jordan, the Lakers won the first game, 93–91. For the rest of the series, Pippen guarded Johnson, allowing Jordan to attain a free scoring role to lead Chicago to ultimately taking the next four games. The Bulls returned to the Finals in the next year, pitted against Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers. Throughout the 1991–1992 season, Jordan and Drexler led their teams to the best records in their respective conferences, leading to several comparisons between the two players in anticipation of a postseason match-up. Chicago defeated the Trail Blazers in Game 1 by 33 points, a game notable for Jordan breaking the record for the most three-pointer in a first half, with six. Game 2 went into overtime, with the Trail Blazers outscoring the Bulls 18–7 in the final period to run away with the win. Game 3 and 4 were split between Chicago and Portland, respectively, but the Bulls took the final two games, clinching their second championship.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 22 head coaches for the Lakers {{franchise}}. John Kundla coached {{the team in}} Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships, from 1949 to 1954. Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins. Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010. Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Kurt Rambis and Byron Scott have all played and head coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005–2006 until 2010–2011. Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–2012 season in May 2011. Brown was fired on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned {{at the end of}} the 2013–2014 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach. After the 2015–2016 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement.|$|E
5|$|Challenged by Lakers' coach Phil Jackson {{to be more}} {{assertive}} while Bryant recovered from offseason knee surgery, Gasol started the season's first week averaging 25.3 points on 52.5 percent shooting, 10.3 rebounds, and five assists per game as the Lakers started 3–0. He was named Western Conference Player of the Week. He earned his third straight All-Star selection and his season averages of 19 points and 10 rebounds were nearly identical {{to what he had}} put up as a Laker the previous three seasons. Pau's play also merited him All-NBA second team honors {{for the first time in}} his career. In the playoffs, Gasol only averaged 13 points on 42% shooting over 10 games, and the Lakers were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. Gasol had the worst post season performance of his career. Lakers Hall of Famer and ESPN analyst <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> cited Gasol as a possible trade option for the Lakers to acquire Magic center Dwight Howard. Gasol ignored the false reports about his relationship status with his girlfriend as the cause of his poor performance and has accepted the criticism of his play as valid. During the 2011–12 NBA season, Gasol and teammate Lamar Odom were subjected to trade rumors involving former New Orleans Hornets guard Chris Paul. After the trade fell through, Gasol vowed that it would not affect the way he played. Odom, on the other hand, was angry at the Laker organization and was traded to the 2010–11 NBA champion Dallas Mavericks for a future first round pick. After Lakers co-captain Derek Fisher was traded in March 2012, Gasol joined Bryant as co-captains of the team. He won the 2011–12 seasonlong NBA Community Assist Award.|$|E
5|$|Cooke {{was a more}} {{hands-on}} owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations. He personally financed {{construction of}} the Forum in 1967 {{at a cost of}} $16.5million. He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67million. Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce. Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate. Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998, and until October 2010 <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson</b> was a minority owner as well. Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988. In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league. Fast food chain Jack in the Box is another major sponsor, the company gives all fans in attendance at home games a coupon for two free tacos if the Lakers hold their opponent under 100 points and win. The company also sponsors the team's halftime shows on KCAL-TV and Fox Sports West. In 2013, Buss {{died at the age of}} 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer. His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote. Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{returned}} to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered {{to be one of}} the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history. With the Bulls trailing 86–83 with 41.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and hit a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting the Utah lead to 86–85. The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to forward Karl Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and took the ball out of his hands for a steal. Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan gave Chicago an 87–86 lead with a game-winning jumper, the climactic shot of his Bulls career. Afterwards, John Stockton missed a game-winning three-pointer. Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship and second three-peat. Once again, Jordan was voted the Finals MVP, having led all scorers averaging 33.5 points per game, including 45 in the deciding Game 6. Jordan's six Finals MVPs is a record; Shaquille O'Neal, <b>Magic</b> <b>Johnson,</b> LeBron James and Tim Duncan are tied for second place with three apiece. The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history. Game 6 also holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.|$|E
