50|$|Email {{archiving}} is the act {{of preserving}} and making searchable all email to/from an individual. Email archiving solutions capture email content either directly from the email application itself or during transport.

The reasons a company may opt to implement an email archiving solution include protection of mission critical data, to meet retention and supervision requirements of applicable regulations, and for e-discovery purposes. It is predicted that the email archiving market will grow from nearly $2.1 billion in 2009 to over $5.1 billion in 2013.|$|E

50|$|BESYS (Bell Operating System) was {{an early}} {{computing}} environment originally implemented as a batch processing operating system in 1957 at Bell Labs for the IBM 704 computer.

Vyssotsky and utilized IBM's FORTRAN and North American's symbolic assembly program (SAP) programming languages. It was designed to efficiently deal with a large number of jobs originating on punched cards and producing results suitable for printing on paper and punched cards. The system also provided processing capabilities for data stored on magnetic tapes and <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> units.
