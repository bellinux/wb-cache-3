50|$|The {{telegraph}} {{invented by}} Baron Schilling von Canstatt in 1832 had a transmitting device {{which consisted of}} a keyboard with 16 black-and-white keys. These served for switching the electric current. The receiving instrument consisted of six galvanometers with magnetic needles, suspended from silk threads. Both stations of Shilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the galvanometers, one served for the return current and one - for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions {{of black and white}} flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Shilling subsequently improved its apparatus. He reduced the number of connecting wires from eight to two. On 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836 the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from Nicholas I of Russia. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a 5 km experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at Peterhof and the naval base at Kronstadt. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837. Schilling {{was also one of the}} first to put into practice the idea of the binary system of signal transmission. In 1833, Carl Friedrich Gauss, together with the physics professor Wilhelm Weber in Göttingen installed a 1200 <b>m</b> <b>wire</b> above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the galvanometer. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a commutator of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.|$|E

40|$|Helical {{metallic}} micro/nanostructures as functional components {{have considerable}} potential for future miniaturized devices, {{based on their}} unique mechanical and electrical properties. Thus, understanding and controlling the mechanical properties of metallic helices is desirable for their practical application. Herein, we implemented a direct-writing technique based on the electrodeposition method to grow copper microhelices with well-defined and programmable three-dimensional (3 D) features. The mechanical properties of the 3 D helical structures were studied by the electrically induced quasistatic and dynamic electromechanical resonance technique. These methods mainly explored the static pull-in process and the dynamic electromechanical response, respectively. It {{was found that the}} center-symmetric and vertical double copper microhelix structure with 1. 2 mu <b>m</b> <b>wire</b> diameter has a flexural rigidity of 0. 9 x 10 (- 14) N m(2) and the single vertical copper microhelix structure with 1. 1 mu <b>m</b> <b>wire</b> diameter has a flexural rigidity of 0. 5989 x 10 (- 14) N m(2).

It is found that the experimental results agree well with the finite element calculations. The proposed method can be used to fabricate and measure the flexural properties of three-dimensional complex micro/nanowire structures, and may {{have a profound effect on}} the application of microhelices in various useful microdevices such as helix-based microelectromechanical switches, sensors and actuators based on their unique mechanical properties...|$|E

The wires would also be evaluated for surface characteristics under a scanning electron microscope. Materials and methods: Superelastic NiTi wires of 0. 016 " from 3 M Unitek were categorized as group I and from American orthodontics as group II. The subgroup A of groups I and II consisted of 10 unused samples. The subgroups B of groups I and II consisted of wires retrieved after 3 months of clinical use. The subgroup C of groups I and II consisted of wires retrieved after 6 months of intraoral use. Results: The results showed that the ultimate tensile strength of the unused wires of both groups I and II were significantly higher than the used wires of the same group. The unused <b>wires</b> of 3 <b>M</b> Unitek were found to have superior ultimate tensile strength than the unused wires from American orthodontics and the difference was statistically significant. Likewise, the ultimate tensile strength of 3 <b>M</b> Unitek <b>wires</b> which were unused was significantly higher than used wires at 3 months and 6 months of intraoral use, American orthodontics wires which were unused were also found to have statistically higher ultimate tensile strength that the intraorally placed wires after 3 months and 6 months.

40|$|A wire boom {{deployment}} {{system has}} been developed that uses a mechanism {{which is similar to}} the classic yo-yo despin mechanism. The goal has been to develop a way to rapidly deploy wire booms from a spinning sounding-rocket experiment. The main challenge in using a yo-yo-type mechanism is to dissipate the excess kinetic energy so that the wire booms do not re-wrap themselves about the spacecraft after deploying. A ring has been added to the basic yoyo mechanism. It rotates with respect to the main spacecraft about the nominal spin axis, and the wire booms deploy from it. The ring/spacecraft joint is damped, and relative motion between the ring and the spacecraft dissipates the excess energy. This system is analyzed and simulated in 2 and 3 dimensions. Techniques are developed for tuning the damping law to rapidly deploy the wire booms without the occurrence of re-wrapping, and a criterion is presented that ensures 3 -dimensional stability of the final equilibrium in the global minimum-energy sense. Simulation results show that the system can deploy 2. 5 <b>m</b> <b>wire</b> booms in under 20 sec and that the deployment can tolerate the expected levels of asymmetry in the system configuration and the initial state...|$|E

In the past, many research activities {{have occurred in the}} field of reliability of power modules, where the life time of the complete module is affected by bond wire lift offs, heel cracks and other failures. Less effort was spent for investigating the degradation process at the wire bond itself.

These cracks form after several thousand temperature swings due to CTE mismatch and ultimately lead to wire bond lift off.
