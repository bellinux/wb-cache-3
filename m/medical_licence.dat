50|$|Prior to {{the nineteenth}} century European medical {{training}} and practice was ostensibly self-regulated {{through a variety of}} antique corporations, guilds or colleges. Among regular practitioners, university trained physicians formed a medical elite while provincial surgeons and apothecaries, who learnt their art through apprenticeship, made up the lesser ranks. In Old Regime France, licenses for medical practitioners were granted by the medical faculties of the major universities, such as the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Access was restricted and successful candidates, amongst other requirements, had to pass examinations and pay regular fees. In the Austrian Empire <b>medical</b> <b>licences</b> were granted by the Universities of Prague and Vienna. Amongst the German states the top physicians were academically qualified and typically attached to medical colleges associated with the royal court.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The American Thoracic Society {{recommends}} that the inspired concentration {{used for the}} estimation of carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO) mixture should be 0. 25 - 0. 35 % carbon monoxide, 10 - 14 % helium, 17 - 21 % oxygen, balance nitrogen. Inspired oxygen influences alveolar oxygen and hence carbon monoxide uptake, such that transfer factor increases by 0. 35 % per mm Hg decrease in alveolar oxygen. To aid in the standardisation of TLCO either a known inspired oxygen concentration should be used, or TLCO should be corrected to a standard inspired oxygen concentration. The range of gas mixtures used in practice and the implications for cost and accuracy have been investigated. METHODS [...] A questionnaire was sent to 185 respiratory units in the UK requesting information on (1) the method used to estimate TLCO, (2) the manufacturer of the equipment, (3) the mixture used, (4) whether "medical quality" gas was ordered, and (5) the level of satisfaction with supplier service. RESULTS [...] Replies were received from 106 units. Most used the single breath breath holding method for which 17 different test mixtures were ordered. One unit also used the single breath exhalation method. Inspired oxygen ranged from 17. 94 % to 25 %, giving a wide variation in alveolar oxygen and hence TLCO. Forty seven units ordered a specific inspired oxygen, the rest ordering "air" as balance. The cost per litre of gas varied greatly, with the mixture 14 % helium, 0. 28 % carbon monoxide, balance air (17. 9 % oxygen) and 10 % helium, 0. 28 % carbon monoxide, balance air (18. 8 % oxygen) being cheapest to produce. Ordering a specific inspired oxygen concentration increased the cost. Large cylinders of gas were cheaper for the same mixture. The mixture for the exhalation method was the most expensive. Sixty seven units ordered "medical quality" gas and six assumed this was supplied. Twenty nine (27 %) were dissatisfied with their supplier due to (1) poor service, (2) long delivery times, (3) costs, or (4) wrongly labelled cylinders. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is recommended that two mixtures be available: (a) 14 % helium, 0. 28 % carbon monoxide, balance air for a helium analyser reading up to 15 %, and (b) 10 % helium, 0. 28 % carbon monoxide, balance air for lower reading helium analysers. The mixture should be produced under a <b>medical</b> product <b>licence.</b> The advantage of the single exhalation method for routine clinical use needs to be investigated {{in view of the}} higher cost of the mixture...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{biochemistry}} is {{the usual}} name for clinical biochemistry or clinical chemistry in Serbia, and medical biochemist is the official name for the clinical chemist (or clinical biochemist). This is the largest sub-discipline of the laboratory medicine in Serbia. It includes all aspects of clinical chemistry, and also laboratory hematology with coagulation, immunology, etc. Medical biochemistry laboratories in Serbia and medical biochemists as a profession are part of Health Care System and their activities are regulated through: the Health Care Law and rules issued by the Chamber of Medical Biochemists of Serbia. The first continuous and organized education for Medical Biochemists (Clinical Chemists) in Serbia dates from 1945, when the Department of Medical Biochemistry was established at the Pharmaceutical Faculty in Belgrade. In 1987 at the same Faculty a five years undergraduate study program was established, educating Medical Biochemists under a special program. Since the academic year 2006 / 2007 the new five year undergraduate (according to Bologna Declaration) and four-year postgraduate program according to EC 4 European Syllabus for Postgraduate Training in Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine has been established. The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Public Health accredited these programs. There are four requirements for practicing medical biochemistry in the Health Care System: University Diploma of the Faculty of Pharmacy (Study of Medical Biochemistry), successful completion of the professional exam at the Ministry of Health after completion of one additional year of obligatory practical training in the medical biochemistry laboratories, membership in the Serbian Chamber of <b>Medical</b> Biochemists and <b>licence</b> for skilled work issued by the Serbian Chamber of Medical Biochemists. In order to present laboratory medical biochemistry practice in Serbia this paper will {{be focused on the}} following: Serbian national legislation, healthcare services organization, sub-disciplines of laboratory medicine and medical biochemistry as the most significant, education in medical biochemistry, conditions for professional practice in medical biochemistry, continuous quality improvement, and accreditation. Serbian healthcare is based on fundamental principles of universal health coverage and solidarity between all citizens...|$|R
40|$|Historically, bone defects {{resulting}} from trauma, disease or infection {{are treated with}} autograft or allograft. Autograft is bone transplanted from a non-critical area of the skeleton and allograft is bone donated from {{another member of the}} same species. The drawbacks with these treatments such as limited availability, donor site morbidity, high cost and disease transmission have driven increasing use of bone graft substitute (BGS) materials. These represent 15 % of the £ 1. 6 billion global orthobiologics market. BGS materials available to date are not suitable for use in grafts that are intrinsic to the stability of the skeleton. Thus, the aim for this project was to fabricate an off the shelf and economically viable BGS that will support the skeletal structure whilst healing occurs. This project employed an empirical approach utilising both rapid prototyping (RP) and conventional manufacturing processes to produce novel BGSs. A range of RP techniques were attempted and discovered to be unsuitable {{as a result of their}} long build and postprocessing times, poor availability of suitable materials, and undesirable surface finish. Experiments with injection moulding and laser drilling of polylactic acid (PLA) successfully produced 10 mm blocks with a compressive strength of 67 – 80 MPa and compressive modulus of 1. 5 – 2. 2 GPa. This line of research led to the hypothesis that ceramic extrusion, a process hitherto untested for use in bone tissue engineering (BTE), may be feasible for production of a novel and high strength BGS. In collaboration with an international expert in the manufacture of ceramic monoliths it was possible, for the first time, to manufacture hydroxyapatite (HA) monoliths by adapting the process used for manufacture of automotive exhaust catalysts. These HA monoliths exhibited a compressive strength of 142 – 265 MPa and compressive modulus of 3. 2 – 4. 4 GPa. The exceptional strength of these monoliths match the properties of cortical bone whilst retaining the high levels of porosity (> 60 %) found in cancellous bone. This combination of strength and porosity will enable treatment of large structural bone defects where the high strength will withstand typical skeletal forces whilst the high porosity allows blood vessels to infiltrate the monolith and begin the healing process. Furthermore, these HA monoliths support the proliferation and differentiation of human osteoblast-like MG 63 cells and compare very favourably with a market leading BGS material in terms of their biological performance. It is suggested that this work will result in the development of a new family of high strength and high porosity BGSs for use in challenging clinical situations. The International Preliminary Examination Report for the patent issued to the author (WO 2007 / 125323) decreed that all 45 claims contained novelty and an inventive step. Two successful applications for research funding have raised nearly £ 50, 000 that helped fund this research effort.
