40|$|The moving {{junction}} {{is used in}} craniospinal irradiation (CSI) {{to smooth}} out any dose inhomogeneity across the head/spine junction. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the extent of the head/spine junction inhomogeneity in treatment plans of actual patients and to compare stationary and moving junction data. The radiotherapy plans, prescriptions and case notes of 18 patients (12 medulloblastomas, 3 supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumours, 2 pineoblastomas and 1 pineal germinoma) treated with CSI (35 Gy in 21 fractions over 29 days) were examined. At 16 months median follow-up (range 1. 5 - 35. 5 months), no junctional recurrences or myelopathy were observed. Using the moving junction technique the mean maximum anterior cord dose, from 5 cm caudal to 3 cm cephalad of the Day 1 junction, was 36. 3 Gy, and the mean minimum anterior cord dose was 32. 9 Gy, with a mean within-patient variation of 3. 4 Gy (9. 7 % of 35 Gy). In four patients, comparison of dose variation across the field junction was made between the original plans and a re-plan using a stationary junction. The effect of a <b>matched</b> <b>junction,</b> a 2 mm overlap and a 2 mm gap were studied both for moving junction and stationary junction techniques. Dose variations were similar in all cases for exactly-matched fields, but for a 2 mm overlap or gap the dose variation was smaller in all but one case for the moving junction technique. These data suggest that the moving junction is important to minimize the risk of overdose or underdose across the spine/head junction in CSI...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The paper {{suggests}} a contour-based algorithm for tracking moving objects in video. The inputs are segmented moving objects. Each segmented frame {{is transformed into}} region adjacency graphs (RAGs). The object's contour is divided into subcurves. Contour's junctions are derived. These junctions are the unique &# 226;&# 8364;&# 339;signature&# 226;&# 8364;&# 65533; of the tracked object. Junctions from two consecutive frames are matched. The junctions' motion is estimated using RAG edges in consecutive frames. Each pair of <b>matched</b> <b>junctions</b> may be connected by several paths (edges) that become candidates that represent a tracked contour. These paths are obtained by the -shortest paths algorithm between two nodes. The RAG {{is transformed into a}} weighted directed graph. The final tracked contour construction is derived by a match between edges (subcurves) and candidate paths sets. The RAG constructs the tracked contour that enables an accurate and unique moving object representation. The algorithm tracks multiple objects, partially covered (occluded) objects, compounded object of merge/split such as players in a soccer game and tracking in a crowded area for surveillance applications. We assume that features of topologic signature of the tracked object stay invariant in two consecutive frames. The algorithm's complexity depends on RAG's edges and not on the image's size. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We present {{measurements}} of the thermal conductance of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) junctions formed between metal leads (Au, Ag, Pt, and Pd) with mismatched phonon spectra. The thermal conductance obtained from frequency domain thermoreflectance experi-ments is 65 ± 7 MW/m 2 K for <b>matched</b> Au−alkanedithiol−Au <b>junctions,</b> while the mismatched Au−alkanedithiol−Pd junctions yield a thermal conductance of 36 ± 3 MW/m 2 K. The experimental observation that junction thermal con-ductance (per molecule) decreases as the mismatch between the lead vibrational spectra increases, paired with results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, suggest that phonons scatter elastically at the metal−SAM interfaces. Furthermore, we resolve a known discrepancy between measurements and MD predictions of SAM thermal conductance by using a contact mechanics model to predict 54 ± 15 % areal contact in the Au−alkanedithiol−Au experimental junction. This incomplete contact obscures the actual junction thermal conductance of 115 ± 22 MW/m 2 K, which is {{comparable to that of}} metal−dielectric interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Impedance {{matching}} {{techniques have}} shown potential for active vibration control of structures in bending. Such structures are commonly described by Euler-Bernoulli theory. Previous studies concerning impedance matching of these structures have only considered scalar quantities. However, for an Euler-Bernoulli beam four field variables are involved which implies that a scalar impedance is insufficient. The {{purpose of this}} study is therefore to expand the technique to include full 2 x 2 matrices. This is achieved by first deriving the reflection matrix as a function of the characteristic impedance matrices of an Euler-Bernoulli beam and an arbitrary termination impedance. An active impedance load is then introduced in order to manipulate the reflection matrix. A theoretical example is given where the approach is utilized to <b>match</b> the <b>junction</b> between an Euler-Bernoulli beam and a sandwich composite. This proposed active-passive damping configuration employs active control to enclose all incident power in the sandwich composite.

40|$|We present new {{heterodyne}} receiver results obtained at 100 GHz using resistively-shunted Nb and NbN tunnel junctions. In addition, we have carried out accurate {{measurements of the}} available noise power of these devices at the L-band (1. 5 GHz) IF (infrasonic) frequency. Both the heterodyne and the output noise measurements show that the noise of these devices can be a factor of five or more higher than that predicted by the simple current-biased RSJ model. The noise approaches the appropriate thermal or thermal and shot noise limits for bias voltages where the nonlinearity is not strong (i. e., V greater than I(sub C) R(sub N)), but as expected from the RSJ model, can be significantly higher at the low voltages where the mixers are typically biased. The bias voltage dependence of the noise shows structure which is associated with resonances in the RF embedding circuit. Surprisingly, we find that changes in the high-frequency (100 GHz) impedance presented to the junction can dramatically affect the magnitude and voltage dependence of the low-frequency (1. 5 GHz) noise.

40|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) is a chronic, {{progressive and}} possibly vision-threatening eye disease. Early detection and diagnosis of DR, {{prior to the}} development of any lesions, is paramount for more efficiently dealing with it and managing its consequences. This thesis investigates and proposes a number of candidate geometric and haemodynamic biomarkers, derived from fundus images of the retinal vasculature, which can be reliably utilised for identifying the progression from diabetes to DR. Numerous studies exist in literature that investigate only some of these biomarkers in independent normal, diabetic and DR cohorts. However, none exist, {{to the best of my}} knowledge, that investigates more than 100 biomarkers altogether, both geometric and haemodynamic ones, for identifying the progression to DR, by also using a novel experimental design, where the same exact <b>matched</b> <b>junctions</b> and subjects are evaluated in a four year period that includes the last three years pre-DR (still diabetic eye) and the onset of DR (progressors’ group). Multiple additional conventional experimental designs, such as non-matched junctions, non-progressors’ group, and a combination of them are also adopted in order to present the superiority of this type of analysis for retinal features. Therefore, this thesis aims to present a complete framework and some novel knowledge, based on statistical analysis, feature selection processes and classification models, so as to provide robust, rigorous and meaningful statistical inferences, alongside efficient feature subsets that can identify the stages of the progression. In addition, a new and improved method for more accurately summarising the calibres of the retinal vessel trunks is also presented. The first original contribution of this thesis is that a series of haemodynamic features (blood flow rate, blood flow velocity, etc.), which are estimated from the retinal vascular geometry based on some boundary conditions, are applied to studying the progression from diabetes to DR. These features are found to undoubtedly contribute to the inferences and the understanding of the progression, yielding significant results, mainly for the venular network. The second major contribution is the proposed framework and the experimental design for more accurately and efficiently studying and quantifying the vascular alterations that occur during the progression to DR and that can be safely attributed only to this progression. The combination of the framework and the experimental design lead to more sound and concrete inferences, providing a set of features, such as the central retinal artery and vein equivalent, fractal dimension, blood flow rate, etc., that are indeed biomarkers of progression to DR. The third major contribution of this work is the new and improved method for more accurately summarising the calibre of an arterial or venular trunk, with a direct application to estimating the central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE), the central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE) and their quotient, the arteriovenous ratio (AVR). Finally, the improved method is shown to truly make a notable difference in the estimations, when compared to the established alternative method in literature, with an improvement between 0. 24...|$|R
