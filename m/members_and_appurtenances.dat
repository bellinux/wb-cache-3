40|$|Most {{descriptions}} of disaster events place {{a great deal}} of emphasis on the damage done to life, physical structures and facilities. Financial estimates of the destruction caused by the disaster agent, together with accounts of the number of dead and injured, comprise the commonly accepted standard for gauging disaster severity. However, disasters also exact social costs over and above the damage to life and property. Indeed, {{it can be argued that}} it is precisely this element – the sudden disruption of social life – that distinguishes disasters from other destructive or costly events such as accidents, personal or family tragedies and economic depression. The notion that some degree of stress in community social organizations is present in all disasters is expressed explicitly in widely quoted definitions which define a disaster as an event, concentrated in time and space, in which a society or a relatively self-sufficient subdivision of a society undergoes severe danger and incurs such losses to its <b>members</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>appurtenances</b> that the social structure is disrupted and the fulfillment of all or some of the essential functions of society is prevented (Fritz, 1967 : 655); or as a collective stress situation when many members of a social system fail to receive expected conditions of life from the system (Barton, 1970 : 38) ...|$|R

The event and its aftermath may significantly damage an organization and its employees, products, services, financial condition, and reputation. (Barton) A crisis, like an accident, is a disruption that physically affects a system as a whole and also threatens the priority goals of an organization, and challenges the traditional behaviors and values shared in an organization. (Pauchant and Mitroff) Disaster: An occurrence inflicting wide spread destruction and distress. A situation that is disruptive and harmful; is of high magnitude; is sudden, acute and demands a timely response; and is outside the organization's typical operating framework. Any occurrence which causes damage, ecological disruption, loss of human lives, deterioration of health and health services on a scale sufficient to warrant an extraordinary response from outside the affected community. (World Health Organization) An event concentrated in time and space, in which a society, or a relatively selfsufficient subdivision of a society, undergoes severe danger and incurs such losses to its <b>members</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>appurtenances</b> that the social structure is disrupted and the fulfillment of all or some of the essential functions of the society is prevented.
