500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{described}} the album as more consistent than most remix collections {{and noted that}} it functions well as a record in its own right. Priya Elan of NME explained that [...] "the results are pretty much all quality" [...] {{and that some of}} the tracks are better than the original songs on Silent Alarm. Rockfeedback's Thomas Hannan stated, [...] "It's all very clever, but the most intelligent thing about it is that it <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the original in a completely altered way." [...] Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe was impressed with the album and indicated that it is [...] "surprisingly good, and surprisingly often".|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{said that}} he wanted to make [...] "something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the {{adventure}} and all that" [...] but also have a conscience [...] "that maybe in the enjoying of it <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{a little bit about the}} way you interact with nature and your fellow man". He added that [...] "the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are" [...] and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans [...] "represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future".|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} the episode {{originated}} from an idea that executive producer and series creator Chris Carter had about a pyramid scheme involving body parts. Writer Jeff Vlaming combined two additional concepts that he had developed; the first involved a lottery {{in a small town}} and the other concerned corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. When the initial script for [...] "Hell Money" [...] was submitted, Carter merged the three stories into one. Entertainment Weekly later noted that [...] "the twisted grotesquery of this story <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it must be based on a true story", but, according to Carter, the story was completely original. Vlaming had originally hoped that the episode {{would be one of the}} rare entries where Scully's version of the events would be vindicated, but in the end Mulder, once again, put everything together.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} Autobiography were mixed. People {{magazine}} {{considered it a}} [...] "passable debut" [...] and said that it showed Simpson was a [...] "credible talent in her own right"; Allmusic called it [...] "an unexpectedly strong debut". The Village Voice compared Autobiography favorably to Courtney Love's 2004 album, America's Sweetheart, referring particularly to Autobiographys [...] "Fruit Stripe bubblegrunge guitars and insanely chewy melodies and an ear-tickling production job." [...] It also praised Simpson's singing, saying that she [...] "can pack so much contradictory emotion into a single line—a single word—that the music can barely contain it." [...] According to Blender, all of the album's songs [...] "paint in huge strokes"; its review also regarded Simpson's vocals positively.E! Online also praised Simpson's singing and catchy tracks, saying that [...] "Ashlee Simpson still managed to piece together this collection of tracks that sound {{as if they were}} ripped right from the pages of her diary. Ashlee even <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> twice about her semicharmed life. So, even if it doesn't wow you, Autobiography may surprise you." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{signed a}} five-album record deal with SYCOmusic {{as part of}} Columbia Records on September 18, 2006. She was the first U.S. artist to sign with SYCOmusic; during the press conference, Simon Cowell called Ryan [...] "potentially {{one of the best}} singers I have ever heard in my life." [...] The {{following}} month, Ryan was in Los Angeles to record her first CD. The self-titled debut was released on November 14, 2006, featuring cover versions of [...] "The Rose" [...] and [...] "I Believe I Can Fly", and original songs like [...] "I Wish That" [...] and [...] "Pray for a Better Day". Eight days later, the album debuted at No. 57 on the Billboard album charts, showcasing [...] "her gargantuan chops and sweet charm". Matt Collar of AllMusic added that the arrangements were [...] "grandiose" [...] for someone of Ryan's age, but they were [...] "more than matched by her truly impressive vocal talent." [...] Los Angeles Daily News reviewer Sandra Barrera wrote that Ryan handled the songs [...] "like the old pro that her big, powerful voice <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> she is".|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{retrospective}} of both Rachel and of Baxendale's performance when the series ended. In the New Statesman, Andrew Billen wrote that Rachel [...] "was as near to a sex symbol as this comedy drama about six cold-footed yuppies produced. She was also materialistic, unfaithful, self-absorbed, tricky {{and had not}} the first clue about men [...] Yet her death, caused by a moment of carelessness behind the wheel, was powerful and shocking, {{a tribute to the}} extent to which we have invested and believed in her." [...] Observer critic Kathryn Flett noted that Baxendale's high-profile role in Friends made her the [...] "star" [...] of Cold Feet in the first series, but both she and Rachel had been [...] "eclipsed" [...] by the other actors and characters by the time of the final series. Spectator critic Simon Hoggart wrote, [...] "I wasn't as sorry about poor old Rachel as I should have been. It was one of those deaths which <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> 'Oh, her poor baby boy,' rather than 'Goodness, how we'll miss her.'" [...] Hoggart attributed his ambivalence to Baxendale's portrayal of the character as a [...] "fraught, snippy" [...] woman. Matt Greenhalgh, who co-wrote the episode featuring Rachel's death, called killing off the character [...] "a privilege".|$|E

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E
500|$|... "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. While reviewing Femme Fatale, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Spears [...] "does what pop stars invariably do {{in lieu of}} having a detectable character of their own: {{goes on and on}} about sex", while commenting that [...] "after a while, you get the feeling the lyricists just gave up trying in the face of her indifference: 'You got me kind of hot … Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,' she sings, which somehow <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> not of thrillingly sweaty congress but the smell of boiled cabbage." [...] Contemporary critic Robert Christgau noted the songs on the album are [...] "such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy", saying that the singer is [...] "just too straight-faced" [...] on [...] "the nauseous 'Your body look so sick I think I got the flu'". A reviewer of Samesame.com.au compared the background vocals of the song to Kesha's [...] "Blow" [...] (2010), and noted [...] "guest rapper Sabi wish she was Nicki Minaj". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani considered [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] one of the album's [...] "best offerings", comparing the song to Christina Aguilera's [...] "Desnudate" [...] (2010).|$|E

500|$|John Anderson, of Variety, said [...] "to simply call it {{harrowing}} or unsparing doesn’t quite cut it," [...] having {{felt that}} the film is [...] "courageous and uncompromising, a shaken cocktail of debasement and elation, despair and hope." [...] Anderson cited Carey's performance as [...] "pitch perfect" [...] and Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as [...] "disarming." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, praised Carey's performance, describing it as having been [...] "an authentically deglammed compassion" [...] and praised the film for 'capturing' [...] "how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead" [...] and for Daniels' showing [...] "unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives." [...] Gleiberman described the film as being a movie [...] "that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> 'There {{but for the grace}} of God go I.' [...] It's a potent and moving experience, because by the end you feel you've witnessed nothing less than the birth of a soul" [...] and {{felt that the}} [...] "final scene of revelation" [...] between Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's characters was strong enough to be able to leave viewers [...] "tearful, shaken, [...] dazed with pity and terror." [...] He identifies how Daniels uses one of the rich scenes created by Fletcher to position Mo'Nique in a painful confrontation with Sidibe that results in a masterful and thought-provoking performance that delivers the final [...] "push" [...] needed by Sidibe: [...] "The more Precious tries to get away from her mother, the more she's pulled back".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. VanDerWerff graded the episode [...] "A−". He {{felt it was}} imperfect, but that [...] "Audition" [...] demonstrated the Glee executives had learned [...] "a surprising amount about what does and doesn't work within its format". He added, [...] "as a season premiere and promise for what's to come? 'Audition' is very good indeed." [...] David Hinckley of the Daily News rated [...] "Audition" [...] 4/5. He felt that the episode was [...] "a little self-indulgent" [...] with [...] "a dizzying series of cross-plots", but hoped that it was setting the foundations for an [...] "interesting, evolving story" [...] in the season to come. Bianco called the episode a [...] "heady, sometimes-too-rich mix of song-and-dance magic, high school musical spoof and overall excess", and concluded: [...] "It's a mess, but it's the kind of joyous mess that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> order can be overrated." [...] Both Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times and Jessica Derschwitz of CBS News praised the episode's musical numbers and Sue's lines, while Stack and the New York Post Jarett Wieselman deemed the episode to have assuaged their worries about Glee experiencing a [...] "sophomore slump" [...] and commented positively on the opening scene that directly addressed criticism of the first season. Vanity Fair Brett Berk received the episode positively, despite having been disappointed with {{the second half of}} the first season, a sentiment shared by Futterman, who deemed [...] "Audition" [...] a [...] "fresh start" [...] after [...] "a first season that devolved into a frenzy of too many songs and not enough long-term plot".|$|E

Cortese was at first uncomfortable with the storyline, stating; [...] "I was very worried about the age difference but the way it's been done and written is really respectful." [...] Cortese also believed despite the age difference, Dom was truly in love with Delphi; [...] "Dom sees Delphi as his soul mate, she affects {{him in a way}} no one has before because he's always been suspicious of relationships. He doesn't have to pretend to be anyone else for her to like him." [...] Producer Harriet Crampton enjoyed the romance and how it contrasted with Dom's evil character, stating; [...] "To have a villain who has a strong sincere love or passion <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> ‘Okay, he’s an absolute bastard but we know he does love Delphi." [...] The two first get together when Delphi turns 16, sharing a kiss. The two eventually start a relationship but break up when Dom comes under question of Geoff's murder in arguably one of the soap's most memorable storylines. Dom flees when Delphi confronts him about the murder but later returns, with Cortese suggesting it was for love; [...] "But the thing about Dominic is he believes he's doing everything for the right reasons. He's done everything he can for Delphi— that's his main reason for coming back." [...] Dom later scares Delphi into fleeing the country, ending the once seemingly perfect relationship.|$|E
