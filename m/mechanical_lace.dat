5000|$|The {{forerunner of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>lace</b> making {{stems from the}} 1589 {{stocking}} frame. This is a weaving frame fitted with a bar of bearded needles that passed back and forth, {{to and from the}} operator. There was no warp. The beards were simultaneously depressed by a presser bar catching the weft and holding it back a course making a row of loops. After Jeremiah Strutt had modified the machine in 1759 to do ribbing, Hammond in 1764 used a tickler stick to transfer the loops 2 or 3 gaits sideways,mechanic lace making was born. [...] There was no carriage, no comb and the operations continued to be done in sequence by the operator.|$|E

It was to Victoria Mill, in Weaste that Friedrich Engels (the father) sent his son Friedrich in 1842. It was {{while working for}} the firm that Friedrich wrote his influential bookThe Condition of the Working Class in England. [...] The book was written between September 1844 and March 1845 and printed in German in 1845 and in English in 1887. In the book, Engels gave way to his views on the [...] "grim future of capitalism and the industrial age".The Engels were a pietist, fiercely Calvinist family with solid beliefs in predestination and the rejection of forms of worldly pleasure. Hardwork and prayer were mantras: and they saw no contradictions in creating vast wealth while neighbours, their employees remained in poverty; as that was their destiny. From Rhineland farming stock, the family's prosperity began when Johann Casper Engels (1715-1787) arrived in Barmen {{and saw that the}} crystal clear lime free waters of the Wupper was idea for linen bleaching. He built up a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lace</b> production enterprise which he passed onto his sons. They were paternalistic employers, building houses, schools and a granary co-operative for his workers in Barmen. The second generation expanded the firm to include ribbon weaving. Johann Casper II became a town councillor and built the Barmen United Protestant Church. They were s (merchant-manufacturers) representing everything Biedermeier. With the next generation, the family fragmented- the Engels & Sohne went to one brother, and Friedrich left to join the Ermen brothers to spin and double sewing cotton and trade in Manchester and Engelskirchen.|$|E
