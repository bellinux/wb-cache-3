40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to predict and analyze the dam break flood in a real river valley. A numerical model was developed for simulating dam break flood and applied for analyzing flood situation due to the instantaneous hypothetical failure of the proposed dam in river Dibang, a major Himalayan tributary of the River Brahmaputra. Significant variation in bed slope, bed width and resistance characteristic along the channel length are the typical characteristics of Dibang river. To compute the flood under such dam failure conditions, natural channel is generally represented by a simplified channel.. Such simplification may lead to erroneous estimation of the important parameters such as maximum probable depth, peak arrival, maximum probable velocity and inundated area. Therefore, due emphasis should be given in the selection of an appropriate computational channel while simulating a real dam break flood. Two different approaches for adopting the computational natural channel have been proposed here for predicting the dam break flood. Probable maximum depth of flood, time of peak arrival and the <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> <b>flood</b> velocity at different sections up to 63 km downstream of the proposed Dibang dam have been computed. In one approach, the predictions are made by adopting a computational channel, which considers the whole floodplain downstream of the dam when River Dibang enters the plain. The other approach considers only the original simplified river channel of Dibang. The predictions of dam Break Wave Propagation by both the methods have been compared and analyzed. The analysis clearly illustrates the importance of the proper selection of the computational channel in a river valley downstream of the dam to avoid over estimation or underestimation of flood...|$|E

The physical model included the spillway, the chute, the stilling basin and about 220 ft of the channel downstream. The model was built at a scale of 1 : 16. Three series of tests were conducted in this model study. The first test series were conducted under the <b>probable</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>flood</b> condition with two tailwater levels, and under the standard <b>probable</b> <b>flood</b> condition with one tailwater level.

40|$|Sudan has {{realized}} {{the importance of}} small dams in water harvesting long time ago. The first experience with small dam in Sudan goes back to early 40 ’s. The prime utilization of the micro dam was store water to meet irrigation and domestic water demands. The number of constructed small dams are growing with time, {{most of which were}} constructed on seasonal ungauged wadis where limited design information is available. Due to the inadequate designs there are cases of failure, dam breaks and complete siltation of the live storage in few years. In some cases the dam appurtenants (spillways, gates, etc) were not properly designed due to the limited information and/or improper design procedure. The short –time objectives of the study are to revise design procedures of the existing and proposed micro dams appurtenants and assess them critically to understand their weaknesses. The long –term objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the possible design procedures under the condition of limited information and to develop procedure for designing micro dams in data scarce areas. Simple embankment techniques have been adopted and practiced long ago in the rural Sudan areas. Small dams constructed to provide water supply in rural areas. Investigation of dams requires carefull and detailed studies of hydrology, geology and topography of the site together with the land use and soil conservation aspects. Failure of dams is attributed to improper design and insufficient data. Geneina is located in the west of the Darfur region, near the boarders with Chad and has about 124800 inhabitants. Kerninik is one of its biggest villages with inhabitants of about 12000. The climate is hot and dry during most of the year; the wet season lasts about three months, from June to September. The mean annual rainfall for the last 20 years is about 497. 8 mm, and the mean annual potential evaporation is 2299. 6 mm. The Wadi Kaja and Wadi Barray are the main drainage lines in the area. In 1984 total runoff of Wadi Kaja was only 6. 1 × 106 m 3; in 1985 total runoff was 610. 8 × 106 m 3. Most of the people of Kerenik depend on cultivation of Sorghum, millet and the crops from small gardens like mango, Guava, Citrus, vegetables and Fodders. The main water source is the open dug wells. The climate in Darfur is controlled by seasonal movement of the sun and associated inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The rainfall which is taken into account is from Zalingi metrological station which is just outside the Catchment. The contour map was plotted by surfer. The test pits show that the alluvial deposit is presented (consists of gravel, sands, silts and clay). The type of soil is small grain with straight raw plus crop residue cover with residue about 40 % of the surface throughout the year. These soils are in a good hydrologic condition with transmission rate greater than 0. 76 cm/h. The <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> <b>flood</b> is calculated by SCS-curve number model and Manning formula.

The analyses of data show that the mean annual rainfall is found to be 2618. 5 mm. There is only one rainy season in the region and the peak of the rainfall occurs in the period (July to august). The effective rainy season can be considered from July to September. The peak of rainfall occurs on average three weeks before the peak of the flow and the flow hydrograph starts to pick up in two weeks time after the start of the effective rainy season.

40|$|A big {{responsibility}} lies in {{the hand}} of local authorities to exercise measures in preventing fatalities and damages during flood occurrences. However, the problem is how flooding can be prevented if nobody knows when and {{where it will be}} occurring, and how much water is expected. Therefore, the utilisation of flood models in such studies can be helpful in simulating what is anticipated to occur.   In this study, the HEC-RAS steady flow model was used in calibrating different flood events in Testeboån river, which is situated in the municipality of Gävle in Sweden. The purpose is to provide inundation maps that show the water surface profiles for the various flood events that can help authorities in planning within the area. Moreover, the study would try to address certain issues, which concern one-dimensional models like HEC-RAS in terms of the effects of topographic data and the parameters used for friction coefficient.   Various flood maps were produced to visualise the extents of the floods. In Oppala and Norra Åbyggeby, the big water extents for both the 100 -year and the highest probable floods were visible in the forested areas and grasslands, although a few houses were within the predicted flooded areas. In Södra Åbyggeby, Varva, Forsby, and in the northern parts of Strömsbro and Stigslund, the majority of the residential places were not inundated during the 100 -year flood calibration, but became flooded during the <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> <b>flood.</b> The southern portions of Strömsbro and Stigslund had lesser flood extents and houses were situated within the boundaries of the highest flood. In Näringen, there were also some areas close to the estuary that were flooded for both events.   With the other calibrations performed, two factors that greatly affect the flood extents in the floodplain, particularly in flatter areas were topographic data and the parameters used as friction coefficient.  The use of high resolution topographic data was important in improving the performance of the software. Nevertheless, it must be emphasised that in areas characterised by gentler slopes that bounded the channel and the floodplain, data completeness became significant whereby both ground data and bathymetric points must be present to avoid overestimation of the inundation extent. The water extents also varied {{with the use of the}} various Manning’s n for the overbanks, with the bigger value showing greater water extents. Else, in areas with steeper slopes and where the water was confined to the banks, the effect was minimal.   Despite these shortcomings of one-dimensional models, HEC-RAS provided good inundation extents that were comparable to the actual extent of the 1977 flooding.   Modelling real floods has its own difficulties due to the unpredictability of real-life flood behaviours, and more especially, there are time dependent factors that are involved.   Although calibrating a flood event will not exactly determine what is to arise as they might either under- or overestimate such flooding occurrences, still, they give a standpoint of what is more or less to anticipate, and from this,  planning measures can be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|A {{regional}} {{climate model}} (RCM) and oceanographic, hydrological and digital elevation models {{were applied to}} study the impact of climate change on surface wind, sea level, river discharge, and flood prone areas in the Baltic Sea region. The RCM was driven by two global models and two emission scenarios. According to the four investigated regional scenario simulations, wind speed in winter is projected to increase between 3 and 19 % as an area average over the Baltic Sea. Although extremes of the wind speed will increase {{about as much as}} the mean wind speed, sea level extremes will increase more than the mean sea level, especially along the eastern Baltic coasts. In these areas projected storm events and global average sea level rise may cause an increased risk for flooding. However, the Swedish east coast will be less affected because mainly the west wind component in winter would increase and because land uplift would compensate for increased sea levels, at least in the northern parts of the Baltic. One of the aims of the downscaling approach was to investigate the future risk of flooding in the Lake Mälaren region including Stockholm city. In Stockholm the 100 -year surge is projected to change between - 51 and 53 cm relative to present mean sea level suggesting that in the city the risk of flooding from the Baltic Sea is relatively small because the critical height of the jetty walls will not be exceeded. Lake Mälaren lies just to the west of Stockholm and flows directly into the Baltic Sea to the east. This study addresses also the question of how the water level in Lake Mälaren may be affected by climate change by incorporating the following three contributing components into an analysis: 1) projected changes to hydrological inflows to Lake Mälaren, 2) changes to downstream water levels in the Baltic Sea, and 3) changes in outflow regulation from the lake. The first component is analyzed using hydrological modeling. The second and third components employ the use of a lake discharge model. An important conclusion is that projected changes to hydrological inflows show a stronger impact on lake levels than projected changes in water level for the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, an identified need for increased outflow capacity from the lake for the present climate does not diminish with projections of future climate change. The tools developed in this work provide valuable inputs to planning for both present and future operations of water level in Lake Mälaren. Based on the oceanographic and hydrological scenario simulations, flood prone areas were analysed in detail for two municipalities, namely Ekerö and Stockholm. The GIS analysis of both municipalities indicates a series of affected areas.

The nine resulting PMF estimations are used to evaluate each combination of methods. The results show that basic methods allow for a rough estimation of the PMF. In cases where a physically plausible and reliable estimation is required, sophisticated PMP and PMF estimation approaches are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Reservoir spillways are {{designed}} to pass extreme flood events without significant damage. For Category A dams in the UK (whereby a breach will endanger lives in a community), designs {{are based on the}} <b>Probable</b> <b>Maximum</b> <b>Flood</b> (PMF) arising from the critical duration <b>Probable</b> <b>Maximum</b> Precipitation (PMP). This may occur in the winter, coupled with snowmelt, or in the summer when more heat for convection is available. This thesis details an analysis of 20 extreme rainfall events which occurred in the UK in the past 15 years and were observed by radar. Storm efficiencies have been determined in a Lagrangian frame of reference for these events and used as input into a storm model to determine the corresponding PMP. Results show that while the peak rainfall rates are somewhat less with the storm model than suggested by the NERC FSR (current UK guidelines), the overall volume of rainfall is slightly greater resulting in differences in the maximum storage requirement of the reservoir...|$|R
