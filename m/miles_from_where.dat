5|$|Despite limited {{information}} about its service routes and construction, the Nathan F. Cobb {{was the subject}} of two separate New York Times articles during its short career. One article reported the wreck the day after it occurred, the other article came from 20 June 1892 and chronicled a disturbance between mates. The Cobb was still in tow only three miles outside Mobile Bay, beginning its route from Mobile, Alabama to New York, when mate Henry Shaffer jumped over board to avoid a beating. Another mate, J. Trott had already used a belaying pin to half kill another seaman on the schooner and Shaffer was fearful for his life. Shaffer began swimming towards a nearby light house and was picked up nearly five <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> he jumped over board. The captain of the towboat reported that Captain Cookson of the Cobb, mentioned incidentally they had lost a crewman. Both Cookson and Trott already had pending charges against them for cruelty and marooning of sailors, stemming from an incident in May 1891 at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana.|$|E

25|$|On April 17, {{although}} the SPC issued a slight risk of storms, a storm system progressed through Texas. The system spawned ten tornadoes through northern Texas, such as Anton, Lubbock and Haslet, {{which is only}} a few <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> a number of tornadoes hit the Friday before, April 13, 2007. The system also created penny to ping-pong ball-sized hail and created dangerous wind speeds. Six tornadoes were confirmed, one EF1 and the others all EF0.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1995, Royal Majesty {{grounded}} on Rose and Crown Shoal about 10 {{miles east}} of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, and about 17 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> the watch officers thought the vessel was. Investigators found that the officers failed to act on visual cues about the vessel's location, over-relying on the automated bridge system. The vessel, with 1,509 persons on board, was en route from St.George’s, Bermuda, to Boston, Massachusetts. There were no deaths or injuries {{as a result of}} this accident. Damage to the vessel and lost revenue, however, were estimated at about $7 million.|$|E

50|$|Ward first {{published}} {{the story as}} a series of 16-page periodicals during 1698-1700, comprising 18 folio editions. They were printed as a collection in book form in 1703 by J. How of Gracechurch Street, London, a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> Ward had his pub (public house).|$|R
25|$|On 6 June 1937, {{a family}} boating on the River Idle in Bawtry spotted {{an object in}} the water, close to the bank. Upon closer inspection, this family {{discovered}} that the object was the partially decomposed body of a child, with the head and upper torso embedded in silt and trapped in a drain below water level. Her body had been weighted down with wood and metal. On {{the banks of the}} river was a torn and rotting sack which had evidently been used to transport the child's body. The location was approximately 30 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> Nodder had lived. The body was moved to an inn at Newington, where the clothing present with the body was identified by Wilfred Tinsley as belonging to his daughter. A subsequent autopsy at the Retford Mortuary confirmed Mona had been strangled—most likely with a ligature—and that she had been dead before entering the water. Due to the extensive period of time the body had been in the river, the extensive adipocere formation upon the corpse prevented the pathologist from being able to determine whether Mona had been sexually assaulted before her murder.|$|E
25|$|D Company landed {{very close}} to their {{objectives}} at 16 minutes past midnight (the first Allied unit to land in France). The soldiers poured out of their battered gliders, completely surprising the German defenders, and taking the bridges within 10 minutes, losing two men – Lieutenant Den Brotheridge and Lance corporal Fred Greenhalgh – in the process. A further two officers and 14 soldiers were wounded during {{the battle for the}} bridges. Lieutenant Den Brotheridge led the first platoon to land at Pegasus Bridge followed one minute later by Lieutenant David Wood's platoon. Lieutenant Dennis Fox led the first platoon to land at Horsa Bridge. The glider carrying Captain Brian Priday and Lieutenant Tony Hooper's platoon, which was assigned to the capture of Horsa Bridge, landed at the bridge over the River Dives, some seven <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> they intended. In spite of this, the occupants of the glider captured the River Dives bridge, advanced through the German lines towards the village of Ranville where they eventually rejoined the British forces. The Ox and Bucks platoons holding the bridges were relieved by the 7th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment at 03:00hours. The Germans attempted to re-capture the bridges, but were repulsed. Later in the day, at about 13:00hrs, Lord Lovat and elements of the Commandos of his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived to relieve the exhausted defenders, followed by the 3rd British Infantry Division. The operation was immortalised in the film The Longest Day.|$|E
500|$|Hundreds of NYPD officers, U.S. marshals, and Pennsylvania State Troopers were {{involved}} in the manhunt, using helicopters and four police dogs to assist with the search. By July 11, 2007, the bounty for information leading to the whereabouts of Bostic and Ellis reached $64,000, with the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association proposing an additional $25,000. The driver initially dropped off Bostic and Ellis about 14 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> Bostic was finally arrested in Pocono Township, Pennsylvania.|$|E

500|$|His orchestral piece Reservoirs was {{inspired}} by a 1968 poem by R. S. Thomas about the drowning of Welsh valleys such as Tryweryn (a few <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> Puw grew up) and Clywedog to provide water for England. Puw had a particular affinity with the topic as his grandfather lost farmland in the Tryweryn flooding. Nevertheless, he has said that he [...] "decided not to take the poem too literally because as a composer you can be subject to criticism for doing that." [...] It was nominated in 2005 in the Large-Scale Composition category of the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards. The music was used in a BBC2 Wales documentary, [...] "Drowning a Village", broadcast on 9 March 2006. A performance by BBC NOW was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 as part of the 2005 Vale of Glamorgan Festival.|$|E
500|$|The Americans {{captured}} {{more than}} 36,000 Germans, and evacuated 2,000 wounded, far exceeding {{the estimate of}} 10,000 Germans given to Middleton by Patton before the operation. [...] Ramcke was captured by troops of the 8th Division, and asked the deputy division commander for his credentials. The American general pointed to the M-1 rifles being carried by his soldiers and told Ramcke that those were his credentials. Ramcke appeared at his formal surrender clean shaven and with a well-groomed Irish setter. With plenty of reporters and photographers documenting the occasion, Ramcke commented in English that {{he felt like a}} film star. He was soon sent to a prisoner of war camp in Clinton, Mississippi, not more than 50 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> Middleton was born and raised. After the war he spent time in a prison camp in England, and then was sent to France where he was tried and soon released following five total years of incarceration. He went back to Germany and entered the concrete business, continuing a correspondence with Middleton for 15 years following the war.|$|E

2500|$|During the First World War, Allenby {{initially}} {{served on}} the Western Front. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, a British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to France. It consisted of four infantry divisions and one cavalry division, the latter commanded by Allenby. The cavalry division first saw action in semi-chaotic circumstances covering the retreat after the Battle of Mons opposing the German Army's invasion of France. One of Allenby's subordinates claimed at the time: [...] "He cannot explain verbally, with any lucidity at all, what his plans are". When a headquarters officer asked why a cavalry brigade was <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>where</b> {{it was supposed to}} be, he received the reply: [...] "He told me he was getting as far away from the Bull as possible. It was a most scandalous affair, and he was in almost open rebellion against Allenby at the time".
