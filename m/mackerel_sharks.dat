5|$|Lamniformes: They are {{commonly}} known as the <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks.</b> They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.|$|E
5|$|Like other <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks,</b> common {{threshers}} are aplacental viviparous. They {{give birth}} to litters of two to four (rarely six) pups in the eastern Pacific, and three to seven pups in the eastern Atlantic. They are believed to reproduce throughout their range; one known nursery area is the Southern California Bight. Breeding occurs in the summer, usually July or August, and parturition occurs from March to June following a gestation period of nine months. The developing embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs ovulated by the mother. The teeth of small embryos are peg-like and non-functional, being covered by a sheath of soft tissues. As the embryos mature, their series of teeth become progressively more like those of adults in shape, though they remain depressed and hidden until shortly before birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are {{approximately}} the same size {{which is similar to}} some <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks.</b> A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.|$|E

5|$|Mating in the tawny {{nurse shark}} is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one {{functional}} ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity, meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non-viable egg capsules, {{which has led to}} erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg capsules of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The {{tawny nurse shark}} is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos. Unlike in <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks,</b> the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
25|$|Irrespective of {{the cause}} of their {{ultimate}} extinction, during the long time of their existence the pseudotooth birds furnished prey for large predators themselves. Few if any birds that coexisted with them were large enough to harm them while airborne; {{as evidenced by the}} Early Eocene Limnofregata, the frigatebirds coevolved with the Pelagornithidae and may well have harassed any of the small species for food on occasion, as they today harass albatrosses. From the Middle Miocene or Early Pliocene of the Lee Creek Mine, some remains of pseudotooth birds which probably fell victim to sharks while feeding are known. The large members of the abundant Lee Creek Mine shark fauna that hunted near the water's surface included the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), Carcharias sand tiger sharks, Isurus and Cosmopolitodus mako sharks, Carcharodon white sharks, the snaggletooth shark Hemipristis serra, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo), Carcharhinus whaler sharks, the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) and hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and perhaps (depending on the bird fossils' age) also Pristis sawfishes, Odontaspis sand tiger sharks, and Lamna and Parotodus benedeni <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks.</b> It is notable that fossils of smaller diving birds – for example auks, loons and cormorants – {{as well as those of}} albatrosses are much more commonly found in those shark pellets than pseudotooth birds, supporting the assumption that the latter had quite low population densities and caught much of their food in mid-flight.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about goblin shark {{reproduction}} because a pregnant female {{has yet to be}} found and studied. It likely shares the reproductive characteristics of other <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks,</b> which are viviparous with small litter sizes and embryos that grow during gestation by eating undeveloped eggs (oophagy). The birth size is probably close to , the length of the smallest known specimen. Males mature sexually at about [...] long, while female maturation size is unknown. No data is available on growth and aging.|$|E
50|$|The {{crocodile}} shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) is {{a species of}} <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> and the only extant {{member of the family}} Pseudocarchariidae. A specialized inhabitant of the mesopelagic zone, the {{crocodile shark}} can be found worldwide in tropical waters from the surface to a depth of 590 m. It performs a diel vertical migration, staying below a depth of 200 m during the day and ascending into shallower water at night to feed. Typically measuring only 1 m in length, the crocodile shark is the smallest living <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark.</b> It can be distinguished by its elongated cigar-shaped body, extremely large eyes, and relatively small fins.|$|R

5000|$|Otodus is an extinct genus of <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> which lived {{from the}} Paleocene to the Miocene epoch, The name Otodus comes from Greek ὠτ (oûs [...] "ear") and ὀδούς, [...] "odous (tooth)", or [...] "ear-shaped tooth".|$|R
500|$|One {{account of}} a bigeye sand tiger that had been caught alive noted that it behaved very aggressively, {{thrashing}} and snapping violently {{in and out of}} the water. Its large eyes and uniformly dark coloration are characteristic traits of a mesopelagic fish. The bigeye sand tiger feeds on bony fishes and squid. Its reproduction is little-known but probably similar to that of other <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks,</b> which are viviparous with embryos that feed on unfertilized eggs during gestation (oophagy). Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. Males mature sexually at somewhere between [...] long, while females mature at around [...] long.

500|$|Phylogenetic studies {{based on}} {{morphology}} have generally placed the goblin shark {{as the most}} basal member of the order Lamniformes, known as <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks.</b> Studies using genetic data have also supported a basal position for this species. The family Mitsukurinidae, represented by Mitsukurina, Scapanorhynchus, and Anomotodon, {{dates back to the}} Aptian age of the Cretaceous period (c. 125–113 Ma). Mitsukurina itself first appears in the fossil record during the Middle Eocene (c. 49–37 Ma); extinct species include M. lineata and M. maslinensis. Striatolamia macrota, which lived in warm shallow waters during the Paleogene (c. 66–23 Ma), may also be a Mitsukurina species. As the last member of an ancient lineage, and one that retains several [...] "primitive" [...] traits, the goblin shark {{has been described as a}} [...] "living fossil".|$|E
500|$|As {{in other}} <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks,</b> the longfin mako is aplacental {{viviparous}} and typically {{gives birth to}} two pups at a time (one inside each uterus), though a 3.3-m-long female pregnant with eight well-developed embryos {{was caught in the}} Mona Passage near Puerto Rico in January 1983. The developing embryos are oophagous; once they deplete their supply of yolk, they sustain themselves by consuming large quantities of nonviable eggs ovulated by their mother. No evidence of sibling cannibalism is seen as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). The pups measure [...] long at birth, relatively larger than the young of the shortfin mako, and have proportionally longer heads and pectoral fins than the adults. Capture records off Florida suggest that during the winter, females swim into shallow coastal waters to give birth. Male and female sharks reach sexual maturity at lengths around [...] and , respectively.|$|E
50|$|Mitsukurina is a genus of <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> in {{the family}} Mitsukurinidae. It {{contains}} one extant species, the goblin shark (M. owstoni) and more extinct species. The genus was described by American ichthyologist David Starr Jordan in 1898.|$|R
50|$|The {{shortfin mako}} shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), {{also known as the}} blue pointer or bonito shark, is a large <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark.</b> It is {{commonly}} referred to as the mako shark, as is the longfin mako shark (Isurus paucus). The shortfin mako is on record as the fastest-swimming shark, capable of bursts of speed up to 18.8 m/s.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{fishing was}} {{second only to}} farming as an {{economic}} activity in pre-oil Oman. Both the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea {{offer a variety of}} catch, including sardines, bluefish, <b>mackerel,</b> <b>shark,</b> tuna, abalone, lobsters, and oysters. Fishermen harvest their catch in the waters near the coast, using the traditional, small seagoing canoe, to which an outboard motor has been added.|$|R
500|$|The {{biology of}} the longfin mako is little-known; it is {{somewhat}} common in the western Atlantic and possibly the central Pacific, while in the eastern Atlantic, it is rare and outnumbered over 1000-fold by the shortfin mako in fishery landings. The longfin mako's slender body and long, broad pectoral fins evoke the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and the blue shark (Prionace glauca), both slow-cruising sharks of upper oceanic waters. This morphological similarity suggests that the longfin mako is less active than the shortfin mako, {{one of the fastest}} and most energetic sharks. Like the other members of its family, this species possesses blood vessel countercurrent exchange systems called the rete mirabilia (Latin for [...] "wonderful net", singular rete mirabile) in its trunk musculature and around its eyes and brain. This system enables other <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> to conserve metabolic heat and maintain a higher body temperature than their environments, though whether the longfin mako is capable of the same is uncertain.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the false}} catshark, the slender smooth-hound {{exhibits}} aplacental viviparity with oophagy, {{in a form}} different from that in the <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks.</b> Mature females have a single functional ovary, on the right side, and two functional uteruses. Only one embryo develops within each uterus at a time, resulting in litters of two (rarely one) pups. The uterus inner surface is covered by [...] Within a uterus, 30–80 ova [...] across are packed into a single rigid, amber-colored capsule; of these, only one ovum is fertilized and develops into an embryo, while the remaining ova begin to break down.
