In addition to the state television channel, a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout Madagascar. Several media outlets are owned by political partisans or politicians themselves, including the media groups MBS (owned by Ravalomanana) and Viva (owned by Rajoelina), contributing to political polarization in reporting.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{returned}} to work a week later, on , 2015. She said that, while she would not interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage licenses, she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality. Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on {{the validity of the}} licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the <b>means</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> marriage licenses were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating the altered forms were likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order.|$|E

5|$|The Lemon {{test has}} been criticized by justices and legal scholars, but it remains the {{predominant}} <b>means</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Court enforces the Establishment Clause. In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the entanglement prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining {{the effect of the}} challenged statute or practice. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test. Further tests, such as the endorsement test and coercion test, have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E
5|$|Finance chair Walter M. Gibson, {{supported}} by Minister of the Interior Samuel G. Wilder, pushed a new currency law through the 1880 legislature. It allowed the kingdom to purchase {{gold and silver}} bullion to be struck into new Hawaiian coins. Having the kingdom issue its own coins was one <b>means</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> government hoped to improve Native Hawaiian morale, as their numbers and their influence had both been declining over the previous few decades. The king became more interested in coinage bearing his likeness during his world tour of 1881. During this journey, he was contacted by {{the owner of a}} New Caledonia nickel mining company hoping to use the metal in coinage, and sample five-cent pieces were sent to the king after his return to Honolulu. They found little favor, possibly because Hawaii's motto was misspelled. No action was taken until 1882, when the king appointed Gibson to lead the government. He moved forward with the coin idea; the currency was to have the king's image on the obverse side, and Hawaii's coat of arms and motto Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono (The Life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness) on the reverse. The 1880 law specified that the silver coins were to be in denominations of one dollar, fifty cents, twenty-five cents, and twelve and one-half cents. Twelve and one-half cents, or one bit (one Spanish colonial real) was sometimes the day's pay for a laborer.|$|E

40|$|Apple fruit texture {{is a key}} quality trait {{orienting}} consumer {{choice and}} agro-industrial processes. Among the several factors at different scales involved in texture, cell walls and their constitutive hemicelluloses are determinant in controlling the mechanical properties of the cells and tissues. In this report, the dynamic of cell wall composition and hemicelluloses fine structure during fruit development and ripening was studied from different apple genotypes collected over 2 years. Typical loss of cell wall galactose was observed along apple expansion and ripening. The combination of cell wall enzymatic hydrolysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed important hemicelluloses modifications along the fruit construction and maturation affecting both xyloglucan and the manor amount of glucomannans. Similar modifications were observed for individuals collected over the two years.

40|$|In {{this text}} the {{construction}} of national identity has been analyzed through the example of national tourism strategy in Serbia framed within the contemporary state's process of 'branding' the nation.

The analysis shows that, rather than negative connotations that 'follow' the notion of balkanism, tourist reformulation leads to changed, but still ambiguous and undefined representation. In this text I point out to the aspect of branding - as marketing process which uses cultural recourses - that leads to pacification of the image.
