5000|$|In 1820, five {{different}} religious congregations united to organize {{construction of a}} church building in Winterport. This building was completed in 1831 as the culmination of this effort. It was designed and built by Calvin Ryder, a prominent local builder and designer. Due to squabbling between the denominations, the building was soon given over to the Congregationalists. The clock was added in 1860, and the interior underwent remodeling at that time. The church has seen only <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> and <b>repairs</b> since then. [...] Since 1976 it has been owned and maintained by a local non-profit organization.|$|R
50|$|In November 2008, Ofcom found Phones 4u {{guilty of}} {{misleading}} customers over network coverage, failing to swiftly provide refunds for faulty handsets and offering unfair terms on chequeback schemes. Phones 4u {{responded with a}} series of undertakings to prevent recurrences. The company said 80% of complaints were due to problems in its repair business, rather than sales, which the company {{was in the process of}} resolving. After six months of scrutiny, the Ofcom investigation resulted in <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> to terms and conditions. Phones 4u subsequently <b>changed</b> its <b>repair</b> provider.|$|R

40|$|We {{give the}} {{governing}} equations for multiple scalar fields {{in a flat}} Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background spacetime on all scales, allowing for metric and field perturbations up to second order. We then derive the Klein-Gordon equation at second order in closed form in terms of gauge-invariant perturbations of the fields in the uniform curvature gauge. We also give a simplified form of the Klein-Gordon equation using the slow-roll approximation.
