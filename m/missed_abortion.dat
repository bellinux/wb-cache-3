With emerging evidence supporting the pivotal role of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and IL- 8 in the immunopathogenesis of CT-specific tubal obstruction, we determined anti-CT Hsp 60 antibody reactivity and serum concentrations of IL- 1 beta and IL- 8 in failed pregnancies consisting of 30 consecutive ectopic pregnancies and 30 <b>missed</b> <b>abortions,</b> with 32 viable intrauterine pregnancies tested as normal controls. ELISAs were utilised to measure IgA or IgG anti-CT major outer membrane outer protein (MOMP) antibodies, IgG anti-CT Hsp 60 antibodies and IL- 1 beta and IL- 8. IgG anti-CT Hsp 60 antibodies were more prevalent in ectopic pregnancy cases (43. 3 %, 13 / 30) than in intrauterine pregnancies (16 %, 5 / 32, p = 0. 016). All 13 ectopic pregnancy anti-CT Hsp 60 -positive cases had anti-CT MOMP antibodies. CT-specific antibodies were more frequent in merged ectopic pregnancy and <b>missed</b> <b>abortions</b> cases (35 %, 21 / 60) than in intrauterine pregnancies (16 %, p = 0. 049). The median (range) levels of IL- 1 beta in ectopic pregnancy, <b>missed</b> <b>abortions</b> and normal intrauterine pregnancies were 1. 74 (0. 2 - 8. 7), 1. 14 (0. 2 - 16) and 1. 22 (0. 2 - 16. 2) pg/ml, respectively (p > 0. 05, for all). Serum IL- 8 levels were comparable amongst groups: ectopic pregnancy (median [range]: 25. 1 [18. 3 - 1000]); <b>missed</b> <b>abortions</b> (32. 9 [15. 39 - 1000]); and intrauterine pregnancies (25. 11 [18. 3 - 1000] pg/ml). Anti-CT antibody-positive ectopic pregnancy had significantly lower IL- 1 beta levels (1. 29 [0. 2 - 2. 93]) pg/ml than sero-negative ectopic pregnancy cases (2. 09 [1. 10 - 8. 70]) pg/ml, (p = 0. 022), but IL- 8 did not differ. Our data demonstrate that anti-CT Hsp 60 immunity is a predominant feature of ectopic pregnancy. We conclude that neither IL- 1 beta nor IL- 8 can be considered markers of failed pregnancy, although lower levels of the former cytokine are associated with CT-related ectopic pregnancy.

40|$|Coelomic {{fluid and}} {{maternal}} serum {{samples were collected}} from 43 normal pregnancies and 18 <b>missed</b> <b>abortions</b> between 7 and 12 weeks of gestation. The samples were analysed for the concentrations of intact human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), free αHCG, free βHCG and total protein. The relationships between the biological findings and the ultrasound and pathological features were assessed by regression analysis. In normal pregnancies, intact HCG, free αHCG and free βHCG concentrations were respectively 1. 3, 185 and 33 times higher in coelomic fluid than in maternal serum. The coelomic concentrations of intact HCG and free αHCG decreased significantly with advancing gestation. No relationship was found between coelomic fluid and maternal serum concentrations of the different variables. These findings suggest that in normal pregnancies, the concentration of HCG in the coelomic fluid, as in maternal serum, is mainly influenced by cytotrophoblastic differentiation and that the metabolic clearance of HCG molecules is slower in the coelomic cavity than in maternal serum. In <b>missed</b> <b>abortions,</b> the serum concentrations of intact HCG, αHCG and free βHCG and the coelomic concentration of total protein were significantly lower than in normal pregnancies. In three out of nine anembryonic pregnancies diagnosed by ultrasound, embryonic remnants were present at histological examination. The coelomic concentration of total protein was extremely low in all <b>missed</b> <b>abortions</b> with advanced trophoblastic necrosis, whereas the HCG concentration was low when embryonic remnants were absent. These findings support the concept that embryonic and placental development are closely related in the first trimester of human pregnancy, placental biological functions persisting only for a limited period of time after embryonic demise. © 1995 Oxford University Press.

5000|$|A {{complete}} miscarriage is {{when all}} products of conception have been expelled; {{these may include}} the trophoblast, chorionic villi, gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetal pole (embryo); or later in pregnancy the fetus, umbilical cord, placenta, amniotic fluid, and amniotic membrane. The presence of a pregnancy test that is still positive {{as well as an}} empty uterus upon transvaginal ultrasonography does, however, fulfill the definition of pregnancy of unknown location. Therefore, there may be a need for e.g. follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including an ectopic pregnancy. [...] An incomplete miscarriage occurs when some products of conception have been passed, but some remains inside the uterus. However, an increased distance between the uterine walls on transvaginal ultrasonography may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness and/or a polyp. The use of a Doppler ultrasound may be better in confirming the presence of significant retained products of conception in the uterine cavity.

40|$|Abstract Trophoblast {{dysfunction}} is a {{major factor}} in defect placentation, which is thought to be an important etiology of abortions. Homeobox genes are transcription factors that regulate the transcription of other genes. They encode highly conserved DNA-binding domains (homeodomains) that regulate proliferation, differentiation and migration, important for pattern formation and organogenesis during embryogenesis in the development of multicellular organisms. Homeobox genes have also been shown to control normal development of the placenta. They are thought {{to play an important role}} in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation. Chloride channels are important in many cellular processes like electrolyte transport, pH regulation, water balance, cell potensials and apoptosis. Little is known about their involvement in trophoblasts and placentation. Our thesis consists of a literature review related to placenta, placentation, trophoblasts, homeobox genes, ion channel proteins and abortion. It also comprises a pilot study testing our hypothesis: that spontaneous/missed abortions and hydatiform mole are consequences of defect trophoblast function and signalling of homeobox genes in trophoblasts in the placental bed. We also studied the expression of an intracellular ion channel gene called CLIC 3. The pilot study was performed on a diagnostic material from first trimester abortions, partly in Oslo and partly at the Pregnancy Research Centre at the University of Melbourne. Material: Tissue micro arrays (TMAs) from the placental bed in normal (therapeutic abortions) and abnormal (spontaneous and <b>missed</b> <b>abortions</b> and moles) first trimester pregnancies. Methods: Immunohistochemical study of expression of the homeobox genes TGIF and HEX and the intracellular ion channel CLIC 3. Results: There was a reduction in the expression of Homeobox genes TGIF and HEX and of the ion channel protein CLIC 3 in the extravillous trophoblasts in the placental bed in the clinical abortions as compared to the normal controls (therapeutic abortions). The reduced expression was most markedly for HEX in <b>missed</b> <b>abortions.</b> The findings might indicate a defect trophoblast function in clinical first trimester abortions. The staining pattern in the positive cells varied, especially in the homeobox immunostainings. Further studies are needed...|$|R

Embryofetoscopy can additionally permit access to the embryonic circulatory system for early fetal blood sampling.

Materials and Methods: After exclusion of direct causes of <b>missed</b> <b>abortion,</b> this study included 60 women (the study group) who had first trimestric <b>missed</b> <b>abortion</b> and 30 healthy women who did not suffer from any diseases during their pregnancy and had apparently normal outcome (the control group). All cases were diagnosed; the blood and tissue samples were collected from the mothers and abortuses from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Maternity Hospital, Ain Shams University. Cytogenetic analyses were performed by using conventional technique and G/T banding techniques and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis with a whole chromosome 7 painting probe (WCP 7) and a 7 q subterminal probe (7 q 36, qter), prepared b...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{case-control study}} to {{evaluate}} whether a single serum measurement of angiopoietin- 1 (ANG- 1) and angiopoietin- 2 (ANG- 2) at 6 - 8 weeks gestation can differentiate failed pregnancies, whether ectopic pregnancies (EP) or <b>missed</b> <b>abortions</b> (MA), from healthy intrauterine pregnancies (IUP). Intervention(s) : Serum and tissue mRNA determination of ANG- 1 and ANG- 2 levels by ELISA and RTPCR, from 60 (30 EP and 30 MA) patients with failed early pregnancy and 33 IUPs. Results: ANG- 1 and ANG- 2 concentrations and their ratio are lower in EP (median, 689 and 302 pg/ml, respectively) and MA cases (median, 810 and 402 pg/ml, respectively) compared to IUP (median, 963 and 1477 pg/ml, respectively) (p< 0. 05, for all). Unlike ANG- 2, serum ANG- 1 discriminates an EP from a MA (p = 0. 011). Trophoblastic ANG- 1 mRNA expression levels are lower in EP compared to MA and IUP (p< 0. 05), while ANG- 2 mRNA is higher in EP and MA than in IUP (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: A single measurement of serum ANG- 1 and ANG- 2 at 6 - 8 weeks of gestation designate {{the outcome of a}} pregnancy, as their levels are significantly decreased in failed than normal pregnancies. Serum ANG- 1 showed potential to discriminate MA from EP. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This {{pilot study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of intrauterine infusion of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in infertile women undergoing frozen embryo transfer cycles with suboptimal endometrium. Material and Methods: Intrauterine instillation of autologous PRP was done in 68 women between 22 and 40 years, over 8 months, with suboptimal endometrial growth, and patients with repeated cycle cancellations, in addition to Estradiol valerate. Frozen embryo transfer was performed when the endometrium reached an optimal pattern in terms of thickness, appearance, and vascularity. Results: The mean pre-PRP endometrial thickness (ET) was 5 [*]mm which significantly increased to 7. 22 [*]mm post-PRP. There was a significant increase in vascularity, seen by the number of vascular signals seen on Power Doppler, reaching the zones 3 and 4 of the endometrium. The positive beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) rate was 60. 93 % and the clinical pregnancy rate was 45. 31 %. A total of 13 women are in the second trimester, 13 are in the first trimester with a healthy intrauterine pregnancy, one patient had an ectopic gestation, three had blighted ova, two had <b>missed</b> <b>abortions,</b> and two biochemical pregnancies. Conclusion: This study suggests that the use of autologous PRP holds promise in the treatment of women with suboptimal ET and vascularity for embryo transfer. It would help to reduce the incidence of cycle cancellations and thus even help reduce the financial and psychological burden of repeated cancelled cycles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Parallel Data {{processing}} {{has emerged}} {{to be one}} of the killer applications for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds. One of an IaaS cloud’s key feature is the provisioning of compute resources on demand. The computer resources available in the cloud are highly dynamic and possibly heterogeneous. Nephele is the first data processing framework to explicitly exploit the dynamic resource allocation offered by today’s IaaS clouds for both, task scheduling and execution. Particular tasks of a processing job can be assigned to different types of virtual machines which are automatically instantiated and terminated during the job execution. However, Nephele is not considering resource overload or underutilization during the job execution. In this paper, a novel utility accrual scheduling algorithm is proposed for scheduling the real-time cloud computing services. The most unique characteristics of this approach is that, different from traditional utility accrual approach that works under one single Time Utility Function (TUF), which have two different TUF’s, a profit TUF and a penalty TUF – associated with each task at the same time, to model the real-time applications for cloud computing, that need not only to reward the early completions and also to penalize the <b>missing</b> <b>abortions</b> or deadline <b>misses</b> of realtime tasks. To improve the performance of cloud computing, the traditional Utility Accrual (UA) approach is deployed in both Non-Preemptive and Preemptive scheduling. The experimental results shows that the proposed algorithm can outperform the existing Nephele framework and also compare the performance between Non-Preemptive and Preemptive schedulin...|$|R
