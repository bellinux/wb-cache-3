40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedRecent reports cite that military Food Stamp Program beneficiaries may range from 6, 400 to 20, 000. The need {{for food stamps}} {{has been attributed to}} several factors, one of which is the perceived military "pay gap". Although, significant strides have been made in recent years to improve quality of life for our service men and women and their families, the military pay system tends to lag behind the civilian employment cost growth index. Despite the strong economy that we currently enjoy, many of our service personnel are struggling to make ends meet. The analysis compared the costs associated with providing eligible personnel with food stamps to the cost of providing a Special <b>Subsistence</b> <b>Allowance</b> in lieu of food stamps. On the surface, the Federal Government may realize approximately $ 7, 862, 400 savings if the additional subsistence is set at $ 180 per beneficiary per month, as posed in Senate legislation. Despite such savings, the Department of Defense is constrained by its compensation system, which uses promotion and pay increases to encourage advancement and longevity as a basis for compensation. The Special <b>Subsistence</b> <b>Allowance</b> in lieu of food stamps could also have devastating financial effects for some while providing a cash bonus for others. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

5000|$|On 4 January 2013 the {{association}} Democracia Real Ya (DRY), created after the 15 May 2011 protest movement, brought charges against Mariano Rajoy and another 62 deputies (including four ministers) before the Supreme Court, {{accusing them of}} diversion of public funds and misappropriation. Mariano Rajoy was accused of receiving a <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowance</b> {{despite the fact that}} he was living in the Moncloa Palace in Madrid. The lawsuit before the Supreme Court was a consequence of the data which had appeared in the media providing information about several deputies who had houses in Madrid but at the same time were receiving extra funds for lodging. According to {{the association}} DRY, these representatives, who could be lodged at no cost to the public purse, were paid a monthly <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowance</b> valued at 1,823.36 euros. Furthermore, if they had been elected by the constituency of Madrid and had a house in this city, they were allowed 870 euros per month to cover accommodation and food expenses resulting from the exercise of their functions that, with respect to Rajoy, were already covered - from the state budget - in the Moncloa Palace. DRY therefore accused them of diversion of public funds and misappropriation. Additionally, DRY demanded that they return all the money that didn't belong to them, particularly bearing in mind that [...] "the cuts are making most Spaniards' life a misery".|$|R

40|$|This paper, {{using data}} from a quasi-random control {{experiment}} on BRAC’s “Targeting the Ultra Poor” program in Bangladesh, investigates whether a one-off large grant to the extreme poor enables {{them to participate in}} the regular microfinance program that typically excludes them.

Some eligible extreme poor who did not receive assets for reasons unrelated to the ones that can lead to self-selection bias are treated as the control group. The results for 2002 baseline and 2005 repeat survey data show that such a big push has indeed significant impact on graduation to the regular microfinance program.
