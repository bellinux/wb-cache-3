5|$|Chamberlin was a {{prolific}} taxonomist of invertebrate animals who named and described over 4,000 species, {{specializing in the}} study of arachnids (spiders, scorpions, and their relatives), and myriapods (millipedes, centipedes, and relatives), but also publishing on molluscs, <b>marine</b> <b>worms,</b> and insects. By 1941 he had described at least 2,000 species, and by 1957 had described a total of 4,225 new species, 742 new genera, 28 new families, and 12 orders. Chamberlin's taxonomic publications continued to appear until at least 1966.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid <b>marine</b> <b>worms)</b> oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, <b>marine</b> <b>worms,</b> or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E

25|$|In 1896 it was {{discovered}} that the pier needed urgent remedial works, <b>marine</b> <b>worms</b> having infested the wooden piles. Extensive works were undertaken only for the pier to be damaged again, this time by a heavy storm on 28 November 1896. Further repairs were necessary and the service to Victoria Port became intermittent, closing in the winter months with trains terminating at Sharnal Halt. In 1901 the wooden piles of the pier were encased in concrete in an attempt to prevent further infestation, but problems continued after the area around the pier was dredged, thereby exposing the uncased parts of the piers to investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} school whiting (also {{known as}} the silver whiting or trawl whiting) is a common smelt whiting that inhabits the south and south-west coasts of Australia, and {{is closely related to}} the eastern school whiting. It is commonly caught by recreational fishermen, often while fishing for related species, especially the sought after King George whiting. Southern school whiting are taken on a variety of baits, with their natural prey such as <b>marine</b> <b>worms,</b> molluscs, prawns and sardines often used. Due to their schooling nature, many fish can be caught in a single fishing period, although most authorities ask for excess fish to be returned to the water alive. In Western Australia, southern school whiting and yellowfin whiting have a combined bag limit of 40 per person with no size restrictions, with no regulations applying elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Located {{north of}} Orchard Beach, the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary {{encompasses}} all of Twin Islands, Cat Briar Island, Two Trees Island, and the northeastern shoreline of Hunter Island. It contains many glacial erratics, large boulders that were deposited {{during the last}} ice age. The rocky coast of Twin Islands contains the southernmost outcropping of Hartland Schist, the major bedrock component of New England coastlines, as well as granite with migmatite dikes as well as veins made of quartz. The sanctuary supports a unique intertidal marine ecosystem that is rare in New York State. It holds the largest continuous oak forest in Pelham Bay Park, including white, red, and black oak, as well as black cherry, white pines, Norway spruce, and black locust trees. One can also find grape hyacinth, periwinkle, daylily, and Tartarian honeysuckle, which {{were part of the}} Hunter Mansion's garden. Member species of the islands' salt marsh ecosystem include egrets, cormorants, fiddler crabs, horseshoe crabs, and <b>marine</b> <b>worms.</b>|$|E

25|$|Medicine Rocks {{is part of}} the Fort Union Formation, a {{geologic}} unit containing coal, sandstone, and shale in Montana, Wyoming, and other adjacent states. About 61 million years ago, near the start of the Paleocene Epoch and during the late Zuñi sequence, a freshwater river crossed what is now eastern Montana, flowing southeast into a prehistoric sea whose boundary was near far northwestern South Dakota (possibly the remains of the Western Interior Seaway). This river deposited large amounts of very fine-grained sand, which compacted into sandstone. On top of the freshwater sandstone was sand laid down by a saltwater estuary (indicated by the presence in this greyish layer of sandstone of burrows created by <b>marine</b> <b>worms).</b> Numerous fossils dating back 63.3 million years (to the Torrejonian North American Stage) {{can be found at the}} site, which help date the sandstone. These include several fossil snakes as well as teeth belonging to Plesiadapis anceps (an early primate-like mammal). The fossil remains of the primitive mammal Baiotomeus were discovered here in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Marine {{gastropods}} in the predatory superfamily Conoidea, (known as the toxoglossans, meaning [...] "poison tongue") use {{a poison}} dart or harpoon, {{which is a}} single modified radula tooth which is created inside {{the mouth of the}} snail, and which is primarily made of chitin. These snails are carnivorous hunters: the harpoon is used in predation. When the snail is close to its prey, it extends its proboscis a considerable distance; then it fires its harpoon and injects a toxin into the prey. For most species of toxoglossans the prey is <b>marine</b> <b>worms,</b> {{but in the case of}} some larger cone snails, the prey is small fish.|$|E

Large catches are possible, with rigs kept as light as possible to avoid spooking the fish.

2500|$|Many {{instances}} of endosymbiosis are obligate; that is, either the endosymbiont or the host cannot survive without the other, {{such as the}} gutless <b>marine</b> <b>worms</b> of the genus Riftia, which get nutrition from their endosymbiotic bacteria. [...] The most common examples of obligate endosymbioses are mitochondria and chloroplasts. Some human parasites, e.g. Wuchereria bancrofti and Mansonella perstans, thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an obligate endosymbiosis with Wolbachia spp. They can both be eliminated from said hosts by treatments that target this bacterium. However, not all endosymbioses are obligate. [...] Also, some endosymbioses can be harmful to either of the organisms involved.|$|E
2500|$|When Europeans first settled Eastern North America, semianadromous or sea-run brook trout, {{commonly}} called [...] "salters", ranged from southern New Jersey, north throughout the Canadian maritime provinces, and west to Hudson Bay. Salters may {{spend up to}} three months at sea feeding on crustaceans, fish, and <b>marine</b> <b>worms</b> in the spring, not straying {{more than a few}} miles from the river mouth. [...] The fish return to freshwater tributaries to spawn in the late summer or autumn. While in salt water, salters gain a more silvery color, losing much of the distinctive markings seen in freshwater. [...] However, within two weeks of returning to fresh water, they assume typical brook trout color and markings.|$|E
