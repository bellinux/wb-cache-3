40|$|Objective: An animal trial, its {{protocol}} {{approved by}} the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the U. P. National Institutes of Health (IACUC Protocol No. 2010 - 008), was employed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on the degree and rate of orthodontic tooth movement in guinea pigs. Materials and Methods: Eighteen male adult guinea pigs were randomly allocated into 3 groups: low dose, high dose, and control groups. A 0. 016 " titanium molybdenum alloy wire formed into a helical torsion spring with a coil, with the loops cemented onto the maxillary incisors of the animals, served as the orthodontic appliance. Daily oral administration of resveratrol was provided to the low dose (0. 047 mg/kg) and high dose (0. 47 mg/kg) groups, while water was provided to the control group. Measurements were taken everyday at the interproximal area {{at the level of}} the incisal edge using a <b>measuring</b> <b>caliper.</b> Results: The results of the ANOVA showed no statistically significant differences in the mean measurements of tooth separation among the three groups from day 2 (P= 0. 966) to day 8 (P= 0. 056). However, starting from day 9 (P= 0. 049) until day 18 (P= 0. 000), there was a significant difference in the mean tooth separation among the test groups. Conclusion: Using the LSD, it was noted that the low dose and the high dose groups have similar degrees of mean tooth separation, with the control group being significantly different from the two...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{fruit and}} shade tree nurseries, {{there is a}} need to count and <b>measure</b> <b>caliper</b> for trees {{frequently}} so as to have an accurate inventory sufficiently before harvest since disease, pests and climate can change the yield from year to year. In some tree nurseries it is common practice to count the entire stock three times a year and to caliper them once a year. Both tasks are very labor intensive, involving crews of workers counting trees by hand over several weeks. Experience indicates that calipering and counting millions of trees manually can be error prone. There is a strong need to automate these tasks in the tree nursery industry to decrease labor cost and to improve inventory management. We have developed a device to count trees and to <b>measure</b> <b>caliper</b> while the trees are in the field. The device is designed to be mounted on a carrier passing through rows of trees in a nursery. Tedious tasks are reduced to a simple drive through that could be done simultaneously with tasks such as spraying or mowing. Here we describe the device and results from tests conducted in nurseries in Pennsylvania in 2010. Our experiments show that it is reasonable to expect an accuracy of approximately ± 1 mm indoors and ± 2. 5 mm outdoors...|$|R

On the dial inching bar with the accuracy of 0, 10 mm by using the standard JIS B 7507 - 1993 method. As a result of analysis, the uncertainty value of the measuring instrument from dial caliper I at a rate of trust 95 % with a coverage factor of k = 2 is U 95 = ± 9. 50. The uncertainty value of the dial caliper II at a rate of trust 95 % with the coverage factor k = 2 is U 95 = ± 9, 50. The uncertainty value of the dial caliper III at a rate of trust 95 % with the coverage factor k = 2 is U 95 = ± 9, 50. Measurement error / deviation measuring clock caliper (dial calliper) I and II with the measuring block measuring 150 mm is 0. 00007 mm.

MÉTODO: estudo {{longitudinal}} prospectivo, em 20 sujeitos com idade entre 07 e 70 anos, sendo 13 do genero feminino e 07 masculino, com diagnóstico de paralisia facial periférica de Bell, atendidos no Ambulatório de Paralisia Facial, da disciplina de otorrinolaringologia de um Hospital Público Universitário. Neste estudo foi adotado o uso de um medidor paquímetro digital da marca Digimess 100. 174 BL, instrumento com resolução de 0, 00 mm/ 152, 78 mm. As medições foram realizadas no movimento da mímica facial, sempre partindo de um ponto fixo para o ponto móvel nas estruturas: tragus e comissura labial, canto externo do olho e comissura labial e também canto interno do olho e asa do nariz, sendo realizadas pré e pós tratamento fonoaudiológico. A quantificação da incompetência do movimento foi mensurada por meio de porcentagem simples. Foi aplicado teste dos Postos Sinalizados de Wilcoxon, para verificar possíveis diferenças entre ambos os momentos considerados (com e sem movimentos), como as variáveis de interesse. RESULTADOS: as mensurações tiveram um resultado estatisticamente significante (p PURPOSE: {{to assess}} {{the use of the}} digital caliper in the measurement of the facial mimic movements in different moments of the speech therapy. METHOD: prospective longitudinal study, with 20 subjects between 7 and 70 years-old, 13 females and 7 males, all diagnosed with Bell&# 8217;s Palsy, attended in the Facial Paralysis Ambulatory, of the otorhinolaryngology subject of a University Public Hospital. The use of a Digimess 100, 174 BL digital <b>measuring</b> <b>caliper</b> was adopted for this study. The measurements were carried out in the facial mimic movement, always starting from a fixed point to a mobile point in the structures: the tragus and the labial commissure, external corner of the eye and labial commissure and also internal corner of the eye and the nasal ala. All measurements were carried out both prior and after the treatment. The quantification of the incompetence of the movement was measured by simple percentage. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to check for possible differences between both moments considered (with and without movements), as the study variables. RESULTS: the measurements had a statistically significant result (p< 0. 05) in all the proposed measured structures (tragus and labial commissure, external corner of the eye and labial commissure, and internal corner of the eye and nasal ala), showing that there are possibilities of measuring of movement and absence of movement using a digital caliper. CONCLUSION: the caliper has demonstrated to be a useful device which has permitted to objectively compare the evolution of the rehabilitation of facial mimic in Bell&# 8217;s Palsy in the sample studied here...|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of intuitive, user-friendly and specialized software {{to work with}} 3 D models of cultural heritage artifacts {{is as important as}} the {{availability of}} lowcost and robust data acquisition techniques for the adoption of digitized 3 D models in cultural heritage research. As recent developments in 3 D scanning technologies have made the digitization of artifacts affordable; the amount of digitized models available for research increases rapidly. Consequently the need for specialized software for cultural heritage research and practice on 3 D models becomes more apparent. The lack of spatial measurement tools familiar to cultural heritage experts in traditional 3 D modeling packages motivated us to create a simple, freely available, and extensible measurement tools system, CH Toolbox, which was designed exclusively for cultural heritage research. The proposed system visualizes digitized models of artifacts in 3 D and allows the user to analyze the pieces using a spaceball and mouse driven bi-manual interface.
