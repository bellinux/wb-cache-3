5|$|The herd {{has been}} studied {{periodically}} since the late 1980s, with researchers recommending various <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> depending on the focus of their study. Current herd levels {{have been shown to}} {{have a negative effect on}} their environment, and researchers focused on environmental issues recommend a severe reduction in herd numbers. Other researchers, looking at genetic variability, state that a herd size nearly as large as current is necessary to prevent inbreeding, but also state the herd is not genetically unique enough to warrant special preservation. The National Park Service has no current management plan for the horses, and their one effort to create one was blocked by Jack Kingston, a Georgia member of the US House of Representatives.|$|E

5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play {{important roles in}} maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were {{to be protected from}} destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E
5|$|Proposed {{transportation}} <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> {{are aimed}} at keeping traffic into Aspen at the baseline 1993 level through 2015. There are three levels or strategic response: The first would be when that baseline is equaled or slightly exceeded. It would consist of promoting ride sharing and more extensive transit use, among other informational measures. At Level 2, when traffic reaches a few percentage points above that level, more transit service would be added, and parking rates raised slightly to fund the additional buses required to reduce headways. Level 3 would be implemented when traffic levels had exceeded the baseline by 5–10%, and would use more forceful measures such as steeper increases in parking fees, deliberately {{limiting the number of}} spaces available, and making some parts of downtown Aspen car-free zones.|$|E

25|$|Prey pathway animals include sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca. The right {{conditions}} for the domestication {{for some of them}} appear to have been in place in the central and eastern Fertile Crescent {{at the end of the}} Younger Dryas climatic downturn and the beginning of the Early Holocene about 11,700 YBP, and by 10,000 YBP people were preferentially killing young males of a variety of species and allowed the females to live in order to produce more offspring. By measuring the size, sex ratios, and mortality profiles of zooarchaeological specimens, archeologists have been able to document changes in the <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> of hunted sheep, goats, pigs, and cows in the Fertile Crescent starting 11,700 YBP. A recent demographic and metrical study of cow and pig remains at Sha’ar Hagolan, Israel, demonstrated that both species were severely overhunted before domestication, suggesting that the intensive exploitation led to <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> adopted throughout the region that ultimately led to the domestication of these populations following the prey pathway. This pattern of overhunting before domestication suggests that the prey pathway was as accidental and unintentional as the commensal pathway.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{developing}} countries depends very much on having adequate physical infrastructure to support economic development. As a strategic response, many physical infrastructure investments like seaports are being privatised and highly purpose built. This paper investigates the merits of viable seaport infrastructure investment, typically ‘lumpy’ and requiring large capital expenditure and long payback period. A key feature of such an infrastructure investment is to structure a defensible risk <b>management</b> <b>strategy</b> to deal with uncertainties. This risk <b>management</b> <b>strategy</b> can provide responsive alternatives to new opportunities. Singapore's Jurong Port is the case study. The original risk <b>management</b> <b>strategy</b> is analysed in 1996, and deploys risk simulation for scenario planning in conjunction with constraint optimisation. This original risk <b>management</b> <b>strategy</b> finds {{that it is more}} defensible to configure Jurong Port, and a seaport in general, into the maritime industrial and logistics park (MILP) instead of the higher-margin and purpose-built container terminal strategy, which is inherently volatile (ie uncertain or risky). The planned scenarios and their projections, under the original risk <b>management</b> <b>strategy</b> are then compared with the consequential developments in reality. The results highlight that the sustained viability of Jurong Port in 2004 is attributed to that risk <b>management</b> <b>strategy,</b> originally developed in 1996.
