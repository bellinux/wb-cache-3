40|$|BACKGROUND: Years since {{onset of}} sexual {{intercourse}} (YSSI) is a rarely used variable when studying adolescents- sexual outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the influence of YSSI on the adverse sexual outcomes of early sexual initiators. METHODS: Data were drawn from the 2002 Swiss Multicenter Adolescent Survey on Health database, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey including 7429 adolescents in post <b>mandatory</b> <b>school</b> <b>aged</b> 16 - 20 years. Only adolescents reporting sexual intercourse (SI) were included (N= 4388; 45 % females) and divided by age of onset of SI (early initiators, age< 16 : N= 1469, 44 % females; and late initiators, age? 16 : N= 2919, 46 % females). Analyses were done separately by gender. Groups were compared for personal characteristics at the bivariate level. We analyzed three sexual outcomes (? 4 sexual partners, pregnancy and non-use of condom at last SI) controlling for all significant personal variables with two logistic regressions first using age, then YSSI as one of the confounding variables. Results are given as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) using lSI as the reference category. RESULTS: After adjusting for YSSI instead of age, negative sexual outcomes among early initiators were no longer significant, except for multiple sexual partners among females, although at a much lower level. Early initiators were less likely to report non-use of condom at last SI when adjusting for YSSI (females: aOR= 0. 59 [0. 44 - 0. 79]; p< 0. 001; males aOR= 0. 71 [0. 50 - 1. 00]; p= 0. 053). CONCLUSION: YSSI is an important explanatory variable when studying adolescents- sexuality and needs to be included in future research on adolescents- sexual health...|$|R

This {{is also a}} European problem {{as well as an}} issue for the European Union. Applying the social-ecological model by Bronfenbrenner we concentrated on micro- and mesosystems of Austrian adolescents and migrant adolescents of war-affected countries. Methods: a questionnaire was administered to adolescents in Austria attending schools beyond the <b>mandatory</b> <b>school</b> <b>age,</b> yielding a sample of about 1 100 students from Austrian and immigrant background. We used analysis of variance to compare host and immigrant youth as well as regression analysis {{to assess the impact of}} risk and protective factors on youth outcomes. Results: we do find sex differences for protective factors and youth outcomes but few differences between immigrant and Austrian adolescents. Youth outcomes analysed were somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, anti-social behaviour, substance use, and academic performance. Important risk factors turned out to be intergenerational conflict, exposure to violence, and social distance. Protective factors include family connectedness, parental monitoring, school connectedness, peer support, and neighbourhood attachment. Conclusions: the most important protective factor is school connectsdness. Social distance and intergenerational conflict are the dominant risk factors influencing youth outcomes. Our research leads to a better understanding of factors determining the well-being of adolescents and contributes to finding new approaches to prevent or cope with mental health problems of young immigrants. In particular it appears to be important to keep young persons in education and/or training since school connectedness influences mental health and well-being positively...|$|E

Methods 151 patients (mean age 16. 95 years, SD = 1. 76; range 13 - 22) were consecutively assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and standardized clinical questionnaires to assess mental disorders, symptom distress, psychosocial variables and detailed aspects of drug use. A consecutively referred subgroup of these 151 patients consisting of 65 underage patients (mean age 16. 12, SD = 1. 10; range 13 - 17) was additionally assessed with the modules for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD) using The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for school-aged children (K-SADS-PL). Results 128 (84. 8 %) of the 151 patients were dependent {{on at least one}} substance, the remaining patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for abuse only. 40. 5 % of the participants fulfilled criteria for at least one comorbid present Axis I disorder other than substance use disorders (67. 7 % in the subgroup additionally interviewed with the K-SADS-PL). High prevalences of present mood disorder (19. 2 %), somatoform disorders (9. 3 %), and anxiety disorders (22. 5 %) were found. The 37 female participants showed a significantly higher risk for lifetime comorbid disorders; the gender difference was significantly pronounced for anxiety and somatoform disorders. Data from the underage subgroup revealed a high prevalence for present CD (41. 5 %). 33 % of the 106 patients (total group) who were within the <b>mandatory</b> <b>school</b> <b>age</b> had not attended school for at least a two-month period prior to admission. In addition, 51. 4 % had been temporarily expelled from school at least once.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is to make {{a contribution}} to the literature on Making Work Pay policy. This thesis consists of four separate chapters of which three focus on the labor supply decision of households and how different policy reforms affect the labor supply decision. Each chapter answers a specific research question and, by using a solid theoretical framework, provides policy recommendations. We devote one specific chapter to a presentation of the most relevant literature on labor supply modeling. Each chapter is based on Belgian data and, hence, applies the research question on the Belgian situation. However, the methodological framework presented in each chapter can also be used for empirical studies for other countries. In order to evaluate the potential labor supply effects of policy reforms, labor supply models need to be estimated. There exists, however, a substantial amount of literature on labor supply modeling. Therefore, the first goal of Chapter 2 is to provide an overview of the existing literature and to position this dissertation in therelevant academic literature on labor supply modeling. As will be discussed in this chapter, this thesis adopts two specific methodologies thatare to a certain degree similar to each other but differ in some important aspects. It would be tempting for the reader to compare effects across chapters. However, each chapter is estimated on a different sample which makes a direct comparison difficult and hard to interpret. Therefore, the second purpose of chapter 2 is to provide a detailed discussion ofboth models and estimate them on exactly the same dataset which enablesus to directly compare both models and stress the important differencesand similarities between the two. We examine how both models perform inreproducing the observed household's choices and analyze whether the behavioral responses differ by deriving labor supply elasticities. Given this comparison, we justify the choices we made regarding the methodological framework chosen in each chapter to model labor supply. A lot of research has already been done on the effectiveness of Making WorkPay policies. However, an element that has received less attention is the importance of the scope of information that policy makers have for the design of their instrument. Chapter 3 of this dissertation emphasizes that the effectiveness of MWP-policies depends to a large extent on the information that policy makers have available. As the main purpose of Making Work Pay policies is to enlarge the incentives for low skilledindividuals to step into the labor market, the necessary condition to effectively implement such policies is the government's ability to correctly identify the low skilled individuals. If individuals only report their gross income, Making Work Pay instruments in which eligibility depends on some level of this income concept will create disincentive effects. High-skilled individuals might have incentives {{to reduce the amount of}} hours worked l in order to have lower income to be eligible to the benefit. If, on the other hand, people report gross income and the actual amount of hours worked, Making Work Pay policies can be designed that only target the low skilled individuals and the amount of distortions created by the system will be lower than in regime T. We quantify the differential positive and normative effects of Making Work Pay instruments in both scenario's by evaluating the employment effects of the Belgian Workbonus and a hypothetical budget neutral in-work tax credit. We show that policymakers are able to target the low skilled population more effectively if the scope of information is enlarged. In addition to these positive effects, our analysis shows that the implementation of an instrument based on wages leads to a higher social welfare than the implementation of a budget neutral instrument in which eligibility is based on actual earnings. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 target Making Work Pay policies that focus on both the tax-benefit system and institutional features related to childcare and labor supply. Children have an important impact on labor supply decisions of households and it is therefore interesting to investigate how policy related to childcare and labor supply might contribute to making work pay. The availability of different childcare options, their quality and their price are major determinants of the work-family balance of households with (young) children. These issues figure also highly on the policy agenda, whichis illustrated by the Barcelona childcare targets formulated in 2002 bythe European Council, and confirmed in 2005. According to these targets, each country should provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90 % of children between 3 years old and the <b>mandatory</b> <b>school</b> <b>age</b> and at least 33 % ofchildren under 3 years of age. They believe that having access to more and better childcare is beneficial for both the children and induces women to start working. The focus Chapter 4 remains exclusively on labor supply and how childcare policy might influence the labor supply decision of households. This chapter builds on a structural labor supply model as proposed by Van Soest (1995), using a discrete random utility maximization model, but extends this framework to take childcare policy into account. We investigate how sensitive maternal labor supply iswith respect to changes in the price and availability of childcare and make policy recommendations whether policy should focus on the former orthe latter. The analysis suggests that, in line with other findings in the literature, policy makers should rather focus on the availability than on the price of childcare to foster employment. Chapter 5 goes one step further by modeling both the childcare and labor supply decision of households. In this second stream, known as the Simultaneous approach, households make their employment and childcare decisions simultaneously which allows for an investigation of the link between both,rather than focusing only on the former. As such, households additionally choose the amount of childcare and childcare type, next to the labor supply decision. This type of modeling is particularly interesting to investigate how the simultaneous choice of labor supply and childcare change after specific policy reforms. In march 2012 the Flemish parliament approved a decree containing a substantial reform in the Flemish childcare sector. The main goal is to make childcare more accessible, affordableand professional for each household with young children as they believethat childcare is essential for both economic and educational purposes of the household. One of the targets is that 50 % of all preschool children by 2016 find suitable childcare and this percentage increases up to 100 % by 2020. We analyze the behavioral effects of this reform and the results suggest that the relative importance of informal childcare declines in favor of formal childcare arrangements. Additionally, the participation rate of mothers increases further as they are less restricted in their childcare choice. status: publishe...|$|E
