It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.|$|E
2500|$|Distance {{measurement}} at the [...] model 1891 batteries {{was based}} on horizontal triangulation from two different points, a primary and secondary, on separate islands. The rangefinders used were general von der Launitz's models 1903 and 1905-07. The average distance between the two points at Krepost Sveaborg was [...] Target information was sent from the primary point to the battery command point. If the primary point was located away from the battery or directing a different battery a rangefinder converter designed by colonel Kovanko was {{used to calculate the}} firing solution. A weakness in using two <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> was that any malfunctions in either of the rangefinders or in the telephone system would render the system inoperable. Target indication between the primary and secondary points could also pose problems, as there would often be several similar target ships. The system was also not capable of measuring distances to targets {{in the rear of the}} battery; a maximum measurement sector was 140°.|$|E
40|$|By {{setting a}} {{refractor}} {{at an angle}} to the optical axis of a closed circuit display (CCD) camera lens, the image of a <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> recorded on the image plane is displaced by an amount that corresponds to the distance between the camera and the <b>measurement</b> <b>point.</b> When the refractor is rotated at high speed while the camera is operating, the image of the <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> appears as an annular streak. Since the radius of the annular streak is inversely proportional to the distance between the camera and <b>measurement</b> <b>point,</b> the three-dimensional (3 -D) position of the <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> can be obtained by extracting data from the streak. In this paper, this system is applied to measure a moving surface. To do this, multiple laser spots are projected onto the surface. The position of each laser spot reflected from the surface is measured using a circular dynamic stereo system. Moreover, this system is applied to flow measurement as a potential application and the results are described. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{conventional}} {{approaches to}} distribution network fault location has certain drawbacks {{in terms of}} complexity, especially the fault occurred in the branch lines. In this paper, a novel fault location method based on D-type traveling wave was proposed. This method choose the <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> which the initial traveling waves first reached as the reference <b>measurement</b> <b>point,</b> and the distance between multiple failure points received a fault traveling wave signal to the reference <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> was calculated. Then, the maximum distance between multiple failure points to the reference <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> was selected as location of the final failure point. The simulation result with ATP simulation software and MATLAB software show that the proposed method can achieve fault location fast and accurately within a very short period. Compared with the existing algorithms, this method was consistent whether the fault occurred in the main line or branch lines, which improved the accuracy and reliability of the traveling wave fault location in distribution network...|$|R

Additionally, the control room had a big [...] "X-time" [...] countdown clock that display the time until launch, which was announced via loudspeakers as [...] "X minus four minutes", etc. [...] In addition to the control room, the blockhouse also contained offices, a conference room, a small dormitory with double bunks and an adjoining shower, a wash room, and a workshop. A long underground corridor led from the measurement blockhouse to {{a room in the}} concrete foundation by the flame pit, and multiple rows of measurement cables covered the walls of the tunnel. A different gradually rising tunnel led from the long flame pit room to the exterior of the arena near the pumphouse (...) [...] Near the pumphouse were high wooden towers to cool the water, and [...] high tanks for the recooling water were integrated into the ellipse wall.|$|E

The operation of the dual-beam laser is based on the difference in reflection frequency of two perfectly aligned beams pointing at different points on a shaft.

30|$|When a large vehicle {{reaches the}} bridge, its weight is {{measured}} with a load cell at {{the starting point of}} the bridge. When the measured force is uploaded into the system, a program is activated to calculate the counterforce required for controlling the deck deflection. The system calculates the cable tension (optimal counterforce) required to hold the main girder displacement under normal loads (allowable displacement) when the heavy vehicle reaches the first <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> (A). Once the optimal counterforce is determined, instructions are sent to the actuator to start operation, stressing/releasing of stay cables starts and, at the same time, the monitoring system begins to measure cable tension. The decision-making function compares the measured cable tension with the optimal counterforce and repeatedly stresses and relaxes cable tension until an agreement is reached. When the adjustment of tension is finished, the load is moved to <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> A where a displacement gauge is in place as shown in Figure  6. When the large vehicle reaches <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> A, the above process is repeated for the next <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> B. Operation is repeated from the time a large vehicle reaches the starting point of the bridge model until the vehicle reaches the end, and the deck deflection is measured each time the control measure is taken.|$|R

For example, data for a longitudinal study may attempt to collect measurements at age 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 15 months. However, participant availability, bank holidays, and other scheduling issues may result in variation regarding when data is collected. This variation may be addressed in MLM by adding “age” into the regression equation. There is also no need for equal intervals between <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> in MLM.|$|E

A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time - a time series - thus the line is often drawn chronologically. In these cases they are known as run charts.|$|E
