25|$|Brown {{regarded}} {{the strengthening of}} NATO as a key national security objective and worked hard to invigorate the alliance. With the assistance of Robert W. Komer, at first his special adviser on NATO affairs and subsequently under-secretary of defense for policy, Brown launched a series of NATO initiatives shortly after taking office. In May 1978 the NATO heads of government endorsed a Long Term Defense Program that included 10 priority categories: enhanced readiness; rapid reinforcement; stronger European reserve forces; improvements in maritime capabilities; integrated air defenses; effective command, control, and communications; electronic warfare; rationalized procedures for armaments collaboration; logistics co-ordination and increased war reserves; and theater nuclear modernization. To implement the last item, NATO defense and foreign ministers decided in December 1979 {{to respond to the}} Soviet deployment of new theater nuclear weapons—the SS-20 missile and the Backfire bomber—by placing 108 Pershing II missiles and 464 ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) in several Western European countries beginning in December 1983. The NATO leaders indicated that the new <b>missile</b> <b>deployment</b> would be scaled down if satisfactory progress occurred in arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|In the Cold War {{context of}} Operation RYAN, the Strategic Defence Initiative, Pershing II <b>missile</b> <b>deployment</b> in Europe, and the {{upcoming}} Exercise Able Archer, the Soviet Government perceived the incident with the South Korean airliner to be a portent of war. The Soviet hierarchy took the official line that KAL Flight 007 {{was on a}} spy mission, as it [...] "flew deep into Soviet territory for several hundred kilometres, without responding to signals and disobeying the orders of interceptor fighter planes". They claimed its purpose was to probe the air defences of highly sensitive Soviet military sites in the Kamchatka Peninsula and Sakhalin Island. The Soviet government expressed regret {{over the loss of}} life, but offered no apology and did not respond to demands for compensation. Instead, the Soviet Union blamed the CIA for this [...] "criminal, provocative act".|$|E

500|$|On November 25, 1983, Soviet leader Yuri Andropov {{announced}} {{the resumption of}} nuclear <b>missile</b> <b>deployment</b> in the western U.S.S.R., {{a sign of the}} increased tension in the relationship. The thaw in relations can be taken to begin with Ronald Reagan's January 16, 1984 speech declaring that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had [...] "common interests and the foremost among them is to avoid war and reduce the level of arms" [...] in which he added that [...] "I support a zero option for all nuclear arms." [...] While the speech was commonly seen as propaganda, Lawrence S. Wittner, professor of History at the State University of New York - Albany says of it that [...] "a number of officials--including its writer, Jack Matlock Jr.--have contended that {{it was meant to be}} taken seriously by Soviet leaders." [...] On June 30, 1984, the Soviets offered to start negotiations on nuclear and space-based weapons.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet {{intelligence}} {{services and the}} Soviet military used deceptive measures to conceal from the United States their intentions in Operation Anadyr, {{which led to the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. According to CIA analyst James Hansen, the Soviet Army most likely used large-scale battlefield deception before the Cuban Missile Crisis [...] "more frequently and with more consistent success than any other army." [...] The soldiers involved in Anadyr were provided with winter clothing and informed they would be going to the east of the Soviet Union. On board ship, intelligence officers allowed the 40,000 soldiers involved on deck only during the hours of darkness. The force, including missiles, reached Cuba before US intelligence became aware of it. Anadyr was planned from the start with elaborate denial and deception, ranging from the soldiers' ski boots and fleece-lined parkas to the name of the operation, a river and town in the chilly far east. Once America had become aware of Soviet intentions, deception continued in the form of outright denial, as when, on 17 October 1962, the embassy official Georgy Bolshakov gave President John F. Kennedy a [...] "personal message" [...] from the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev reassuring him that [...] "under no circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba." [...] Hansen's analysis ends with a recognition of the Soviet advantage in deception in 1962. In Hansen's view, the fact that the Killian Report did not even mention adversarial denial and deception was an indication that American intelligence had not begun to study foreign D it did not do so for another 20 years. Hansen considered it likely that with a properly-prepared [...] "deception-aware analytic corps", America could have seen through Khrushchev's plan long before Maj. Heyser's revealing U-2 mission. In Hansen's view, it would take four decades before American intelligence fully understood the extent of Soviet deception before the Cuban Missile Crisis, especially the way the Soviets hid the truth of its strategic <b>missile</b> <b>deployment</b> behind a mass of lies, on [...] "a scale that most US planners could not comprehend".|$|E

2500|$|In August 1970, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt {{agreed to}} an [...] "in place" [...] ceasefire under the terms {{proposed}} by the Rogers Plan.
