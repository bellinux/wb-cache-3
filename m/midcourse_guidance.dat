40|$|The {{predicted}} {{impact point}} (PIP) of hypersonic interception changes continually; therefore the <b>midcourse</b> <b>guidance</b> law {{must have the}} ability of online trajectory optimization. In this paper, an online trajectory generation algorithm is designed based on neighboring optimal control (NOC) theory and improved indirect Radau pseudospectral method (IRPM). A trajectory optimization model is designed according to the features of operations in near space. Two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) are obtained based on NOC theory. The second-order linear form of transversality conditions is deduced backward to express the modifications of terminal states, costates, and flight time in terms of current state errors and terminal constraints modifications. By treating the current states and the optimal costates modifications as initial constraints and perturbations, the feedback control variables are obtained based on improved IRPM and nominal trajectory information. The simulation results show that when the changes of terminal constraints are not relatively large, this method can generate a modified trajectory effectively with high precision of terminal modifications.

40|$|Using the {{recently}} developed computationally efficient model predictive static programming and a closely related model predictive spread control concept, two nonlinear suboptimal <b>midcourse</b> <b>guidance</b> laws {{are presented in}} this paper for interceptors engaging against incoming high-speed ballistic missiles. The guidance laws are primarily based on nonlinear optimal control theory, and hence imbed effective trajectory optimization concepts into the guidance laws. Apart from being energy efficient by minimizing the control usage throughout the trajectory (minimum control usage leads to minimum turning, and hence leads to minimum induced drag), both of these laws enforce desired alignment constraints in both elevation and azimuth in a hard-constraint sense. This good alignment during midcourse is expected to enhance the effectiveness of the terminal guidance substantially. Both point mass as well as six-degree-of-freedom simulation results (with a realistic inner-loop autopilot based on dynamic inversion) are {{presented in this paper}}, which clearly shows the effectiveness of the proposed guidance laws. It has also been observed that, even with different perturbations of missile parameters, the performance of guidance is satisfactory.
