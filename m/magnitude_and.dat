5|$|Betelgeuse is {{classified}} as a semiregular variable star, indicating that some periodicity is noticeable in the brightness changes, but amplitudes may vary, cycles may have different lengths, {{and there may be}} standstills or periods of irregularity.

5|$|By November 1944, Strong was {{reporting}} {{that there was}} a possibility of a German counteroffensive in the Ardennes or the Vosges. Smith sent Strong to personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own. The <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive came as a shock, and Smith had to defend Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm. He felt Bradley had been given ample warning.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Historically, storms of such <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> {{with such}} high wind {{velocities}} have not {{lasted more than}} four or five hours. The Great Lakes storm, however, raged for more than 16hours, with an average speed of 60mph (100km/h), and frequent bursts of more than 70mph (110km/h). It crippled traffic on the lakes and throughout the Great Lakes basin region.|$|E

5|$|The rare floods that do {{break free}} of the dams and weirs of the Murray-Darling system have their <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> {{duration}} deliberately curtailed by river regulators. Increasing research indicates this management practice is very harmful and drastically reduces the general ecosystem benefits and breeding and recruitment opportunities for Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish species these now rare floods can provide.|$|E
5|$|The stellar {{temperature}} {{will determine}} the rate of ionization of various elements, resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum.

5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|Almost all reviewers commented {{upon the}} {{timeliness}} of the book's release as the <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> {{causes of the}} most recent financial crisis were becoming apparent. Some reviewers also commented upon the timeliness of her previous books, like her novel in which society is devastated by a genetically engineered virus, Oryx and Crake, which coincided with the SARS outbreak. Playing off this theme Canadian magazine The Walrus, at a fund-raiser gala for its charitable foundation, auctioned a crystal decanter with five predictions written by Atwood sealed inside. Journalist Rebecca Eckler was the winning bidder and wrote about the predictions, which include the diminished use of fabric softener and the rise in use of industrial hemp, in an article for Maclean's magazine.|$|E
5|$|Although Aries came to {{represent}} specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, {{the stars of}} Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth <b>magnitude),</b> <b>and</b> 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.|$|E

30|$|The {{extent of}} system {{magnitudes}} can be formally classified at seven levels {{known as the}} empty, small, medium, large, giant, immense, andinfinite (universal) systems from the bottom up. Relationships between system sizes, <b>magnitudes,</b> <b>and</b> structural complexities in the system hierarchy are summarized in Table  5 known as the 7 -layer Model of System Magnitudes. The quantitative measurement scheme in Table  5 forms a reference model of system <b>magnitudes</b> <b>and</b> complexities.|$|R
5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a scalar quantity, that is, {{it has only}} <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E
5|$|In addition, stars may be {{classified}} by the luminosity effects {{found in their}} spectral lines, which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity. These range from 0 (hypergiants) through III (giants) to V (main sequence dwarfs); some authors add VII (white dwarfs). Most stars belong to the main sequence, which consists of ordinary hydrogen-burning stars. These fall along a narrow, diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> spectral type. The Sun is a main sequence G2V yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size.|$|E

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to recognize or distort the Holliday junction structure. One such class contains junction-resolving enzymes that cleave the junctions, sometimes in a sequence-specific fashion. Such proteins distort {{the structure of the}} junction in various ways, often pulling the junction into an unstacked conformation, breaking the central base pairs, and/or changing the angles between the four arms. Other classes are branch migration proteins that increase the exchange rate by orders of <b>magnitude,</b> <b>and</b> site-specific recombinases. In prokaryotes, Holliday junction resolvases fall into two families, integrases and nucleases, that are each structurally similar although their sequences are not conserved.|$|E

The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of 1065 AU (one thousand times the distance from the Earth to the Sun).

5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was a typeI fireball, i.e. {{an ordinary}} chondrite.

It lost approximately 350g during the encounter. Computer simulations showed that it started losing mass approximately at the moment it became visible to the cameras of the European Fireball Network, at a height of 100.6km. It lost mass for 25 seconds, until it reached a height of 215.7km. Its surface melted and solidified again after leaving, which means its surface became a typical meteoritic fusion crust.|$|E
