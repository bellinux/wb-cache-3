5|$|Despite the acclaim from <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> reviewers, modern {{scholars}} {{of the silent}} film era would not consider The Carpet from Bagdad a masterpiece, according to the British Film Institute's Clyde Jeavons.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} On the Art of the Cinema on North Korean filmmaking is disputed. Films from {{before and after}} the {{publication}} of the treatise are similar in style and <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> films breach various rules laid out in the treatise.|$|E
5|$|By {{introducing}} {{a distinction between}} diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid {{the foundation of the}} modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).|$|E
50|$|For <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> John Weber's {{portrait}} of Poedua epitomized the sensual {{image of the}} South Sea maiden.|$|R
50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> {{who played}} with or against Moon regard {{him as one of}} the {{greatest}} wingers they have seen.|$|R
50|$|Beaudoin {{earned a}} master's degree in history from Université Laval and a master's degree in {{sociology}} at the Sorbonne. As a student, like <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> she was associated with Quebec separatists.|$|R
5|$|Disorder spread {{throughout}} Aleppo {{the morning after}} Mansur's flight. Aleppines looted Mansur's palace, taking some 80,000 gold dinars-worth of property. The medieval Aleppine chronicler Ibn al-Adim further noted that 28,000 volumes of manuscripts stored in the palace library were lost. A number of Christian and Jewish homes were also plundered. Though actual members of the Hamdanid dynasty had lost power by 1002, <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> Arabic chroniclers consider Mansur's ouster to represent the formal end of the Hamdanid emirate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>contemporary</b> Orthodox {{scholars}} {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|Some medieval rabbis {{claimed that}} today's Western Wall is a {{surviving}} {{wall of the}} Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts {{in a state of}} impurity. <b>Many</b> <b>contemporary</b> rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness. Most secular scholars believe however that these traditions originally pertained to a western wall of the Temple itself, and since the 1500s, were gradually applied to the surviving retaining Western Wall of the Mount.|$|E
50|$|The 4061 cc {{engine of}} the {{original}} D8 placed it in the 23CV car tax band which, for <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> would also have defined its position {{high up in the}} market hierarchy.|$|R
5000|$|Herbert Ihering (also {{sometimes}} Herbert Jhering: 29 February 1888 - 15 January 1977) {{was seen}} by <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> {{as one of the}} leading German theatre critics during and after the Weimar years.|$|R
5000|$|Alexander Lee notes that, [...] "The {{so-called}} [...] "Banquet of the Chestnuts" ...is, for example, attested only in Burchard's memoirs, and is {{not only}} intrinsically implausible, but was also dismissed as such by <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Perl {{languages}} borrow features {{from other}} programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread {{popularity in the}} late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, {{in part due to}} its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Ramsey led {{his side}} to become champions of England in their debut {{season at the}} top level. The side had been tipped by <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> football pundits and journalists for relegation {{at the start of}} the season, making the achievement all the more remarkable. Ramsey created a strong side based on a resolute defence and two strikers, Ray Crawford and Ted Phillips who between them scored over sixty goals. The key to the side was considered to be left-winger, Jimmy Leadbetter whom Ramsey moved into a deep-lying, left of centre midfielder.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar and {{its name}} {{are widely used}} as a symbol in {{contemporary}} culture. It is the national animal of Guyana, and is featured in its coat of arms. The flag of the Department of Amazonas, a Colombian department, features a black jaguar silhouette pouncing towards a hunter. The jaguar also appears in banknotes of Brazilian real. The jaguar is also a common fixture in the mythology of <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> native cultures in South America, usually being portrayed as the creature which gave humans the power over fire.|$|E
5000|$|Randall and his {{followers}} were dismissed by <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> as adherents of a fanatical sect and were pejoratively called a variety of names, including [...] "Randallites," [...] "General Provisioners," [...] "New-Lights," [...] and [...] "Freewillers." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{affair with}} Okhotnikov had a tragic end. The staff captain died in 1807 after an attempt on his life. <b>Many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> {{considered}} that Alexander I or his brother Grand Duke Konstantin had ordered him killed.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Finley and Samuel John Mills helped {{organize}} the National Colonization Society of America and the American Colonization Society at Washington, D.C. in 1816 and 1817. Contributions were solicited from <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> including former students such as Charles Muir Campbell.|$|R
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{disguise}} are unknown. Hingley notes that <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. He suggests that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{commercial}} smash, the record received initially lukewarm reviews from mainstream music critics; <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> reviewers deemed it inferior to Definitely Maybe, with the songwriting and production particular points of criticism. In the ensuing years, however, critical opinion towards the album reversed, {{and it is}} now generally considered a seminal record of both the Britpop era, and the 1990s in general. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band performed an extensive world tour in support of the album. The most notable of the concerts were two Knebworth House performances in August to a combined crowd of 250,000 people. At the 1996 Brit Awards, the album won Best British Album.|$|E
5|$|Bernoulli's work {{influenced}} <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> {{and subsequent}} mathematicians. Even the afterthought-like tract on calculus has been quoted frequently; most notably by the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin. Jacob's program of applying his art of conjecture to the matters of practical life, which was terminated by {{his death in}} 1705, was continued by his nephew Nicolaus Bernoulli, after having taken parts verbatim out of Ars Conjectandi, for his own dissertation entitled De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure which was published already in 1709. Nicolas finally edited and assisted in the publication of Ars conjectandi in 1713. Later Nicolaus also edited Jacob Bernoulli's complete works and supplemented it with results taken from Jacob's diary.|$|E
50|$|Acyutānanda had {{a formal}} {{education}} in Puri. It is agreed by most texts that, like <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> he met Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in his youth, {{but did not}} become a follower of Chaitanya Mahapabhu's Gaudiya Vaishnavism. He became {{the youngest of the}} Panchasakhā.|$|R
50|$|On 10 April 1941, Nagumo was {{appointed}} commander-in-chief of the First Air Fleet, the IJN′s main aircraft carrier force, {{largely due to}} his seniority. <b>Many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> and historians have doubted his suitability for this command, given his lack of familiarity with naval aviation.|$|R
50|$|The third son of {{architect}} George Dance the Elder, Dance (he {{added the}} 'Holland' suffix later in life) studied art under Francis Hayman, and like <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> also studied in Italy. There he met Angelica Kauffman, and painted several historic and classical paintings.|$|R
5|$|Each of the cover, main body, {{and foot}} of the cup is made of an inner and outer plate, and the {{enamelled}} medallions inside the cover and bowl were made separately before attachment. The enamel areas may have been designed by the goldsmith, or an artist more used to painting on panels or in manuscripts may have produced drawings. A number of names of goldsmiths appear in records of the period, but in contrast to <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> manuscripts, the few surviving goldsmith's pieces are not signed or marked and cannot be matched to any names. Not a single maker's name is recorded for the more than 3,000 items in precious metal in the inventory mentioned above of the possessions of Berry's brother Anjou. High quality courtly work like the cup is conventionally assigned to Paris {{in the absence of}} other stylistic evidence; this is where other documentary sources locate the main concentration of goldsmiths.|$|E
5|$|The 1892 {{regular season}} {{was a success}} for Young, who led the National League in wins (36), ERA (1.93), and shutouts (9). Just as <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> Minor League Baseball leagues operate today, the National League was using a split season format during the 1892 season. The Boston Beaneaters won the first-half title, and the Spiders won the second-half title, with a best-of-nine series {{determining}} the league champion. Despite the Spiders' second half run, the Beaneaters swept the series, five games to none. Young pitched three complete games in the series, but lost two decisions. He also threw a complete game shutout, but the game ended in a 00 tie.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, {{making it easier for}} the lower tank to be filled first.|$|E
5000|$|Ford and {{his senior}} {{managers}} {{did not use}} the word [...] "Fordism" [...] themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an [...] "". However, <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> framed their worldview as one and applied the name Fordism to it.|$|R
50|$|In 1846, the {{government}} of France committed to {{a new system of}} electric telegraph lines. <b>Many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> warned of the ease of sabotage and interruption of service by cutting a wire. With the emergence of the electric telegraph, slowly the Chappe telegraph ended in 1852.|$|R
50|$|He {{was sentenced}} to be hanged, drawn and quartered, the {{execution}} took place at Charing Cross on 16 October. <b>Many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> reported him as being in despair. Peters was forced to watch John Cook suffering emasculation and disembowelment, before enduring the same gory fate himself.|$|R
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Atheis came, according to Oemarjati, {{sometime during the}} early 1940s. In Mihardja's observations, Marxism–Leninism and anarcho-nihilism {{were among the most}} common ideologies in Indonesia; this led him to depict Rusli and Anwar as holding those ideologies. Meanwhile, emerging writers such as Idrus, Asrul Sani, and Chairil Anwar were increasingly critical of the older generation of Indonesian authors, whom they decried as narrow-minded and provincial. Mihardja, who was older than <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> writers and wrote in a similar style to the older authors, disliked this comparison; according to Maier, this may have led him to represent Chairil Anwar as a much-flawed character. Mihardja formalised his concept throughout the early 1940s and completed the writing during a period of unemployment from May 1948 until February 1949.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E
5|$|Willy Vandersteen used a wild {{variety of}} themes and {{influences}} {{in his work}} from early on. He made fairytales, historic series, westerns, but also science fiction and <b>many</b> <b>contemporary</b> comics. While some series like De Familie Snoek and Bessy stuck very close to their origin (an everyday Flemish contemporary family for the former, and a pioneer family in the American Old West in the latter), others were more loose. De Rode Ridder, {{the story of a}} medieval knight, wandered from Arthurian tales over the crusades until the explorations of the fifteenth and sixteenth century, thereby spanning some ten centuries, and later (when Vandersteen was less involved in the series) brought in many elements of sword and sorcery and fantasy.|$|E
50|$|Rosenkranz has {{appeared}} onstage with <b>many</b> notable <b>contemporary</b> musicians, including Nicole Cabell, Alarm Will Sound, Siouxsie Sioux, Steve Reich, Signal Ensemble, and So Percussion. He has also worked directly with <b>many</b> notable <b>contemporary</b> composers including George Crumb, Frederic Rzewski, John Adams (composer), and Steve Reich.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{he and his}} son Mikael Imru became {{advocates for}} land reform, and he {{went as far as}} distributing his own {{extensive}} estates to his tenant farmers. Due to these political views, Ras Imru was nicknamed [...] "the Red Ras" [...] by <b>many</b> <b>contemporaries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The speech alarmed local non-Mormons {{attending}} the celebration. Later, the church presidency published the July 4th Oration, causing considerable agitation and further stoking anti-Mormon sentiment throughout northwestern Missouri. <b>Many</b> <b>contemporaries</b> and later historians cite the July 4th Oration as {{a contributing factor}} to the 1838 Mormon War.|$|R
