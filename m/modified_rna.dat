50|$|Bridged {{nucleic acids}} (BNAs) are <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> nucleotides. They are {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as constrained or inaccessible RNA molecules. BNA monomers can contain a five-membered, six-membered or even a seven-membered bridged structure with a “fixed” C3’-endo sugar puckering. The bridge is synthetically incorporated at the 2’, 4’-position of the ribose to afford a 2’, 4’-BNA monomer.

BNAs are structurally rigid oligo-nucleotides with increased binding affinities and stability.|$|E
50|$|TGMP is {{converted}} by phosphorylation to thioguanosine diphosphate (TGDP) and thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP). Simultaneously deoxyribosyl analogs are formed, via the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. The TGMP, TGDP and TGTP are collectively named 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). 6-TGN are cytotoxic to cells by: (1) incorporation into DNA during the synthesis phase (S-phase) of the cell; and (2) through inhibition of the GTP-binding protein (G protein) Rac1, which regulates the Rac/Vav pathway. An additional effect may {{be derived from}} the incorporation of 6-thioguanine into RNA. This yields a <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> strand which cannot be read by the ribosomes.|$|E
5000|$|A locked {{nucleic acid}} (LNA), often {{referred}} to as inaccessible RNA, is a <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> nucleotide. The ribose moiety of an LNA nucleotide is modified with an extra bridge connecting the 2' oxygen and 4' carbon. The bridge [...] "locks" [...] the ribose in the 3'-endo (North) conformation, which is often found in the A-form duplexes. LNA nucleotides can be mixed with DNA or RNA residues in the oligonucleotide whenever desired and hybridize with DNA or RNA according to Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. Such oligomers are synthesized chemically and are commercially available. The locked ribose conformation enhances base stacking and backbone pre-organization. This significantly increases the hybridization properties (melting temperature) of oligonucleotides.|$|E

To illustrate the utility of this effective approach, we explore its scope and limitations via the assembly of several altered hammerhead (HH) ribozymes and a singly modified HH substrate.

40|$|A {{modified}} form of Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase (RNA nucleotidyltransferase) {{has been}} isolated that exhibits distinctive transcriptional specificity.

40|$|Background: A novel {{coronavirus}} {{was recently}} {{identified as the}} aetiological agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Molecular assays currently available for detection of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-Cov) have low sensitivity during the early stage of the illness. Objective: To develop and evaluate a sensitive diagnostic test for SARS by optimizing the viral RNA extraction methods and by applying real-time quantitative RT-PCR technology. Study design: 50 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples collected from days 1 - 3 of disease onset from SARS patients in whom SARS CoV infections was subsequently serologically confirmed and 30 negative control samples were studied. Samples were tested by: (1) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a routine RNA extraction method (Lancet 361 (2003) 1319), (2) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> extraction method, (3) a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay with a <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> extraction method. Results: Of 50 NPA specimens collected during the first 3 days of illness, 11 (22 %) were positive in our first generation RT-PCR assay. With a modification in the RNA extraction protocol, 22 (44 %) samples were positive in the conventional RT-PCR assay. By combining the <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> extraction method and real-time quantitative PCR technology, 40 (80 %) of these samples were positive in the real-time RT-PCR assay. No positive signal was observed in the negative controls. Conclusion: By optimizing RNA extraction methods and applying quantitative real time RT-PCR technologies, the sensitivity of tests for early diagnosis of SARS can be greatly enhanced. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported the in vitro {{selection of a}} ribozyme that catalyzes an aldol reaction between a levulinic amide aldol donor and a benzaldehyde substrate. The selection scheme involved the priming of the RNA library with a levulinic amide aldol donor group that was introduced via transcription priming {{in the presence of}} a modified guanosine mononucleotide derivative. Here we provide a detailed description of the synthesis of the ribozyme substrates and the substrate oligonucleotides used for its isolation and characterization. The aldol donor group was attached to the phosphate moiety of guanosine monophosphate via a photocleavable linker molecule. This initiator nucleotide was efficiently incorporated into RNA molecules of differing sizes and composition by transcription priming with T 7 RNA polymerase. With this method <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> oligonucleotides as small as a 6 -mer sequence can be generated. A temperature profile of the intermolecular reaction indicates that the <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> hexamer binds the ribozyme largely by Watson-Crick pairing and only to a minor extent via the non-RNA moiety, whereas the ribozyme appears to have evolved a specific binding site for the aldehyde substrate...|$|E

40|$|Over 100 {{different}} chemical {{types of}} modifications {{have been identified}} in thousands of sites in tRNAs, rRNAs, mRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and other RNAs. Some modifications are highly conserved, while others are more specialized. They include methylation of bases and the ribose backbone, rotation, and reduction of uridine, base deamination, elaborate addition of ring structures, carbohydrate moieties, and more. We have developed a systematic approach to detect and quantify the extent of known RNA modifications. The method is based on the enzymatic ligation of oligonucleotides using the modified or unmodified RNA as the template. The efficiency of ligation is very sensitive to the presence and the type of modifications. First, two oligo pairs for each type of modification are identified. One pair greatly prefers ligation using the unmodified RNA template over the <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> template or vice versa. The other pair has equal reactivity with unmodified and <b>modified</b> <b>RNA.</b> Second, separate ligations with each of the two oligo pairs and the total RNA mixture are performed to detect {{the presence or absence of}} modifications.

40|$|We have {{determined}} {{the effects on}} splicing of sulfur substitution of the non-bridging oxygens in the phosphodiester bond at the 5 ' splice site of a pre-mRNA intron. Pre-mRNAs containing stereochemically pure Rp and Sp phosphorothioate isomers were produced by ligation of a chemically synthesized <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> oligonucleotide to enzymatically synthesized RAs. When these modified pre-mRNA substrates were tested for in vitro splicing activity in a HeLa cell nuclear extract system, the RNA with the Rp diastereomeric phosphorothioate was not spliced while the Sp diastereomeric RNA spliced readily. The sulfur-containing branched trinucleotide was purified from the splicing reaction of the Sp RNA and analyzed by cleavage with a stereospecific nuclease. The {{results showed that the}} Sp phosphorothioate was inverted during the splicing reaction to the Rp configuration; a finding previously obtained for a Group I self-splicing RNA. This inversion of configuration is consistent with a transesterification mechanism for pre-mRNA splicing. The lack of splicing of the Rp <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> also suggests that the pro-Rp oxygen at the 5 ' splice site is involved in a critical chemical contact in the splicing mechanism. Additionally, we have found that the HeLa cell RNA debranching enzyme is inactive on branches containing an Rp phosphorothioate...|$|E
