5|$|<b>Metagenomics</b> has the {{potential}} to advance knowledge {{in a wide variety of}} fields. It can also be applied to solve practical challenges in medicine, engineering, agriculture, sustainability and ecology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metagenomics</b> {{can improve}} {{strategies}} for monitoring {{the impact of}} pollutants on ecosystems and for cleaning up contaminated environments. Increased understanding of how microbial communities cope with pollutants improves assessments of the potential of contaminated sites to recover from pollution and increases the chances of bioaugmentation or biostimulation trials to succeed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metagenomics</b> {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Microbial {{communities}} {{produce a}} vast array of biologically active chemicals that are used in competition and communication. Many of the drugs in use today were originally uncovered in microbes; recent progress in mining the rich genetic resource of non-culturable microbes has led to the discovery of new genes, enzymes, and natural products. The application of <b>metagenomics</b> has allowed the development of commodity and fine chemicals, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where the benefit of enzyme-catalyzed chiral synthesis is increasingly recognized.|$|E
5|$|The data {{generated}} by <b>metagenomics</b> experiments are both enormous and inherently noisy, containing fragmented data representing {{as many as}} 10,000 species. The sequencing of the cow rumen metagenome generated 279 gigabases, or 279 billion base pairs of nucleotide sequence data, while the human gut microbiome gene catalog identified 3.3 million genes assembled from 567.7 gigabases of sequence data. Collecting, curating, and extracting useful biological information from datasets of this size represent significant computational challenges for researchers.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficient}} industrial-scale {{deconstruction of}} biomass requires novel enzymes with higher productivity and lower cost. Metagenomic {{approaches to the}} analysis of complex microbial communities allow the targeted screening of enzymes with industrial applications in biofuel production, such as glycoside hydrolases. Furthermore, knowledge of how these microbial communities function is required to control them, and <b>metagenomics</b> is a key tool in their understanding. Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like biogas fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|Another medical {{study as}} part of the MetaHit (<b>Metagenomics</b> of the Human Intestinal Tract) project {{consisted}} of 124 individuals from Denmark and Spain consisting of healthy, overweight, and irritable bowel disease patients. The study attempted to categorize the depth and phylogenetic diversity of gastrointestinal bacteria. Using Illumina GA sequence data and SOAPdenovo, a de Bruijn graph-based tool specifically designed for assembly short reads, they were able to generate 6.58 million contigs greater than 500 bp for a total contig length of 10.3 Gb and a N50 length of 2.2 kb.|$|E
5|$|<b>Metagenomics</b> allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{sequencing}} {{begins with}} a culture of identical cells {{as a source of}} DNA. However, early metagenomic studies revealed that there are probably large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be cultured and thus cannot be sequenced. These early studies focused on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences which are relatively short, often conserved within a species, and generally different between species. Many 16S rRNA sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured species, indicating that there are numerous non-isolated organisms. These surveys of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes taken directly from the environment revealed that cultivation based methods find less than 1% of the bacterial and archaeal species in a sample. Much of the interest in <b>metagenomics</b> comes from these discoveries that showed {{that the vast majority of}} microorganisms had previously gone unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The microbial communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional <b>metagenomics</b> strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E
5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun <b>metagenomics</b> provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metagenomics</b> is the {{analysis}} of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metagenomics</b> {{has allowed}} the in-water {{detection}} of bacteriophages that was not possible previously.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} for third-generation sequencing technologies in <b>metagenomics</b> is their speed of sequencing {{in comparison to}} second generation techniques. Speed of sequencing is important for example in the clinical setting (ie pathogen identification), to allow for efficient diagnosis and timely clinical actions.|$|E
25|$|The per base {{sequencing}} cost {{is still}} {{significantly more than}} that of MiSeq. However, the prospect of supplementing reference databases with full-length sequences from organisms below the limit of detection from the Sanger approach; this could possibly greatly help the identification of organisms in <b>metagenomics.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to {{the current generation of}} sequencing technologies, third generation sequencing has the obvious advantage of producing much longer reads. It is expected that these longer read lengths will alleviate numerous computational challenges surrounding genome assembly, transcript reconstruction, and <b>metagenomics</b> among other important areas of modern biology and medicine.|$|E
25|$|De novo {{assembly}} is {{the alternative}} genome assembly approach to reference alignment. It {{refers to the}} reconstruction of whole genome sequences entirely from raw sequence reads. This method would be chosen {{when there is no}} reference genome, when the species of the given organism is unknown as in <b>metagenomics,</b> or when there exist genetic variants of interest that may not be detected by reference genome alignment.|$|E
25|$|Probiotics {{have been}} the subject of {{research}} to see whether the health claims made for them have any supporting evidence. Overall scientific demonstration of probiotic effects requires defining a healthy microbiota and interactions between microbiota and host, and the difficulty to characterize probiotic effectiveness in health and disease. Recent developments of high-throughput sequencing technology and the consequent progresses of <b>metagenomics</b> represent a new approach for the future of probiotics research.|$|E
25|$|The {{biological}} {{resource for}} drug discovery from natural products remains abundant, with small percentages of microorganisms, plant species, and insects assessed for bioactivity. In enormous numbers, bacteria and marine microorganisms remain unexamined. As of 2008, {{the field of}} <b>metagenomics</b> was proposed to examine genes and their function in soil microbes, but most pharmaceutical firms have not exploited this resource fully, choosing instead to develop “diversity-oriented synthesis” from libraries of known drugs or natural sources for lead compounds with higher potential for bioactivity.|$|E
25|$|The entire gut flora of a termite {{very closely}} related to N. corniger has been {{analysed}} using <b>metagenomics</b> to determine the function of different microbes in their gut. Typical to all wood-feeding higher termites, bacterial gut microbiota in the guts of N. corniger are dominated by insect-specific members of TG3_(candidate_phylum), Fibrobacteres, and Spirochaetes. It {{has also been shown}} that the same bacterial lineages are preferentially enriched in the cellulolytic bacterial community that is associated with wood particles in the gut.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} processes and protocols of DNA sequencing {{have continued to}} evolve, largely driven by advancements in bio-chemical methods, instrumentation, and automation techniques. There is now {{a wide range of}} problems that DNA sequencing has made in-roads into, including <b>metagenomics</b> and medical (cancer) sequencing. There are important factors in these scenarios that classical theory does not account for. Recent work has begun to focus on resolving the effects of some of these issues. The level of mathematics becomes commensurately more sophisticated.|$|E
25|$|Zamilon was {{discovered}} in 2013, in Acanthamoeba polyphaga amoebae co-infected with the giant virus Mont1, isolated from a Tunisian soil sample. As of 2015, Zamilon {{is one of three}} virophages to have been isolated physically, the others being Sputnik and Mavirus; several other virophage DNAs have been discovered using <b>metagenomics</b> but have not been characterised physically. A related strain, named Zamilon 2, {{was discovered}} by metagenomic analysis of a North American poplar wood chip bioreactor in 2015. Another virophage, Rio Negro, is also closely related to Sputnik.|$|E
25|$|By {{enabling}} direct {{sequencing of}} single DNA molecules, third generation sequencing technologies {{have the capability}} to produce substantially longer reads than second generation sequencing. Such advantage has critical implications for both genome science and the study of biology in general. However, due to various technical challenges, third generation sequencing has error rates at almost unrepairable levels, rendering the technologies impractical for certain applications such as de novo genome assembly. These technologies are undergoing active development and therefore it is expected that there will be further improvements to the high error rates. For applications that are more tolerant to error rates such as <b>metagenomics</b> or larger structural variant calling, third generation sequencing has been found to outperform existing methods.|$|E
25|$|Microbiology {{is a broad}} {{scientific}} discipline pertaining {{to the study of}} that life which is best viewed under a microscope. It encompasses several fields that are of direct relevance to geobiology, and the tools of microbiology all pertain to geobiology. Environmental microbiology is especially entangled in geobiology since it seeks an understanding of the actual organisms and processes that are relevant in nature, as opposed to the traditional lab-based approach to microbiology. Microbial ecology is similar, but tend to focus more on lab studies and the relationships between organisms within a community, as well as within the ecosystem of their chemical and geological physical environment. Both rely on techniques such as sample collection from diverse environments, <b>metagenomics,</b> DNA sequencing, and statistics.|$|E
25|$|For example, an {{intriguing}} problem in geobiology {{is the role}} of organisms in the global cycling of methane. Genetics has revealed that the methane monooxygenase gene (pmo) is used for oxidizing methane and is present in all aerobic methane-oxidizers, or methanotrophs. The presence of DNA sequences of the pmo gene in the environment {{can be used as a}} proxy for methanotrophy. A more generalizable tool is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which is found in bacteria and archaea. This gene evolves very slowly over time and is not usually horizontally transferred, and so it is often used to distinguish different taxonomic units of organisms in the environment. In this way, genes are clues to organismal metabolism and identity. Genetics enables us to ask 'who is there?' and 'what are they doing?' This approach is called <b>metagenomics.</b>|$|E

500|$|<b>Metagenomics</b> is {{the study}} of genetic {{material}} recovered directly from environmental samples. The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics, ecogenomics or community genomics. While traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing and genomics rely upon cultivated clonal cultures, early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the 16S rRNA gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample. Such work revealed {{that the vast majority of}} microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation-based methods. Recent studies use either [...] "shotgun" [...] or PCR directed sequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities. Because of its ability to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life, <b>metagenomics</b> offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world. As the price of DNA sequencing continues to fall, <b>metagenomics</b> now allows microbial ecology to be investigated at a much greater scale and detail than before.|$|E
500|$|A key goal in {{comparative}} <b>metagenomics</b> {{is to identify}} microbial group(s) which are responsible for conferring specific characteristics to a given environment. However, due to issues in the sequencing technologies artifacts need to be accounted for like in metagenomeSeq. Others have characterized [...] inter-microbial interactions between the resident microbial groups. A GUI-based comparative metagenomic analysis application called Community-Analyzer has been developed by Kuntal et al.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "metagenomics" [...] {{was first}} used by Jo Handelsman, Jon Clardy, Robert M. Goodman, Sean F. Brady, and others, and first {{appeared}} in publication in 1998. The term metagenome referenced {{the idea that a}} collection of genes sequenced from the environment could be analyzed in a way analogous to the study of a single genome. Recently, Kevin Chen and Lior Pachter (researchers at the University of California, Berkeley) defined <b>metagenomics</b> as [...] "the application of modern genomics technique without the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species".|$|E
500|$|Metagenomic {{sequencing}} {{is particularly}} {{useful in the}} study of viral communities. As viruses lack a shared universal phylogenetic marker (as 16S RNA for bacteria and archaea, and 18S RNA for eukarya), the only way to access the genetic diversity of the viral community from an environmental sample is through <b>metagenomics.</b> Viral metagenomes (also called viromes) should thus provide more and more information about viral diversity and evolution. For example, a metagenomic pipeline called Giant Virus Finder showed the first evidence of existence of giant viruses in a saline desert [...] and in Antarctic dry valleys ...|$|E
500|$|Several tools {{have been}} {{developed}} to integrate metadata and sequence data, allowing downstream comparative analyses of different datasets using a number of ecological indices. In 2007, Folker Meyer and Robert Edwards and a team at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago released the <b>Metagenomics</b> Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology server (MG-RAST) a community resource for metagenome data set analysis. As of June 2012 over 14.8 terabases (14x1012 bases) [...] of DNA have been analyzed, with more than 10,000 public data sets freely available for comparison within MG-RAST. Over 8,000 users now have submitted a total of 50,000 metagenomes to MG-RAST. The Integrated Microbial Genomes/Metagenomes (IMG/M) system also provides a collection of tools for functional analysis of microbial communities based on their metagenome sequence, based upon reference isolate genomes included from the [...] (IMG) system and the [...] project.|$|E

Functional analysis is done by comparing the recovered sequences to databases of metagenomic annotations such as KEGG.
