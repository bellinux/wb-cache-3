40|$|SummaryTreacher Collins Syndrome - or <b>mandibulofacial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> – {{is a rare}} {{condition}} that presents several craniofacial deformities of different levels. This is a congenital malformation involving {{the first and second}} branchial arches. Incidence is estimated to range between 1 - 40, 000 to 1 - 70, 000 of live births. The disorder is characterized by abnormalities of the auricular pinna, hypoplasia of facial bones, antimongoloid slanting palpebral fissures with coloboma of the lower eyelids and cleft palate. Treacher Collins Syndrome is rarely associated with choanal atresia. A multidisciplinary team, including craniofacial surgeon, ophthalmologist, speech therapist, dental surgeon and otorhinolaryngologist, is the most appropriate setting to manage these patients.

40|$|AbstractIn the mouse, {{disruption}} of the endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) gene causes severe craniofacial deformities, including mandibular hypoplasia. Since the phenotype of ET- 1 -deficient mice shows features in common with inherited human <b>mandibulofacial</b> <b>dysostosis,</b> we investigated the presence of ET- 1 and its receptors in human fetal craniofacial tissues of 9 - to 12 -week-old fetuses. We found that ET- 1 is immunolocalized in the epithelial cells of the oral cavity. Radioligand binding studies indicate the presence of elevated concentrations of both ETA and ETB receptors in membranes derived from fetal jaws. Using autoradiography, 125 I-ET- 1 binding sites were shown to be localized within the embryonic mandibular process of the oral cavity, where they were confined to the mesenchymal-derived osteogenic cells.

40|$|Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS) is {{the most}} common of the human <b>mandibulofacial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> disorders.

TCOF 1 encodes a low complexity protein of 1, 411 amino acids, whose predicted protein structure reveals repeated motifs that mirror the organization of its exons. These motifs are shared with nucleolar trafficking proteins in other species and are predicted to be highly phosphorylated by casein kinase. Consistent with this, the full-length TCOF 1 protein sequence also contains putative nuclear and nucleolar localization signals. Throughout the open reading frame, we detected an additional eight mutations in TCS families and several polymorphisms. We postulate that TCS results from defects in a nucleolar trafficking protein that is critically required during human craniofacial development...|$|E

40|$|Background: Mutations in EFTUD 2 were {{proven to}} cause a very {{distinct}} <b>mandibulofacial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> type Guion-Almeida (MFDGA, OMIM # 610536). Recently, gross deletions and mutations in EFTUD 2 were determined to cause syndromic esophageal atresia (EA), as well. We set forth to find further conditions caused by mutations in the EFTUD 2 gene (OMIM * 603892). Methods and results: We performed exome sequencing in two familial cases with clinical features overlapping with MFDGA and EA, but which were previously assumed to represent distinct entities, a syndrome with esophageal atresia, hypoplasia of zygomatic complex, microcephaly, cup-shaped ears, congenital heart defect, and intellectual disability in {{a mother and her}} two children [AJMG 143 A(11) : 1135 - 1142, 2007] and a supposedly autosomal recessive oto-facial syndrome with midline malformations in two sisters [AJMG 132 (4) : 398 - 401, 2005]. While the analysis of our exome data was in progress, a recent publication made EFTUD 2 mutations highly likely in these families. This hypothesis could be confirmed with exome as well as with Sanger sequencing. Also, in three further sporadic patients, clinically overlapping to these two families, de novo mutations within EFTUD 2 were identified by Sanger sequencing. Our clinical and molecular workup of the patients discloses a broad phenotypic spectrum, and describes for the first time an instance of germline mosaicism for an EFTUD 2 mutation. Conclusions: The clinical features of the eight patients described here further broaden the phenotypic spectrum caused by EFTUD 2 mutations or deletions. We here show, that it not only includes <b>mandibulofacial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> type Guion-Almeida, which should be reclassified as an acrofacial dysostosis because of thumb anomalies (present in 12 / 35 or 34 % of patients) and syndromic esophageal atresia [JMG 49 (12). 737 - 746, 2012], but also the two new syndromes, namely oto-facial syndrome with midline malformations published by Megarbane et al.

40|$|The acrofacial dysostoses (AFD) are a {{clinically}} and causally heterogeneous {{group of}} conditions characterized by <b>mandibulofacial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> {{and a variety}} of limb anomalies. Several abnormalities affecting different internal organs and the central nervous system (CNS) have been described.

Other forms of "true AFD" have been described as Kelly, Reynolds, Arens (also Tel Aviv form), Rodríguez (or Madrid form), Richieri-Costa, and Patterson-Stevenson-Fontaine types. However, whether they are distinct entities or represent variants of the same condition remains unclear.

40|$|<b>Mandibulofacial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> with {{microcephaly}} (MFDM) {{is a rare}} sporadic syndrome comprising craniofacial malformations, microcephaly, developmental delay, and {{a recognizable}} dysmorphic appearance. Major sequelae, including choanal atresia, sensorineural hearing loss, and cleft palate, each occur in {{a significant proportion of}} affected individuals. We present detailed clinical findings in 12 unrelated individuals with MFDM; these 12 individuals compose the largest reported cohort to date. To define the etiology of MFDM, we employed whole-exome sequencing of four unrelated affected individuals and identified heterozygous mutations or deletions of EFTUD 2 in all four. Validation studies of eight additional individuals with MFDM demonstrated causative EFTUD 2 mutations in all affected individuals tested. A range of EFTUD 2 -mutation types, including null alleles and frameshifts, is seen in MFDM, consistent with haploinsufficiency; segregation is de novo in all cases assessed to date. U 5 - 116 kD, the protein encoded by EFTUD 2, is a highly conserved spliceosomal GTPase with a central regulatory role in catalytic splicing and post-splicing-complex disassembly.

40|$|The endothelin {{receptor}} type A (EDNRA) {{signaling pathway}} {{is essential for the}} establishment of mandibular identity during development of the first pharyngeal arch. We report four unrelated individuals with the syndrome <b>mandibulofacial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> with alopecia (MFDA) who have de novo missense variants in EDNRA. Three of the four individuals have the same substitution, p. Tyr 129 Phe. Tyr 129 is known to determine the selective affinity of EDNRA for endothelin 1 (EDN 1), its major physiological ligand, and the p. Tyr 129 Phe variant increases the affinity of the receptor for EDN 3, its non-preferred ligand, by two orders of magnitude. The fourth individual has a somatic mosaic substitution, p. Glu 303 Lys, and was previously described as having Johnson-McMillin syndrome. The zygomatic arch of individuals with MFDA resembles that of mice in which EDNRA is ectopically activated in the maxillary prominence, resulting in a maxillary to mandibular transformation, suggesting that the p. Tyr 129 Phe variant causes an EDNRA gain of function in the developing upper jaw. Our in vitro and in vivo assays suggested complex, context-dependent effects of the EDNRA variants on downstream signaling. Our findings highlight the importance of finely tuned regulation of EDNRA signaling during human craniofacial development and suggest that modification of endothelin receptor-ligand specificity was a key step in the evolution of vertebrate jaws...|$|E
