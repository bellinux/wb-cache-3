5000|$|Considering {{geological}} {{and structural}} units of Iran, three main structural units or zones could be distinguished in Iran. These units or zones {{are separated from}} each other by ophiolite-bearing sutures. Other criteria such as structural style, crustal character and age of basement consolidation, age and intensity of deformation, age and nature of magmatism, are used to subdivide these major zones into smaller elements. The three major units and their main constituents could {{be defined as the}} southern, central and northern units. The southern unit has a crystalline basement consolidated in the Precambrian time and a platform-type Paleozoic development and comprises the Zagros folded belt, southern and southwestern parts of the Zagros. This section made a part of the Arabian Plate that was located on the margin of Rodinia and Pannotia in the Neoproterozoic, and of Gondwana in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. The central unit, which comprises the central Iran and the Alborz, is interpreted as an assemblage of fragments that were {{in the vicinity of the}} Arabian Plate and formed a marginal section of Rodinia and Pannotia in the Neoproterozoic and of Gondwana in the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian. These fragments were detached from Gondwana in the Carboniferous. They were submerged, moved northwards, and were finally attached to the Eurasian section of the northern supercontinent Laurasia in the Late Triassic. These fragments or microplates were fused together and made the Iranian Plate which was rejoined by Gondwanic Afro-Arabia in the Late Cretaceous. As Afro-Arabia moved northwards towards Eurasia, the Arabian Plate ultimately collided with the Iranian Plate in the Miocene. Finally there is the northern unit which is separated from the central unit by the North Iran Suture. It is characterized by continental crust including remnants of more or less cratonized former Paleozoic oceanic crust that seems to reflect the Paleotethys. The northern unit represents a <b>marginal</b> <b>strip</b> of the Hercynian realm of Central Asia- broadly overlapped by the Alpine realm. It was deformed and largely consolidated by the Early Cimmerian folding and the Late Alpine folding. The northern unit comprises the South Caspian Depression and the Kopet Dagh Range. These three main structural units are divided into some smaller geological and structural subdivisions which include the following zones: ...|$|E

40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of the new Brazilian Forest Code (Law 4, 771 / 65) legislative reform, this paper shows the evolution of legal protection to the riparian system (<b>marginal</b> <b>strips),</b> defined as vegetation strings along rivers and other water bodies, which vary according to the water body width. The demarcation of permanent preservation areas along rivers is a complex process which has led to doubts and conflicts. Riparian systems are spaces aimed at the agricultural expansion and, thus, they’re under pressure. The analysis showed that the limitation posed by the new rule agrees with the principle of reasonableness. The new Brazilian Forest Code review, which is currently included in the National Congress agenda, will be able to positively contribute to achieve the possible and desired balance between respect to the natural environment and expansion of land uses...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the use of}} a lid crease incision for upper eyelid margin rotation in cicatricial entropion combining internal traction on the anterior lamella, tarsotomy, and tarsal overlap without external sutures. Methods: Surgical description: The main steps of the procedure consisted of exposure of the entire tarsal plate up to the eyelashes followed by tarsotomy through the conjunctiva. A double-armed 6. 0 polyglactin suture was then passed through the distal tarsal fragment to the marginal section of the orbicularis oculi muscle. As the sutures were tied, the distal tarsus advanced over the marginal section, and traction was exerted on the <b>marginal</b> <b>strip</b> of the orbicularis muscle. There were no bolsters or external knots. The pretarsal skin-muscle flap was closed with a 6. 0 plain gut suture. Results: We used this procedure at a tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia from 2013 to 2014. Sixty upper lids of 40 patients (23 women and 17 men) were operated on, with an age range of 44 - 99 years [mean ± standard deviation (SD) = 70. 9 ± 13. 01 years]. Bilateral surgery was performed on 21 patients. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 12 months (mean 3. 0 ± 2. 71 months). Forty percent of the patients (24 lids) had more than 3 months' follow-up. The postoperative lid margin position was good in all cases. Trichiasis (two lashes) was observed in only one patient with unilateral entropion on the medial aspect of the operated lid. Conclusions: The upper lid margin can be effectively rotated through a lid crease incision with internal sutures. The technique combines the main mechanisms of the Wies and Trabut approaches and avoids the use of bolsters or external sutures, which require a second consultation to be removed. Some other lid problems, such as ptosis, retraction, or dermatochalasis, can be concomitantly addressed during the procedure...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Mucoadhesive {{nanoparticles}} {{were compared}} with non-aggregated constituent polymers for effect on pre-corneal residence of dexamethasone phosphate (DP) or met-enkephalin (ME), administered by eye-drops to rabbits. OBJECTIVE: Deepening the knowledge of ophthalmic nanoparticulate systems in terms of ability to prolong pre-corneal residence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medicated nanoparticles resulted from gelation of quaternary ammonium-chitosan conjugate or its thiolated derivative with hyaluronan {{in the presence of}} drug. Particles were analyzed by light scattering. Dialysis removed non-encapsulated drug, dynamic dialysis measured drug-polymer interactions, and lyophilization-stabilized product. Dispersions were regenerated from lyophilized products. Also solutions of non-thiolated or thiolated chitosan derivative were administered. Mean drug residence time (MRT) in tears was determined by collecting samples from lower <b>marginal</b> tear <b>strip</b> of albino rabbits using capillaries. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Nanoparticle size of regenerated dispersions was 400 - 430 nm (DP-systems), 360 - 370 nm (ME-systems); the drug content was 2. 5 mg/mL (DP) or 0. 3 mg/mL (ME). The MRT for DP nanoparticles from non-thiolated derivative was higher than that for non-aggregated polymer, due to stronger concurrent interactions of positively charged nanoparticles with ocular surface and drug. Thiolated polymer nanoparticles and non-aggregated parent polymer, both interacting weakly with DP, showed similar MRT values. The MRT of ME could only be enhanced by protecting drug from enzymatic hydrolysis. This was done by nanoparticle systems, whereas non-aggregated polymers were ineffective. CONCLUSION: Developing a nanoparticle system rather than a solution of mucoadhesive polymer, for prolonging pre-corneal residence, is convenient, provided nanoparticles interact strongly with both ocular surface and drug, or protect drug from metabolic degradation...|$|R
40|$|IL- 2 {{receptor}} {{is expressed}} at low levels on adult blood lymphocytes, and {{at lower levels}} on cord blood cells. IL- 2 receptor alpha and beta chain expression increases gradually from 0 - 18 months of age. The level of soluble CD 25 (IL- 2 receptor alpha chain) {{has been reported to}} be elevated in cord blood. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that adult cells express 10 times as much CD 25 mRNA as cord cells. Cord plasma showed only a <b>marginal</b> ability to <b>strip</b> CD 25 from the membrane. To assess the functional consequences of low IL- 2 receptor expression, cord and adult cells were activated in vitro. The response was stimulus-dependent, but cord cells upregulated CD 25 readily. Cord and adult cells proliferated in an IL- 2 -dependent assay to a similar extent. Infants suffering acute infection showed marginally higher levels of membrane CD 25 expression than infants without overt infection. Thus neonatal and infant lymphocytes express lower levels of IL- 2 receptors than adult cells, reflecting lower mRNA concentrations at least for CD 25; they are able to up-regulate receptors in response to in vitro stimulation and are able to respond in vitro to IL- 2 -dependent stimulation; however in vivo there may be a dampening down of the IL- 2 system in infancy...|$|R
