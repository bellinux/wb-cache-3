To investigate whether the Wnt/b-catenin {{signal transduction}} pathway is involved in canine cutaneous melanomagenesis, 18 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded canine cutaneous <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> tissues were exam-ined. For cloning and sequencing of the full-length canine ctnnb 1 gene encoding b-catenin, conserved sequences of the human and mouse ctnnb 1 gene were used to design the primers.

We have selected 21 lines in which we observed a reproducible lacZ expression in blood cells. These lines were classified according to the subsets of hemocytes in which lacZ was expressed, and we identified five lines that can be used as lamellocyte markers. Three lines were selected for further analysis. The first exhibited strong lacZ expression in all lamellocytes. The second expressed lacZ in plasmatocytes and lamellocytes, and exhibited a <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> phenotype in larvae homozygous for the insertion. A third line showed a striking insertion-linked phenotype of melanized lymph glands (the hematopoietic organ), which resulted in the total absence of circulating hemocytes in the mutant larvae.

For type A, tissue-specific reporter gene activity was determined. For type B, a variation of enhancer detection was devised in which β-galactosidase is assayed spectrophotometrically with and without bacterial infection. Because of immune system involvement in <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> formation, a third type was hypothesized to be found among types A and B: genes that, when mutated, have a <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> phenotype. Enhancer detector strains (2800) were screened for type A, 900 for B, and 11 retained for further analysis.

Drosophila melanogaster offers a low complexity model to study MPNs as JAK/STAT signaling is simplified with only one JAK [Hopscotch (Hop) ] and one STAT (Stat 92 E). hopTumorous-lethal (Tum-l) is a gain-of-function mutation that causes dramatic expansion of myeloid cells, which then form lethal <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors.</b> Through an F 1 deficiency (Df) screen, we identified 11 suppressors and 35 enhancers of <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> in hopTum-l animals. Dfs that uncover the Hippo (Hpo) pathway genes expanded (ex) and warts (wts) strongly enhanced the hopTum-l tumor burden, as did mutations in ex, wts, and other Hpo pathway genes. Target genes of the Hpo pathway effector Yorkie (Yki) were significantly upregulated in hopTum-l blood cells, indicating that Yki signaling was increased. Ectopic hematopoietic activation of Yki in otherwise wild-type animals increased hemocyte proliferation but did not induce <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors.</b> However, hematopoietic depletion of Yki significantly reduced the hopTum-l tumor burden, demonstrating that Yki is required for <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> in this background.

To determine {{the reason for the}} difference in host response against the parasitoid eggs, lamellocytes (hemocytes that encapsulate foreign objects and form capsules around endogenous tissues in <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> mutants) were examined in host larvae parasitized by the five Leptopilina strains. Parasitization by the three L. heterotoma strains affected the morphology of host lamellocytes and suppressed endogenous melanotic capsule formation in <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> hosts. L 104 did not alter the morphology of host lamellocytes nor block tumor formation in <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> mutant hosts. The morphology of some lamellocytes was affected by G 317 parasitization but host lamellocytes were still capable of forming melanotic tumors and encapsulating dead supernumerary parasitoid larvae. Therefore, the eggs of strains affecting lamellocyte morphology are protected from encapsulation by the host's blood cells. L. heterotoma eggs float freely in the host hemocoel but L. boulardi eggs are attached to host tissue surfaces.

40|$|Abstract Background In metazoans, the {{hematopoietic system}} {{plays a key}} role both in normal {{development}} and in defense of the organism. In Drosophila, the cellular immune response involves three types of blood cells: plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes. This last cell type is barely present in healthy larvae, but its production is strongly induced upon wasp parasitization or in mutant contexts affecting larval blood cell homeostasis. Notably, several zygotic mutations leading to melanotic mass (or "tumor") formation in larvae have been associated to the deregulated differentiation of lamellocytes. To gain further insights into the gene regulatory network and the mechanisms controlling larval blood cell homeostasis, we conducted a tissue-specific loss of function screen using hemocyte-specific Gal 4 drivers and UAS-dsRNA transgenic lines. Results By targeting around 10 % of the Drosophila genes, this in vivo RNA interference screen allowed us to recover 59 <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> suppressor genes. In line with previous studies, we show that <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> formation is associated with the precocious differentiation of stem-cell like blood progenitors in the larval hematopoietic organ (the lymph gland) and the spurious differentiation of lamellocytes. We also find that <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> formation can be elicited by defects either in the fat body, the embryo-derived hemocytes or the lymph gland. In addition, we provide a definitive confirmation that lymph gland is not the only source of lamellocytes as embryo-derived plasmatocytes can differentiate into lamellocytes either upon wasp infection or upon loss of function of the Friend of GATA cofactor U-shaped. Conclusions In this study, we identify 55 genes whose function had not been linked to blood cell development or function before in Drosophila. Moreover our analyses reveal an unanticipated plasticity of embryo-derived plasmatocytes, thereby shedding new light on blood cell lineage relationship, and pinpoint the Friend of GATA transcription cofactor U-shaped as a key regulator of the plasmatocyte to lamellocyte transformation. </p...|$|E

Interestingly, Heix was specifically expressed in plasmatocyte/macrophage lineage in srp driven EGFP positive cells on the head mesoderm during embryogenesis, while it was highly expressed in crystal cells in the primary lobes of the third instar larval lymph gland.

Donor fat bodies from various ages of larvae were accepted (remained unencapsulated) in tu-Sz ts hosts whereas fat bodies from donors with everted spiracles and all subsequent stages of development that were tested were rejected (encapsulated). Since the demarcation between acceptance and rejection by the tu-Sz ts blood cells did not coincide with the gross morphological changes that appear in the fat body during metamorphosis (dissolution of the basement membrane and dispersal of the freed fat body cells at pupation), we compared acceptable and nonacceptable fat body surfaces by three other methods. Fat body surface ultrastructure was examined, fat bodies were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated lectins, and fat body surfaces were reacted with a monoclonal antibody specific for basement membrane. These approaches did not uncover fat body surface changes associated with eversion of the anterior spiracles, suggesting that recognition of tissue surface heterogeneities by the insect hemocytes exceeds the resolving power {{of the other three}} methods. However, the monoclonal antibody fails to bind to the basement membrane of D. virilis larvae, whose fat body is always rejected in tu-Sz ts hosts. This supports our suggestion that the molecular architecture of the basement membrane may be important in eliciting the encapsulation response...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGlial cell deficient/Glial cells missing (Glide/Gcm) {{transcription}} factor {{is expressed in}} all glial precursors of the Drosophila embryo. Gcm is necessary and sufficient to induce glial differentiation but also {{plays a role in}} other cell types, by interacting with specific factors. To find potential partners of Gcm which trigger these other pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified dpias, a gene involved in post-embryonic hematopoiesis. dpias larvae show <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> due to excess of lamellocytes, a hemocyte lineage that is involved in non-self recognition. We here show that blocking Gcm activity also triggers <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> and that gcm interacts genetically with dpias. Moreover, the members of the Janus Kinase (JAK) / Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway, which are known for their role in the vertebrate and invertebrate immune system and are required for dpias-dependent tumor formation, act downstream of Gcm. Altogether, this study identifies an unpredicted role of Gcm, dictated by its cofactor dpias, allowing Gcm to act in a specific pathway. Together with the recent finding that glia act as scavengers during development and in pathological conditions, our data open new perspectives onto the cellular and molecular pathways involved in non-self recognition within and outside the nervous system...|$|R
40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{function}} of the developmentally regulated A-type lamins we transformed Drosophila melanogaster with a construct containing the hsp 70 promoter followed by the Drosophila lamin C (an analog of vertebrate A-type lamins) cDNA. Lamin C was expressed ectopically after heat shock of embryos and localized to the nucleus. No phenotypic change was observed after lamin C expression in embryos that normally do not contain lamin C, However, ectopic expression of lamin C during most larval (but not pupal) stages stalled growth, inhibited ecdysteroid signaling (in particular during the larval-prepupal transition), resulted in development of <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors,</b> and finally caused death. During pupation in control animals, when massive apoptosis of larval tissues takes place, lamin C is proteolyzed into a fragment with a size similar to that predicted by caspase cleavage. The ectopically expressed lamin C is identically cleaved, resulting in a large increase of the steady-state level of the lamin C fragment. A null mutation of the dcp-l gene, one of the two known Drosophila caspase genes, also results in development of <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> and larval death, suggesting that the ectopically expressed lamin C inhibits apoptosis through competitive inhibition of caspase activity.
