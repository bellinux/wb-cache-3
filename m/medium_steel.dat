40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>medium</b> carbon <b>steels</b> as engineering materials is {{reflected by the}} fact that out of the vast majority of engineering grade ferrous alloys available and used in the market today, a large proportion of them are from the family of <b>medium</b> carbon <b>steels.</b> Typically <b>medium</b> carbon <b>steels</b> have a carbon range of 0. 25 to 0. 65 % by weight, and a manganese content ranging from 0. 060 to 1. 65 % by weight. <b>Medium</b> carbon <b>steels</b> are more resistive to cutting, welding and forming as compared to low carbon steels. From the last two decades a number of research scholars reported the use of verity of heat treatments to tailor the properties of <b>medium</b> carbon <b>steels.</b> Spheroidizing is the novel industrial heat treatment employed to improve formability and machinability of medium/high carbon low alloy steels. This exclusive study covers procedure, the effects and possible outcomes of various heat treatments on <b>medium</b> carbon <b>steels.</b> In the present work, other related heat treatments like annealing and special treatments for property alterations which serve as pretreatments for spheroidizing are also reviewed. <b>Medium</b> carbon <b>steels</b> with property alterations by various heat treatment processes are finding increased responsiveness in transportation, aerospace, space, underwater along with other variegated fields. Improved tribological and mechanical properties consisting of impact resistance, stiffness, abrasion and strength are the main reasons for the increased attention of these steels in various industries. In the present scenario for the consolidation of important aspects of various heat treatments and effects on mechanical properties of <b>medium</b> carbons <b>steel,</b> a review of different research papers has been attempted.
