5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular <b>momentum</b> <b>is</b> transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} disks encounters some problems. The {{most important one}} is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its angular momentum. One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The <b>momentum</b> <b>is</b> transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular <b>momentum</b> <b>is</b> magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E
5|$|Using similar arguments, {{this can}} be {{generalized}} to a system with an arbitrary number of particles. In general, as long as all forces are due to the interaction of objects with mass, {{it is possible to}} define a system such that net <b>momentum</b> <b>is</b> never lost nor gained.|$|E

5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular <b>momentum</b> <b>is</b> dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of moon systems {{is driven by}} tidal forces. A moon will raise a tidal bulge in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving {{in the same direction}} as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, angular <b>momentum</b> <b>is</b> transferred from the rotation of the primary to the r{{evolution of}} the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{measures}} and metrics {{are used to}} evaluate lodging unit and company performance, but no single measure has been identified that captures the financial performance of a lodging firm. EVA Momentum emerged in 2009 as the newest economic value added (EVA) -related business performance measure. The objective {{of this study was}} to understand the value of EVA Momentum as a performance measure in the U. S. lodging industry by: (a) comparing EVA Momentum in similar and dissimilar industries, (b) determining if EVA <b>Momentum</b> <b>was</b> related to future value, and (c) understanding if EVA <b>Momentum</b> <b>was</b> more highly related to future performance than were traditional financial performance measures. Compustat and evaDimensions financial data from 2001 - 2008 for U. S. -based hotel, restaurant, and REIT companies were used in this study. T-test results showed no statistically significant difference between lodging and restaurant EVA Momentum. ANOVA test results found lodging EVA <b>Momentum</b> <b>was</b> higher than for fixed asset-intensive REITs, but the results were not statistically significant. Regression results showed EVA <b>Momentum</b> <b>was</b> not related to future financial performance as measured by market capitalization or total capitalization. Regression results also showed EVA <b>Momentum</b> <b>was</b> more highly related to future performance than were return on assets, return on sales, and earnings per share for the pooled sample, but not for the individual lodging, restaurant, and REIT samples. This is the first known empirical study of EVA Momentum as a performance measure. The results of the study provided support for using EVA Momentum to compare company performance across different industries, but did not find that EVA <b>Momentum</b> <b>was</b> related to future financial performance. Using a pooled sample, EVA <b>Momentum</b> <b>was</b> shown to be more highly related to future financial performance than were three traditional financial measures...|$|R
5|$|One {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with the primary possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, the primary is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then the system can lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After the primary has degenerated into a white dwarf, the secondary star later evolves into a red giant and the stage is set for mass accretion onto the primary. During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral in closer together as angular <b>momentum</b> <b>is</b> lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
