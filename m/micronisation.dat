40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>micronisation</b> on the {{characteristics}} and physicochemical properties of (a) an insoluble fibre-rich fraction (IFRF) prepared from orange peel and (b) cellulose were studied and compared. The results showed that <b>micronisation</b> techniques such as hall milling, jet milling and high-pressure <b>micronisation</b> could effectively (P < 0. 05) reduce particle sizes to microscale, decrease the bulk density and improve the physicochemical properties (water-holding capacity, swelling capacity, oil-holding capacity, cation exchange capacity and glucose adsorption capacity) of IFRF and cellulose to different extents (up to 25 -fold). After <b>micronisation</b> the inhibitory effects of these insoluble fibres towards alpha-amylase and pancreatic lipase were significantly increased (up to 5. 8 - and 7. 8 -fold respectively) and a redistribution of some fibre components from insoluble to soluble fractions was observed. It was concluded that these <b>micronisation</b> treatments, especially high-pressure <b>micronisation,</b> could effectively improve the functionalities of IFRF and cellulose, which might then be used as potential fibre-rich ingredients in functional food applications.

40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) is an {{important}} source of protein in some parts of sub Saharan Africa. In southern Africa, it is mainly boiled into a stew, and long cooking time is a concern. <b>Micronisation</b> of preconditioned seeds has been used to reduce the cooking time of other dry legume seeds such as lentils. Hence <b>micronisation</b> (moisture conditioning and infrared heating) presents an opportunity for processing cowpeas to alleviate long cooking time and provide a convenient product as well as diversify cowpea products. In addition, potential exists for using flour milled from micronised (moisture conditioned and infrared heated) seeds in food systems. However, variations in raw material physicochemical properties (seeds) and <b>micronisation</b> temperature would affect the efficacy of the process to produce products with desired properties. Mild (130 and 153 °C) and severe (170 °C) final surface temperatures were used {{to determine the extent of}} micronisation-induced changes in cowpea structure and physicochemical properties and functionality of the resultant flours. Two cowpea varieties (Bechuana white and Var. 462; 41 % moisture) micronised to 153 °C were used to study the effect of <b>micronisation</b> on physicochemical and structural properties of cowpea seeds. Bechuana white (41 % moisture) micronised to three temperatures (130, 153 and 170 °C) was used to study the <b>micronisation</b> temperature effect on physicochemical properties of cowpeas and functional properties of resultant flours. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) were used to study seed structure, while light microscopy was used for the flour. Gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography (GP-HPLC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and a rapid visco-analyser (RVA) were used to study starch-related properties, while fluorescence spectroscopy and electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were used to study physicochemical properties of isolated proteins. These physicochemical and structural properties were determined to aid in explaining the possible micronisation-induced changes in cooking characteristics of seeds and functional properties of the resultant flours. <b>Micronisation</b> (41 % moisture, 153 °C) reduced cooking time (Bechuana white > Var. 462) and increased splitting (Var. 462 >Bechuana white) of the cowpeas during subsequent cooking. The micronised (41 % moisture, 153 °C) seeds were relatively softer than the unmicronised samples following subsequent cooking. The mild temperatures (130, 153 °C) were more effective in reducing cooking time than the higher temperature (170 °C). <b>Micronisation</b> (41 % moisture, 153 and 170 °C) caused physical fissuring of the seed coat, cotyledon, and parenchyma cell wall and reduced the bulk density of treated seeds. These changes in the physical structure improved the hydration rate of the seeds during cooking. There is a possibility that <b>micronisation</b> (41 % moisture, 130, 153, 170 °C) also caused the degradation of pectic substances of the middle lamella, since shorter cooking time was required for cotyledon parenchyma cells to separate during cooking. Mild <b>micronisation</b> (41 % moisture, 130 and 153 °C) temperatures caused the disruption of the native starch granular order leading to retrogradation of amylose, while at higher <b>micronisation</b> (41 % moisture, 170 °C) temperatures the retrogradation of amylose was possibly accompanied by endodegradation of starch. Simultaneously, <b>micronisation</b> (41 % moisture, 130 and 170 °C) led to increased surface hydrophobicity and crosslinking of protein, which was more pronounced in M- 170 °C samples. SDS-PAGE indicated that disulphide bonds were formed in micronised (41 % moisture, 130 and 170 °C) samples; while isopeptide bonds, dityrosyl bonds and Maillard derived crosslinks are possibilities especially in the M- 170 °C sample. The pronounced crosslinking of protein and possible depolymerisation of starch contributed to hardening of the cotyledon structure, consequently impacting negatively on the effectiveness of the <b>micronisation</b> (41 % moisture, 170 °C) treatment in reducing cooking time. These changes in seed structure and physicochemical properties of starch and protein contributed towards the reduction in cooking time and increased splitting of seeds and modified flour functionality. Cowpea flour foaming capacity was lost following <b>micronisation</b> (41 % moisture, 130 and 170 °C) possibly due to reduced solubility and crosslinking of protein. <b>Micronisation</b> (41 % moisture, 130 and 170 °C) reduced flour gelling and pasting properties while increasing the water absorption capacity, more so in M- 170 °C samples than in M- 130 °C. Hence <b>micronisation</b> to mild temperatures (130 °C) has the potential of producing cowpeas with shorter cooking time, which can also be milled into flour with modified functionality. Thus <b>micronisation</b> of moistureconditioned cowpeas to mild temperatures would contribute towards increased utilisation of cowpeas as well as improving household nutrition status.

The effect of the micronising process was tested by providing pigs with 90 g DM·kg– 1 BW 0. 75 of a N-free diet supplemented with isolated pea inner fibres, presented in native or micronised form and with a water-holding capacity of 12 and 4 g water·g– 1 DM, respectively. ENL and EAAL were measured on pigs weighing 24, 62 and 105 kg. In all cases, daily ENL increased linearly (P < 0. 05) with BW, {{for the majority of the}} AA and total N. As BW increased, daily ENL, total EAAL and the majority of EAAL increased linearly independently of <b>micronisation</b> (P < 0. 05). When expressed per kg DMI, total EAAL and the majority of each EAA decreased curvilinearly and reached nadir at around 100 kg BW. For ENL expressed per kg DMI, <b>micronisation</b> resulted in a curvilinear decrease with increasing BW, as compared to a linear decrease for pigs fed the native pea fibre diet (non-micronised). <b>Micronisation</b> of pea inner fibres did not decrease ENL or EAAL daily, except for proline.

40|$|Summary. During <b>micronisation</b> grain {{moisture}} evaporates mainly in decreasing drying rate period. Grain layer {{located on the}} surface of the conveyor micronisers will be regarded as horizontal plate. Due to the fact that the <b>micronisation</b> process the surface of the grain evaporates little moisture (within 2 - 7 %) is assumed constant plate thickness. Because in the process of micronization grain structure is changing, in order to achieve an exact solution of the equations necessary to take into account changes thermophysical, optical and others.

Rapid inactivation of rSLPI by cathepsin L (Cat L) and rapid clearance from the lungs has limited clinical efficacy to date. Previous studies by us have shown that encapsulation of rSLPI within 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -[phospho-L-serine]/cholesterol (DOPS/Chol) liposomes protects rSLPI against Cat L inactivation in vitro. Liquid DOPS–rSLPI preparations were found to be unstable upon long-term storage and nebulisation. The aim of this study was therefore to develop a method of manufacture for preparing DOPS–rSLPI liposomes as a dry powder for inhalation. DOPS–rSLPI dry powders were lyophilised and subsequently micronised with a novel <b>micronisation</b> aid. The effects of formulation and processing on rSLPI stability, activity, and uniformity of content within the powders were characterised. Using D-mannitol as the <b>micronisation</b> aid, dry powder particles in the inhalable size range (< 5  μm) were prepared. By optimising process parameters, up to 54 % of rSLPI was recovered after <b>micronisation,</b> of which there was no significant loss in anti-neutrophil elastase activity and no detectable evidence of protein degradation.

Contemporary protocols involve the consumption of large amounts of strong acids, enzymatic treatments, ultra-sonication and combinations thereof. In an attempt to address this scalability challenge, we aimed to isolate CNC via a scalable mechanical method i. e. high energy bead milling (HEBM). An aqueous dispersion of commercially available microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was micronized through a HEBM process. This process was optimised by varying the concentration (0. 5 – 2 wt%) and time (15 – 60 min) parameters, in order to obtain a high yield of well-separated CNCs as characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). <b>Micronisation</b> of cellulose via the HEBM method under mild conditions resulted in cellulose nanocrystals with an average aspect ratio in the range of 20 to 26. The nanocrystals also retained both their crystallinity index (ICr) (85 to 95 %) and thermal stability described in terms of onset degradation temperature (Tonset) (230 – 263 °C). The production yield of CNC from MCC via this process ranged between 57 and 76 %.

Methods: IB monohydrate and anhydrous crystals were produced from seed crystals and supercritical carbon dioxide crystallisation, respectively. Young's modulus of anhydrous and monohydrate IB crystals was determined using nanoindentation. For air-jet micronised crystals, the physicochemical and surface interfacial properties via the cohesive-adhesive balance (CAB) approach were investigated. These data were correlated to in-vitro aerosolisation performance of carrier-based DPI formulations containing either anhydrous or monohydrate IB. Key findings: Particle size and Young's modulus of both crystals were similar and this was reflected in their similar processing upon <b>micronisation.</b> Particle size of micronised anhydrous and monohydrate crystals were similar. CAB measurements of the micronised particles of monohydrate or anhydrous forms of IB with respect to lactose were 0. 70 (R 2 = 0. 998) and 0. 77 (R 2 = 0. 999), respectively. These data suggested that both samples had similar adhesion to lactose, which correlated with their similar in-vitro aerosolisation performance in DPI formulations.

The temperature that developed {{in the course of}} the microwave radiation and autoclaving did not cause statistically significant differences between oil content in heat treated and fresh kernels of soya bean.

The dissolution rate of solid dispersions with at least 67 % of PVPK 25 was significantly improved in comparison to untreated and mechanically ground artemisinin. Modulation of the dissolution rate of artemisinin was obtained by both particle size reduction and formation of solid dispersions.

The study involved the synthesis, purification, <b>micronisation</b> and co-precipitation of Cu-Indo with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. Initially the volumetric and solubility behaviours of the solventanti-solvent systems were investigated to determine the optimum processing conditions.

Copper indomethacin was successfully synthesised and purified in a single vessel using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. Drug yields of 98 % and purities near 100 % were achieved at optimum conditions with the advantages of less residual solvent in the drug, less solvent waste, reduced processing time and increased yields over the conventional synthesis process. Copper indomethacin was produced in a variety of morphologies and particle sizes using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. An investigation of the effect of process parameters on the particle characteristics showed that solute concentration was the dominant variable. Spherical particles with diameters less than 8 mm were obtained at optimum conditions. The immediate benefit of micronising Cu-Indo was demonstrated with an eight fold increase in dissolution rate when compared to the conventionally produced drug.

40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} grain legume in sub- Saharan Africa. It is an important source of affordable dietary proteins for the low-income populations. Cowpeas develop hard-to-cook (HTC) defect during storage at high temperaturehigh humidity (HTHH) conditions experienced in these regions. Cowpeas with HTC defect are characterised by long cooking time that lead to increased energy demands that add constraints on the consumers with limited resources. The main objective of this work was to determine the effect of <b>micronisation</b> and hot-air roasting as strategies in the control of HTC defect development. A preliminary study determined the effect of accelerated storage conditions of 40 °C and 80 % relative humidity for 40 days on HTC defect development among 3 cowpea types. The accelerated conditions simulate the HTHH storage conditions. The 3 cowpea types (Bechuana white, Agripienk and Mae–e–tsiliwane) stored at these HTHH conditions developed HTC defect as shown by the increased cooking time. The increase in cooking time was not observed in the control cowpeas stored at 4 oC. The increase in cooking time differed among the 3 cowpea types and this indicated varying degree of susceptibility to HTC defect. HTC defect development at the accelerated HTHH conditions was shown to be due to increased phytase activity that resulted in decreased phytate content and decrease in water soluble pectin. This was in agreement with the "phytase-phytate-pectin" theory. The role of lignification was not established during HTHH storage conditions since peroxidase activity and lignin content did not increase. Agripienk which had the highest increase in cooking time was selected for the heat pre-treatment study. Cowpeas of the Agripienk type were pre-conditioned to 25 % moisture before being micronised or hot-air roasted at 150 oC for 5 minutes. Phytase activity was reduced by 70 % and 45 % by <b>micronisation</b> and roasting pre-treatments respectively. After HTHH storage the cooking time increased by > 430 %, 243 % and 92 % for the control, roasted and micronised cowpeas respectively. Micronised cowpeas had the lowest increase in cooking time. Therefore, HTC defect was controlled but not prevented by the heat pre-treatments. Micronised cowpeas which had the lowest phytase activity has higher phytate and water soluble pectin contents when compared to both roasted and control cowpeas. The mechanism of HTC defect control by the heat pre-treatments was attributed to partial phytase inactivation which decreased the rate phytate hydrolysis and liberation of divalent cations available to bind to pectin in the middle lamella. There was higher content of water soluble pectin and lower content of chelator soluble pectin in the heat pre-treated cowpeas than in the control after HTHH storage. Increase in chelator soluble pectin indicated formation of pectates that limit the rate of cell separation during cooking. Based on these findings, cell separation during cooking was investigated further. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that there was more cell separation in the heat pre-treated cowpeas when compared to the control after HTHH storage. The control cowpeas showed minimal cell separation even after 2 hours of cooking. The ease in cell separation in the heat pre-treated cowpeas was due to presence of more soluble pectin in the middle lamella when compared to the control that had more chelator soluble pectin. Micronised cowpeas had more cell separation when compared to the hot-air roasted cowpeas. Differential scanning calorimetry of cowpea flours showed that HTHH did not lead to an increase in gelatinisation temperatures (To and Tp) or gelatinisation enthalpy(H) in control, micronised and hot-air roasted cowpeas. Increase in these thermal properties is suggested to lead in increased cooking time. The pasting viscosities of the cowpea flours decreased after heat pretreatments but HTHH conditions did not alter the viscosities of either the control or heat pretreated cowpeas. Therefore the changes in starch thermal and pasting properties due to HTHH storage were not observed. This study indicates that HTC defect development was dependent on phytase activity during HTHH storage. The effectiveness of <b>micronisation</b> and hot-air roasting in preventing HTC defect was dependent on the degree of phytase inactivation. <b>Micronisation</b> was more effective than hot air roasting in controlling the development of HTC defect due to a higher degree of phytase inactivation.

Results also indicate that the particle size reduction mechanism is influenced by the size and morphology of the starting ibuprofen crystals. Dissolution behaviour of ibuprofen was shown to be influenced by the solid surface chemistry of micronised drug particles. The molecular modelling study provided deeper understanding of the experimental findings observed in this study. Â© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Milling {{has been}} the key unit {{operation}} in controlling particle size of pharmaceutical powders at scale. The work carried out in this thesis is a comprehensive study of the stability of pharmaceutical solids post-milling and upon storage, from molecular level up to bulk handling scale. It {{is an attempt to}} fill key gaps in knowledge with regard to the anomalous behaviour and physical instability of milled powder through the development of advanced novel techniques. The physical instability of milled or amorphous pharmaceutical powders often manifest in changes in derived powder properties. Moisture induced dimensional changes of amorphous lactose compacts were monitored by in-situ environmental controlled optical profilometry. The complex volumetric behaviour involves glassy-rubbery phase transition followed by amorphous-crystalline transformation under the influence of water. These associated changes were not observed in physical aging of amorphous lactose compacts by measuring specific surface area. At the molecular level these physical changes are governed by relaxation processes. By operating within the linear viscoelastic region, low strain uni-axial indentation of small molecule organic glasses at a range of temperature generated master curves using WLF analysis. Viscoelastic behaviour of these materials were determined to be controlled by local β-relaxation around the glass transition rather than globally for polymers. At the bulk level, due to the non-equilibrium nature of milled and amorphous powders, their surface energies tends to be significantly higher than the equivalent crystalline forms. This can be detrimental as highly cohesive and poor flowing powders are difficult to process. The unconfined compression test was adapted to measure cohesion of small weak pharmaceutical powder compacts. More significantly, a positive relationship was confirmed between surface energetics and cohesion of modified D-mannitol. At the particle level, the mechanism(s) by which milling or <b>micronisation</b> creates low levels of amorphicity remains unclear. MOUDI fractionation of bulk micronised α-lactose monohydrate and characterisation of fine fractions has clearly demonstrated that <b>micronisation</b> as well as mechanical particle size reduction also generates low levels of highly amorphous ultrafine particles within bulk crystalline powder which will {{have a significant effect on}} powder physical stability post-milling and upon storage. In conclusion, using the novel techniques developed here, significant progress has been towards understanding the physical behaviour of milled and amorphous pharmaceutical solids.

30|$|As already mentioned, {{there are}} several methods, such as <b>micronisation,</b> roasting, expanding, extrusion, {{hydrothermal}} processing and germination, that all work with different temperatures and durations. Germination is a method used, for example, to produce soymilk [33]. The methods used {{will depend on the}} product to be placed on the market [34] {{as well as on the}} variety of soybean [35]. The degradation of the inhibiting proteins will vary, but they will not be removed completely [35]. Most of these standard methods work with temperatures much lower than 190  °C. In general, each processing company might also prefer to vary the standardised methods, since the goal of the processing is not only to degrade anti-nutritional compounds, such as trypsin-inhibitors, but also to produce a food or feed product with high quality proteins and healthy compounds, such as isoflavones [34]. If the methods used particularly focus on the conservation of protein quality in the soybeans, this could result in the structure and function of the Bt toxin being preserved in food and feed.|$|E
30|$|Other {{examples}} of synergies that are specifically relevant {{for the health}} risk assessment of Intacta soybeans include the effect that protease inhibitors can have on the toxicity of Bt toxins: Such an inhibition could delay the digestion of proteins, including Cry toxins, and thus enhance toxicity by prolonged or increased exposure. An up to 20 -fold increase of toxicity was found even {{in the presence of}} very low levels of protease inhibitors [29 – 31]. Soybeans are known to show high levels of such inhibitors e.g. the trypsin-inhibitor [32]. The degradation of these proteinase inhibitors in the soybeans will depend on the method of heat processing. There are several methods, such as <b>micronisation,</b> roasting, expanding, extrusion or hydrothermal processing, that all work with different temperatures and durations [33].

That experiment has a purpose to create drug-polymer microparticle composite with Particles from Gas-Saturated Solutions (PGSS) technology. Different pressures (80 - 200 bar) and polymers (PEG 6000 and Î² cyclodextrin) were applied to get microparticle with narrow size distribution, discrit morphology and fast drug release profile. Ketoprofen-PEG 6000 and ketoprofen-Î² cyclodextrin was saturated with supercritical fluid in saturated vessel and the liquified time was 2 hours, then depressured the solution pass through nozzle as microparticles. The compositeâs morphology is various by the effect of saturation pressure and type of polymer which used. Microparticle morphology indicate that higher saturation pressure create irregular microparticle product and on the contrary lower saturation pressure create sphere microparticle product. The average diameter of the particles obtained by PGSS at different conditions was about 0. 83 - 7. 74 Î¼m and release profile of composite Ketoprofen-PEG 6000 was faster than ketoprofen-Î² cyclodextrin...|$|E
40|$|Classical methods offer many {{possibilities}} {{to generate}} powders. Where very small particle sizes especially in spherical shape are required, or highly viscous substances {{have to be}} reduced, the limits of traditional processes are reached soon. The solution {{can be found in}} high-pressure processes. The PGSS (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions) process e. g. is suitable for the <b>micronisation</b> of several substances. With a couple of investigations it could be proved that fine powders with different morphologies can be manufactured [1 - 3]. The possibilities of the PGSS process have successfully been demonstrated over the last years for numerous solids such as e. g. polyethylene glycols, powder coatings and green tea. The aim of this investigation was the production of liquid filled powder micro particles using the PGSS process. This way the encapsulation of a dispersed liquid phase was achieved and powders with different properties were produced. The properties of the composi te powders can be adjusted by the process parameters of the PGSS process.

40|$|Dry powder inhalers are a {{commonly}} prescribed dosage {{form for the}} treatment of asthma. In essence they consist of an active compound in particulate form (1 ??? 5 m diameter) adhered loosely on the surface of a larger inert particle, usually lactose (25 ??? 60 m diameter). Processing of the pharmaceutical active powder to produce the stated particle size range requires high-energy milling or <b>micronisation.</b> However, this process also breaks down the surface crystalline structure of the particles, introducing an unstable amorphous phase to the powder. This conversion of the crystalline to the amorphous state can be of great pharmaceutical significance. It can influence the bioavailability, stability, formulation and manufacturing of the medicinal product. The milling-induced amorphism must be detected and quantified to prevent stability and formulation consequences. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the feasibility of using the novel technique of powder pocket dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to detect and quantify amorphous content in pharmaceutical powders. Mixtures of amorphous and crystalline salbutamol sulphate were used as test materials...|$|E
40|$|<b>Micronisation</b> {{of active}} {{pharmaceutical}} ingredients {{is a process}} which is sometimes difficult to control. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of the pre-existing flaws in the material to be milled. The rate of breakage of four samples of a model compound (sodium chloride), originating from different sources, was determined in a jet mill. It appeared that each type of sodium chloride has a distinct particle rate of breakage and breakage pattern. The numbers of flaws in the different types of sodium chloride have been determined by immersing the sodium chloride particles in a liquid with the same refractive index. This makes the cracks better visible. Microphotographs were made and flaws were counted manually. The study shows that the flaw density has an impact on the fracture behaviour of particles. The degree of fracture tends to increase with increasing flaw density. The paper shows however that the mechanical properties of the material as well as the starting particle size dominate the significance of the impact of flaws on fracture behaviour.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to enhance {{solubility}} and dissolution rate of poorly water soluble drug. Several techniques such as <b>micronisation,</b> cyclodextrin-complexation, use of surfactants, solubilizers and super disintegrants, solid dispersion in water soluble and water dispersible carriers, microemulsions and self emulsifying micro and nano disperse systems have been used to enhance the solubility and dissolution rate of poorly water soluble drugs. Among the various approaches solid dispersion technique is most widely used. Cefdinir is a drug of choice for solubility and dissolution enhancement. Solid dispersions were prepared by solvent evaporation method and melt fusion method using polyethylene glycol 3350 and PVP-K 30 as hydrophilic carriers. The prepared solid dispersions were evaluated in terms of drug content, % yield and in-vitro dissolution study. In-vitro release profiles of all dispersions were comparitively evaluated and also studied against pure cefdinir. The results obtained showed that the rate of dissolution of cefdinir was considerably improved when formulated in solid dispersions as compare to pure drug.

The two main types of motorcycle rims are solid wheels, {{in which case the}} rim and spokes are all cast as one unit, usually in Aluminum or magnesium alloys and the other spoke wheels, where the motorcycle rims are laced with spokes which require high spoke tension, since the load is carried by fewer spokes. If a spoke does break, the wheel generally becomes instantly un-ridable also the hub may break. Presently, for high cc bikes Magnesium wheels are used, due to its low heat resistance and <b>micronisation</b> of crystal grains, replacing it with Aluminum alloy. This Simulation work attempts to model the wheel of a two wheeler racing by using the CATIA Software, and conducting the tests: Static and Fatigue analysis using the ANSYS software by reducing the number of spokes from 5 to 4 for the existing model.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} various textural properties of heat-induced gels prepared from wheat and potato starch suspensions (10 %) treated with tribomechanical <b>micronisation</b> and activation (TMA). Particle size measurements showed that the TMA treatment caused a significant decrease in particle size and change in particle size distribution of powdered starches. Scanning electron microphotographs showed an obvious impact on the structure and size of starch granules. The effect of TMA treatment on the texture profile of wheat and potato starch gels was assessed by measuring their textural properties, such as hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, springiness and gumminess. The texture profile analyses of the TMA-treated wheat and potato starch gels showed lower hardness and gumminess; however, adhesiveness, cohesiveness and springiness were higher when compared with untreated suspensions. TMA treatment caused no significant lowering of the initial gelatinization temperatures. Results of differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed a decrease in the enthalpy of gelatinization. This can be explained by the disruption of starch granules by mechanical forces during the TMA treatment, which made the granules more permeable to water during the heating step of differential scanning calorimetry analysis...|$|E

With a copule of investigations it was shown that fine powders with different morphologies can be manufactured.

In the context of this work 165 experiments with the model system palm fat/water, castor fat/water and PEG 6000 /rapeseed oil were used to determine the interdependencies between process parameters of the PGSS process and particle and powder properties on the other hand.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of CO 2 in a polymer causes plasticization of the polymer and hence, its viscosity is reduced. A model {{based on the}} free volume theory {{has been used for}} a polyester resin, which shows a considerable reduction in the viscosity due to dissolved CO 2. Therefore, supercritical CO 2 {{has been used as a}} processing solvent in the continuous production of micron size particles of the resin. Despite the viscosity reduction caused by the dissolved CO 2, an excess quantity of CO 2 with respect to its solubility limit has been used for <b>micronisation</b> of the polymer due to its high viscosity. The mixing of CO 2 and the polymer has not been possible in an extruder at high gas to polymer mass ratios and consequently, a simplified Kenics type static mixer has been used for the mixing purpose. In this study, the effect of various parameters such as temperature, pressure, nozzle diameter and gas to polymer mass ratio on the particle morphology and size has been studied. The experimental results manifest the technological as well as the theoretical insight into the particles production from a high viscosity material. ...|$|E

A consortium of European SMEs (www. adfimax. com) has developed a product that reduces the level of mycotoxins and pesticides in wine while keeping all other wine parameter identical. The product is derived from renewable vegetable fiber. The production process includes both activation and <b>micronisation.</b> The usage recommendation is to substitute only the pre-coat, typically perlite, by the product at 1 or 1. 5 [*]kg⋅m− 2 without changing the other layer (body feed) typically kieselguhr.

Young's modulus of two batches of budesonide crystals (samples A and B) produced using different anti-solvents was determined using nanoindentation. Physicochemical and surface interfacial properties via the cohesive-adhesive balance (CAB) approach to colloid probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) of air-jet micronised budesonide crystals were also investigated. These data were correlated to in vitro aerosolization performance of carrier-based DPI formulations containing either budesonide samples A or B and lactose monohydrate. Young's modulus of budesonide samples A and B crystals was 0. 95 and 4. 04 GPa, respectively. Sample A crystals with low Young's modulus exhibited poorer <b>micronisation</b> efficiency than sample B. CAB analysis of micronised budesonide samples A and B, suggest that sample B budesonide had a greater adhesion to lactose than sample A. These data correlated with in vitro aerosolisation studies, which showed that the fine particle delivery of budesonide sample A was {{higher than that of}} sample B. In conclusion, crystallisation conditions may affect the mechanical properties of budesonide, and therefore secondary processing of the material and their interfacial properties and product performance in carrier based DPI formulations...|$|E
40|$|In {{material}} sciences, one of {{the most}} promising strategies to approach eco-efficiency is the combination of <b>micronisation</b> and functionalisation, i. e. the synthesis of materials that provide several integrated functions on as little area as possible. During the past decade, the better understanding of the operating modes of biological systems has caused an increasing tendency to prepare micro-sized particles with high functionalities, large surface-to-volume ratios, and multiple application potentials. Numerous methods are available to produce microstructured solid particles and to assist the preparation procedures by theoretical considerations. Physical and chemical processes can be used to encapsulate liquid or solid materials by various synthetic or natural polymeric shells. Sparingly soluble metal oxides are appropriate coating materials for functional filling agents, pigments, and powdery ceramic precursors. Amphiphilic polymers can be used to combine different substances with virtually incompatible structural properties based on a thermodynamically promoted self-structurization. The precipitation of inorganic or organic solids from solutions by means of supercritical fluids proves to be an effective tool to prepare nano- or micro-sized composite particles. For the production of microspheres, the scale-up problem can be simplified by mathematical models that include population balances and describe multicomponent mass transfers as well as nucleation and crystal growth phenomena. The models consider varying solubilities, cross diffusivities and relevant transport phenomena for the transfer of mass and energy...|$|E
