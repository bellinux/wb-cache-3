5|$|A {{branch to}} Sola has been {{considered}} to allow the trains to operate to Sola and the airport. The line would branch from the Sørland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, Solakrossen, Forus West, Statoil's head office and possibly the shopping center Kvadrat. This would give a travel time of 17 <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> airport to the city center, and 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed {{as part of the}} light rail system. It would give about 2.5 million annual passengers.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began their}} League Cup {{campaign}} in the third round, drawn at home to Newcastle United. They made nine changes from the previous starting XI – Eduardo paired up with Bendtner in the front two. Bendtner scored the opening goal seven <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end of normal time; Denílson added a second goal to ensure Arsenal's progression. Fourth-round opponents Sheffield United were easier to defeat, with Eduardo scoring a brace (two goals). The quarter-final pitted Arsenal away to Blackburn Rovers, in a match played on 18 December 2007. Diaby gave Arsenal the lead with a volley after six minutes and Eduardo extended the lead, before Roque Santa Cruz pulled a goal back for Blackburn, three <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the first}} half. Santa Cruz scored the equaliser and his second of the match, heading in a cross by David Bentley. In stoppage time, Denílson was sent off for a two-footed challenge on Dunn. In spite of playing with one less player, Arsenal regained the lead. Alex Song passed the ball to Eduardo, who held off his opponent Ryan Nelsen and with minimal effort placed it past Brad Friedel. The performance prompted Wenger to assert that his team could win the cup, while opposing manager Mark Hughes commented that Arsenal's blend of young players were capable of {{following in the footsteps of}} Manchester United's fledglings, managed by Alex Ferguson.|$|E

5|$|Malick {{was upset}} that the studio {{screened}} his unfinished version for critics and Penn ended up helping {{him in the}} editing room, shaping the final version. Malick spent three more months and cut 45 additional <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film. The director refused to subject his film to test screenings before delivering his final cut. After Geisler and Roberdeau told their story to Vanity Fair magazine, Medavoy's attorneys declared them in breach of contract and threatened to remove their names from the film unless they agreed to do no future interviews until after the Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Renoir {{edited the}} film while shooting; his first cut was three hours long. He and editor Marguerite {{completed}} a 113-minute final {{cut of the}} film in July 1939.

Renoir refused to completely omit Octave but agreed to remove 13 <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the rest}} of the five-match Test series against South Africa, Ring took only seven more wickets, and he tended to be {{expensive}} {{in terms of the number}} of runs conceded from his bowling. In the second match, which the South Africans won, he took three wickets for 187, and, batting at No 10, contributed a quick-fire 53 out of the last 74 runs when the match had already effectively been lost. Two weeks later, in the third match, he took just one wicket in a crushing Australian victory, but contributed 58 out of 75 in just 68 <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> unusually lofty batting position of No 8. The fourth and fifth Tests brought him few runs or wickets. In the series as a whole, Ring scored 184 runs at an average of 23 runs per innings and took 13 wickets at the high average of 48.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began {{dominating}} in {{the second}} half, and increased their lead after 57 <b>minutes.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> left wing, Overmars used his pace to {{get the better of}} Gary Neville and passed the ball to Anelka, who turned and passed to an unmarked Christopher Wreh. Schmeichel blocked the Liberian's initial shot with his feet, but he was unable to stop the second attempt or Wreh's acrobatic celebration. Despite the setback, United continued to press Arsenal; defender Martin Keown almost put the ball into his own goal from Ryan Giggs's corner. Both teams made mass substitutions in the final third of the game, notably Teddy Sheringham and Luís Boa Morte coming on for Cole – who rarely threatened – and Petit, respectively. Arsenal scored their third in the 72nd minute – Parlour's pass found Anelka, who got around Stam and shot the ball past Schmeichel from a narrow angle, inside the goalkeeper's near post. Near the end, Sheringham wasted a goal-scoring opportunity, shooting wide.|$|E
5|$|Brugge {{needed to}} score again {{to keep the}} tie alive, and pushed their players forward {{in search of an}} equaliser. This forced Liverpool to pull all their players, except Keegan, into {{defensive}} positions to try to preserve their lead. Despite this Liverpool had a chance {{to take the lead in}} the 34th minute. Smith's volley from a Kennedy free-kick went wide of the Brugge goal. Brugge's pressure almost paid off five minutes into the second half. Ulrik le Fevre and Roger van Gool combined to split the Liverpool defence, leaving Lambert with the ball. His subsequent shot beat Liverpool goalkeeper Clemence but hit the post. Brugge kept attacking in an effort to find the goal they needed; their best chance came four <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end. Brugge breached the Liverpool defence, but Cools' shot was denied by a diving save from Clemence. No more goals were scored; the final score was 1–1.|$|E
50|$|Asamoah Gyan {{scored the}} {{equalizer}} for Ghana in <b>the</b> 25th <b>minute</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> penalty spot, shooting {{low to the}} goalkeepers left after a handball by Harry Kewell on the goal-line {{for which he was}} shown a straight red card.|$|R

Bowden scored the second goal, and the third came from a penalty scored by Bastin. The fourth and final Arsenal goal was Beasley's second, with Barnsley's consolation goal coming a couple of <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end of the match.

The second half {{and most of}} extra time passed without incident until Chelsea's Didier Drogba was sent off for slapping Nemanja Vidić four <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end. In the penalty shoot-out, Ronaldo missed Manchester United's third kick, giving John Terry the {{chance to win the}} game for Chelsea, only for him to slip and hit the post. Edwin van der Sar then saved Nicolas Anelka's effort from Chelsea's seventh kick to give Manchester United their third European Cup title.|$|E

30|$|Endoglucanase and β-glucosidase {{activity}} assay {{were carried}} out by following the protocol of Thygesen et al. (2003). For exoglucanase activity, it was measured by using 1 % Avicel (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, USA) in 100  mM sodium acetate buffer (pH  4.8) as described by Wood and Bhat (1988). One unit (IU) of enzyme activity {{was defined as the}} amount of the enzyme that released 1 μmole of glucose per <b>minute</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original substrate at the experimental conditions for the endoglucanase and exoglucanase activity assay. For β-glucosidase activity, one unit (IU) is defined as the amount of the enzyme that releases 1 μmole of p- Nitrophenol per <b>minute</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> p-Nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside.|$|R
