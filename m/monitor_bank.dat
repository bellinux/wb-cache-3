5000|$|In {{the last}} couple of decades there has been {{increased}} criticism about its benefits. Concerning market discipline, one can easily say that mispriced deposit insurance distorts the incentives of depositors to <b>monitor</b> <b>bank</b> risk taking activities. For example, 100% of deposits are under government guarantee (up to $100,000) in the U.S. compared to only 70% in England. Obviously, the depositors in England, knowing that they will lose money when the bank they are investing in fails, will be more cautious than U.S. depositors and will <b>monitor</b> <b>bank</b> activities with vigilance.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{corporate}} governance role of banks by investigating the effect of <b>bank</b> <b>monitoring</b> on the borrowers' earnings management behavior. Our analyses suggest that a borrowing firm's earnings management behavior generally decreases as the strength of <b>bank</b> <b>monitoring</b> increases. The strength of <b>bank</b> <b>monitoring</b> is measured as (1) the magnitude of a bank loan, (2) the reputation (rank) of a lead bank, (3) {{the length of a}} bank loan, and (4) the number of lenders. These results imply that <b>bank</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{plays an important role in}} the corporate governance of bank-dependent firms. We further examine other bank loan characteristics (collateral, refinancing, loan types, and loan purposes) and their effects on borrowers' earnings management behavior. Our analyses show that collateral and loan types are significantly associated with borrowers' earnings management behavior while refinancing and loan purposes have no association. <b>Bank</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>Bank</b> loans Corporate governance Earnings management...|$|R
50|$|The {{efficacy}} of regulations aimed at introducing market discipline is questionable. Financial bailouts provide implicit insurance schemes like too-big-to-fail, where regulators in central agencies {{feel obliged to}} rescue a troubled bank for fear of financial contagion. It {{can be argued that}} depositors would not bother to <b>monitor</b> <b>bank</b> activities under these favorable circumstances.There are numerous academic studies on this subject. The findings, at first, had mixed and somewhat discouraging results where market discipline {{did not appear to be}} an essential feature in banking. Later studies, though, when including some of the previously missing key aspects into the empirical analysis, supported the existence and significance of such a natural control mechanism unambiguously. Accordingly, depositors 'discipline' bank activities to some extent depending on the well functioning of financial markets and institutions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{comparison}} to Besley and Persson's individual level study, Gordon and Li (2009) {{focus on the}} role of businesses and the financial sector in developed versus developing countries. They model businesses' participation in the financial sector—where Gordon and Li specifically refer to participation in the financial sector as using banks—as participation in the formal sector; they assume that tax authorities can <b>monitor</b> <b>bank</b> records, so that mass participation in the financial sector lends the state information and likewise, the power to tax. Gordon and Li (2009) demonstrate that because the financial sector is important in developed countries, businesses will choose to use banks and not evade taxes. Comparatively, the financial sector may be weaker in developing countries and businesses may have less incentive to use the banking system and instead opt to use cash. As is such, Gordon and Li (2009) conclude that [...] "as the financial sector improves in effectiveness, more firms will be pulled into using it in spite of the tax implications of doing so".|$|E

The underlying motive for <b>bank’s</b> <b>monitoring</b> is as follows: Production realizations are private information, therefore repayments on un-monitored external finance cannot be extracted from the entrepreneur. Specifically, if not monitored an entrepreneur with positive return realization would claim {{that he had the}} zero-return state realization and strategically default to enjoy private gains on his externally financed fraction of entrepreneurial output. Therefore, in order to avoid strategic default and enforce repayment, the <b>bank</b> <b>monitors</b> production realizations.

In the United States, primary responsibility for <b>monitoring</b> <b>bank</b> holding companies (BHCs) falls to the Federal Reserve. The Fed currently uses a combination of on-site and off-site monitoring to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities. On-site supervisory visits produce a detailed picture of an institution’s financial condition and risk profile, but they do absorb considerable resources and are conducted only about once a year. Given {{the changing nature of}} banking, this is more than enough time for an institution’s risk profile to change sharply, so the Fed complements on-site inspections with off-sit...|$|R
40|$|Cash {{holdings}} {{have often}} been presumed to help resolve the inherent uncertainty of assessing banks. Nonetheless, extant empirical evidence is inconclusive. The present paper adopts a novel approach to assessing the level of stockholder uncertainty associated with the cash holdings reported by European banks before, during, and after the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009. The paper finds that stockholder uncertainty may be significant when cash holdings exceed or fall short of the levels warranted to meet depositor demands. It concludes that investors <b>monitor</b> <b>bank</b> cash holdings in relation to short-term liabilities. Cash holdings may thus contribute to making banks more opaque. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{corporate}} governance role of banks in "bank-centered" countries like Japan {{has been well}} studied. This article studies the {{corporate governance}} in Japanese banks. It shows that large shareholders restrained bank managers from real estate lending in the 1980 s. However, this effect was absent for the shareholders who belonged to the same keiretsu (corporate grouping) as the bank. Relationship banking and cross shareholding prevented these shareholders from disciplining the bank managers.

40|$|The {{risk of a}} {{reputation}} loss can provide an informal enforcement mechanism when contracts are incomplete. This paper provides evidence that reputation and formal incentives to monitor are substitutes in syndicated lending. Formal incentives in a loan syndicate {{are determined by the}} amount of funding the <b>monitoring</b> <b>bank</b> provides to a loan. Using within-firm estimators, we show that <b>monitoring</b> <b>banks</b> increase their funding supply after {{a reputation}} loss caused by the discovery of fraud by one of its borrowers.

30|$|The {{well-known}} orthodox {{theory of}} supply and demand is behind the market discipline hypothesis. In banking markets, economic agents should react to the riskier behavior of their banks, because their costs may present a direct relationship with bank risk taking. Thus, the riskier behavior of a particular bank will change depositors’ preferences, and they will shift the supply curve of deposits toward the left, requiring higher interest rates on deposits or/and withdrawing their resources. As a result, this particular bank should modify its risk taking. We assume that depositors can monitor and indentify riskier banks, and they react in consequence. In other words, market discipline shows two faces: the ability to <b>monitor</b> <b>bank</b> conditions and the ability to influence banks’ actions, market monitor and market influence in terms of Flannery (2001).|$|E
40|$|Although bank {{supervision}} under the National Banking System exercised a light hand and panics were frequent, depositor losses were minimal. Double liability induced shareholders to carefully <b>monitor</b> <b>bank</b> managers and voluntarily liquidate banks early if {{they appeared to}} be in trouble. Inducing more disclosure, marking assets to market, and ensuring prompt closure of insolvent national banks, the Comptroller of the Currency reinforced market discipline. The arrival of the Federal Reserve weakened this regime. Monetary policy decisions conflicted with the goal of financial stability and created moral hazard. The appearance of the Fed as an additional supervisor led to more “competition in laxity” among regulators and “regulatory arbitrage” by banks. When the Great Depression hit, policy-induced deflation and asset price volatility were misdiagnosed as failures of competition and market valuation. In response, the New Deal shifted to a regime of discretion-based supervision with forbearance. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} how banking relationships and managerial ownership relate to firm valuation.

After controlling for the effect of exogenous variables, the results reveal {{the existence of a}} complementary <b>monitoring</b> effect between <b>banks</b> and the managerial group.

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} our {{hypothesis}} that the distinguishable principal-agent relationships of German banks are significantly influencing the risk-taking attitudes of bank managers. Particularly, we intend to substantiate the theory that banks owned by dispersed shareholders or federal state authorities face a higher relevance of principal-agent problems than other banking sectors due to a missing ability to <b>monitor</b> <b>bank</b> managers. Our results underline that these problems appear to mislead bank managers showing an unreasonable risk-taking behavior. In a first stage, we rely on a theoretical model explaining that from the bank owners' viewpoint three factors of the principal-agent relationships are determining the probability of choosing the optimal portfolio of risky assets. These factors cover {{the ability to control}} bank managers, the risk pooling capabilities of bank owners and bank managers, and the incentives of seeking high returns. To support our hypothesis we apply an empirical study to the distances-to-default of different German banking sectors. This demonstrates that risktaking attitudes of banks are closely related to banks' ownership. Consequently, our findings offer evidence, that legislative and regulatory authorities should increase their vigilance in terms of principal-agent problems within certain sectors of the banking industry...|$|E
40|$|A {{database}} driven multi-agent {{model has}} been developed with automated access to US bank level FDIC Call Reports that yield data on balance sheet and off balance sheet activity, respectively, in Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and Credit Default Swaps (CDS). The simultaneous accumulation of RMBS assets on US banks' balance sheets and also large counterparty exposures from CDS positions characterized the $ 2 trillion Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) market. The latter imploded {{at the end of}} 2007 with large scale systemic risk consequences. Based on US FDIC bank data, that could have been available to the regulator at the time, the authors investigate how a CDS negative carry trade combined with incentives provided by Basel II and its precursor in the US, the Joint Agencies Rule 66 Federal Regulation No. 56914, which became effective on January 1, 2002, on synthetic securitization and Credit Risk Transfer (CRT), led to the unsustainable trends and systemic risk.
