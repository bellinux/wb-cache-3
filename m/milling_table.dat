5000|$|The {{mechanics}} {{behind a}} PCB milling machine are fairly straightforward {{and have their}} roots in CNC milling technology. A PCB milling system {{is similar to a}} miniature and highly accurate NC <b>milling</b> <b>table.</b> For machine control, positioning information and machine control commands are sent from the controlling software via a serial port or parallel port connection to the milling machine's on-board controller. The controller is then responsible for driving and monitoring the various positioning components which move the milling head and gantry and control the spindle speed. Spindle speeds can range from 30,000 RPM to 100,000 RPM depending on the milling system, with higher spindle speeds equating to better accuracy, in a nutshell the smaller the tool diameter the higher RPM you need. [...] Typically this drive system comprises non-monitored stepper motors for the X/Y axis, an on-off non-monitored solenoid, pneumatic piston or lead screw for the Z-axis, and a DC motor control circuit for spindle speed, none of which provide positional feedback. More advanced systems provide a monitored stepper motor Z-axis drive for greater control during milling and drilling as well as more advanced RF spindle motor control circuits that provide better control over a wider range of speeds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} design of {{disturbance}} force observer for sustainable machining process in milling application. In milling process, cutting force acts directly on work surfaces thus producing external {{impact on the}} drives system of the positioning table.

Disturbance force observer (DFO) is a type of estimator that estimates precisely the disturbance force with prior knowledge of the cutting force harmonics frequencies. This paper presents both numerical and experimental results of DFO performed on an XYZ positioning <b>milling</b> <b>table</b> using measured cutting force.

40|$|Design and {{implementation}} of robust tracking controllers for linear feed drive high speed machine tools are the primary objectives of this work. Cutting forces and friction forces limit tracking accuracy and their influences are minimised through robust controller design. This paper discusses the design and tracking performances of a traditional cascade and a sliding mode controller for a X-Y <b>milling</b> <b>table.</b> Circular tests are performed at selected tracking speeds and circle radii for tracking performance analysis. The tracking error for cascade P/PI controller {{is proportional to the}} reference tracking speed and is inversely proportional to the velocity gain value of the position loop controller. Speed and acceleration feedforward further reduce this tracking error. Quadrant glitches, a product of nonlinear friction at the points of velocity reversal, are observed. Sliding mode controller exhibits better tracking accuracy and dynamic stiffness and yields a significant reduction of the quadrant glitches. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Disturbance forces {{acting on}} a system can greatly {{influence}} both positioning and tracking accuracy. This is especially important in machining process such as milling process. This paper {{is focused on the}} compensation of cutting forces in a XY high speed <b>milling</b> <b>table</b> using a sliding mode control (SMC). The performance of the sliding mode controller is then compared with a classical PID controller as a mean of comparing its effectiveness. Actual cutting forces for different depth of cuts and spindle speeds are applied in the numerical analysis. These are collected from several milling experiments using a Kistler dynamometer and analyzed further using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) for spectral analysis purposes. The PID controller is designed based on open loop and closed loops criteria. Chattering phenomenon on the sliding mode control is addressed by substituting the signum function with a sigmoid-like function. The numerical analysis showed that the robust sliding mode controller is able to compensate for different disturbance forces while suppressing chattering effect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{function}} of a cylinder allowing simultaneous measurements of the opposition axis of the index finger and thumb of the hand and the magnitude of pinch force is described. Methods The apparatus is made of two half-cylinders that are bonded together through a 6 -axis force/torque sensor and allows the measurement of 3 D orthogonal forces and moments of force. The amplitude of the pinch force exerted on the cylinder by the fingers {{is defined as the}} resultant of the forces in the different axes. A software program was developed to measure the barycentre of the forces on the instrumented cylinder, allowing calculation of the angle of the opposition axis between the fingers and the location of the resulting pinch force on the cylinder, assuming that the pinch or grip forces are co-linear {{through the center of the}} cylinder. In order to assess the validity and reliability of the measurements, the cylinder was mounted on a <b>milling</b> <b>table</b> and seven calibrated weights (from 100 to 500 g) were successively applied perpendicularly to a 9 * 9 matrix of sites separated by 1 cm. With the exception of the extreme lateral parts of the cylinder, the dispersion of the calculated vertical position of the resulting force was always within 1 mm of the application point, suggesting a high reliability of these measurements. In addition, the errors in the angles of the applied force were calculated and found to be less than 2 degree with no clear patterns of variation across the different locations of the cylinder. Results The usefulness of the cylinder is demonstrated by evaluating the pinch force and the opposition axis in six healthy subjects lifting the cylinder from the table using three different orientations of their right hand. The magnitude of the grip force was not significantly different across orientations (45, 22 and - 22 degrees relative to the midline of the subject) suggesting that force grip is controlled. Conclusion From these results, it has been concluded that the cylinder is a valid, reliable and precise instrument that may prove useful for evaluating opposition axis and grip force in healthy and pathological populations. </p...|$|E

This review has two main objectives: (i) to identify the main gaps in our knowledge regarding the biology and epidemiology of Venturia spp. affecting fruit trees; and (ii) to identify similarities and differences among these Venturia spp. in order to improve disease management. A thorough review has been conducted of studies regarding the phylogenetic relationships, host ranges, biologies, and epidemiologies of Venturia spp. A multiple correspondence analysis (CA) has also been performed on the main epidemiological components of these Venturia spp. CA separated the Venturia spp. into two main groups, according to their epidemiological behavior: the first group included V. inaequalis, V. pyrina, V. nashicola, and V. carpophila, the second F. oleagineum and F. eriobotryae, with F. effusum having an intermediate position. This review shows that Venturia spp. affecting fruit trees are highly host-specific, and that important gaps in understanding the life cycle exist for some species, including V. pyrina; gaps include pseudothecia formation, ascospore and conidia germination, and mycelial growth.
