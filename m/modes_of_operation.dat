25|$|Partly due to low {{awareness}} {{among the}} general population and prohibitive equipment costs, the number of licensed amateur radio operators did not increase significantly {{over the next two}} decades, numbering fewer than a thousand by 1970. CW (Morse code) and AM were the predominant modes at that time. The electronic equipment was mostly valve-based, obtained from Indian army surpluses. During the mid-1960s, the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> saw a change from Amplitude Modulation to Single Side Band (SSB) as the preferred communication mode. By 1980, the number of amateur radio operators had risen to 1,500. In 1984, then Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, waived the import duty for wireless equipment. After this, the number of operators rose steadily, and by 2000 there were 10,000 licensed ham operators. As of 2007, there are more than 17,000 licensed users in India.|$|E

On 13 October 1945, the pemuda decided to react strongly by resorting to violence towards the Allied forces. During the fight, two Indonesians and one Ambonese woman were killed. The tide of pemuda violence then spread from Medan to Pematang Siantar within two days and many including the Dutch, Ambonese, pemuda and Swiss were killed {{as a result of}} the fight. On 18 October 1945, the control of Medan became British’s responsibility, immediately after official orders were issued by Republican leaders for pemuda to surrender their weapons to the British troops. Nonetheless, the pemuda of East Sumatra managed to acquire some weapons that were left over by Japanese soldiers after the surrender and used them to confront the British in the south of Medan on 10 December 1945. A strong sense of contingency was said to be present in the British policy as the political circumstances in Indonesia has forced them to make decisions that were seemingly neither pro-Dutch nor pro-Indonesian. Tensions between the Dutch and British <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> as well as the strong resistance from Indonesian nationalists resulted in a low British morale throughout the post-war British occupation.|$|E

2500|$|ESI {{interface}} for LC-MS systems {{was developed}} by Fenn and collaborators in 1988. This ion source/ interface [...] {{can be used for}} the analysis of moderately polar molecules (e.g., metabolites, xenobiotics, and peptides). The liquid eluate coming out of the LC column is pumped through a metal capillary kept at 3 to 5 kV. The liquid is nebulized {{at the tip of the}} capillary and a fine spray of charged droplets is formed. To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages. Positively and negatively charged ions can be detected and it is possible to switch between the negative and positive <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Most ions produced in the ESI interface are multiply charged.
