40|$|Building on {{the success}} of the former North Queensland Clinical School/Royal Australian College of General Practitioners {{collaboration}} in North Queensland, the James Cook University School of Medicine continues to develop a model of close collaboration with stakeholder groups that provides <b>medical</b> <b>education</b> <b>services</b> to dispersed communities in northern Australia. The flagship themes of the programme (rural and remote, Indigenous and tropical health) are essential to the regional mission to improve the health care of people in northern Australia. Selection processes target regional and rural background students and Aboriginal and Torres Strain Islander students. An innovative curriculum design reinforces interest in and relevance to regional health needs. The present paper provides an overview of the roles and early progress of the new School of Medicine, with the aim of keeping rural doctors informed about the continuing development of a successful 'national standards/local collaboration and control' model of education service delivery...|$|E
40|$|Background: Residents' {{perception}} {{on quality}} of endocrinology training in India is not known. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} perceptions about endocrinology residency programs in India among current trainees as compared to practicing endocrinologists. Methods: Trainees attending a preconference workshop at the annual conference of Endocrine Society of India (ESI) were given a questionnaire designed to evaluate their perceptions on their training. These evaluated the reasons for choosing endocrinology, their experiences during residency, and career plans. Practicing endocrinologists attending ESICON with at least 5 -year experience were evaluated as controls. Results: Questionnaires from 63 endocrine trainees and 78 practicing endocrinologists were analyzed. Endocrinology {{is perceived to be}} the super-specialty with the best quality of life (QOL) but fair with regard to financial remuneration. Among current trainees, 61. 89 %, 31. 74 %, and 34. 91 % are satisfied with training in clinical endocrinology, laboratory endocrinology, and clinical/translational research, respectively. The corresponding figures for practicing endocrinologists are 71. 78 %, 25. 63 %, and 30. 75 %, respectively. Exposure to national endocrinology conferences during their endocrinology residency was adequate. However, exposure to international endocrinology conferences, research publications, project writing, and grant application are limited. Laboratory endocrinology is rated as the most neglected aspect during endocrine residency. Most of the trainees want to establish their own clinical practice in the long run. Very few trainees (17. 46 %) wish to join the <b>medical</b> <b>education</b> <b>services.</b> Conclusion: There is a good perception of QOL in endocrinology in spite of average financial remuneration. There is dissatisfaction with the quality of training in laboratory endocrinology and clinical research. Very few endocrine trainees consider academics as a long-term career option in India...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In most medical schools, {{graduate}} students, {{sometimes referred}} to as graduate teaching assistants, often participate in the training of undergraduate students. In developing countries like Uganda, are typically involved in undergraduate training. However, prior to this study there were no standard guidelines for this involvement. At the same time, the views and experiences of the graduate students in their role as educators had not been documented. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} explore the views and experiences of graduate students about their involvement in undergraduate training in three Ugandan medical schools. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of policies for training in Ugandan medical schools. Methods This was a qualitative study in which thirty in-depth-interviews were conducted among second and third year graduate students in three Ugandan medical schools in the MESAU consortium (<b>Medical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Services</b> to all Ugandans) including Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Makerere College of Health Sciences and Kampala International University, Western Campus. Results All graduate students from all the three medical schools viewed their involvement in undergraduate training as important. The study also revealed that graduate students increase available human resources and often compensate for the teaching missed when senior educators were absent. The graduate students expressed important views that need to be considered in the design of educational programs where they are to be involved. The respondents also reported a number of challenges in this undertaking that included lack of motivation, lack of orientation and having heavy workloads. The presence and commitment of senior educators to guide and support the graduate students in teaching activities was viewed as one significant intervention that would increase the effectiveness of their educational contributions. Conclusions Graduate students enjoy their involvement in the training of undergraduate students despite the various challenges they face. In some departments, the involvement of postgraduate trainees is critical to the viability of undergraduate medical training...|$|E
