5000|$|In 1870, {{the rich}} <b>massive</b> <b>copper</b> had been worked out, {{and the depth}} of the mine shafts had reached the limit of the {{hoisting}} equipment. At the same time, the price of copper dropped to $0.19 per pound, down from a high of $0.55 in 1864. Rather than invest in new equipment and explore for new ore bodies, the company stopped working the mine, and turned it over to tributer [...] - [...] independent miners who paid for the privilege of mining, usually paying a share of the ore they took out. The mine continued to be profitable to tributers, who took out 270 tons (245 mt) of copper in 1870, the same year that the mine closed. In 1876, the Minesota company paid a final dividend and went out of business, having paid a total of $1.82 million in dividends, versus $456,000 in assessments.|$|E
50|$|Krupp {{continued}} {{theoretical research}} on {{a replacement for}} the Paris Gun during the Weimar Republic-era, {{but it was the}} Nazi government that finally authorized funding for experiments to solve some of its worst problems. The extremely high velocities used by the Paris Gun to attain the stratospheric heights necessary for extreme range caused enormous wear of the barrel, {{so much so that the}} shells had to be made in gradually increasing diameter to suit the rate of wear. Even then barrel life was merely 50 rounds. It is believed that the one Paris Gun destroyed by a premature detonation in the bore was caused by loading one of the serially-numbered shells out of order. Thus Krupp decided to use only eight grooves in the barrel and to machine matching ribs or splines on the shells to eliminate the need for a <b>massive</b> <b>copper</b> driving band to start the shell spinning without shearing off, which had been one of the prime causes of the excessive barrel wear in the earlier weapon. Gas sealing would be handled by a copper band, mounted in the place normally occupied by the driving band, with an asbestos and graphite packing to form the initial seal. Several test barrels, known as the 10.5 cm K 12 M, and shells were made in 1935 and were compared to a conventionally rifled barrel (the 10.5 cm K 12 MKu). The tests proved that Krupp's concept was correct.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{properties}} of a plasma formed by sequential action of two laser beams {{on a flat}} target, simulating the conditions of shock-ignited inertial confinement fusion target exposure. The experiments were performed using planar targets consisting of a <b>massive</b> <b>copper</b> (Cu) plate coated with a thin plastic (CH) layer, which was irradiated by the 1 Ï‰ PALS laser beam (Î» = 1. 315 Î¼m) at the energy of 250 J. The intensity of the fixed-energy laser beam was scaled by varying the focal spot radius. To imitate shock ignition conditions, the lower-intensity auxiliary 1 Ï‰ beam created CH-pre-plasma which was irradiated by the main beam with a delay of 1. 2 ns, thus generating a shock wave in the massive part of the target. To study {{the parameters of the}} plasma treated by the two-beam irradiation of the targets, a set of various diagnostics was applied, namely: (i) Two-channel polaro-interferometric system irradiated by the femtosecond laser (âˆ¼ 40 fs), (ii) spectroscopic measurements in the X-ray range, (iii) two-dimensional (2 D) -resolved imaging of the KÎ± line emission from Cu, (iv) measurements of the ion emission by means of ion collectors, and (v) measurements of the volume of craters produced in a massive target providing information on the efficiency of the laser energy transfer to the shock wave. The 2 D numerical simulations have been used to support the interpretation of experimental data. The general conclusion is that the fraction of the main laser beam energy deposited into the <b>massive</b> <b>copper</b> at two-beam irradiation decreases in comparison with the case of pre-plasma.

40|$|New Reâ€“Os age {{determinations}} on mineralized {{material from}} the Polish Kupferschiefer elucidate the timing of mineralization and thus the likely mechanisms of ore deposition. Three mineralization parageneses were analysed: (a) chalcocite as pore space filling in sandstone, (b) disseminated Cuâ€“Mo mineralization in shale, and (c) <b>massive,</b> bedded <b>copper</b> sulphides. The resulting ages fall into two ranges: 245. 2 (Â± 1. 6) â€“ 264. 7 (Â± 1. 8) Ma and 162. 3 (Â± 0. 8) â€“ 184. 3 (Â± 2. 2) Ma. These results substantiate previous age determinations, although no Upper Triassic ages were found in this study. Some of the younger ages for the mineralization could represent alteration and recrystallization of existing sulphides. The results confirm that mineralization took place in several stages, from soon after Kupferschiefer sediment deposition in the Upper Permian and for at least 100 m. y. after, until at least the Cretaceous.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of mine planning {{is to determine}} ore quantity and quality distribution along a time sequence, i. e., scheduling the ore necessary to make the project technically and economically feasible. These temporal sequences are fundamental for the financial success of a mining activity and currently this optimal sequence can be obtained through various mining software. Most studies in mine planning present the final pit calculated by only one algorithm chosen by the mining engineer or simply by availability. Besides, technical constraints and geometrical aspects can be imposed promoting differences {{on the results of}} the project. There are many algorithms implemented in various commercial software for the ultimate pit calculation. One of the purposes of this work is to check the effectiveness of the algorithms that obtained greater recognition within the mineral industry and if there are differences related to the type of mineralization and deposit where they are applied. The comparison is performed using two commercial software, and two different algorithms to determine if differences can be observed from the different mineralization types.

It is listed as a status 1 indication according to the United Network for Organ Sharing classification. A <b>massive</b> amount of <b>copper</b> released during the attack induces hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure. Conventional chelating therapy attempting to remove copper from the patient is not satisfactory because there is inadequate time for these drugs to take action and patients are usually oliguric. The Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS) {{is a form of}} modified dialysis that removes putative albumin-bound toxins associated with liver failure. It is believed that extracorporeal albumin dialysate absorbs the circulating copper molecules that are trapped in the patient's circulation. We report 2 patients with acute decompensated Wilson disease treated with MARS. In the first case, the patient was started on MARS once conventional treatment failed. A significant amount of copper was removed from her circulatory system, and her condition stabilized afterwards. The treatment gained her extra time, and she was eventually bridged to liver transplantation. In the second case, the patient was started on MARS treatment early {{in the course of his}} illness, and his condition soon stabilized after the treatment. He was able to return to his home country for liver transplantation. In both cases, MARS was used as a means of preventing deterioration rather than salvaging devastation.
