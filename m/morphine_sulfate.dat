25|$|Diacetylmorphine (better {{known as}} heroin) was {{synthesized}} from morphine in 1874 {{and brought to}} market by Bayer in 1898. Heroin is approximately 1.5 to 2 times more potent than morphine weight for weight.

40|$|Introduction: Pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complaints}} of patients referred to emergency department (ED) and its control {{is one of the}} most important responsibilities of the physicians. The present study was designed, aiming to compare the efficiency of intranasal sufentanil and intravenous (IV) <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> in controlling extremity trauma patients' pain in ED. Methods: In the present clinical trial, extremity trauma cases referred to the ED of Imam Hossein Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from October 2014 to March 2015 were randomly divided into 2 groups treated with intranasal sufentanil (0. 3 µg/kg) and IV <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (0. 1 mg/kg) single-doses. Demographic data and information regarding the quality of pain control such as pain severity before intervention and 15, 30, and 60 minutes after intervention, and probable side effects were gathered using a checklist and compared between the 2 groups. Results: 88 patients with the mean age of 35. 5 ± 14. 8 years were included in the study (81. 8 % male). 44 patients received IV <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and 44 got intranasal sufentanil. No significant difference was detected between the 2 groups regarding baseline characteristics. In addition, there was no significant difference in the groups regarding pain relief at different studied times (p = 0. 12; F = 2. 46; df: 1, 86). Success rate of the drugs also did not differ significantly at different studied times (p = 0. 52). No significant difference was seen between the groups regarding side effects (p = 0. 24).

40|$|AbstractNeuropeptide FF (NPFF) modulates opiate actions. It has pro-nociceptive effects, {{primarily}} through the NPFF receptor 1 subtype, and anti-nociceptive effects, {{primarily through}} the NPFFR 2 subtype. AC- 263093 {{is a small}} l, organic, systemically active molecule that was previously shown to functionally activate NPFFR 2, but not NPFFR 1. It was hypothesized that AC- 263093 would attenuate morphine tolerance. Rats were tested for radiant heat tail-flick latency before and after 5 mg/kg <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> s. c. They were then rendered morphine-tolerant by continuous subcutaneous infusion of 17. 52 mg/kg/day <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate.</b> On the seventh day of infusion, they were retested for analgesia 10 and 20 min after 5 mg/kg <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> s. c. Tolerance was indicated by reduction of morphine analgesia from the pre-infusion test. Fifty minutes prior to morphine challenge, rats received either 10 mg/kg i. p. AC- 263093 or injection vehicle alone. AC- 2623093 -treated rats had far smaller tolerance scores than control rats. This drug effect was significant, p= 0. 015. The same dose of AC- 263093 had almost no analgesic effect in non-tolerant, saline-infused rats. In vitro experiments revealed that AC- 263093 had equal affinity for NPFFR 1 and NPFFR 2, and functionally inactivated NPFFR 1, {{in addition to its}} previously shown ability to activate NPFFR 2. Thus, altering the balance between activation of NPFF receptor subtypes may provide one approach to reversing opiate tolerance...|$|E
40|$|The undecapeptide {{substance}} P and the alkaloid <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> are two agents {{previously thought}} to have opposite roles in the mediation of spinal nociceptive processes. The present report, however, demonstrates that low doses of substance P when coadministered with marginally effective doses of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> into the rat subarachnoid space produce a markedly enhanced analgesic response, as monitored by the tail-flick test. This pharmacological effect is blocked by prior treatment with the opioid antagonist naloxone, indicating that the potentiated analgesic response is mediated by opioid-responsive neurons. In addition, the putative immediate precursor form of substance P (i. e., substance P-glycine) may substitute for the mature compound in the potentiated pharmacological effect. Moreover, the described synergism is unaffected by transection of the spinal cord, demonstrating the lack of supraspinal modulation of the observed phenomenon. Based on these observations, we {{are now able to}} dissociate opioid-potentiating and analgesic properties of substance P from traditional hyperalgesic effects realized at significantly higher concentrations. Consistent with previous biochemical data, a likely mechanism underlying the peptide-mediated enhancement of opioid analgesia may center on the ability of substance P to release endogenous opioid peptides within the local spinal cord environment. Finally, the pharmacological relationship of coadministered substance P and <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> established here supports the hypothesis that spinal tachykinin and opioid systems have a direct functional interaction in the modulation of local nociceptive responses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Opioid analgesics can {{be abused}} by {{crushing}} followed by solu-bilization and intravenous injection to attain rapid absorption. <b>Morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules (EMBEDA, MS-sNT), indicated for management of chronic, {{moderate to severe}} pain, contain pellets of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> with a sequestered naltrexone core. Should product tampering by crushing occur, the sequestered naltrexone is intended for release to reduce morphine-induced subjective effects. Objective: This study compared self-reports of high, euphoria, and drug-liking effects of intravenous morphine alone versus intravenous morphine combined with naltrexone in a clinical simulation of intravenous abuse of crushed MS-sNT. Methods: This single-center, randomized, double-blind, crossover study char-acterized subjective effects of naltrexone administered intravenously at the same ratio to morphine present in MS-sNT. Subjects were male and had used prescription opioids five or more times within the previous 12 months to ge...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and bioavailability (F) {{of single}} dose sustained release <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (OSRMS) and nonsustained release <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (NSRMS) {{were compared to}} each other and to a bolus injection of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (MS) intravenously (i. v.) in dogs. Beagles (n = 6) were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups: namely, OSRMS 15 mg orally, NSRMS 15 mg orally, and 15 mg i. v. Serum samples were drawn at intervals up to 480 min following oral and 420 min following i. v. administration. Serum was analysed for morphine concentration using a radioimmunoassay. Data were analysed using non-compartmental pharmacokinetics. The only statistically significant difference between OSRMS and NSRMS was maximum serum concentration (Cmax). There were trends toward longer time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) and longer mean absorption time (MAT) for OSRMS when compared to NSRMS, but the differences were not statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Pharmacokinetic parameters for both oral formulations exhibited large variability in the rate of absorption of MS from the gastrointestinal tract. Bioavailability of both OSRMS and NSRMS was low (15 %- 17 %). As expected, the area under the concentration vs time curve (AUC) and Cmax for the i. v. data was significantly greater than for both oral groups, and Tmax and mean residence time (MRT) were significantly less following i. v. administration. There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 treatment groups for apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) or elimination parameters. The OSRMS formulation used in this study provided equivalent bioavailability to NSRMS in dogs, accompanied by large individual variability in drug absorption. It also did not appear that the sustained release formulation provided sufficiently prolonged release of <b>morphine</b> <b>sulfate</b> from the tablet matrix in dogs to allow prolonged dosing intervals compared to NSRMS.
