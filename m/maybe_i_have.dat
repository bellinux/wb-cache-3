5000|$|In 1988, the Tunnel of Love Express Tour {{began and}} Springsteen {{convinced}} Scialfa {{to join the}} tour again. She expressed reluctance at first, since she wanted to start recording her first solo album, but after Springsteen {{told her that the}} tour would be short, she agreed to postpone her own solo record. Phillips and Springsteen separated in the spring of 1988, but it wasn't made known to the press. Springsteen and Scialfa fell in love with each other during the Tunnel of Love Express Tour and started living together soon after his separation from Phillips. On August 30, 1988, Julianne filed for divorce and it was finalized on March 1, 1989. Springsteen received press criticism for the hastiness in which he and Scialfa took up their relationship. In a 1995 interview with The Advocate, Springsteen told Judy Wieder about the negative publicity the couple subsequently received. [...] "It's a strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love and whom they shouldn't. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, 'Well, all I know is, this feels real, and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got a mess going here in some fashion, but that's life.'" [...] He also told Wieder that, [...] "I went through a divorce, and it was really difficult and painful and I was very frightened about getting married again. So part of me said, 'Hey, what does it matter?' But it does matter. It's very different than just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly—which is what you do: You get your license, you do all the social rituals—is a part of your place in society and in some way part of society's acceptance of you ...

5000|$|Khuzwayo joined AmaZulu from Durban Warriors in 2010. He {{made his}} debut on 22 September 2010 against Platinum Stars in a 2-2 draw. Khuzwayo played two more league games to {{finish with a}} total of 3. He was loaned to National First Division club Thanda Royal Zulu. Khuzwayo joined Chiefs {{at the end of the}} 2011-12 season signing a three-year {{contract}} which was finalised on 24 May 2012. On 23 May 2012, the day before Khuzwayo signed, AmaZulu general manager Peter O’Connor suggested it was in the player’s best interest that the club agreed to let him join Chiefs. “Seeing that Tapuwa Kapini has another three years with us, it was agreed that we would release ‘Casillas’ Khuzwayo because he wouldn’t be playing as the first-choice goalkeeper. So to enable him to get more game-time we have decided to allow him to join Chiefs after they had approached us for his services,” He made his debut on 28 April 2013 against Platinum Stars at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. The match was billed as the title decider but ended 0-0. He won the league and cup double with Chiefs. In the 2013-14 season he played four matches. He played in a 2-0 win over Golden Arrows in the league, another 2-0 against AS Vita in the CAF Champions League, a 1-0 win over Black Leopards and a 2-1 win over FC Buffalo, both in the Nedbank Cup. In the 2014-15 season he played his first league match in a 2-1 win over University of Pretoria conceding his first league goal since joining Chiefs. Ahead of the eagerly anticipated MTN 8 final, Khuzwayo was the favourite to be the goalkeeper in the absence of Itumeleng Khune. Coach Stuart Baxter said “Itu is one of our top players, and of course we’ll miss him. If my Lamborghini isn’t working today then <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to take the old Porsche. One of our ‘keepers has now got to be a Porsche, maybe he’s not a Lamborghini just yet, but he can be that Porsche. Lets see if they step up.” In his Soweto derby debut on 20 September 2014, despite being written off as the [...] "weakest link", Khuzwayo made numerous saves in Chiefs' 1-0 win over Orlando Pirates in the MTN 8 Final at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durbanhis hometown, and he thanked everyone at the club, most notably Khune, after he received the Man of the Match award. [...] "First and foremost I'd like to thank my family, my brothers, my friends, everyone who believed in me, Itumeleng Khune, he was motivating me all the time since I came to Kaizer Chiefs, he's just an inspiration to me," ...|$|E

40|$|The {{intent of}} applied welfare {{economics}} is to distinguish good from bad, {{so it is}} a branch of moral philosphy/ethics. Said another way, welfare economists {{are in the business of}} determining whether a policy will increase or decrease happiness. For thirty-odd years I have done environmental valuation: trying to estimate in dollars or Euros individuals’ willingness-to-pay for changes in the environment, estimating how and why willingness-to-pay might vary across individuals, and using these estimates to guide policy decisions. The foundations of this practice are the following: Economists believe, or assume, an individual has one, and only one, stable ordering of states of the world, believe the individual knows their ordering and will choose the highest-ranked availabe state, and believe that achieving a higher ranked state is preferred to a lower-ranked state in the sense that the individual is better o ¤ in the higher-ranked state. This essay reviews what I have learned- <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> it wrong-about these economic beliefs by scratching some surfaces in philosophy, ethics, psychology, neuroscience and evoluntionary biology. What are the implications for the way we, as economists, determine whether an action is good or bad...|$|E
