25|$|The Teleki-Bolyai Library is a {{historic}} public library and current museum in the town. One of the richest Transylvanian collections of cultural artefacts, it was founded by the Hungarian Count Sámuel Teleki in 1802, {{at the time when}} Transylvania was part of the Habsburg Monarchy, and has been open to the reading public ever since. It was among the first institutions of its kind inside the Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Hungary. It houses over 200,000 volumes, of which many are rarities, constituting a comprehensive scientific database. The book collection is divided into several smaller libraries, of which the two main donations are the original 40,000-volume Teleki Library and the 80,000-volume Bolyai Library; the rest, grouped as the <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Collection,</b> is made up of several private libraries, volumes previously held by religious schools and those of a Franciscan monastery. Overall, the library constitutes a collection of most traditional types of Transylvanian book.|$|E
500|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays {{consists}} {{primarily of}} Hazlitt's impressions of and thoughts {{about all of}} William Shakespeare's plays he believed to be genuine. It was the first book {{of the kind that}} anyone had yet written. His main focus is on the characters that appear in the plays, but he also comments on the plays' dramatic structure and poetry, referring frequently to commentary by earlier critics, as well as {{the manner in which the}} characters were acted on stage. The essays on the plays themselves (there is a [...] "Preface" [...] as well as an essay on [...] "Doubtful Plays of Shakespear" [...] and one on the [...] "Poems and Sonnets") number thirty-two, but with two of the essays encompassing five of the plays, the plays discussed amount to thirty-five in number. Though each essay constitutes a chapter in a book, in style and length they resemble those of Hazlitt's <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>collection</b> The Round Table (published also in 1817, a collaboration with Leigh Hunt), which followed the model for periodical essays established a century earlier in The Spectator.|$|E
500|$|The 6th Airborne Division {{would be}} opposed by German Army (Heer) {{formations}} {{stationed in the}} area around Caen and the River Orne. By June 1944, this consisted of the 709th and 716th Infantry Divisions; both of which were static formations whose manpower consisted of medically downgraded troops and conscripts recruited from the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. Both divisions also had a <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>collection</b> of anti-tank guns and artillery pieces, as well as a small number of German and French tanks and self-propelled guns. Neither division was rated as being highly efficient, with Allied intelligence rating them at a forty per-cent efficiency compared to a first-class line infantry division in a static role, and fifteen percent in a counter-attack role. Allied intelligence also indicated that two companies of armour were in the area, as were a number of ad hoc infantry formations formed from training establishments. Based near Caen, in support of the static divisions, was the 21st Panzer Division. The 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment was billeted at Vimont, just east of Caen and 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment based at Cairon {{to the west of the}} Caen canal and the River Orne bridges. Although a new formation equipped with an assortment of older tanks and other armoured vehicles, the core of the division were Afrika Korps veterans. [...] Further afield was the Panzer Lehr Division, based at Chartres, which was less than a day's march from the area. Also considered a threat to the airborne forces was the Waffen SS 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, based at Lisieux and believed capable of arriving in the vicinity of the airborne landings within twelve hours. The division possessed a large number of tanks and self-propelled guns, including the Panther.|$|E

2500|$|His manual {{on running}} a farm (De Agri Cultura or [...] "On Agriculture") (ca. 160 BC) is his only work that survives completely. It is a <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>collection</b> of rules of {{husbandry}} and management, including sidelights on country {{life in the}} 2nd century BC. Adopted by many as a textbook {{at a time when}} Romans were expanding their agricultural activities into larger scale and more specialized business ventures geared towards profitability, De Agri Cultura assumes a farm run and staffed by slaves. Cato advises on hiring gangs for the olive harvest, and was noted for his chilling advice on keeping slaves continually at work, on reducing rations for slaves when sick, and on selling slaves that are old or sickly. Intended for reading aloud and discussing with farm workers, De Agri Cultura was widely read and much quoted (sometimes inaccurately) by later Latin authors. Cato the Elder ranked the vineyard as the most important aspect when judging a farm. This was because of the profitability of the wine trade during that time. Grain pastures were ranked sixth due to the grain crisis.|$|E
