Before leaving Glasgow, he married a 16-year-old girl, Lynda Campbell. It was a <b>marriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> which allowed her to travel with him as she was too young to have her own passport. They split up after a few months and Jansch was eventually repatriated to Britain after catching dysentery in Tangiers.|$|E
5|$|For Sihanouk, {{this proved}} to be a <b>marriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> that was spurred on by his thirst for revenge against those who had betrayed him. For the Khmer Rouge, it was a means to greatly expand the appeal of their movement. Peasants, {{motivated}} by loyalty to the monarchy, gradually rallied to the GRUNK cause. The personal appeal of Sihanouk, and widespread US aerial bombardment helped recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after 9 October 1970, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of a centralized Khmer Republic.|$|E

From 1920, her relationship with Bryher became closer, and the pair travelled in Egypt, Greece and the United States before eventually settling in Switzerland. Bryher entered a <b>marriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> in 1921 with Robert McAlmon, which allowed him to fund his publishing ventures in Paris by utilising some of her personal wealth for his Contact Press.

5|$|Mason {{retained}} {{his interest}} in western affairs, hoping in vain to salvage the Ohio Company's land grant. He and Jefferson were among the few delegates to be told of George Rogers Clark's expedition to secure control of the lands north of the Ohio River. Mason and Jefferson secured legislation authorizing Governor Henry to defend against unspecified western enemies. The expedition was generally successful, and Mason received a report directly from Clark. Mason sought to remove differences between Virginia and other states, and although he felt the 1780 settlement of the boundary dispute with Pennsylvania, the Mason-Dixon line (not named for George Mason) was unfavorable to Virginia, he voted for it enthusiastically. Also in 1780, Mason remarried, to Sarah Brent, from a nearby plantation, {{who had never been}} married and was 52 years old. It was a <b>marriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience,</b> with the new bride able {{to take some of the}} burden of parenting Mason's many children off his hands.|$|E
5|$|Though {{she insists}} {{that she is}} in love with Louis, Blair begins to seek Chuck out as the season progresses. The two {{eventually}} declare their love for each other prior to a car accident in her limousine while being chased by paparazzi. Though both recover, Blair suffers a miscarriage from the crash. After the crash Blair decides that she must commit herself to Louis, converting to Catholicism and cutting off any connection with Chuck. At the wedding, Gossip Girl releases a recording of Blair confessing her love for Chuck. Nevertheless, Louis and Blair get married, making Blair a Princess of Monaco, though Louis informs her that they will have a loveless <b>marriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience.</b> She then receives support from Dan, leading them to share a kiss on Valentine's Day. Amidst these developments, Blair grows conflicted between her feelings for Dan and Chuck. After taking steps to end her marriage, she chooses to begin a romantic relationship with Dan. By the end of the season, however, after a debate about which love is the best—with Dan she feels safe, with Chuck she feels vulnerable—Blair declares that she is still in love with Chuck, and chooses to pursue him.|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{immigration}} laws that {{provide an opportunity}} for undocumented immigrants to become legal immigrants have been shown to substantially impact U. S. marriage rates (Smith Kelly, 2010; Dalmia 2 ̆ 6 Smith Kelly, forthcoming). Given this fact the big question is, are these <b>marriages</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> or not? In an attempt to answer the question, this study will examine the divorce propensity of residents in different sizes of immigrant-population counties before and after the immigration law change in 1994. If the spike in the marriage rates was a result <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience,</b> then we expect the immigration law change to also influence the U. S. divorce rates after undocumented immigrants have obtained their legal residence status (green card). In other words, undocumented immigrants who entered <b>marriages</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> would have the incentive to leave such arrangements after they have obtained their legal residence status. If the marriages that occurred during the immigration law change window were not <b>marriages</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> then the divorce rates should be unaffected. Undocumented and documented immigrants are spreading over more regions; however, the principal states where they reside are California, Texas, New York, Florida, New Jersey and Illinois (Passel et al., 2004). These states are the immigrant receiving states that will be examined. They were chosen for their large immigration population and availability of the required data...|$|R

Meyer had joined Brandt in Norway in July 1933. In 1937, during the Civil War, Brandt worked in Spain as a journalist. In 1938, the German government revoked his citizenship, so he applied for Norwegian citizenship. In 1940, he was arrested in Norway by occupying German forces, but was not identified as he wore a Norwegian uniform. On his release, he escaped to neutral Sweden. In August 1940, he became a Norwegian citizen, receiving his passport from the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, where he lived {{until the end of the}} war. Willy Brandt lectured in Sweden on 1 December 1940 at Bommersvik College about problems experienced by the social democrats in Nazi Germany and the occupied countries at the start of the Second World War. In exile in Norway and Sweden Brandt learned Norwegian and Swedish. Brandt spoke Norwegian fluently, and retained a close relationship with Norway.|$|E

500|$|Although UMNO {{supported}} ketuanan Melayu, {{it formed}} an [...] "Alliance" [...] with the MCA and the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) {{to contest the}} 1955 Federal Legislative Council elections.

Its President, Tan Cheng Lock, was himself a Straits Chinese, albeit not as extremist as the secessionists. Although initially dismissed as a <b>marriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience,</b> the Alliance won 51 out of 52 seats available. The sole remaining seat went to the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party (PMIP; later known as PAS), a Malay-based party and strong advocate of ketuanan Melayu. The total defeat of non-communal parties led the Alliance to perceive the political atmosphere as inhospitable for multi-racial parties. A coalition government comprising mono-racial parties in which party leaders privately brokered compromise decisions was thought more stable and better suited to Malayan politics.|$|E
