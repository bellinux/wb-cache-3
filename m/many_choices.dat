25|$|Alpha Protocol is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game developed by Obsidian Entertainment {{and published by}} Sega.

Thorton becomes a rogue agent and must unravel an international conspiracy to stop a war. Throughout the game, players must make <b>many</b> <b>choices</b> that affect the narrative. Played from a third-person perspective, players can confront enemies using firearms, gadgets, martial arts, and stealth. The game features extensive customization and a dialogue stance system that allows players to select dialogues based on three different tones.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{original}} Makaitoushi SaGa, {{much of the}} series has relied on loosely connected stories and sidequests rather than an epic narrative. Makaitoushi SaGa allowed players to travel through different worlds. Romancing SaGa expanded the open-endedness by offering <b>many</b> <b>choices</b> and allowing players to complete quests in any order, with the decision {{of whether or not}} to participate in any particular quest affecting the outcome of the storyline. The game also allowed players to choose from eight different characters, each with their own stories that start in different places and offer different outcomes. Romancing SaGa thus succeeded in providing a very different experience during each run through the game, something that later non-linear RPGs such as SaGa Frontier and Fable had promised but were unable to live up to. It also introduced a combo system where up to five party members can perform a combined special attack, and required characters to pay mentors to teach them abilities, whether it is using certain weapons or certain proficiencies like opening a chest or dismantling a trap.|$|E

Mad Max features a variety of weapons, including Max's iconic shotgun, but ammunition is scarce and the game emphasizes melee combat over firearms. One weapon is the explosive Thunderstick, which can be lanced into an enemy's chest. The game has a free-flow combat system combining professional wrestling attacks and boxing techniques, similar to Warner Bros.' previous [...] video-game series (in which indicators on enemies' heads remind the player when to strike, counter or make finishing moves).

40|$|The Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) {{property}} of the multinomial logit (MNL) model imposes the restriction of zero covariance between the utilities of pairs of alternatives. This restriction is inappropriate for <b>many</b> <b>choice</b> situations; those in which some pairs or sets of alternatives share the same unobserved attributes. The nested logit (NL) model relaxes the zero covariance restriction of the MNL model but imposes the restriction of equal covariance among all alternatives in a common nest and zero covariance otherwise. The paired combinatorial logit (PCL) model relaxes these restrictions further by allowing different covariances for each pair of alternatives. This relaxation enables the estimation of differential competitive relationships between each pair of alternatives. The closed form of the PCL model retains the computational advantages of other logit models while the more flexible error correlation structure, compared to the MNL model and NL models, enables better representation of <b>many</b> <b>choice</b> situations. This paper describes the derivation, structure, properties and estimation of the PCL model. The empirical results demonstrate that the PCL model is statistically superior to the MNL and NL models and may lead to importantly different travel forecasts and policy decisions. ...|$|R
500|$|Fitzgerald had {{difficulty}} choosing a title for his novel and entertained <b>many</b> <b>choices</b> before reluctantly choosing The Great Gatsby, a title inspired by Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes. Prior, Fitzgerald shifted between Gatsby; Among Ash-Heaps and Millionaires; Trimalchio; Trimalchio in West Egg; On the Road to West Egg; Under the Red, White, and Blue; Gold-Hatted Gatsby; and The High-Bouncing Lover. [...] The titles The Gold-Hatted Gatsby and The High-Bouncing Lover came from Fitzgerald's epigraph for the novel, one {{which he wrote}} himself under the pen name of Thomas Parke D'Invilliers. He initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio, the crude parvenu in Petronius's Satyricon, and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel: [...] "It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday nightâ€”and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over." [...] Unlike Gatsby's spectacular parties, Trimalchio participated in the audacious and libidinous orgies he hosted but, according to Tony Tanner's introduction to the Penguin edition, there are subtle similarities between the two.|$|E
500|$|Real-time {{gameplay}} {{with emphasis}} on weapons and cover was a preference because the team felt that the constant pausing to select powers interrupts {{the intensity of the}} combat. As a result, more options to assign different abilities to the user interface for use in real-time were added. Developers also decided to introduce regenerating health because it prevented players from playing erratically and relying on health kits. Norman remarked that it was important not to oversimplify the RPG elements but to still make them easier to use. She explained that the original Mass Effect offered [...] "too <b>many</b> <b>choices</b> that weren't particularly representative of how they would impact the game. In Mass Effect 2, the leveling options were pared down and made more descriptive." [...] For the character classes, the developers wanted to create very different play styles, [...] "even if it meant cutting some of the possible choices."
