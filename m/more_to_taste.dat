And I feel certain that no man ever, when beginning, had the most distant intention or expectation of becoming a drunkard. Your danger, dear old fellow, lies in your not seeing the danger. You admit that you like a social glass. Shank, I candidly make the same admission--I like it,--but after seeing your father, and hearing your defence, the danger has been so deeply impressed on me, that from this hour I resolve, God helping me, never <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> a social glass." ...|$|E

[...] Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns [...] That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, [...] Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, [...] In thee concentring all thir precious beams [...] Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n [...] Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou [...] Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee, [...] Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers [...] 110 [...] Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth [...] Of Creatures animate with gradual life [...] Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.

[...] Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne [...] In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd [...] Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath, [...] From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise [...] To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill [...] With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair [...] And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire [...] Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake [...] The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: [...] 200 [...] Then commune how that day they best may ply [...] Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew [...] The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. [...] And Eve first to her Husband thus began. [...] Adam, well may we labour still to dress [...] This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour. [...] Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands [...] Aid us, the work under our labour grows, [...] Luxurious by restraint; what we by day [...] Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, [...] 210 [...] One night or two with wanton growth derides [...] Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise [...] Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present, [...] Let us divide our labours, thou where choice [...] Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind [...] The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct [...] The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I [...] In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt [...] With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: [...] For while so near each other thus all day [...] 220 [...] Our task we choose, what wonder if no near [...] Looks intervene and smiles, or object new [...] Casual discourse draw on, which intermits [...] Our dayes work brought to little, though begun [...] Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. [...] To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd. [...] Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond [...] Compare above all living Creatures deare, [...] Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd [...] How we might best fulfill the work which here [...] 230 [...] God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass [...] Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found [...] In woman, then to studie houshold good, [...] And good workes in her Husband to promote. [...] Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd [...] Labour, as to debarr us when we need [...] Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, [...] Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse [...] Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, [...] To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food, [...] 240 [...] Love not the lowest end of human life. [...] For not to irksom toile, but to delight [...] He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd. [...] These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt [...] Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide [...] As we need walk, till younger hands ere long [...] Assist us: But if much converse perhaps [...] Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild. [...] For solitude somtimes is best societie, [...] And short retirement urges sweet returne. [...] 250 [...] But other doubt possesses me, least harm [...] Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst [...] What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe [...] Envying our happiness, and of his own [...] Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame [...] By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand [...] Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find [...] His wish and best advantage, us asunder, [...] Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each [...] To other speedie aide might lend at need; [...] 260 [...] Whether his first design be to withdraw [...] Our fealtie from God, or to disturb [...] Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss [...] Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; [...] Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side [...] That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects. [...] The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, [...] Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, [...] Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. [...] To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, [...] 270 [...] As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, [...] With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd. [...] Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, [...] That such an enemie we have, who seeks [...] Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, [...] And from the parting Angel over-heard [...] As in a shadie nook I stood behind, [...] Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. [...] But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt [...] To God or thee, because we have a foe [...] 280 [...] May tempt it, I expected not to hear. [...] His violence thou fearst not, being such, [...] As wee, not capable of death or paine, [...] Can either not receave, or can repell. [...] His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs [...] Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love [...] Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; [...] Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, [...] Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? [...] To whom with healing words Adam reply'd. [...] 290 [...] Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, [...] For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: [...] Not diffident of thee do I dissuade [...] Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid [...] Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. [...] For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses [...] The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd [...] Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff [...] Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne [...] And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, [...] 300 [...] Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, [...] If such affront I labour to avert [...] From thee alone, which on us both at once [...] The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, [...] Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. [...] Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; [...] Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce [...] Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. [...] I from the influence of thy looks receave [...] Access in every Vertue, in thy sight [...] 310 [...] More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were [...] Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, [...] Shame to be overcome or over-reacht [...] Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. [...] Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel [...] When I am present, and thy trial choose [...] With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. [...] So spake domestick Adam in his care [...] And Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thought [...] Less attributed to her Faith sincere, [...] 320 [...] Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. [...] If this be our condition, thus to dwell [...] In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, [...] Suttle or violent, we not endu'd [...] Single with like defence, wherever met, [...] How are we happie, still in fear of harm? [...] But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe [...] Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem [...] Of our integritie: his foul esteeme [...] Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns [...] 330 [...] Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard [...] By us? who rather double honour gaine [...] From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, [...] Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. [...] And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid [...] Alone, without exterior help sustaind? [...] Let us not then suspect our happie State [...] Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, [...] As not secure to single or combin'd. [...] Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, [...] 340 [...] And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. [...] To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd. [...] O Woman, best are all things as the will [...] Of God ordaind them, his creating hand [...] Nothing imperfet or deficient left [...] Of all that he Created, much less Man, [...] Or ought that might his happie State secure, [...] Secure from outward force; within himself [...] The danger lies, yet lies within his power: [...] Against his will he can receave no harme. [...] 350 [...] But God left free the Will, for what obeyes [...] Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, [...] But bid her well beware, and still erect, [...] Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd [...] She dictate false, and missinforme the Will [...] To do what God expresly hath forbid. [...] Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, [...] That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. [...] Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, [...] Since Reason not impossibly may meet [...] 360 [...] Some specious object by the Foe subornd, [...] And fall into deception unaware, [...] Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. [...] Seek not temptation then, which to avoide [...] Were better, and most likelie if from mee [...] Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. [...] Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve [...] First thy obedience; th' other who can know, [...] Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? [...] But if thou think, trial unsought may finde [...] 370 [...] Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, [...] Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; [...] Go in thy native innocence, relie [...] On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, [...] For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. [...] So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve [...] Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. [...] With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd [...] Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words [...] Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, [...] 380 [...] May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, [...] The willinger I goe, nor much expect [...] A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; [...] So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. [...] Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand [...] Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light [...] Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine, [...] Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self [...] In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, [...] Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, [...] 390 [...] But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, [...] Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, [...] To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd, [...] Likest she seemd, Pomona when she fled [...] Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, [...] Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. [...] Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd [...] Delighted, but desiring more her stay. [...] Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, [...] Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd [...] 400 [...] To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, [...] And all things in best order to invite [...] Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. [...] O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve, [...] Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! [...] Thou never from that houre in Paradise [...] Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; [...] Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades [...] Waited with hellish rancor imminent [...] To intercept thy way, or send thee back [...] 410 [...] Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. [...] For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, [...] Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, [...] And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde [...] The onely two of Mankinde, but in them [...] The whole included Race, his purposd prey. [...] In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft [...] Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, [...] Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, [...] By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet [...] 420 [...] He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find [...] Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope [...] Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, [...] Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, [...] Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, [...] Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round [...] About her glowd, oft stooping to support [...] Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay [...] Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, [...] Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies [...] 430 [...] Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, [...] Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, [...] From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. [...] Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd [...] Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, [...] Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen [...] Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours [...] Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: [...] Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd [...] Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd [...] 440 [...] Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, [...] Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King [...] Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. [...] Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. [...] As one who long in populous City pent, [...] Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, [...] Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe [...] Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes [...] Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, [...] The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, [...] 450 [...] Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; [...] If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, [...] What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, [...] She most, and in her look summs all Delight. [...] Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold [...] This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve [...] Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme [...] Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, [...] Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire [...] Of gesture or lest action overawd [...] 460 [...] His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd [...] His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: [...] That space the Evil one abstracted stood [...] From his own evil, and for the time remaind [...] Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, [...] Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; [...] But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, [...] Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, [...] And tortures him now more, the more he sees [...] Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon [...] 470 [...] Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts [...] Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. [...] Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet [...] Compulsion thus transported to forget [...] What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope [...] Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste [...] Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, [...] Save what is in destroying, other joy [...] To me is lost. Then let me not let pass [...] Occasion which now smiles, behold alone [...] 480 [...] The Woman, opportune to all attempts, [...] Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, [...] Whose higher intellectual more I shun, [...] And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb [...] Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, [...] Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, [...] I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine [...] Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. [...] Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, [...] Not terrible, though terrour be in Love [...] 490 [...] And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, [...] Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, [...] The way which to her ruin now I tend. [...] So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd [...] In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve [...] Address'd his way, not with indented wave, [...] Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, [...] Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd [...] Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head [...] Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; [...] 500 [...] With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect [...] Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass [...] Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, [...] And lovely, never since of Serpent kind [...] Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd [...] Hermione and Cadmus, or the God [...] In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd [...] Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, [...] Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore [...] Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique [...] 510 [...] At first, as one who sought access, but feard [...] To interrupt, side-long he works his way. [...] As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought [...] Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind [...] Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; [...] So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine [...] Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, [...] To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound [...] Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd [...] To such disport before her through the Field, [...] 520 [...] From every Beast, more duteous at her call, [...] Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd. [...] Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; [...] But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd [...] His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, [...] Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. [...] His gentle dumb expression turnd at length [...] The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad [...] Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue [...] Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, [...] 530 [...] His fraudulent temptation thus began. [...] Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps [...] Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm [...] Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, [...] Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze [...] Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard [...] Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. [...] Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, [...] Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine [...] By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore [...] 540 [...] With ravishment beheld, there best beheld [...] Where universally admir'd; but here [...] In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, [...] Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne [...] Half what in thee is fair, one man except, [...] Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen [...] A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd [...] By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. [...] So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; [...] Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, [...] 550 [...] Though at the voice much marveling; at length [...] Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. [...] What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't [...] By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? [...] The first at lest of these I thought deni'd [...] To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day [...] Created mute to all articulat sound; [...] The latter I demurre, for in thir looks [...] Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. [...] Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field [...] 560 [...] I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; [...] Redouble then this miracle, and say, [...] How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how [...] To me so friendly grown above the rest [...] Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? [...] Say, for such wonder claims attention due. [...] To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. [...] Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, [...] Easie to mee it is to tell thee all [...] What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: [...] 570 [...] I was at first as other Beasts that graze [...] The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, [...] As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd [...] Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: [...] Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd [...] A goodly Tree farr distant to behold [...] Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, [...] Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; [...] When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, [...] Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense [...] 580 [...] Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats [...] Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, [...] Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. [...] To satisfie the sharp desire I had [...] Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd [...] Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, [...] Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent [...] Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. [...] About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, [...] For high from ground the branches would require [...] 590 [...] Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree [...] All other Beasts that saw, with like desire [...] Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. [...] Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung [...] Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill [...] I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour [...] At Feed or Fountain never had I found. [...] Sated at length, ere long I might perceave [...] Strange alteration in me, to degree [...] Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech [...] 600 [...] Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. [...] Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep [...] I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind [...] Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, [...] Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; [...] But all that fair and good in thy Divine [...] Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray [...] United I beheld; no Fair to thine [...] Equivalent or second, which compel'd [...] Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come [...] 610 [...] And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd [...] Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. [...] So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve [...] Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. [...] Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt [...] The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: [...] But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? [...] For many are the Trees of God that grow [...] In Paradise, and various, yet unknown [...] To us, in such abundance lies our choice, [...] 620 [...] As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, [...] Still hanging incorruptible, till men [...] Grow up to thir provision, and more hands [...] Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. [...] To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.

[...] So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud [...] Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree [...] Of prohibition, root of all our woe; [...] Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. [...] Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, [...] Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, [...] The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, [...] Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. [...] 650 [...] But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; [...] God so commanded, and left that Command [...] Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live [...] Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. [...] To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. [...] Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit [...] Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, [...] Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? [...] To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit [...] Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, [...] 660 [...] But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst [...] The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate [...] Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. [...] She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold [...] The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love [...] To Man, and indignation at his wrong, [...] New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, [...] Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act [...] Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. [...] As when of old som Orator renound [...] 670 [...] In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence [...] Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, [...] Stood in himself collected, while each part, [...] Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, [...] Somtimes in highth began, as no delay [...] Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. [...] So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown [...] The Tempter all impassiond thus began. [...] O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, [...] Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power [...] 680 [...] Within me cleere, not onely to discerne [...] Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes [...] Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. [...] Queen of this Universe, doe not believe [...] Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: [...] How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life [...] To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, [...] Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, [...] And life more perfet have attaind then Fate [...] Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. [...] 690 [...] Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast [...] Is open? or will God incense his ire [...] For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise [...] Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain [...] Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, [...] Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade [...] To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; [...] Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil [...] Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? [...] God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; [...] 700 [...] Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: [...] Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. [...] Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, [...] Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, [...] His worshippers; he knows that in the day [...] Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, [...] Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then [...] Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, [...] Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. [...] That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, [...] 710 [...] Internal Man, is but proportion meet, [...] I of brute human, yee of human Gods. [...] So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off [...] Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, [...] Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring [...] And what are Gods that Man may not become [...] As they, participating God-like food? [...] The Gods are first, and that advantage use [...] On our belief, that all from them proceeds, [...] I question it, for this fair Earth I see, [...] 720 [...] Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, [...] Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd [...] Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, [...] That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains [...] Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies [...] Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? [...] What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree [...] Impart against his will if all be his? [...] Or is it envie, and can envie dwell [...] In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more [...] 730 [...] Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. [...] Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. [...] He ended, and his words replete with guile [...] Into her heart too easie entrance won: [...] Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold [...] Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound [...] Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd [...] With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; [...] Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd [...] An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell [...] 740 [...] So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, [...] Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, [...] Sollicited her longing eye; yet first [...] Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. [...] Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, [...] Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd, [...] Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay [...] Gave elocution to the mute, and taught [...] The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: [...] Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, [...] 750 [...] Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree [...] Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; [...] Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding [...] Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good [...] By thee communicated, and our want: [...] For good unknown, sure is not had, or had [...] And yet unknown, is as not had at all. [...] In plain then, what forbids he but to know, [...] Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? [...] Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death [...] 760 [...] Bind us with after-bands, what profits then [...] Our inward freedom? In the day we eate [...] Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. [...] How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, [...] And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, [...] Irrational till then. For us alone [...] Was death invented? or to us deni'd [...] This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? [...] For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first [...] Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy [...] 770 [...] The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, [...] Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. [...] What fear I then, rather what know to feare [...] Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, [...] Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? [...] Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, [...] Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, [...] Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then [...] To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? [...] So saying, her rash hand in evil hour [...] 780 [...] Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: [...] Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat [...] Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, [...] That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk [...] The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve [...] Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else [...] Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, [...] In Fruit she never tasted, whether true [...] Or fansied so, through expectation high [...] Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. [...] 790 [...] Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, [...] And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, [...] And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, [...] Thus to her self she pleasingly began. [...] O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees [...] In Paradise, of operation blest [...] To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, [...] And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end [...] Created; but henceforth my early care, [...] Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise [...] 800 [...] Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease [...] Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; [...] Till dieted by thee I grow mature [...] In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; [...] Though others envie what they cannot give; [...] For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here [...] Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, [...] Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind [...] In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, [...] And giv'st access, though secret she retire. [...] 810 [...] And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, [...] High and remote to see from thence distinct [...] Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps [...] May have diverted from continual watch [...] Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies [...] About him. But to Adam in what sort [...] Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known [...] As yet my change, and give him to partake [...] Full happiness with mee, or rather not, [...] But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power [...] 820 [...] Without Copartner? so to add what wants [...] In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, [...] And render me more equal, and perhaps [...] A thing not undesireable, somtime [...] Superior; for inferior who is free? [...] This may be well: but what if God have seen, [...] And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, [...] And Adam wedded to another Eve, [...] Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; [...] A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve, [...] 830 [...] Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: [...] So dear I love him, that with him all deaths [...] I could endure; without him live no life. [...] So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, [...] But first low Reverence don, as to the power [...] That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd [...] Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd [...] From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while [...] Waiting desirous her return, had wove [...] Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne [...] 840 [...] Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown [...] As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. [...] Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new [...] Solace in her return, so long delay'd; [...] Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, [...] Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; [...] And forth to meet her went, the way she took [...] That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree [...] Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, [...] Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand [...] 850 [...] A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, [...] New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. [...] To him she hasted, in her face excuse [...] Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, [...] Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. [...] Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? [...] Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd [...] Thy presence, agonie of love till now [...] Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more [...] Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, [...] 860 [...] The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange [...] Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: [...] This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree [...] Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown [...] Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect [...] To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; [...] And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, [...] Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, [...] Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, [...] Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth [...] 870 [...] Endu'd with human voice and human sense, [...] Reasoning to admiration, and with mee [...] Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I [...] Have also tasted, and have also found [...] Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, [...] Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, [...] And growing up to Godhead; which for thee [...] Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. [...] For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, [...] Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. [...] 880 [...] Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot [...] May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; [...] Least thou not tasting, different degree [...] Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce [...] Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. [...] Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; [...] But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. [...] On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard [...] The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd, [...] Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill [...] 890 [...] Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; [...] From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve [...] Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: [...] Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length [...] First to himself he inward silence broke. [...] O fairest of Creation, last and best [...] Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd [...] Whatever can to fight or thought be found, [...] Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! [...] How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, [...] 900 [...] Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? [...] Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress [...] The strict forbiddance, how to violate [...] The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud [...] Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, [...] And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee [...] Certain my resolution is to Die; [...] How can I live without thee, how forgoe [...] Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, [...] To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? [...] 910 [...] Should God create another Eve, and I [...] Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee [...] Would never from my heart; no no, I feel [...] The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, [...] Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State [...] Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. [...] So having said, as one from sad dismay [...] Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd [...] Submitting to what seemd remediless, [...] Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd. [...] 920 [...] Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve, [...] And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd [...] Had it bin onely coveting to Eye [...] That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, [...] Much <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> it under banne to touch. [...] But past who can recall, or don undoe? [...] Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so [...] Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact [...] Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, [...] Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first [...] 930 [...] Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; [...] Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, [...] Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man [...] Higher degree of Life, inducement strong [...] To us, as likely tasting to attaine [...] Proportional ascent, which cannot be [...] But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. [...] Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, [...] Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy [...] Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, [...] 940 [...] Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, [...] For us created, needs with us must faile, [...] Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, [...] Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, [...] Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power [...] Creation could repeate, yet would be loath [...] Us to abolish, least the Adversary [...] Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God [...] Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first [...] He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? [...] 950 [...] Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. [...] However I with thee have fixt my Lot, [...] Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death [...] Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; [...] So forcible within my heart I feel [...] The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, [...] My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; [...] Our State cannot be severd, we are one, [...] One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. [...] So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd. [...] 960 [...] O glorious trial of exceeding Love, [...] Illustrious evidence, example high! [...] Ingaging me to emulate, but short [...] Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, [...] Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, [...] And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, [...] One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff [...] This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, [...] Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread [...] Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, [...] 970 [...] To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, [...] If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, [...] Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, [...] Direct, or by occasion hath presented [...] This happie trial of thy Love, which else [...] So eminently never had bin known. [...] Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue [...] This my attempt, I would sustain alone [...] The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die [...] Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact [...] 980 [...] Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd [...] Remarkably so late of thy so true, [...] So faithful Love unequald; but I feel [...] Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life [...] Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, [...] Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before [...] Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. [...] On my experience, Adam, freely taste, [...] And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. [...] So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy [...] 990 [...] Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love [...] Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr [...] Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. [...] In recompence (for such compliance bad [...] Such recompence best merits) from the bough [...] She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit [...] With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat [...] Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, [...] But fondly overcome with Femal charm. [...] Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again [...] 1000 [...] In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, [...] Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops [...] Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin [...] Original; while Adam took no thought, [...] Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate [...] Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe [...] Him with her lov'd societie, that now [...] As with new Wine intoxicated both [...] They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel [...] Divinitie within them breeding wings [...] 1010 [...] Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit [...] Farr other operation first displaid, [...] Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve [...] Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him [...] As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: [...] Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. [...] Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, [...] And elegant, of Sapience no small part, [...] Since to each meaning savour we apply, [...] And Palate call judicious; I the praise [...] 1020 [...] Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. [...] Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd [...] From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now [...] True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be [...] In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, [...] For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. [...] But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, [...] As meet is, after such delicious Fare; [...] For never did thy Beautie since the day [...] I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd [...] 1030 [...] With all perfections, so enflame my sense [...] With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now [...] Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. [...] So said he, and forbore not glance or toy [...] Of amorous intent, well understood [...] Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. [...] Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, [...] Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd [...] He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, [...] Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, [...] 1040 [...] And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. [...] There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport [...] Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, [...] The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep [...] Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. [...] Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, [...] That with exhilerating vapour bland [...] About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers [...] Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep [...] Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams [...] 1050 [...] Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose [...] As from unrest, and each the other viewing, [...] Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds [...] How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile [...] Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, [...] Just confidence, and native righteousness, [...] And honour from about them, naked left [...] To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe [...] Uncover'd more. So rose the Danite strong [...] Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap [...] 1060 [...] Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd [...] Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare [...] Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face [...] Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, [...] Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht, [...] At length gave utterance to these words constraind. [...] O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give care [...] To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught [...] To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, [...] False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes [...] 1070 [...] Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know [...] Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, [...] Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, [...] Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, [...] Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, [...] Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, [...] And in our Faces evident the signes [...] Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; [...] Even shame, the last of evils; of the first [...] Be sure then. How shall I behold the face [...] 1080 [...] Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy [...] And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes [...] Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze [...] Insufferably bright. O might I here [...] In solitude live savage, in some glad [...] Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable [...] To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, [...] And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, [...] Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs [...] Hide me, where I may never see them more. [...] 1090 [...] But let us now, as in bad plight, devise [...] What best may for the present serve to hide [...] The Parts of each from other, that seem most [...] To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, [...] Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, [...] And girded on our loyns, may cover round [...] Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, [...] There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. [...] So counsel'd hee, and both together went [...] Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose [...] 1100 [...] The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, [...] But such as at this day to Indians known [...] In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes [...] Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground [...] The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow [...] About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade [...] High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; [...] There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate [...] Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds [...] At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves [...] 1110 [...] They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, [...] And with what skill they had, together sowd, [...] To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide [...] Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike [...] To that first naked Glorie. Such of late [...] Columbus found th' American to girt [...] With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde [...] Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. [...] Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part [...] Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, [...] 1120 [...] They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares [...] Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within [...] Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, [...] Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore [...] Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once [...] And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: [...] For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will [...] Heard not her lore, both in subjection now [...] To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe [...] Usurping over sovran Reason claimd [...] 1130 [...] Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest, [...] Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile, [...] Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. [...] Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd [...] With me, as I besought thee, when that strange [...] Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, [...] I know not whence possessd thee; we had then [...] Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild [...] Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable. [...] Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve [...] 1140 [...] The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek [...] Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. [...] To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve. [...] What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, [...] Imput'st thou that to my default, or will [...] Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows [...] But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by, [...] Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there, [...] Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd [...] Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; [...] 1150 [...] No ground of enmitie between us known, [...] Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme. [...] Was I to have never parted from thy side? [...] As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. [...] Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head [...] Command me absolutely not to go, [...] Going into such danger as thou saidst? [...] Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, [...] Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. [...] Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, [...] 1160 [...] Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. [...] To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd. [...] Is this the Love, is the recompence [...] Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest [...] Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, [...] Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, [...] Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: [...] And am I now upbraided, as the cause [...] Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, [...] It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? [...] 1170 [...] I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold [...] The danger, and the lurking Enemie [...] That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, [...] And force upon free Will hath here no place. [...] But confidence then bore thee on, secure [...] Either to meet no danger, or to finde [...] Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps [...] I also err'd in overmuch admiring [...] What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought [...] No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue [...] 1180 [...] That errour now, which is become my crime, [...] And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall [...] Him who to worth in Women overtrusting [...] Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, [...] And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, [...] Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. [...] Thus they in mutual accusation spent [...] The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning [...] And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps we may," [...] {{returned}} John Skyd, [...] "and if so, fighting will be <b>more</b> <b>to</b> my <b>taste</b> than farming--not that I'm constitutionally pugnacious, but I {{fear that}} {{my brothers and}} I shall {{turn out to be}} rather ignorant cultivators of the soil." ...|$|R

60|$|The little venture was a success, and {{all that}} winter the old ladies did their part faithfully, finding the task <b>more</b> <b>to</b> their <b>taste</b> than {{everlasting}} patchwork and knitting, and receiving a fair profit on their outlay, being shrewd managers, and rich in old-fashioned thrift, energy, and industry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Agatha, I don't know. That {{would be}} {{somewhat}} hard upon us poor girls, whose lovers are <b>more</b> <b>to</b> our <b>taste,</b> than M. Denot is to yours. I know not that our knights will fight {{the worse for}} a few stray smiles, though the times be so frightful." ...|$|R
