2500|$|In 1998, Prosecutor General of Russia Yuri Skuratov {{opened a}} bribery {{investigation}} against Mabetex, accusing Mabetex CEO Mr. Pacolli of bribing President Boris Yeltsin {{and his family}} members. Swiss authorities issued an international arrest warrant for Pavel Borodin, the official who managed the Kremlin's property empire. [...] Admitting publicly that bribery was usual business practice in Russia, Mr. Pacolli confirmed in early December 1999 that he had guaranteed five credit cards for Mr Yeltsin's wife, Naina, and two daughters, Tatyana and Yelena. President Yeltsin resigned {{a few weeks later}} in late December 1999 appointing Vladimir Putin to be his successor. President Putin's first decree as president was lifelong immunity from prosecution for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Yeltsin.</b>|$|E

Berezovsky, a Yeltsin ally.|$|R
5000|$|The British Prime Minister John Major had {{expressed}} feelings in a 1991 interview about the coup and said [...] "I {{think there are}} many reasons why it failed {{and a great deal of}} time and trouble will be spent on analysing that later. There were, I think, a number of things that were significant. I don’t think it was terribly well-handled from the point of view of those organising the coup. I think the enormous and unanimous condemnation of the rest of the world publicly of the coup was of immense encouragement to the people resisting it. That is not just my view; that is the view that has been expressed to me by Mr. Shevardnadze, <b>Mr.</b> Yakovlev, President <b>Yeltsin</b> and many others as well to whom I have spoken to the last 48 hours. The moral pressure from the West and the fact that we were prepared to state unequivocally that the coup was illegal and that we wanted the legal government restored, was of immense help in the Soviet Union. I think that did play a part." ...|$|R
5000|$|At 12:30 an {{aircraft}} bearing the Russian's advance party landed at Shannon. The official delegation, including Reynolds, the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Nikolai Kozyrev, Bertie Ahern (the Minister for Finance), Brian Cowen (the Minister for Energy), and Willie O'Dea (Minister of State) {{went to the}} runway to greet Yeltsin's plane which was expected ten minutes later. The assembled dignitaries waited but Yeltsin's plane did not land. Airport officials reported that it was circling over Shannon and County Clare. [...] After circling for an hour the plane landed. However, Yeltsin did not appear when the plane's door opened. An Aeroflot official informed Kozyrev that Yeltsin was unwell and that the vice premier, Oleg Soskovets, would meet with the Irish delegation. Kozyrev was able to board the plane {{but was unable to}} see Yeltsin. Alexander Korzhakov, Yeltsin's bodyguard, told Kozyrev that Yeltsin was [...] "very tired." [...] Kozyrev returned to the runway and informed Reynolds that Yeltsin would not be making an appearance due to poor health. Reynolds replied, [...] "Well now, if he is sick, there is {{nothing we can do about}} it. I am willing to talk to the Russian President's representative, but <b>Mr.</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> my guest, is on Irish soil, and I cannot miss the opportunity to go on board the airplane for five minutes, shake the president's hand and wish him a speedy recovery." [...] The Russians rejected this suggestion. Reynolds then agreed to meet Soskovets and gave orders for a meeting to be held in the airport. The Irish government commandeered the VIP lounge of Delta Air Lines to serve as the venue. Reynolds and Soskovets held a brief meeting and Yeltsin's plane departed immediately after it concluded.|$|E
