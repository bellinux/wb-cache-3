5|$|During {{the early}} morning hours, a cold front with several {{embedded}} low pressure areas extended from east Texas northeastward into the Ohio River Valley.

Early in the morning, the squall line, packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through Louisiana and Mississippi, then proceeded to affect North and Central Alabama and parts of Middle and East Tennessee. The line strengthened as it moved through Alabama, due in part to a high amount of low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and increasing wind shear.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{on other}} organisms have {{provided}} evidence that foraging {{can occur in}} long runs, but this preference develops after only visiting a few <b>morphs.</b> When presented with two equally rewarding <b>morphs,</b> it has been demonstrated that an organism may select to exclusively forage on one <b>morph</b> for a variable amount of time, and then switch to the alternative <b>morph</b> and repetitively forage on this <b>morph.</b> Under this switching attention hypothesis, selectively foraging on the common <b>morph</b> can occur without invoking a learned response, as the probability of visiting a particular <b>morph</b> first increases as the relative frequency of that <b>morph</b> increases. In other words, it is likely pollinators will select common <b>morphs</b> first due to chance since they are more common {{and will continue to}} forage on these <b>morphs</b> during foraging bouts.|$|R
40|$|Seed bank is a {{plant life}} history {{strategy}} against {{the unpredictability of}} the biotic and the abiotic environment. We simulated competition between a seed banking and a non-banking <b>morph</b> of an annual plant. A constant fraction of the banker <b>morph</b> seeds was allocated to the seed bank, where they had a constant mortality and germination rate. All surviving seeds of the non-banker <b>morph</b> germinated in the next generation. The seedlings of both <b>morphs</b> experienced similar density-dependent mortality. Whether one of the <b>morphs</b> wins or the <b>morphs</b> coexist was evaluated from parameter space plots and statistically with logistic regression analysis. All parameters of the model had a significant, nonlinear effect on {{the persistence of the}} <b>morphs,</b> supporting our approach of numerically covering a wide range of parameter values. The seed production of a focal <b>morph</b> increased its survival and decreased the survival of the other <b>morph.</b> Otherwise, the <b>morphs</b> showed opposite response to changes in the model parameters. The banker <b>morph</b> was usually the winning strategy when it had a higher seed production than the non-banker <b>morph.</b> The banker <b>morph</b> benefitted from high germination probability, while the non-banker benefitted from high allocation to seed bank and high seed mortality. The coexistence of the <b>morphs</b> was inhibited by high banker <b>morph</b> seed production and seed mortality and promoted by high values of all other parameters. The system showed complex dynamics when banking was the winning strategy or the <b>morphs</b> coexisted. In addition, a part of the parameter space where the non-banker <b>morph</b> wins showed complex dynamics. Our results suggest that seed banking is a beneficial strategy if seed number is increased consequently, e. g. due to a decreased seed size. If banking decreases seed number, the non-banker <b>morph</b> wins or the two <b>morphs</b> coexist. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|Seemingly gone forever, another Scarlet member {{known as}} Xi-Tiger {{took control of}} the organization.

Upon arriving, Xi-Tiger sensed the presence of Epsilon in one of the boys.

5|$|The Macedonian army {{continued}} to evolve under the Antigonid dynasty.

At the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC, the Macedonians commanded some 16,000 phalanx pikemen. Alexander the Great's 'royal squadron' of companion cavalry were similarly numbered to the 800 cavalrymen of the 'sacred squadron' (Latin: sacra ala; Greek: hiera ile) commanded by Philip V of Macedon during the Social War of 219 BC. Due to the Roman historian Livy's accounts of the battles of Callinicus in 171 BC and Pydna in 168 BC, it is known that the Macedonian cavalry were also divided into groups with similarly named officers as had existed in Alexander's day. The regular Macedonian cavalry numbered 3,000 at Callinicus, which was separate from the 'sacred squadron' and 'royal cavalry'. Thanks to contemporary inscriptions from Amphipolis and Greia dated 218 and 181 respectively, historians have been able to partially piece together the organization of the Antigonid army under Philip V, such as its command by tetrarchai officers assisted by grammateis (i.e. secretaries or clerks).|$|E
5|$|The first Labor {{party in}} South Australia was the United Labor Party in 1891, {{born out of}} a trade union {{association}} that recommended and supported trade unionist candidates. In response, the National Defence League (NDL) was born two years later.

The ULP <b>morphed</b> into the Australian Labor Party in 1910, and has been known by this name ever since. A separate Country Party subsequently emerged, representing rural interests, but this was assimilated back into the conservative side of politics {{with the formation of}} the Liberal and Country League (LCL) in 1932. The South Australian party system has not deviated from this two-party divide, and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence, until the emergence of smaller parties such as the Australian Democrats in the late 20th century, and the Australian Greens and Family First Party in the 21st century.|$|E

More modern machines cost even more: the Macintosh IIcx was $5,369, the IIci $6,269, and the IIfx $9,900 - all without monitors or keyboards. Color CRTs were relatively expensive in the late 1980s; Apple's 14-inch 640×480 monitor had a list price of $999 and Apple's ADB keyboards, while of high quality, were similarly expensive.

40|$|Summary. The feeding {{performance}} on soft and hard prey of two <b>morphs</b> of the trophically polymorphic Neotropical cichlid fish, Cichlasoma citrinellum, {{was investigated in}} the laboratory. The molariform <b>morphs,</b> specialized to feed on hard prey, are able to crack snail shells that are twice as hard as those cracked by the papilliform <b>morphs.</b> During ecological bottlenecks in food resources this ability should allow molariform <b>morphs</b> to exploit alternate, less preferred prey sources that are not available to papilliform <b>morphs.</b> Analysis of stomach contents revealed that molariform <b>morphs</b> feed significantly more often on hard snails than do papilliform <b>morphs</b> (Meyer 1989 a). The performance advantage of the trophically specialized <b>morphs</b> when feed-ing on hard prey is countered by their less efficient perfor-mance on soft diets. The morphologically generalized papil-liform <b>morph</b> feeds more efficiently on soft prey. The abun-dance of preferred soft prey, seasonal fluctuations in prey availability {{and the frequency of}} ecological bottlenecks may determine the relative abundance of these two <b>morphs</b> in natural populations in Nicaraguan lakes...|$|R
