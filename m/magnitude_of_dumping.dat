40|$|Of Europe’s {{approximately}} 6 million boats {{almost half}} are found inthe Nordic countries. In {{spite of the}} long durability of plastic boats, the problem of End of Life Boats (ELB) now starts to arise. However,the responsibilities are unclear {{and there is no}} regulation on how the dismantling and disposal is to be conducted. Investigations havebeen going on in the various Nordic countries on how to perform scrapping of plastic boats, but there is yet no consensus on how to handle the problem. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide information on statistics on boats in the Nordic countries and relate to the future need for scrapping plastic boats (ELB). More specific, the project dealt withthe <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> of boats, contents of contaminants in ELBs as well as possibilities for reuse and recycling of materials. Part of the project was to organize a Nordic Workshop with essential stakeholders and their views on ELB is compiled in this report. The project provides a good background to the problem of disposing of boats and highlights the various issues that must be addressed. Since the scrapping of boats is a future waste problem which need to be solved, this project is relevant to many different stakeholders from boaters, boat organizations, shipyards, waste companies and government institutions at various levels...|$|E
40|$|A dumping {{investigation}} involves comparing {{export prices}} with a “normal value” loosely {{defined as the}} price in the exporter’s domestic market observed {{in the course of}} normal trade. However, domestic sales with prices below production costs are excluded from the computation of a normal value; thus increasing the probability products with cyclical prices will get caught with positive dumping margins although there are no intentions to <b>dump.</b> The objective <b>of</b> the paper is to illustrate how price cycles impact the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> estimated <b>dumping</b> margins. The empirical analysis focuses on Canadian hog exports to the U. S. and U. S. potato exports to Canada. The period and amplitude of each price cycles are estimated. The analysis starts with the assumption that export and domestic prices are equal so no true dumping occurs. Margins are then calculated based on rules that exclude below cost sales. The resulting average dumping margins for Canadian hogs and U. S. potato exports are respectively 11. 5 and 5. 9 percent. Biases in dumping margins depend {{on the nature of the}} cycle, the period of investigations, and the estimate of the cost of production. ...|$|R

Limited availability <b>of</b> land for <b>dumping</b> encourages the uncontrolled <b>dumping</b> <b>of</b> waste, {{on the outskirts of}} city that take a large space of land.. Some chemical content on dump site soil may affect the future structure to develop such as concrete on foundation and steel pile. Different locations <b>of</b> <b>dump</b> site have different soil characteristics and chemical content. The aim of this study generally to determine the geotechnical properties, chemical content, strength parameter and settlement <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the soil. The structure may damage from long term effect such as corrosion, eroded and also reduce in workability. There are possibilities present of Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Copper (Cu), Cadmium (Cd), Chlorine (Cl), Chromium (Cr), Lead (Pb), and Nitrogen (N) in the soil. From the study, it’s shown that specific gravity of soil is much lower from normal soil since it does contain organic matter. Besides that, the soil also has high plasticity due to polluted by variety <b>of</b> <b>dump</b> and leachate that may affect its characteristic. The chemical content that present in the soil are more than 20 but only 8 elements and oxides have more than 1 % present percentage in the soil.

This allows antidumping measures to be used for protectionist ends and to harass trade partners. While putting antidumping measures on a sounder economic foundation in international law may be difficult given their popularity with politicians, no progress can be made until economists provide a theoretically sustainable definition <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> and devise a set of transparent criteria for determining if dumping is occurring.

Section II focuses on the application of these procedures to the international steel trade, taking as a case study the most noteworthy of recent innovations : the Trigger Price Mechanism for steel. Section III considers models {{that can be used to}} analyze <b>dumping.</b> The models <b>of</b> most relevance to the practices currently at issue in the steel industry seem to us models of oligopolistic rivalry in imperfectly competitive, segmented markets. We develop a model designed to identify crucial factors upon which the incidence <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> will depend: the number of firms producing for each national market,their costs, their market shares, and the extent to which they recognizeand exploit their mutual dependence. Finally, in Section IV we calibrate these models to illustrate how the extent <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> and the effects of the TPM depend on the model's parameters. ...|$|R
