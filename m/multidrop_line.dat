50|$|In a <b>multidrop</b> <b>line</b> {{arrangement}} (a central {{computer and}} different terminals {{in which the}} terminals share a single communication line {{to and from the}} computer), the system uses a master/slave polling arrangement whereby the central computer sends message (called polling message) to a specific terminal on the outgoing line. All terminals listen to the outgoing line, but only the terminal that is polled replies by sending any information that it has ready for transmission on the incoming line.|$|E
40|$|Digital Communication {{can send}} signals of several devices on one wire. This reduces {{the costs of}} wiring immensely. DIA and AíD {{converters}} are superfluous for digital communicatioQ because controllers are mostly digital and the mfonnation is already digital now. So this also reduces the costs. These advantages make digital communication attractive. The HART protml is wide spread digital communication protocol in process industry. At DSM many devices are HART compatible. In the multidrop mode the HART protocol can send signals of several devices on one wire. Because of the advantages and the unacquaintedness with the multidrop mode of the HART protocol, the Instrument Group, pari of the Center of Process Control / Engineering Stamicarbon of DSM made an experimental design to investigate the HART protocol and its multidrop mode. Problems are expected for the HART protocol in DDC because of the sampiing time and time áelay that can cause undesirable behaviour. The sampling time can be varied by changing the number of devices to the <b>multidrop</b> <b>line.</b> The sa. mplq time is equal to number of devices times halfa second. Investigating if ' the HART protocol is suitable for DD...|$|E
50|$|In star networks, which, in its {{simplest}} form, {{consists of}} one central switch, hub, or computer {{that acts as}} a conduit to transmit messages, polling is not required to avoid chaos on the lines, but it is often used to allow the master to acquire input in an orderly fashion. These poll messages differ from those of the <b>multidrop</b> <b>lines</b> case because there are no site addresses needed, and each terminal only receives those polls that are directed to it.|$|R
40|$|The Hop-constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem (HMST) {{is defined}} as follows: Given a graph G = (V, E) with node set V = { 0, 1, [...] ., n}, edge set E {{as well as a}} cost ce {{associated}} with each edge e ∈ E and a natural number H, we wish to find a spanning tree T of the graph with minimum total cost such that the unique path from a specified root node, node 0, to any other node has no more than H hops (edges). The HMST is N P-hard because it contains as a particular case (the case with H = 2) an N P-hard version of the simple uncapacitated facility location problem (see [6, 2]). It has been shown by [11] that the HMST is even not in APX, i. e., the class of problems for which it is possible to have polynomial time heuristics with a guaranteed approximation bound. The HMST models the design of centralized telecommunication networks with quality of service constraints. The root node represents the site of a central processor (computer) and the remaining nodes represent terminals that are required to be linked to the central processor. The hop constraints limit the number of hops (edges) between the root node and any other node and guarantee a certain level of service with respect to some performance constraints such as availability and reliability (see, e. g., [15]). Availability refers to the probability that all the transmission lines in the path from the root node to the terminal are working, and reliability corresponds with the probability that a session will not be interrupted by a link failure. In general, these probabilities decrease with the number of links in the path implying that paths with fewer hops have a better performance with respect to availability and reliability. Centralized terminal networks are also usually implemented with <b>multidrop</b> <b>lines</b> for connecting the terminals with the center. In such networks, node processing times dominate over queuing delays and fewer hops mean, in general, lower delays...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} examined distributed {{computer based}} process control systems. A functional analysis {{was done to}} identify the subunits that make up such a system. They are: i) a communication system ii) a distributed database iii) a presentation system for a) the process b) the process engineer c) the process operator Each of these subunits is discussed in detail in chapters 3 - 7. An economic analysis was also carried out to determine the optimum distribution of the control task. It was concluded that, on present costs, each controller should contain eight control loops. The controllers and man machine interfaces should be distributed along a <b>multidrop</b> communications <b>line.</b> Based on these analyses, a system was implemented within the department. It used an M 6800 microcomputer for the controller and the departmental PDP 11 minicomputer for the man machine interfaces. The result proved to be effective, especially the process operator's interface. This used a colour graphics CRT with touch sensitive screen and ten key keyboard. This input system minimised training and, combined with the three level hierarchical displays, provided an efficient work station...|$|R
