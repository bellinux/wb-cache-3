40|$|A linked simulation-optimization model using {{artificial}} {{neural networks}} ANNs and genetic algorithms GAs is developed for deriving <b>multiple</b> objective <b>management</b> strategies for coastal aquifers. The GA-based optimization approach is especially suitable for externally linking a numerical simulation model within the optimization model. However, {{the solution of}} a linked simulation-optimization model is computationally intensive, as {{a very large number}} of iterations between the optimization and the simulation models are necessary to arrive at an optimal management strategy. Computational efficiency and feasibility for such linked models can be enhanced by simplifying the simulation process by an approximation. A possible approach for such approximation is the use of an ANN model. In this paper, an ANN model is developed initially as an approximate simulator of the three-dimensional density dependent flow and transport processes in a coastal aquifer. A simulation-optimization model is then developed by linking the ANN model with a GA-based optimization model for solving <b>multiple</b> objective saltwater <b>management</b> problems. The performance of the optimization models is evaluated using an illustrative study area. For comparison of the solution results, a <b>multiple</b> objective <b>management</b> model is also solved using embedded formulation and classical nonlinear optimization technique. The comparison of results shows potential feasibility of the proposed methodology in solving <b>multiple</b> objective <b>management</b> model for coastal aquifers...|$|R

50|$|However, {{characteristics}} of receptor sites can vary across different jurisdictions. In some countries, for instance, land is primarily state-owned, {{and so it}} is the government that owns and manages biodiversity offset projects. For biodiversity offsets in marine environments, receptor sites might be subject to <b>multiple</b> <b>management</b> organisations and not necessarily owned by anyone. Controversially, some biodiversity offsets use existing protected areas as receptor sites (i.e. improving the effectiveness of areas that are already managed for biodiversity conservation).|$|E

There is no single “correct” model for a devolved infrastructure, thus greatflexibility is needed in the architecture of the configuration system itself. Sometimes a set of highly autonomoussites wish to collaborate loosely. In this case each site will host a fairly comprehensiveset of configuration servers, with common configuration information being retrieved from a shareddatabase and integrated with the local configuration.|$|E

A problem faced by any railroad is worn-out or defective rails, which can result in hundreds of derailments per year. Under a DSS, the Canadian National Railway system managed to decrease the incidence of derailments at the same time other companies were experiencing an increase.|$|E
