5|$|Some of {{the ancient}} sources detail plots that Galerius made on Constantine's life in the months {{following}} Diocletian's abdication. They assert that Galerius assigned Constantine to lead an advance unit in a cavalry charge through a swamp on the middle Danube, made him enter into single combat with a lion, and attempted to kill him in hunts and wars. Constantine always emerged victorious: the lion emerged from the contest in a poorer condition than Constantine; Constantine returned to Nicomedia from the Danube with a Sarmatian captive to drop at Galerius' feet. It is uncertain how <b>much</b> <b>these</b> tales can be trusted.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} Byzantine period, the khan of Khazaria in the {{northern}} Caucasus and his court converted to Judaism, partly {{in order to maintain}} neutrality between Christian Byzantium and the Islamic world. This event forms the framework for Yehuda Halevi's work The Kuzari (c.1140), but how <b>much</b> <b>these</b> traces of Judaism within this group survived the collapse of the Khazar empire is a matter of scholarly debate.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow <b>much.</b> <b>These</b> areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The hope is that such large scale exercises will draw down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E

25|$|Since Gilbert {{had been}} his closest relative, and Robert and Isabelle had had no children, his estates passed to a distant relative, Sir William Tailboys. How <b>much</b> <b>these</b> lands were {{actually}} worth, however, Summerson has queried: although his manors around Redesdale covered over 25,000 acres, Scotland and England were {{in a state of}} war, and 1414so it is likely, he suggests, that they had been greatly ravaged. Possibly the only lands of Umfraville's that were worth their full value at the time, he says, were those in Lincolnshire, which could have been worth up to £400 per annum.|$|E
25|$|When {{protecting}} the coastline {{it is important}} to understand the how the sedimentary budget can be affected when implementing appropriate coastal protecting techniques. Often management plans for coastal erosion have seen the use of ‘hard’ engineering structures as a means of {{protecting the}} coastline from recession. In particular groynes which are used to trap the longshore drift of sediment that often deprives a beach. Groynes have the ability to change the coast's sediment budget, accreting up drift beaches but at the same time starving down drift beaches. This management approach is not used so <b>much</b> <b>these</b> days, with modern knowledge of coastal dynamics promoting the use of ‘soft’, natural approaches such as nourishment and preservation of natural systems such as dunes.|$|E

The game received praise for its {{preservation of the}} original arcade releases' integrity, additions of online multiplayer and challenges, and variety of unlockable content. On the other hand, it received criticism for its unbalanced character rosters and outdated gameplay mechanics.

[...] Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera praised the selection of songs, saying they [...] "fit with the gameplay of Rock Band very well". Some reviewers, such as GamePro's Mitch Dyer, were {{disappointed by the}} focus on Green Day's newer songs. Several reviewers were critical of the setlist, feeling that the songs were not fun to play or were too easy. Others praised the songs chosen, saying that songs such as [...] "F.O.D."

500|$|Hayley Louise Brown of Clash {{viewed the}} song as an {{important}} part of the album, musing [...] "opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad ‘Thinking About You’ and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean’s vocal range, the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial Odd Future synths and clumsy piano chords." [...] Lane Billings of Paste noted the song as whispy in nature, and made a case for Ocean as an R revivalist. Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly, [...] "like perfect thoughts about someone missed, until the muscle memory of Ocean’s falsetto bursts into the song’s upper register." [...] She continued, [...] "while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs, there’s a reason Bey shed a tear the first time she heard it. Regardless of how <b>much</b> <b>these</b> lyrics were influenced by lines like, 'By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless,' the ache in Ocean’s voice is universal. MSN Music's Danielle Cheesman felt that Ocean did his followers a service by featuring the song as the album's opener, describing the track as" [...] the year-old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite." [...] She continued, [...] "despite now being enhanced with a strings intro, his falsetto - more importantly - remains in tact over the well-known warped ebb and flow." ...|$|E
500|$|The concert {{opened with}} Spears taking the stage {{accompanied}} by four blonde female dancers {{to perform a}} short version of [...] "...Baby One More Time", wearing a silver beaded bra, a pleated white skirt and white boots.

Though while Spears performed the original choreography, the performance was compared to the style of the Pussycat Dolls. The dancers then left Spears alone onstage to perform a chair routine of [...] "Breathe on Me". They re-entered with a male fan from the audience with them and Spears giving him a lap dance. Half way through the lap dance, Spears disappeared for a costume change leaving her dancers to continue the performance. She then reappeared in a hot pink bra, white fur coat and jean skirt to perform [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] with Spears throwing air guitars to the crowd. The show then concluded with [...] "Toxic", which featured Spears and her dancers performing in a mix of Spears and Shakira dance styles. As the performance came to an end, Spears said [...] "Thank you so <b>much.</b> <b>These</b> are my dancers"– her only words during the show– and left the stage.
