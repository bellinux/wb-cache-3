The map was drawn at twice final <b>map</b> <b>scale,</b> and photographically reduced to produce the five film positives for printing.

25|$|This is the {{standard}} process used by National Mapping Agencies. It uses a plastic film, which is coated on one side with a photo-opaque film. The layer is removed with a scribing tool or scalpel to produce a negative image. One sheet of film is needed for each solid colour, and one for each screen, usually requiring about ten sheets of film altogether. The map is drawn at final <b>map</b> <b>scale,</b> and the negatives are printed with high quality dot screens to produce the five film positives for printing.

2500|$|The USGS {{produces}} several {{national series}} of topographic maps which vary in scale and extent, with some wide gaps in coverage, notably the {{complete absence of}} 1:50,000 scale topographic maps or their equivalent. The largest (both in terms of scale and quantity) and best-known topographic series is the 7.5-minute, 1:24,000 scale, quadrangle, a non-metric scale virtually unique to the United States. Each of these maps covers an area bounded by two lines of latitude and two lines of longitude spaced 7.5 minutes apart. Nearly 57,000 individual maps in this series cover the 48 contiguous states, Hawaii, U.S.territories, and areas of Alaska near Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Prudhoe Bay. The area covered by each map varies with the latitude of its represented location due to convergence of the meridians. At lower latitudes, near 30° north, a 7.5-minute quadrangle contains an area of about [...] At 49° north latitude, [...] are contained within a quadrangle of that size. As a unique non-metric <b>map</b> <b>scale,</b> the 1:24,000 scale naturally requires a separate and specialized romer scale for plotting map positions. In recent years, budget constraints have forced the USGS to rely on donations of time by civilian volunteers {{in an attempt to}} update its 7.5-minute topographic map series, and USGS stated outright in 2000 that the program was to be phased out in favor of The National Map (not {{to be confused with the}} National Atlas of the United States produced by the Department of the Interior, one of whose bureaus is USGS).|$|E

To identify what <b>map</b> <b>scales</b> people may need and what spatial features make relevant maps stand out, we conducted an experiment on subjective map selection in a route planning task between two {{cities in the}} United States. Our {{results suggest that the}} distribution of selected maps is fairly concentrated on those maps that contain spatial information about both the origin and the destination, the current location and the destination, and the transition between different important roads in a route.

As such the entire area of the river floodplains in the Netherlands may be mapped with high accuracy and regular updates, capturing the dynamic state of the vegetation. In this study, these fused datasets are used to map the vegetation of 936 ha of the floodplain on the north-side of the river Nederrijn near Wageningen into ten vegetation structure classes. The method follows object-based image analysis principles. Objects are defined in segmentation and subsequently labeled using the ensemble-tree classifier random forest. The <b>mapping</b> <b>scale</b> is controlled by selecting segmentation parameters from quantified discrepancies between reference polygons and segmented objects. Effects on the <b>mapping</b> <b>scale</b> of different reference polygons and different segmentation data is investigated. The results show {{that it is important}} to be able to select the right segmentation parameters to control the <b>mapping</b> <b>scale.</b> A discrepancy measure with reference polygons is a suitable method to do this objectively. The use of random forest classification on the objects resulted in an estimated classification accuracy of 86 % on the basis of the built-in cross-validation estimate of random forest. Variable importance measures of random forest showed that the AHN 2 lidar dataset is a valuable addition to the spectral information contained in the aerial images in the classification. </p...|$|R

The Chinese cartographer and geographer Pei Xiu of the Three Kingdoms period created a set of large-area maps that were drawn to scale.
