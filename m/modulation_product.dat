40|$|A {{method to}} {{characterize}} the memory effects in a nonlinear concurrent dual-band transmitter is presented. It {{is an extension of}} the conventional two tone test for power amplifiers to concurrent dual band transmitters. The output signal of a concurrent dual-band transmitter is affected not only by intermodulation products but also by cross-modulation products. In one frequency band, the transmitter is excited by a two tone signal which frequency separation is swept. In the second band the transmitter is concurrently excited by an other two tone signal with slightly wider frequency separation. The frequency difference of the two signals is fixed during the frequency sweep. The two tone test is made at different power levels. The upper and lower third-order inter- and cross-modulation products are measured. The asymmetry between the upper and lower third-order inter- and cross-modulation products are measures of the transmitter's memory effects. The measurement results show that the memory effects are more dominant in the third-order intermodulation products than in the cross <b>modulation</b> <b>products.</b> An error analysis and system calibration was performed and measurement results for two different devices are presented.

40|$|A general {{method for}} {{compressing}} the <b>modulation</b> time-bandwidth <b>product</b> of analog signals is introduced and experimentally demonstrated. As {{one of its}} applications, this physics-based signal grooming performs feature-selective stretch, enabling a conventional digitizer to capture fast temporal features that were beyond its bandwidth. At the same time, the total digital data size is reduced. The compression is lossless and is achieved through a same-domain transformation of the signal's complex field, performed in the analog domain prior to digitization. Our method is inspired by operation of Fovea centralis in the human eye and by anamorphic transformation in visual arts. The proposed transform can also be performed in the digital domain as a digital data compression algorithm to alleviate the storage and transmission bottlenecks associated with "big data".

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of oral and product temperature on the perception of texture and flavor attributes. A trained panel assessed 21 texture and flavor attributes in one high-fat and one low-fat product of two semi-solids: custard dessert and mayonnaise. The products were evaluated at 10, 22 or 35 °C in combination with oral temperatures of 27, 35 and 43 °C. Results showed that <b>modulation</b> of <b>product</b> and oral temperature had significant effects {{on a number of}} attributes. Flavor intensities, melting mouth feel, and fat after feel increased, while subjective thickness decreased with increasing product temperature. Neither product- nor oral temperature had an effect on over-all creaminess. Oral temperature affected a number of mouth feel attributes: melting, heterogeneous and smooth. Furthermore, large differences existed in ratings between the high- and low-fat products of custard and mayonnaise, and they were more prominent in mayonnaise. We conclude that the effect of oral temperature on the perception of sensory attributes in semi-solids was small, but present, while the product temperatures influenced the ratings greatly. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{discussion}} of the use of amplitude modulation techniques with regard to the length sensing and control of optical cavities for laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Traditional radio frequency amplitude modulation techniques automatically include phase <b>modulation</b> as a <b>product</b> of the <b>modulation</b> process which can contaminate the signal after demodulation. In particular, with many length sensing and control schemes the detected signals are demodulated in quadrature which {{in the case of a}} traditional amplitude modulation scheme will result in offsets due to the additional phase modulation.

40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} communication systems, signal space diversity techniques are usually adopted to combat channel fading by exploiting time diversity, frequency diversity, spatial diversity {{or a combination}} of them. Most existing schemes to achieve signal space diversity are based on linear constellation spreading. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear signal space diversity technique based on maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. The new technique provides a design flexibility for almost any number of diversity channels and desired diversity orders. We also propose a simple and suboptimal diversity channel selection (DCS) decoding for our new scheme. DCS decoding can greatly reduce the decoding complexity at a cost of marginal performance loss relative to the optimal detection while keeping the diversity order. Simulation results show that with the same throughput but a lower decoding and implementation complexity, our scheme can have superior performance than the optimal linear spreading schemes over either independent fading or additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.

40|$|Hyperacusis is {{described}} as an enhanced sensitivity towards sounds. It occurs together with tinnitus, but can also be present as an isolated symptom. A possible reason for hyperacusis is a reduced function of efferent mediocochlear function, that causes a strong auditory respons to a relatively small stimulus. On the other hand could a displacement of the cochlear partition, lead to a stronger activity of the outer hair cells. The recording of transient otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) under contralateral stimulation {{can be used to}} examine efferent auditory function. In the case of reduced efferent auditory function, the suppression of TEOAE should be smaller than expected. Close contact between cochlear menbranes, caused by stiffness of the basilar membrane, can be measured by using the low-frequency <b>modulation</b> of distorsion <b>products</b> of otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Stiffness of the basilar membrane results in reduced modulation. Contralateral stimulation of TEOAE and low-frequency modulation of DPOAE have been performed in 15 patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis, 15 patients with normal hearing and hyperacusis and 15 normal subjects.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the human visual system is insensitive to acceleration in moving stimuli. This notion is supported by evidence that detection sensitivity for velocity modulation in moving stimuli is a lowpass function of the velocity modulation's temporal frequency. However, the lowpass function might be a mixture of detection by attention-based tracking and low-level mechanisms sensitive to acceleration. To revisit the issue of acceleration perception in relation to attentive tracking, we measured detection sensitivities for velocity modulations at various temporal frequencies (0. 25 – 8 Hz) by using drifting gratings within long or short spatial windows that make the tracking of grating easier or more difficult respectively. Results showed that modulation sensitivity is lowpass for gratings with long windows but bandpass for gratings with short windows (peak at ~ 1 Hz). Moreover, we found that lowpass sensitivity becomes bandpass when we removed observer attention by a concurrent letter identification task. An additional visual-search experiment showed that a target dot moving with a velocity modulation at relatively high temporal frequencies (~ 2 – 4 Hz) was most easily detected among dots moving at various constant velocities. These results {{support the notion that}} high sensitivity to sluggish velocity <b>modulation</b> is a <b>product</b> of attentively tracking of moving stimuli and that the visual system is directly sensitive to accelerations and/or decelerations at the preattentive level...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: AtPAP 2 is {{a purple}} acid {{phosphatase}} that is targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria. Over-expression (OE) lines of AtPAP 2 grew faster, produced more seeds, and contained higher leaf sucrose and glucose contents. The present study aimed {{to determine how}} high energy status affects leaf and root transcriptomes. RESULTS: ATP and ADP levels in the OE lines are 30 - 50 % and 20 - 50 % {{higher than in the}} wild-type (WT) plants. Global transcriptome analyses indicated that transcriptional regulation does play a role in sucrose and starch metabolism, nitrogen, potassium and iron uptake, amino acids and secondary metabolites metabolism when there is an ample supply of energy. While the transcript abundance of genes encoding protein components of photosystem I (PS I), photosystem II (PS II) and light harvesting complex I (LHCI) were unaltered, changes in transcript abundance for genes encoding proteins of LHCII are significant. The gene expressions of most enzymes of the Calvin cycle, glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were unaltered, as these enzymes are known to be regulated by light/redox status or allosteric <b>modulation</b> by the <b>products</b> (e. g. citrate, ATP/ADP ratio), but not at the level of transcription. CONCLUSIONS: AtPAP 2 overexpression resulted in a widespread reprogramming of the transcriptome in the transgenic plants, which is characterized by changes in the carbon, nitrogen, potassium, and iron metabolism.

The possibility that this phenomenon {{is due to the}} action of lymphocytes or some of their products has been investigated by analysing in vitro the <b>modulation</b> of HLA <b>products</b> in Beta cells. Monolayer cultures from 25 human pancreatic glands were supplemented with alpha-interferon (IFN), beta-IFN or gamma-IFN, interleukin 2 (IL- 2) and supernatants from activated lymphocytes. In addition, lectins {{and a variety of other}} hormones, biological products and chemicals were tested. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression was assessed by double immunofluorescence technique using monoclonal antibodies to non-polymorphic determinants of Class I and Class II molecules and the pancreatic cells were identified by antibodies to islet hormones and other cytoplasmic antigens. gamma-IFN and lectins produced a parallel enhancement of HLA-A,B,C expression in islet, exocrine/ductal cells and fibroblasts. HLA-D/DR was inducible in all pancreatic cell types, except endocrine islet cells which did not produce Class II molecules in response to any of the stimuli including supernatants from activated lymphocytes. Exocrine/ductal cells from glands of patients with chronic pancreatitis spontaneously expressed Class II products, but islet cells were devoid of any detectable D/DR. These data are consistent with recent observations which have indicated that in the 'diabetic' pancreas inappropriate Class II expression in the Beta cells occurs independently of the presence of lymphocytes infiltrating the islets, and make it necessary to postulate that other factors are responsible for the Class II induction in Beta cells in human Type I diabetes...|$|R
