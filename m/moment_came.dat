5|$|Tanev's biggest <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> in {{the tournament}} final against Finland, playing 21:38 in ice time, {{including}} a team-high 8:37 {{in the third period}} as Canada defended their one-goal lead. Team Canada held on to win the gold medal for a second consecutive year.|$|E
5|$|Besides the 1874 Supreme Court ruling, a {{critical}} <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> on December 15, 1879, when Judge Lorenzo Sawyer of the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in Orton, 32 F. 457 (C.C.D. Cal. 1879), {{that the federal}} government controlled the railroad land grants, and more importantly, the state could not control ultra vires acts of corporations.|$|E
5|$|Their most {{successful}} <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> in 1998, when, {{against all the}} odds they defeated Wigan in the Challenge Cup final, despite being huge underdogs. The team then hit troubled times before reforming in 2003. Since then they have played their rugby in the Championship (second tier). In 2011, they made the playoffs finishing in fifth place. They made the Grand Final, by defeating Leigh, who were huge favourites in a playoff semi final. In the final, they were comprehensively beaten by Featherstone Rovers. Sheffield also put {{in a bid to}} be a host city for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, but their bid was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|The first {{significant}} <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> {{in the approach}} to the Collada de Beixalis, the first climb of the day. Chris Froome hit a wooden barrier and then a wall, injuring his left shoulder and knee and his right foot. He was dropped from the lead group and, {{with the help of}} teammates, started a long chase back to the leading group. The first riders to attack were Romain Sicard (Europcar) and Darwin Atapuma (BMC); they were followed by seventeen other riders, including Fraile, the leader of the mountains classification. They led over the summit of the climb, with Fraile the first over the summit to extend his lead in the classification. Froome regained contact with the main group on the descent from the climb.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Rutherford {{had succeeded}} in {{disintegrating}} nitrogen atoms with alpha particles emitted from decaying radium atoms. This and subsequent experiments hinted at the structure of atomic nuclei. To explore it further, he needed an artificial means of creating particles with a velocity high enough to overcome the charge of the nucleus. This opened {{a new line of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory. He assigned Cockcroft, Thomas Allibone and Ernest Walton to the problem. They built what became known as a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Mark Oliphant designed a proton source for them. A crucial <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> when Cockcroft read a paper by George Gamow on quantum tunnelling. Cockcroft realised {{that as a result of}} this phenomenon, the desired effect could be achieved with much lower voltages than first thought. In fact, he calculated that protons with energy of just 300,000 electronvolts would be able to penetrate a boron nucleus. Cockcroft and Walton worked on their accelerator for the next two years. Rutherford obtained a £1,000 grant from the University of Cambridge for them to buy a transformer and other equipment they needed.|$|E

25|$|As a bowler, his {{greatest}} <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> at Dhaka in January 1984. He took 6/10 (including a hat-trick) against Singapore {{in the opening}} match of the 1984 South-East Asia Cup.|$|E
25|$|A mildly notorious <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> during CBS' {{coverage}} of the 1990 All-Star Game from Wrigley Field in Chicago. In a game that was marred by rain delays for a combined 85 minutes (including a 68-minute monsoon during the 7th inning), CBS annoyed many diehard fans by airing the William Shatner-hosted reality series Rescue 911 during the delay.|$|E
25|$|Bermuda's {{greatest}} cricketing <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> on 7 July 2005 {{when they}} {{qualified for the}} semi-finals of the 2005 ICC Trophy.

25|$|The Carthaginians were blockading {{the harbor}} of Syracuse with {{a fleet of}} triremes which greatly outnumbered the sixty ships of Agathocles had manned. Agathocles {{had to wait for}} a {{suitable}} opportunity to leave Syracuse. This <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> when a few grain ships en route for the harbor of Syracuse arrived. When the Carthaginian fleet temporarily lifted the blockade to chase the grain ships, Agathocles quickly led his fleet out of the port.|$|E
25|$|The Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) was a {{civil rights}} {{organization}} in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, which coordinated boycotts and sponsored federal lawsuits aimed at dismantling segregation in Birmingham and Alabama during the Civil Rights Movement. Fred Shuttlesworth, pastor of Bethel Baptist Church, {{served as president of}} the group from its founding in 1956 until 1969. The ACMHR's crowning <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> during the pivotal Birmingham Campaign which it coordinated along with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference during the Spring of 1963.|$|E
25|$|Maregwede's cricket {{heroes are}} Steve Waugh, {{and like many}} Zimbabweans, Andy Flower. His proudest <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> in the U19 World Cup when he scored 64 against Australia. He also played first team rugby and hockey for Churchill and was a sprinter. Alester really enjoys travelling, and is glad that his cricket {{commitments}} give him the chance to visit many foreign countries. Alester was a vital member of the Mildura Settlers Cricket Clubs first premiership in 20 years. Alester has since parted ways with the club but is hopeful of remaining in the area.|$|E

25|$|Brian Crump was {{a pillar}} of the Northamptonshire side in the 1960s. Perhaps his finest cricketing <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> at Cardiff in August 1965. Northamptonshire and Glamorgan were both in strong {{contention}} for County Championship honours, and Keith Andrew's men secured a tense 18-run victory which, at the time, looked to have given them a decisive advantage in the title race. Crump took 8-142 from 76.3 overs in the game, conceding less than two runs an over, and was carried into the pavilion when the final Glamorgan wicket went down, having bowled unchanged in the second innings.|$|E
25|$|Reichel's {{most famous}} {{international}} <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> {{in the first}} of his two Olympic appearances {{in one of the most}} significant moments in Czech hockey history. Canada and the Czech republic battled to a 1–1 tie in the semi-final at the 1998 Nagano Games, a contest that ultimately required a shootout to decide the game. Reichel scored the lone goal and Dominik Hašek stopped all Canadian shots to lead the Czech Republic into the gold medal game. The Czechs went on to defeat Russia in the final to win the nation's first Olympic gold medal. The victory touched off celebrations throughout the Czech Republic.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> in August 1969 {{when there}} was a major outbreak of intercommunal violence in Belfast and Derry, with eight deaths, six of them Catholics, and whole streets ablaze. On 14–15 August loyalists burned out several Catholic streets in Belfast in the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969. IRA units offered resistance, however very few weapons were available for the defence of Catholic areas. Many local IRA figures, and ex-IRA members such as Joe Cahill and Billy McKee, were incensed by what they saw as the leadership's decision not to take sides and in September, they announced that they would no longer be taking orders from the Goulding leadership.|$|E

25|$|An all-rounder, Chamberlain got {{his first}} called up to the South Australian team in the 1907/08 cricket season, when he played against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club in a {{first-class}} fixtures. Chamberlain, who dismissed Test player Jack Crawford for his maiden wicket, made his Sheffield Shield debut three weeks later. He participated in South Australia's 1912/13 Shield winning campaign, scoring 166 runs and taking eight wickets from his three matches. His wickets tally was the third highest for South Australia but perhaps his best <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> with the bat {{when he came in}} at five and amassed 103 in just 130 minutes against New South Wales at Adelaide Oval.|$|E
25|$|As chancellor, Brandt {{developed}} his Neue Ostpolitik (New Eastern Policy). Brandt {{was active in}} creating a degree of rapprochement with East Germany, and also in improving relations with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other Eastern Bloc (communist) countries. A seminal <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> in December 1970 with the famous Warschauer Kniefall in which Brandt, apparently spontaneously, knelt down at the monument to victims of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The uprising occurred during the Nazi German military occupation of Poland, and the monument is to those killed by the German troops who suppressed the uprising and deported remaining ghetto residents to the concentration camps for extermination.|$|E
25|$|The 1961 {{series was}} a {{personal}} triumph for skipper Richie Benaud, whose match-winning bowling and astute leadership in the fourth Test at Old Trafford {{proved to be the}} decisive factor in the series. With the series square, England needed 256 to win and were expected to get them, but Benaud, by bowling his leg breaks round the wicket into some rough created by footmarks, took 6-70 to secure an Australian victory by 54 runs. The key <b>moment</b> <b>came</b> when he bowled the England captain Peter May behind his legs for a duck. The bemused May had to be told by Aussie keeper Wally Grout that he had been bowled.|$|E
