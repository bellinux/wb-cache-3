5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the <b>main</b> <b>carrier</b> {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E
5|$|Serving as a {{link between}} Steubenville, Ohio and Weirton, West Virginia, the Fort Steuben Bridge opened as a toll bridge in November 1928. The bridge was the <b>main</b> <b>carrier</b> of U.S. Route 22 over the Ohio River, its traffic {{included}} trucks and heavy duty vehicles associated with the industrial facilities in Weirton-Steubenville area and along the Ohio River. The Fort Steuben Bridge provided a more direct route for the flow of traffic which previously {{had to use the}} Market Street Bridge. As of 1940 the toll for the bridge was 5 cents (US$ with inflation) for pedestrians and 25 cents (US$ with inflation) for automobiles. The toll was removed in 1947, when ownership of the bridge was transferred to the State of Ohio. Improvements to the bridge were made in 1956.|$|E

25|$|LATI did 211 trans-Atlantic flights, {{of which}} 132 {{were done with}} a special Savoia-Marchetti SM 83. The speed reached 300km/h {{but it was only}} allowed a {{transport}} of up to 500kg. The flights were mainly commercial (for postal services) but a few passengers were allowed to use the transatlantic route. Furthermore, according to Samuel Pezzillo, LATI had been able to pick up much of the mail traffic that German Lufthansa had provided to South America prior to ending its service in August, 1939: it was the <b>main</b> <b>carrier</b> of postal services between Western Europe occupied by the Axis and South America until December 1941.|$|E
25|$|Marraffino's design, {{which remains}} in use for single-color stripes, is simple. The main material, usually white, {{sits at the}} crimp end of the {{toothpaste}} tube and makes up most of its bulk. A thin pipe, through which that carrier material will flow, descends from the nozzle to it. The stripe-material (this was red in Stripe) fills {{the gap between the}} carrier material and the top of the tube. The two materials are not in separate compartments, however they are sufficiently viscous that they will not mix. When pressure is applied to the toothpaste tube, the main material squeezes down the thin pipe to the nozzle. Simultaneously, the pressure applied to the main material causes pressure to be forwarded to the stripe material, which thereby issues out through small holes (in the side of the pipe) onto the <b>main</b> <b>carrier</b> material as it is passing those holes.|$|E

500|$|The main Japanese carrier-borne strike {{aircraft}} were the D3A1 [...] "Val" [...] dive bomber and the B5N2 [...] "Kate", {{which was used}} either as a torpedo bomber or as a level bomber. The <b>main</b> <b>carrier</b> fighter was the fast and highly maneuverable A6M [...] "Zero". For a variety of reasons, production of the [...] "Val" [...] had been drastically reduced, while that of the [...] "Kate" [...] had been stopped completely and, as a consequence, there were none available to replace losses. In addition, many of the aircraft being used during the June 1942 operations had been operational since late November 1941 and, although they were well-maintained, many were almost worn out and had become increasingly unreliable. These factors meant all carriers of the Kido Butai had fewer aircraft than their normal complement, with few spare aircraft or parts stored in the carriers' hangars.|$|E
