60|$|Before I {{was aware}} of it we {{had gotten out of}} the narrow canyon into a valley with well-timbered bottom, and open, slow rising slopes. We were getting down into Penetier. Cubby swerved from the trail and started up the left slope. I did not want to go, but I had to keep with him, and that was the only way. The hunter strode behind without speaking, and so I {{gathered}} that the direction suited him. By leaning back on the rope I walked up the slope as easily {{as if it were a}} <b>moving</b> <b>stairway.</b> Cubby pulled me up; I had only to move my feet. When we reached a level once more I discovered that the cub was growing stronger and wanted to go faster. We zigzagged across the ridge to the next canyon, which at a glance I saw was deep and steep.|$|E
50|$|The {{sculptor}} {{also did}} some set {{work in the}} cinema. In 1946 {{he worked on the}} Powell and Pressburger film A Matter of Life and Death at Denham Film Studios. On the giant <b>moving</b> <b>stairway</b> featured in the film, Aumonier created the statues of various famous people. By coincidence, Powell and Pressburger's production company was called The Archers.|$|E
50|$|The Rock had {{a variety}} of rides for its tourists. Its oldest ride was The Old Mill, built in 1904. Another ride was Shoot-the-Chutes, which was rebuilt and renamed The Mill Chutes, {{featuring}} a <b>moving</b> <b>stairway</b> saving ride-goers a hike to the ride entrance. Among the other rides were the Jitterbug, The Virginia Reel, and The Seaplane Swing. It also had several rollercoasters such as The Sky Blazer, The Racer, The Whirlwind Racer, The White City Flyer, and The Thunderbolt.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, it {{has held}} the title of being the most used line, and {{increased}} even more so after {{the opening of a}} section of tunnel between Los Incas station in the neighborhood of Parque Chas and a shopping centre in Villa Urquiza. It was the first line in Buenos Aires whose stations had turnstiles and <b>moving</b> <b>stairways.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{division}} of the state public safety department, The Board of Elevator Regulations, has eight members who are appointed to serve by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Board of Elevator Regulations regulates the construction, installation, alteration and operation of all elevators in Massachusetts. The term “elevator” includes <b>moving</b> <b>stairways,</b> dumbwaiters, <b>moving</b> walkways, material lifts, vertical reciprocating conveyors, and dumbwaiters with automatic transfer devices, wheelchair lifts, automatic people movers and other associated devices that are commonly included within the elevator industry. All elevator constructors, maintenance people, repairpeople, and operators must be licensed by the Board.|$|R
40|$|During the Pre-Modern Era of 1970 s; new {{buildings}} questioning general typologies and offering advances {{in terms of}} design and function are started to be built. Architects not only looked for unattempted block structures but also their quest for unattempted block structures were continued for internal places, too and internal implicit setups were designed using ortographic tools like plans and sections. In today’s museums; new and multiple circulation routes are designed; in which visitors do not read books {{from beginning to end}} but choose their own paths and walk through the exhibition as if in a labyrinth on their own. These radical perceptional, spatial changes and spatial scenarios are particularly emphasized in museum buildings. These new spatial arrangements in circulation areas are offering new spatial experiences with irregular gaps in sections, regular but non-geometric floor plans, vagueness of the borders, striking colors, patterns and materials, differentiated circulation parts (stairs, <b>moving</b> <b>stairways,</b> elevators, platforms, bridges). In the study; Jean Nouvel’s Quai Branly Museum (2006) which is a recent example of this striking change will be analyzed thorough spatial experiences, observations, syntactic analysis technique and semantic examinations.      </p...|$|R
5000|$|In 1950, the {{landmark}} case Haughton Elevator Co. v. Seeberger precipitated {{the end of}} Otis's exclusive reign over the word [...] "escalator", and simultaneously created a cautionary study for companies and individuals interested in trademark retention. Confirming the contention of the Examiner of Trademark Interferences, Assistant Commissioner of Patents Murphy’s decision rejected Otis’ appeal to keep their trademark intact, and noted that [...] "the term 'escalator' is recognized {{by the general public}} as the name for a <b>moving</b> <b>stairway</b> and not the source thereof", observing that Otis had [...] "used the term as a generic descriptive term [...] [...] [...] in a number of patents which had been issued to them and [...] [...] [...] in their advertising matter." [...] All trademark protections were removed from the word [...] "escalator", the term was officially genericized, and it fell into the public domain.|$|E
5000|$|The fair {{was divided}} into {{differently}} themed zones, such as the Transportation Zone, the Communications and Business Systems Zone, the Food Zone, the Government Zone, and so forth. Virtually every structure erected on the fairgrounds was extraordinary, {{and many of them}} were experimental in many ways. Architects were encouraged by their corporate or government sponsors to be creative, energetic and innovative. Novel building designs, materials and furnishings were the norm. Many of the zones were arranged in a semicircular pattern, centered on the Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz-designed Theme Center, which consisted of two all-white, landmark monumental buildings named the Trylon (over 700 ft tall) and the Perisphere which one entered by a <b>moving</b> <b>stairway</b> and exited via a grand curved walkway named the [...] "Helicline". Inside the Perisphere was a [...] "model city of tomorrow that visitors" [...] viewed from a moving walkway high above the floor level. The zones were distinguished by many color cues, including different wall colors and tints and differently colored lighting.|$|E
5000|$|The story {{opens with}} Lewin Randit and his archenemy, first-year Darwell Turkfan clashing in the swordsmanship {{practice}} field. In combat, Darwell taunts Lewin calling him [...] "loser-kun" [...] {{not long after}} releasing a powerful sword wave, enraging Lewin. As his temper flares, he swings his sword over his head, breaking a rule of conduct, and knocks Darwell to the ground. Stabbing the earth beside Darwell's head he threatens Darwell, causing him to submit. Seconds after the fight, Professor Qualfer suddenly appears and grabs Lewin by the neck, scolds him for swinging his weapon above his head, and sends him to the infirmary to have his wounds patched. As the healer, Professor Milieu Rouge, cleans his scars, Lewin asks why she doesn't use magic to heal his wounds. He believes it is {{because he is the}} only student unable to use magic so that the healer would treat him differently. Milieu explains that although she has the power to heal with magic, she restrains herself because by doing so, she would upset the natural balance. As Lewin exits the infirmary he comes across a wall that separates the wizardry division with the swordsmanship classes. There, he is overwhelmed by painful memories of his peers, specifically Darwell, taunting him about his red hair and inability to use magic. Has the thoughts unravel, he ends up injuring himself by clouting the wall out of agony. As he cries, Lewin remarks that despite his perception of only feeling frustration at first, he still harbors that emotional pain. The following day, Lewin pays a visit to the school library in order the research methods to fix his rusty sword with. As he descends on a <b>moving</b> <b>stairway,</b> a book unexpectedly plummets from the sky, followed by a girl whom Lewin catches. Her weight sends him tumbling down the stairway as an elf rushes to the girl's aid. Noticing that she has injured Lewin, the girl attempts to patch his wounds with little success, apologizing for her inability to use healing magic. Upon hearing that, Lewin tells the girl the same thing that Milieu had told him the day before: Don't use magic for everything. The elf gathers Lewin's books before both the girl and elf recognize him as the [...] "Red Haired Boy". They introduce themselves as Chris Cottonburg and Soela Evenport before proposing {{the fact that he is}} [...] "famous". They go on to tell Lewin the rumors that they have heard of him. Lewin finally realizes how people think of him, believing that Soela and Chris were going to brag about their learning and ridicule him. Instead Chris complements Lewin for being a kind person for helping Soela. Soela thanks Lewin for his help and smiles at him, which takes him by surprise. Suddenly, a large object falls from above, which lands on Lewin's head. Soela remarks on how the beast creature usually stays away from people and suggests that maybe he wants to thank Lewin for his deed. Chris and Soela then tell Lewin of their assignment from the magic classes. They are to open a book sealed by a magic force. The only way to open it is to locate where all the hidden passageways are in the school. Easily, Lewin is able to tell the two where the passages are since he has spent much of time at the school observing. The books opens, much to Chris and Soela's delight. After the incident, Lewin becomes their friend, making him much more happy as noted by one of the school's enchanted cleaning maids. Everyday, Lewin would meet Soela and Chris at the library. Eventually, Chris and Soela decide to smuggle Lewin into the Magic division of the school to thank him.|$|E
50|$|Traveling carnivals {{have long}} {{included}} small walk-through fun houses {{in addition to}} their thrill rides. The typical carnival fun house is built entirely in a semi-trailer, usually about 40 ft long by 8 ft wide, allowing limited space for elaborate scenes or effects. Common features are dark corridors, light-up skulls, gravity-powered tipping floors, and airjets at the exit. A few include motorized devices like <b>moving</b> floors and <b>stairways</b> or downscaled revolving barrels. A few attractions traveling on two or more trailers are more elaborate.|$|R
60|$|You {{weary of}} the Toledo's perfect repair, of its {{monotonous}} iron balconies, its monotonous lofty windows; {{and it would be}} insufferable if you could not turn out from it at intervals into one of those wondrous little streets which branch up on one hand and down on the other, rising and falling with flights of steps between the high, many-balconied walls. They ring all day with the motleyest life of fishermen, fruit-venders, chestnut-roasters, and idlers of every age and sex; and there is nothing so full of local color, unless it be the little up-and-down-hill streets in Genoa. Like those, the by-streets of Naples are only meant for foot-passengers, and a carriage never enters them; but sometimes, if you are so blest, you may see a mule climbing the long <b>stairways,</b> <b>moving</b> solemnly under a stack of straw, or tinkling gayly down-stairs, bestridden by a swarthy, handsome peasant--all glittering teeth and eyes and flaming Phrygian cap. The rider exchanges lively salutations and sarcasms with the by-standers in his way, and perhaps brushes against the bagpipers who bray constantly in those hilly defiles. They are in Neapolitan costume, these pifferari, and have their legs incomprehensibly tied up in the stockings and garters affected by the peasantry of the provinces, and wear brave red sashes about their waists. They are simple, harmless-looking people, and would no doubt rob and kill in the most amiable manner, if brigandage came into fashion in their neighborhood.|$|R
40|$|The artistic play {{of light}} {{seen on a}} pyramid in some Mayan ruins located in Cancun, Mexico {{provided}} the inspiration for Vision of Equinox.  On both the spring and autumn equinox days, the sunlight projected on the pyramid forms a shape {{which looks like a}} serpent <b>moving</b> on the <b>stairway</b> of the pyramid.  Vision of Equinox was composed with an image of light as the model for the artistic transfiguration of sound. The light image of sound changes its shape in each stage of the piece, using the orchestra in different ways - sometimes like a chamber ensemble, sometimes like one big instrument. The image of light casting on a pyramid is expressed by descending melodic lines that can be heard several times in the piece. At the final climax of the work, a complete and embodied artistic figure is formed and stated, expressing the appearance of the Mayan god Quetzalcoatl, the serpent, in my own imagination. 	The light and shadow which comprise this pyramid art are treated as two contrasting elements in my composition and become the two main motives in this piece. To express these two contrasting elements, I picked the numbers " 5 " and " 2," and used them as "key numbers" in this piece. As a result, the intervals of a fifth and a second (sometimes inverted as a seventh) are the two main intervals used in the structure. The interval of a fifth was taken into account for the construction of the pyramid, which has five points of contact. The interval of a second was selected as a contrasting sonority to the fifth. Further, the numbers " 5 " and " 2 " are used as the number of notes which form the main motives in this piece; quintuplets are used throughout this piece, and the short motive made by two sixteenth notes is used as one of the main motives in this piece. Moreover, the shape of the pyramid provided a concept of symmetry, which is expressed by the setting of a central point of the music (pitch center) as well as the use of retrograde and inversion in this piece...|$|R
40|$|Koncept Barn lär sig både genom stilla lek och rörelselek. Det är därför viktigt att barnen får utrymme för båda typer av lekar på före- skolan. I den stilla leken finns ett mer fokus på individen, det självständiga skapandet och utvecklingen. Medans det i den rörliga leken finns ett mer fokus på gruppen, samarbetet och interaktionen mellan barnen. Jag anser att dessa lekar är varan- dras motsatser och att miljöerna, anpassad till respektive lek också bör stå i kontrast till varandra. Hur utformar man en miljö för den stilla leken? Hur utformar man en miljö för den rörliga leken? I den stilla leken ägnar sig oftast barn åt aktiviteter som kräver koncentration och så lite yttre störningar som möjligt. Det kan till exempel vara målning, lek med lera eller läsning. Här utveck- lar barnet främst sina egna förmågor och tränar då på att vara självständig. Därför är det viktigt att rummen utformas så enkla och tydliga som möjligt. Inte för mycket {{material}} och inte heller för fönster där barnen kan störas av det som sker utanför. Det är också viktigt att miljön känns varm, lugn och trygg. I den rörliga leken lär sig barnet genom att använda sin kropp på olika sätt, till exempel genom att springa, hoppa, krypa och gå. Här finns också utrymme för barnet att lära sig att samarbeta och ta hänsyn till varandra då den rörliga leken oftast sker i grupp. Ett rum för rörelselekar ska uppmana barnet till rörelse. Det ska vara en dynamisk miljö som inspirerar och skapar nya intryck. Rummet ska också ge barnet möjlighet till att använda sin kropp på olika sätt.   Jag har velat skapa en förskola som på ett tydligt sätt avgränsar rummet för den stilla leken och den rörliga leken. En plats där barnet kan utvecklas på den individuella nivån efter dess förmåga och mognad, men samtidigt ges utrymme till att intragera och lära sig av andra barn. Dessa tankar har resul- terat i en byggnad som består av ett gemensamt trapphus som används som ett rum för den rörliga leken. Trapphuset rör sig cirkulärt kring en inre volym på tre olika plan.

It is therefore important that children get space for both types of plays on preschool. In the quiet game, there is more focus on the individual, the independent creation and development. While in the mobile game, there are more focus on group coo- peration and interaction between the children. I think that these kind of plays are opposites and that the environments, adapted to each game should also stand in contrast to each other. How do you design an environment for the quiet game? How do you design an environment for the mobile game? In the quiet game, childrenare mostly dedicated in activities that require concentration and as little outside interference as possible. It may include painting, play with clay or reading. Here, the child develops mainly their own abilities and training as to be independent. Therefore {{it is important that}} the rooms are designed as simple and distinct as possible. Not too much material nor for windows where children can be disturbed by what is happening outside. It is also important that the environ- ment feels warm, peaceful and safe. In the mobile play, the child learns by using its body in various ways, for example by running, jumping, crawling and walking. There is also space for the child to learn to cooperate and take care of each other as the mobile play is usually done in groups. A room for movement games should encourage the child to move. It should be a dynamic environment that inspires and creates new impressions. The room should also enable the child to use their body in different ways. I have wanted to create a preschool that clearly defines the room for the quiet game, and the moving game. A place where the child can develop at the individual level by its own ability and maturity, but also be given space to interact and learn from other children. These thoughts have resulted in a building that consists of a common stairwell used as a room for the <b>moving</b> game. The <b>stairway</b> moves circularly around an internal volume of three different planes. Inside the volume, the three depart- ments are placed, where the youngest children are at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The idea is that the rooms for the quiet game takes place here. ...|$|R
