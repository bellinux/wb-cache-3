5|$|Filming started {{shortly before}} 7.00pm, and ended at around 8.30pm; Griffin left the {{building}} 10 minutes later. Audience members inside the studios used their mobile phones to relay live information about the recording's progress. James Lyons, political correspondent for the Daily Mirror, wrote that {{the mood in the}} studio turned from anger to <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> Griffin.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the {{sluggish}} response of Brazil, infuriated by the <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the Buenos Aires press and impatient at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian province through sovereign Argentine territory, on 13 April 1865 López fired upon and seized two small Argentine naval vessels moored {{in the port}} of Corrientes, then proceeded to take the Argentine province of that name, making Paraguayan paper currency compulsory on pain of death. The resulting War of the Triple Alliance was to destroy his country.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter of}} Hadrian written from Egypt to his {{brother-in-law}} Servianus is quoted at length (and {{was accepted as}} genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century). Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136. The letter {{is said to have}} been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the History, in another suspect passage. A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.|$|E

60|$|For in {{the open}} space nearest the door stood a gleeman, a dancing, harping, foul-mouthed fellow, who was showing off ape's tricks, jesting against the English, and {{shuffling}} about in <b>mockeries</b> <b>of</b> English dancing. At some particularly coarse jest of his, the new Lord of Bourne burst into a roar of admiration.|$|R
5|$|Phan was {{transferred}} to the Huế court {{as a member of the}} censorate, a watchdog body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing that the vast majority of the court mandarins were making a <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice. Tự Đức later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the viceroy of the northern region. He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct. Phan openly criticised Tôn Thất Thuyết, the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest. Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a historical geography of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin release {{had been}} timed to {{coincide}} with the height of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee celebrations. By Jubilee weekend, {{a week and a half}} after the record's release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies—a massive success. On 7 June, McLaren and the record label arranged to charter a private boat and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, a <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Camping for {{the night}} on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are {{collecting}} firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in a <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|E

5|$|She then {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Michelle McCool, later called LayCool. They began a feud with Mickie James in October, making a <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> her weight and vowing to make her leave SmackDown. At the Survivor Series, McCool's team lost to James' team. At , Layla interfered in the WWE Women's Championship match between McCool and James by helping McCool retain the title. In January 2010, at Royal Rumble, Layla {{came out in a}} fatsuit, mocking James prior to the title match between McCool and James; however, the mockery backfired, as James attacked Layla and used that as a distraction to quickly defeat McCool to win the title. On the 12 February episode of SmackDown, Layla and McCool defeated James in a handicap match made by Official SmackDown Consultant Vickie Guerrero, who had been accidentally humiliated by James backstage. Guerrero then began managing LayCool, accompanying them to the ring and regularly interfering in their matches. At the Elimination Chamber, Layla and McCool defeated Raw's Gail Kim and Maryse in an inter-brand tag team match. At WrestleMania XXVI, Layla was on the winning team in an inter-brand tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{are known}} for the great number of deities they honoured, a {{capacity}} that earned the <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> early Christian polemicists. As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples {{rather than try to}} eradicate them. One way that Rome promoted stability among diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous cults of pseudo-foreign gods (Roman reinventions of foreign gods) were cultivated at Rome and in the provinces, among them cults of Cybele, Isis, Epona, and of solar gods such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue {{in the sense that it}} is for competing monotheistic systems.|$|E
5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved {{to wrap it up}} in lead, to put it aboard a Barge, and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another, and by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests the irony would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story even suggested that Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|E
5000|$|Installing TV {{programs}} and other projects as <b>mockeries</b> <b>of</b> well-known existing formats {{is part of}} Schlingensief's methodology. In another show broadcast in Germany, Freakstars 3000, {{he set up a}} talent cast show where all candidates where mentally handicapped. In the theatre project Quiz 3000 (the '3000' was a recurring trademark of Schlingensief), he mocked the show Who wants to be a millionaire?, using questions like [...] "Please sort the following concentration camps from north to south".|$|R
60|$|He {{tried not}} to flinch before that gaze, {{to keep up the}} air <b>of</b> <b>mockery,</b> the sound <b>of</b> a sneer. Outside the murmur of voices had become {{somewhat}} louder, the shuffling of bare feet on the flag-stones could now be distinctly heard.|$|R
5000|$|Some songs, such as [...] "The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's Grave" [...] and [...] "Suicide," [...] {{appear to}} be either <b>mockeries</b> <b>of,</b> or sloppy {{attempts}} to mimic, the hardcore style of music that was rising in popularity amongst then-contemporary American punk fans. [...] "The Revenge of Anus Presley" [...] is likely a Black Flag and Henry Rollins parody. Others, including [...] "Hey" [...] and [...] "Bar-B-Q Pope," [...] are better indicators of the psychedelic direction the band would take on future albums.|$|R
25|$|This ambivalence is {{expressed}} {{also in the}} Greeks' association of the god with the Thracians, whom they regarded as a barbarous and warlike people. Thrace was Ares's birthplace, his true home, and his refuge after the affair with Aphrodite was exposed to the general <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the other gods.|$|E
25|$|Notables such as Chilean folk singer El Monteaguilino and Senator Pedro Muñoz have {{expressed}} their discontent with Inciclopedia and the site's <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the Chilean flag and national symbols.

25|$|In {{his letter}} of resignation, Ritter said the Security Council's {{reaction}} to Iraq's decision earlier that month to suspend co-operation with the inspection team made a <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the disarmament work.

25|$|This {{philosophy}} {{is evident in}} Tolkien's other works, especially The Silmarillion – one Vala, Morgoth, creates the Orc race as a foul <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the elf. Another Vala, Aulë, creates the Dwarf race {{as an act of}} subcreation that honoured Eru Ilúvatar (The equivalent of God in Tolkien's writings), and which Eru accepted and made real, just as Niggle's Tree was made real.|$|E
25|$|The Alexamenos graffito, {{which was}} {{once thought to be}} the {{earliest}} surviving pictorial representation of a crucifixion and has been interpreted as <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> a Christian, shows a cross as an instrument of execution. Its date is uncertain: some have posited for it a date as early as 85, but it may be as late as the 3rd century, and even thus prior to AD 300.|$|E
25|$|McCulloch and McKinney played {{businessmen}} who shared both a first name and very similar personalities. Both Geralds are friendly to people's faces and condescending behind their backs. Despite {{the fact that}} they appear to work at different companies, they are friends who frequently phone each other and hang out together. Their conversation consists mainly of bouts of humorous negotiations and <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> their associates or other business rivals.|$|E
5000|$|The ettin {{appears in}} the Monster Manual for this edition (2014). It {{describes}} the ettin as two individuals trapped in the same body. An origin story explains that {{legend has it that}} orcs once stumbled upon a temple to Demogorgon, and the magic of this temple transformed the orcs into giant <b>mockeries</b> <b>of</b> the twin-headed Prince of Demons. These creatures scattered into the wilderness to become the first ettins. The book also notes that the word [...] "ettin" [...] means [...] "ugly giant" [...] in an ancient dialect of common.|$|R
50|$|Eric Lott, in {{his book}} Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class, {{estimates}} that at least three million people saw these plays, as many as the novel's worldwide sales. Some of these shows were basically just blackface minstrel shows only loosely based on the novel, and their grossly exaggerated caricatures of black people further perpetuated, for purposes <b>of</b> <b>mockery,</b> some <b>of</b> the stereotypes that Stowe had used more innocently.|$|R
50|$|Viz is {{a popular}} British comic {{magazine}} founded in 1979 by Chris Donald. It parodies British comics of the post-war period, notably The Beano and The Dandy, but with vulgar language, toilet humour, black comedy, surreal humour and generally sexual or violent storylines. It also sends up tabloid newspapers, with <b>mockeries</b> <b>of</b> articles and letters pages. It features parody competitions and advertisements for overpriced 'limited edition' tat, as well as obsessions with half-forgotten kitsch celebrities from the 1960s to the 1980s, such as Shakin' Stevens and Rodney Bewes. Occasionally, it satirises current events and politicians, but has no particular political standpoint.|$|R
25|$|In the post-race interviews, the Ferrari drivers {{changed their}} {{story of what}} had {{happened}} at the finish with each telling. Other teams insisted that Ferrari had made a <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the sport again, while some said Schumacher had simply bungled an improvised formation finish. Earlier in the year Barrichello had been ordered to let Schumacher past on the final lap so he could win the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. So many saw this result as Schumacher returning the favour.|$|E
25|$|The diabolist {{elements}} of the initiation ceremonies of both the Millers' Word and Horseman's Word {{might have been a}} deliberate parody of Presbyterianism, a form of Protestant Christianity that was then dominant in much of Scotland. Similarly, its embrace of drunkenness, jokes, songs, and toasts may have served as a deliberate <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the area's conventional morality. The historian Ronald Hutton suggested that these diabolical elements may have derived in part from folk stories of the witches' sabbath, which could have been absorbed either directly from Scottish folklore or from published accounts discussing witchcraft.|$|E
25|$|Such {{details are}} corroborated by many other sources. Accounts {{of the actions}} of the iconoclasts from eyewitnesses and the records of the later trials of many of them make it clear that there was often a {{considerable}} element of carnival to the outbreaks, with much <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the images and fittings such as fonts recorded as the iconoclasts went about their work. Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.|$|E

60|$|But {{the hard}} lesson learned {{early in life}} stood him in good stead. He crossed {{his arms over his}} broad chest and anon his well-shaped hand went up to his {{moustache}} and it almost seemed as if the slender fingers smoothed away the traces of that wave of wrath which had swept over him so unaccountably just now, and only left upon his face those lines <b>of</b> <b>mockery</b> and <b>of</b> good-humour which a nature redolent of sunshine had rendered indelible.|$|R
50|$|Eru created {{alone the}} Elves and Men. This is why in The Silmarillion both races {{are called the}} Children of Ilúvatar. The race of the Dwarves was created by Aulë, and given sapience by Eru. Animals and plants were {{fashioned}} by Yavanna during the Music of the Ainur after the themes set out by Eru. The Eagles of Manwë were created from the thought of Manwë and Yavanna. Yavanna also created the Ents, who were given sapience by Eru. Melkor instilled some semblance of free will into his <b>mockeries</b> <b>of</b> Eru Ilúvatar's creations (Orcs, mocking Elves and perhaps Men; Trolls, mocking Ents; and perhaps Dragons, mocking Eagles).|$|R
