This work aims to evaluate the concrete with addition <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> microsphere with different combinations of dosage in concrete concerning strength and workability. Slump tests were performed in each dosage of concrete in order to evaluate the effect of glass microspheres in concrete mix. In each age of curing concrete, bodies-specimens underwent ultrasound to estimate the homogeneity <b>of</b> concrete with <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> microspheres, and testing of compressive strength. The analysis of the results shows that for some formulations, the addition <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> microspheres imparts high mechanical strength to compressive strength above 30 MPa at all analyzed cure periods.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> microsphere/epoxy resin syntactic foams reinforced by short glass fibers are studied using representative volume elements. Both the glass fibers and the <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> microspheres exhibit random arrangement in the epoxy resin. The volume fraction and wall thickness <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> microspheres and the volume fraction of glass fibers are considered as parameters. It is {{observed that the}} elastic modulus values of syntactic foams decrease {{with the increase of}} microsphere volume fraction when the microsphere relative wall thickness is lower. However, it increases with the increase of microsphere volume fraction when the relative wall thickness exceeds a critical value. The elastic modulus value goes through a maximum when the relative wall thickness is around 0. 06 at 25 % volume fraction of microspheres. The addition of glass fibers reduces the critical wall thickness values of the microspheres and increases the {{mechanical properties}} of the composites. The highest stress lies on the equatorial plane perpendicular to the loading direction. Adding fibers reduces the large stress distribution areas on the microspheres, and the fibers aligned with the loading direction play an important load-bearing role...|$|R

40|$|The {{elastoplastic}} deformation behaviors <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> microspheres/iron {{syntactic foam}} under tension were modeled using a representative volume element (RVE) approach. The three-dimensional microstructures {{of the iron}} syntactic foam with 5 wt % glass microspheres were reconstructed using the random sequential adsorption algorithm. The constitutive behavior of the elastoplasticity in the iron matrix and the elastic-brittle failure for the glass microsphere were simulated in the models. An appropriate RVE size was statistically determined by evaluating elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and yield strength in terms of model sizes and boundary conditions. The model was validated by the agreement with experimental findings. The tensile deformation mechanism of the syntactic foam considering the fracture of the microspheres was then investigated. In addition, the feasibility of introducing the interfacial deboning behavior to the proposed model was briefly investigated to improve the accuracy in depicting fracture behaviors of the syntactic foam.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of the size <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> {{microspheres}} (20 μm vs. 40 μm) and composition on the energy absorption capacity of the silicate glass foams under both the quasistatic (∼ 10 ^(− 3) s^(− 1)) and high-strain rate (∼ 10 ^ 3 s^(− 1)) loading conditions. These measurements revealed that while the size difference <b>of</b> the <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> microspheres and the foam composition have negligible effects on the uniaxial quasistatic response, their effects were significant under the dynamic loading conditions. The results suggest that the smaller glass microspheres (20 μm) dominated the dynamic behavior of the glass foams in comparison to the larger glass microspheres (40 μm), leading to a significant increase of the energy absorption capacity of the 20 μm-based glass foams at high-strain rates. Glass foams exhibited energy absorption capacity of about 54 kJ/kg under the dynamic loading that is greater in comparison to that of the typical metallic and syntactic foams...|$|R

40|$|Storing {{hydrogen}} inside <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> spheres {{requires that}} the gas permeate through the glass walls. Hydrogen permeation through glass is relatively slow and the time to charge a sphere or bed of spheres is dependent on many factors. Permeation processes are strongly temperature dependent with behavior that follows an Arrhenius function., Rate is also dependent on the pressure drop driving force across a membrane wall and inversely proportional to thickness. Once filled, glass spheres will immediately begin to leak once the pressure driving force is reversed. Practical systems would {{take advantage of the}} fact that keeping the glass at ambient temperatures can minimize outboard leakage even with significant internal pressures. If hydrogen could be loaded and unloaded from glass microspheres with significantly less energy and particularly at near ambient temperature, some of the key barriers to commercializing this storage concept would be broken and further system engineering efforts may make this approach cost-effective. There were two key objectives for this effort. The first was to evaluate the application <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>glass</b> microspheres for merchant hydrogen storage and distribution and then determine the hydrogen permeation performance required for practical commercial use. The second objective was to identify, through a series of fundamental experiments, a low energy, low temperature field effect that could significantly enhance hydrogen permeation through glass without application of heat.
