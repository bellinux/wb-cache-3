40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} analysis of an automated assembly system for hingeless 90 Â° out-of-plane microstructures using a microelectronics wire-bonder or an automated <b>microprober.</b> The out-of-plane microstructures, requiring only a single push along the in-plane direction to toggle out-of-plane movement, consist of a novel spring design that is stiff in the in-plane direction while conformal in the out-of-plane direction. The designs were fabricated using three highly differentiated microelectromechanical systems processes. The first process is a silicon-on-insulator fabrication technology called MicraGEM. The second process is a polysilicon fabrication technology called PolyMUMPs. And, the third process is a polymer fabrication technology, developed at Simon Fraser University. The designs were modeled using finite element analysis, fabricated in all three technologies, and tested showing the proof of concept. After verifying {{the viability of the}} designs, an automated system was used to test and validate the reliability of the final devices...|$|E
