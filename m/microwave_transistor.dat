50|$|During the mid-1980s, {{along with}} colleagues in Lille and Duisburg universities, he {{explored}} {{the potential for}} a new class of physical model which became known as the quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) approach. This was shown to be extremely effective at modelling field-effect transistors such as the popular metal semiconductor FET (MESFET). Snowden's models were shown {{to have the ability to}} accurately predict the DC and RF performance based on the physical geometry and material properties available from fabrication data. Moreover, the Q2D model can be solved over 1000 times faster than full two-dimensional models, making it suitable for computer aided design applications. These models were widely used around the world in industry and academia. The models were used to develop high performance microwave transistors with highly predictable characteristics which went on to be manufactured in high volumes by several companies. One of the most successful was the ‘hi-lo-hi’ pulse-doped <b>microwave</b> <b>transistor</b> which achieved high breakdown voltages and was particularly suited to high volume manufacturing.|$|E
