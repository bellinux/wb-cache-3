50|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>taxi</b> <b>weight</b> (MTW) (also {{known as}} the maximum ramp weight (MRW) is the maximum weight {{authorized}} for maneuvering (taxiing or towing) an aircraft {{on the ground as}} limited by aircraft strength and airworthiness requirements.

50|$|The {{difference}} between the maximum taxi/ramp weight and the <b>maximum</b> take-off <b>weight</b> (<b>maximum</b> <b>taxi</b> fuel allowance) depends {{on the size of}} the aircraft, the number of engines, APU operation, and engines/APU fuel consumption, and is typically assumed for 10 to 15 minutes allowance of taxi and run-up operations.|$|R

40|$|Risk Recognition is an {{important}} part in shipyard project risk management. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explain how to identify risks by means of AHP. Firstly, we analyzed briefly the superiority of AHP in shipyard project risk Recognition; secondly, expounded the basic steps of risk Recognition based on AHP in shipyard project investment; then we proposed the principle and tips of applying AHP in identifying project risks by demonstrating a case of shipbuilding base. To prove the validity of AHP, we have identified the risk factors of the Shipyard project that mentioned in the case above, and have also calculated the influence <b>weights</b> <b>taxis</b> of dominating risk factors to the general risk. &# 13; Key words: Shipyard Project Investment; AHP; Risk Recognition; Risk Factor...|$|R
500|$|The {{aircraft}} used reheat (afterburners) at take-off and to {{pass through}} the upper transonic regime and to supersonic speeds, between Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.7. The afterburners were switched off at all other times. Due to jet engines being highly inefficient at low speeds, Concorde burned two tonnes of fuel (almost 2% of the <b>maximum</b> fuel load) <b>taxiing</b> to the runway. Fuel used is Jet A-1. Due to the high thrust produced even with the engines at idle, only the two outer engines were run after landing for easier taxiing and less brake pad wear - at low weights after landing, the aircraft would not remain stationary with all four engines idling [...] requiring the brakes to be continuously applied to prevent the aircraft from rolling.|$|R
40|$|Chemotaxis by Pseudomonas aeruginosa RM 46 {{has been}} studied, and {{conditions}} required for chemotaxis have been defined, {{by using the}} Adler capillary assay technique. Several amino acids, organic acids, and glucose were shown to be attractants of varying effectiveness for this organism. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was absolutely required for chemotaxis, and magnesium was also necessary for a <b>maximum</b> response. Serine <b>taxis</b> was greatest when the chemotaxis medium contained 1. 5 X 10 (- 5) M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 0. 005 M magnesium chloride. It was not necessary to include methionine in the chemotaxis medium. The strength of the chemotactic responses to glucose and to citrate was dependent on prior growth of the bacteria on glucose and citrate, respectively. Accumulation in response to serine was inhibited {{by the addition of}} succinate, citrate, malate, glucose, pyruvate, or methionine to the chemotaxis medium. Inhibition by succinate was not dependent on the concentration of attractant in the capillary. However, the degree to which glucose and citrate inhibited serine taxis was dependent on the carbon source utilized for growth. Further investigation of this inhibition may provide information about the mechanisms of chemotaxis in P. aeruginosa...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{combinatorial}} optimization problem that models situations of both dynamic ride-sharing and taxi-sharing. Passengers who want to share a taxi or a ride, use an app to specify their current location, destination and further information such as the earliest departure time, the latest arrival time and the maximum cost {{they are willing to}} pay for the ride. Car owners also specify their origin, destination, the leaving time and the <b>maximum</b> accepted delay. <b>Taxi</b> drivers report their location and the time they will start and end the service. All drivers need to define a price per kilometer. The problem is to compute routes, matching requests to vehicles in such a way that ride-sharing is allowed as long as some restrictions are satisfied, such as: the capacity of the vehicle, maximum trip cost of each passenger and maximum delay. The problem is dynamic since new requests arrive on-line and routes can be modified in order to attend them. To solve this dynamic problem, the day is divided in time periods. For each period, an instance of a static problem is created and solved by a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Experiments with instances based on real data were made to evaluate the heuristics and the proposed method. In our simulations with taxis, passengers paid, on average, almost 30 % less than they would pay on private rides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
