500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1997, the Fugees {{performed}} in September 2004 at Dave Chappelle's Block Party in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The concert featured Hill's nearly a cappella rendition of [...] "Killing Me Softly". The event was recorded by director Michel Gondry and was released on March 3, 2006, to universal acclaim. The Fugees also appeared at BET Awards 2005 during June 2005, where they opened the show with a 12-minute set. One track, [...] "Take It Easy", was leaked online and thereafter was released as an Internet single in late September. It peaked at number forty on the Billboard R Chart. In 2005, she told USA Today, [...] "If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children.</b> If other people benefit from it, then so be it." [...] When asked how she now felt about the songs on 2.0, she stated [...] "a lot of the songs were transitional. The music was about how I was feeling at the time, even though I was documenting my distress as well as my bursts of joy." ...|$|E

(15 July)This evening I was standing outside the door with baby in my arms, talking to the ayah, when I felt something whiz past my ears. (23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.

I {{have made a}} terrible atonement; I have borne witness against the innocence of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child.</b> <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>child!</b> I dare not bid God bless her, if they bring her to my bedside!--forgive me!--forgive me before I die!" ...|$|R

6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS: 'I don't wish to. But oh, Mr. Bemis, I've {{just come}} from <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> {{and you must be}} merciful to his family!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} are. Why shouldn't they be <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children?</b> They are doing very well, {{and will get}} quite as good {{treatment}} as younger brothers ought to have." ...|$|E
60|$|REGINALD. No: I'm dashed if you have. I'll {{fight for}} the {{ownership}} of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> tooth and nail; and so will a good many other fellows, I can tell you.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear Marion, {{it is thus}} I feel towards you. What I {{would say}} to you I would say to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child.</b> There are great {{differences}} {{in the ranks of}} men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “And {{the worst}} is that I am not even sure how far this sentimental pilgrimage is genuine. Yes. I doubt <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child.</b> It’s true that she’s a woman. [...] . ” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear little things, it's heartrending!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Especially when I {{think of}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> {{who have to}} be made to eat. Tell me the {{nationality}} of that adorable tot at the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "P'r'aps she will, but you needn't {{begin to}} sneeze yet awhile. I can sneeze for <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> thank you, ma'am," [...] {{returned}} Betty, sharply, for her usually amiable spirit had been ruffled {{by the late}} occurrences.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Work till I can {{pay back}} that poor fellow's fortune,' said the banker, earnestly {{pointing}} to Lancelot. 'And if I could clear my conscience of that, I would not care if I starved myself, hardly if <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> did.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{brought you}} up--took care of you--helped educate you," [...] protested Durade, with agitation. [...] "You were <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> I thought. I was always kind to you. I--I loved the {{mother in the}} daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{drew her}} nearer to me. If {{she had been}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> I don't think I could have felt for her more truly than I felt at that moment. I only looked at her; I only said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{shall be}} asked to come. I say he shall. Am I to be harder on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> than are all the others? Shall I call her a castaway, when others say that she is an honest married woman?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, then, {{my mother}} is very bitter about all this. And how can I, at such a time, tell her that her opinion is to go for nothing? I am bound to think of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> and cannot abandon my claim to the property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I am not beaten on {{the main}} issue; but I am, don't you see, on {{all the rest of}} it--on the {{question}} of my reputation, of my relations with your father, of my relations with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> if we should have any." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not fear}} them, my son. Father Francois has {{the list of}} them; he will have every man {{collected}} by daylight on the 7th, and he will come on with them himself {{as far as the}} cross-roads; they will there meet <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> from St. Laud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very sad}} for me," [...] said Trevelyan, gloomily;--"very sad, indeed. My home is destroyed; {{my life is}} made solitary; I do not even see <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child.</b> She has her boy with her, and her sister. I have nobody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have found}} the lost remembrance. My misfortune--I ought {{to call it the}} {{punishment}} for my sins, is recalled to me now. The worst curse that can fall on a father is the curse that has come to me. I have a wicked daughter. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> sir! <b>my</b> <b>own</b> child!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O yes, dear gentlemen, he's my child, {{out without}} leave. My poor bad, bad boy! and he don't know me, he don't know me! O what shall I do,' cried the little creature, wildly beating her hands together, 'when <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> don't know me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense,' smiled Lady Kelsey. 'They're my only {{relations}} in the world, except Bobbie, who's very much too rich as it is, and I love Lucy and George {{as if they were}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children.</b> What is the good of my money except to make them happy and comfortable?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then she {{discovered}} her mistake. 'Dear me,' said she, 'this will never do at all. If I can't tell <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> apart, how can I expect others to? Your coat is altogether {{too much like}} that of Mr. Chipmunk. I must change it. I certainly must change it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Soon <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> {{began to}} shun me as a pest. Often, when I was {{creeping}} upon {{them like a}} melancholy ghoul, I would hear them say to each other: [...] "Here comes papa," [...] and they would gather their toys and scurry away to some safer hiding place. Miserable wretch that I was! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's {{the very}} reason why I have come to you,' replied the lizard. 'Bring me your {{youngest}} daughter to-morrow morning. I promise to bring her up {{as if she were}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> and to look upon her as the apple of my eye.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{what you}} have just heard {{a part of my}} catechism? Has my {{daughter}} been excused from repeating it because she is a young lady? Where is the difference between the religious education which is given to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> and that given to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, Miss Eve, {{and it will}} relieve your mind," [...] {{said the}} {{faithful}} woman; [...] "your dear mother had such feelings sometimes, and I never dared to question her about them; but you are <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> and nothing can grieve you without grieving me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, indeed,' said she, earnestly. 'Remember how {{we agreed}} that you should come to me like one of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children.</b> And, indeed, I do not see why you need grieve in this despairing way, for you almost overcame the fit of anger; and perhaps you were off your guard because the trial came in an {{unexpected}} way?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thy {{mother is}} {{watching}} for thee. Run to her, {{and she will}} give thee a cake--aye, and a bath before thy dinner. So Verronax is come. I am glad thou wilt see him, my father. The youth has grown up with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> and is as dear to me as my own son. Ah, here comes my Columba!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, child! to be sure, I shouldn't. What do {{you talk}} so for? I would as soon have one of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> sold. But really, Eliza, you are getting {{altogether}} too proud of that little fellow. A man can't put his nose into the door, but you think he must be coming to buy him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Gar'ner {{will make}} a right good husband for any young woman, and I do advise you to have him. You are my brother's da'ghter, Mary, and I give you this advice, which I should give you all the same, had you been <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> instead of his'n." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Linda; {{the house}} is your own. And the {{furniture}} in it is yours too; so that Herr Steinmarc is your lodger. It is right that you should understand all this; but I think too well of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> {{to believe that she}} will ever on that account be disobedient or unruly." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is {{not that}} I have seen my good Amy attentive, and--ha--condescending to my old pensioner--it {{is not that}} that hurts me. It is, if I am to close the painful subject by being explicit, that I have seen <b>my</b> <b>child,</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> daughter, coming into this College {{out of the public}} streets--smiling! smiling!--arm in arm with--O my God, a livery!' ...|$|R
