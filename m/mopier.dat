5000|$|In November 1996 HP {{introduced}} the network-ready LaserJet 5Si, a major revision and upgrade to the 3Si (IIISi) and 4Si, which {{had used the}} Canon NX engine. The 5Si, based on the Canon WX engine, could thus provide 11"x17" [...] printing at an unprecedented 24 pages per minute and at 600 dpi with resolution enhancement. An internal duplexer enabled full-speed double-sided printing. Automatic personality switching (between PCL and PostScript), a feature that first appeared on the 4SiMX, was standard on the 5SiMX. The 5Si series were true workhorses, but initial models were somewhat hobbled by a vulnerability to slightly low voltage (i.e. crashing if mains voltage was less than 120 Volts) {{as well as a}} weak clutch in Tray 3 (thus resulting in paper jamming for Tray 3 as well as the optional 2,000-sheet Tray 4), and also a weak solenoid in the manual feed tray (Tray 1). These paper-handling issues were easily dealt with. Many 5Si LaserJets remain in service today. The Color LaserJet 5 and 5M were introduced in March 1996, with 1200 dpi resolution. In October 1996 HP introduced its first printers in the LaserJet 6 range, the 6P and 6 MP, both aimed at small offices. They included infrared technology, for wireless printing. In November 1996 the HP 5Si <b>Mopier</b> was introduced, claimed to be the first network printers optimized to produce multiple original prints (mopies). It had a 100 000 copies per month duty cycle, and 24 ppm print speed.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for Indiewire, Eric Kohn {{gave the}} film a B and praised the {{performances}} of del Toro and Hutcherson writing that del Toro [...] "turns Escobar into a subdued terror whose ability to order murders with ease provides the movie with its chief source of dread".

The film is thankfully less self-serious than the <b>mopey</b> Twilight films. The Mortal Instruments revels in its own camp." [...] She added, [...] "But {{there is plenty of}} room for improvement.

[...] Spin described the album as The Warlocks being [...] "more funereal than ever".

[...] Spin magazine commented [...] "Manson may appeal to <b>mopey</b> eighth graders, but he's essentially mining the same agitprop territory and 'premillenial' confusion that hipster, highbrow heroes such as Alec Empire and Tricky take for granted. Manson shares with Empire a preference for destroying the master's house with the master's tools.
