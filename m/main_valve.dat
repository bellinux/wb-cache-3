5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
25|$|Some demand valves use a small, {{sensitive}} {{pilot valve}} {{to control the}} opening of the <b>main</b> <b>valve.</b> The Poseidon Jetstream and Xstream and Oceanic Omega second stages are examples of this technology. They can produce very high flow rates for a small pressure differential, and particularly for a relatively small cracking pressure. They are generally more complicated and expensive to service.|$|E
25|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{tank and}} CTN are bolted {{together at the}} <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> bulkhead, which is integrated into the tank. There are O-rings at the interface to prevent leakage; this is the main potential leak path in the engine. The ignition system, main control valve, and injector are mounted on the valve bulkhead, inside the tank. Slosh baffles are also mounted on this bulkhead. Because the oxidizer is stored under pressure, no pump is required.|$|E
5|$|The main {{oxidizer}} and <b>main</b> fuel <b>valves</b> {{control the}} flow of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the engine and are controlled by each engine controller. When an engine is operating, the <b>main</b> <b>valves</b> are fully open.|$|R
50|$|The {{propellant}} {{feed system}} consists of separate fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (the bearings {{of which were}} lubricated by the fluid being pumped because the extremely low operating temperature of the engine precluded use of lubricants or other fluids), several <b>valves</b> (including the <b>main</b> fuel <b>valve,</b> <b>main</b> oxidizer <b>valve,</b> propellant utilization valve and fuel and oxidizer bleed valves), fuel and oxidizer flowmeters, and interconnecting lines.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} for simplicity and reliability, rather than sophisticated control. The pilot's only control was a simple on/off switch, with the valves and pump then controlled by an electromechanical timer. Power for actuating the <b>main</b> <b>valves</b> was then obtained by a compressed air bottle or fuel pressure.|$|R
25|$|The side-float design uses a {{float on}} the end of a lever to control the fill valve. The float is usually shaped like a ball, so the {{mechanism}} is called a ball-valve or a ballcock. Cock is a term for valve; see, for example, stopcock. The float was originally made from copper sheet, but it is now usually plastic. The float is located to one side of the <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> tower at the end of a rod or arm. As the side-float rises, so does the side-float-arm. The arm connects to the fill valve that blocks the water flow into the toilet tank, and thus maintains a constant level in the tank.|$|E
500|$|On 6 September 1918, South Carolina escorted a fast convoy partway {{across the}} Atlantic, {{becoming}} one of the first American battleships (alongside [...] and [...] ) to do so. When returning to the United States, South Carolina lost its starboard propeller. When continuing with the port propeller, a valve in its engine malfunctioned; continuing with an auxiliary valve caused a large amount of vibration, so the ship was stopped just hours later for temporary repairs on the <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> before continuing to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for repairs. Michigan had the same problem when escorting a convoy in the next month; the ship lost its port propeller on 8 October, but managed to return home on 11 October without further incident. After the war's end on 11 November 1918, both South Carolina-class battleships were used to repatriate American soldiers that had been fighting in the war.|$|E
500|$|The HPFTP is a three-stage {{centrifugal}} pump {{driven by a}} two-stage hot-gas turbine. It boosts {{the pressure of the}} liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia), and operates at approximately 35,360rpm with a power of 71,140hp. The discharge flow from the turbopump is routed to, and through, the <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> and is then split into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls. It is then routed from the main combustion chamber to the LPFTP, where it is used to drive the LPFTP turbine. A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the liquid hydrogen tank to maintain pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls of the hot-gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into the main combustion chamber. A second hydrogen flow path from the main fuel valve is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. This combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer preburners. The HPFTP is approximately [...] in size and is attached to the hot-gas manifold by flanges.|$|E

40|$|Anomalous high {{frequency}} pressure {{fluctuations in the}} Space Shuttle main engine have been experienced during hot firings. Through diagnostic analysis of hot firing engine data, {{it was determined that}} this excitation originated at the <b>main</b> oxidizer <b>valve.</b> The intensity of these fluctuations was such that the <b>main</b> oxidizer <b>valve</b> was partially consumed in fire, experienced fretting, and had seal damage.

50|$|The <b>main</b> {{oxidizer}} <b>valve</b> (MOV) was a butterfly-type valve, spring-loaded to {{the closed}} position, pneumatically operated {{to the open}} position, and pneumatically assisted to the closed position. It was mounted between the oxidizer high-pressure duct from the oxidizer turbopump and the oxidizer inlet on the thrust chamber assembly. Pneumatic pressure from the normally closed port of the mainstage control solenoid valve was routed to both {{the first and second}} stage opening actuators of the <b>main</b> oxidizer <b>valve.</b> Application of opening pressure in this manner, together with controlled venting of the <b>main</b> oxidizer <b>valve</b> closing pressure through a thermal-compensating orifice, provided a controlled ramp opening of the <b>main</b> oxidizer <b>valve</b> through all temperature ranges. A sequence valve, located within the MOV assembly, supplied pneumatic pressure to the opening control part of the gas generator control valve and through an orifice to the closing part of the oxidizer turbine bypass valve.|$|R

50|$|The {{pressure}} from the pilot tube to the dome is routed through the actual control pilot valve. There are many designs but the control pilot is essentially a conventional PRV with the special job of controlling pressure to the <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> dome. The pressure at which the control pilot relieves at is the functional set pressure of the PORV. When the pilot valve reaches set pressure it opens and releases the {{pressure from}} the dome. The piston is then free to open and the <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> exhausts the system fluid. The control pilot opens either to the <b>main</b> <b>valve</b> exhaust pipe or to atmosphere.|$|E
