In 1837, he patented a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> cloth-covered buttons and built a factory to the rear of his works which extended to Vittoria Street. This was one of many purpose-built factories with others including the Victoria Works on Graham Street, which was built between 1839 and 1840 by Joseph Gillott for the mass production of steel pen nibs.|$|E
25|$|This {{behavior}} of SeV was utilized by Köhler and Milstein, who {{published an article}} in 1975 outlining a revolutionary <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> monoclonal antibodies. In need of a reliable method to produce large quantities of a specific antibody, the two merged a monoclonal B cell, exposed to a chosen antigen, and a myeloma tumor cell to produce hybridomas, capable of being grown indefinitely and of producing significant amounts of an antibody specifically targeting the chosen antigen. Though more efficient methods of creating such hybrids have since been found, Köhler and Milstein first used Sendai virus to create their revolutionary cells.|$|E
25|$|Coins were {{originally}} hand-hammered — an ancient technique {{in which two}} dies are struck together with a blank coin between them. This was the traditional <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> coins in the Western world from the classical Greek era onwards, in contrast with Asia, where coins were traditionally cast. Milled (that is, machine-made) coins were produced first {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and periodically during the subsequent reigns of James I and Charles I, but there was initially opposition to mechanisation from the moneyers, who ensured that most coins continued to be produced by hammering. All British coins produced since 1662 have been milled.|$|E

25|$|In May 1952, Sidney Darlington filed {{a patent}} {{application}} in the United States for a structure {{with two or}} three transistors integrated onto a single chip in various configurations; in October 1952, Bernard Oliver filed a patent application for a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> three electrically connected planar transistors on one semiconductor crystal. On May 21, 1953, Harwick Johnson filed a patent application for a method of forming various electronic components – transistors, resistors, lumped and distributed capacitances – on a single chip. Johnson described three ways of producing an integrated one-transistor oscillator. All of them used a narrow strip of a semiconductor with a bipolar transistor on one end and differed in the methods of producing the transistor. The strip acted as a series of resistors; the lumped capacitors were formed by fusion whereas inverse-biased p-n junctions acted as distributed capacitors. Johnson did not offer a technological procedure, and it is not known whether he produced an actual device. In 1959, a variant of his proposal was implemented and patented by Jack Kilby.|$|E

2500|$|Rosecrans {{suffered}} {{a period of}} failing health and resigned from the Army in 1854, moving into civilian fields. He took over a mining business in Western Virginia (today West Virginia) and ran it extremely successfully. He designed and installed {{one of the first}} complete lock and dam systems in Western Virginia on the Coal River; today recognized as the Coal River Locks, Dams, and Log Booms Archeological District. [...] In Cincinnati, he and two partners built one of the first oil refineries west of the Allegheny Mountains. He obtained patents for many inventions, including the first kerosene lamp to successfully burn a round wick and a more effective <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturing</b> soap. While Rosecrans was president of the Preston Coal Oil Company, in 1859, he was burned severely when an experimental [...] "safety" [...] oil lamp exploded, setting the refinery on fire. It took him 18 months to recover, and the resulting facial scars gave him the appearance of having a perpetual smirk. As he concluded recovering from those injuries, the Civil War began.|$|E
