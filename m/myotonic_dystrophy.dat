25|$|There {{are nine}} main {{categories}} of muscular dystrophy that contain {{more than thirty}} specific types. The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which typically affects males beginning around the age of four. Other types include Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and <b>myotonic</b> <b>dystrophy.</b> They are due to mutations in genes {{that are involved in}} making muscle proteins. This can occur due to either inheriting the defect from one's parents or the mutation occurring during early development. Disorders may be X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant. Diagnosis often involves blood tests and genetic testing.|$|E
50|$|Toxic RNA {{can lead}} to a vast range of medical effects {{including}} those of insulin resistance, tumors, muscular wasting seen in <b>myotonic</b> <b>dystrophies,</b> impairment of motor skills seen in FXTAS, a variety neurodegenerative syndromes, and more. Treatment has been suggested for some of these RNA-dominant diseases while others are still considered incurable.|$|R

25|$|PGD is {{available}} for {{a large number of}} monogenic disorders—that is, disorders due to a single gene only (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked)—or of chromosomal structural aberrations (such as a balanced translocation). PGD helps these couples identify embryos carrying a genetic disease or a chromosome abnormality, thus avoiding diseased offspring. The most frequently diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, Beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1. The most common dominant diseases are <b>myotonic</b> <b>dystrophy,</b> Huntington's disease and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease; {{and in the case of}} the X-linked diseases, most of the cycles are performed for fragile X syndrome, haemophilia A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Though it is quite infrequent, some centers report PGD for mitochondrial disorders or two indications simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, <b>myotonic</b> <b>dystrophy,</b> fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E
2500|$|The genetic {{component}} is {{strong in the}} development of cataracts, most commonly through mechanisms that protect and maintain the lens. The presence of cataracts in childhood or early life can occasionally be due to a particular syndrome. Examples of [...] chromosome abnormalities associated with cataracts include 1q21.1 deletion syndrome, cri-du-chat syndrome, Down syndrome, Patau's syndrome, trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome), and Turner's syndrome, {{and in the case of}} neurofibromatosis type 2, juvenile cataract on one or both sides may be noted. Examples of single-gene disorder include Alport's syndrome, Conradi's syndrome, cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis, <b>myotonic</b> <b>dystrophy,</b> and oculocerebrorenal syndrome or Lowe syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Electron {{magnetic}} resonance experiments {{have demonstrated that}} spin-labeled myotonic erythrocyte membranes have spectra that are recognizably {{different from those of}} normal erythrocytes. The spin label incorporated in the erythrocyte membranes of patients having <b>myotonic</b> muscular <b>dystrophy</b> is apparently located in a less polar and somewhat more fluid region than the label in a normal membrane. Although the mechanisms of molecular interaction and their relationship to enzymatic differences is unclear, the results lend confirmation to the suggestion that <b>myotonic</b> muscular <b>dystrophy</b> may be a disease resulting from a basic membrane abnormality...|$|R
50|$|The {{clinical}} presentation for both people with DM1 and DM2 commonly {{differs from the}} conception of the diseases held by many neurologists. Clinicians who are less familiar with the <b>myotonic</b> <b>dystrophies</b> may expect people with both forms to present with the more severe, classic symptoms of DM1. As a result, people may remain undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed. A useful clinical clue for diagnosis is the failure of spontaneous release of the hands following strong handshakes due to myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction) which accompanies muscle weakness.|$|R
50|$|Mutations in KCa2.3 are {{suspected}} to be a possible underlying cause for several neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa and ataxia {{as well as}} <b>myotonic</b> muscular <b>dystrophy.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Myotonic</b> <b>dystrophy</b> (DM) is an {{inherited}} disease. A severe form of DM, congenital <b>myotonic</b> <b>dystrophy,</b> may appear in newborns of mothers who have DM.

25|$|Currently, {{there is}} no cure for muscular dystrophy. In terms of management, {{physical}} therapy, occupational therapy, orthotic intervention (e.g., ankle-foot orthosis), speech therapy, and respiratory therapy may be helpful. Low intensity corticosteroids such as prednisone, and deflazacort may help to maintain muscle tone. Orthoses (orthopedic appliances used for support) and corrective orthopedic surgery may be needed {{to improve the quality of}} life in some cases. The cardiac problems that occur with EDMD and <b>myotonic</b> muscular <b>dystrophy</b> may require a pacemaker. The myotonia (delayed relaxation of a muscle after a strong contraction) occurring in <b>myotonic</b> muscular <b>dystrophy</b> may be treated with medications such as quinine.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to our teacher, Prof. Erich Kuhn, Heidelberg, {{on the occasion of}} his 88 th birthday on 23 th November 2008. In contrast to muscular dystrophies, the muscle channelopathies, a group of diseases characterised by impaired muscle excitation or excitation-contraction coupling, can fairly well be treated with a whole series of pharmacological drugs. However, for a proper treatment proper diagnostics are essential. This article lists state-of-the-art diagnostics and therapies for the two types of <b>myotonic</b> <b>dystrophies,</b> for recessive and dominant myotonia congenita, for the sodium channel myotonias, for the primary dyskalemic periodic paralyses, for central core disease and for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in detail.

40|$|Despite {{the more}} recent genetic {{classification}} of the novel <b>myotonic</b> <b>dystrophies</b> into at least two distinct myotome dystrophy (DM) loci (DM 1, DM 2 /PROMM/PDM), the clinical characteristics of these dominant myotonic syndromes often blur.
