This deteriorated an already precarious financial situation. Consequently, the Liberian Government faced financial bankruptcy on more than one occasion.The overall Liberian economy was also contracting during these years, as palm kernel oil exports to the United States declined. This was due to competition from the whale oil industry and the new <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry,</b> still in its infancy. Whereas palm kernel oil was once a prized source for lantern light oil, market tastes had changed.

50|$|The {{work being}} done at the IMI on the {{acceptance}} of recycling IT terminal equipment pursues the basic idea of addressing the attitude towards recycling IT terminal equipment, for example, discarded mobile phones, {{on the one hand}} by analysing isomorphic scenarios and on the other by conducting expert interviews. The isomorphic scenarios analysed were the recycling of drinks bottles and cans (including those with a single-use deposit or drink can deposit), second-hand clothing, and the return and recycling of waste oil in the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry.</b> In addition, the technical problems encountered in disposing of and reconditioning mobile telephones were discussed. The results obtained were compiled into an action framework for shaping the process of introducing recycling systems for IT terminal equipment.

50|$|His major {{innovation}} was {{improving the}} procedure for drilling crude oil. The Attock Oil Company at Rawalpindi (representative of Messers Steel Brothers & Co London) had confronted a peculiar problem, wherein the mud used for drilling operation got hardened upon contact with the saline water, thereby clogging the drill holes. Bhatnagar realised that this problem could be solved by colloidal chemistry. He added an Indian gum, which had the remarkable property of lowering the viscosity of the mud suspension and of increasing {{at the same time}} its stability against the flocculating action of electrolytes. M/s Steel Brothers was so pleased that they offered Bhatnagar a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- for research work on any subject related to petroleum. The company placed the fund through the university and it was used to establish the Department of Petroleum Research under the guidance of Bhatnagar. Investigations carried out under this collaborative scheme included deodourisation of waxes, increasing flame height of kerosene and utilisation of waste products in vegetable <b>oil</b> and <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industries.</b> Acknowledging the commercial success of the research, the company increased the fund, and extended the period from five years to ten years.|$|R

40|$|Acid resins are {{residues}} characterised by elevated {{concentrations of}} hydrocarbons and heavy metals, which were produced by <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industries</b> in Central Europe {{during the first}} half of the last century. Due to the lack of environmental legislation at that time, these wastes were dumped into excavated ponds in public areas without further protection. In this work, the long-term effects of such resin deposits on soil quality of two forest areas (Bayern, Germany) were assessed. We evaluated the distribution and accumulation of contaminants in the surroundings of the deposits, where the waste was disposed of about 60 years ago. General soil chemical properties such as pH, C, N and P content were also investigated. Chemical analysis of resin waste from the deposits revealed large amounts of potential contaminants such as hydrocarbons (93 g kg- 1), As (63 mg kg- 1), Cd (24 mg kg- 1), Cu (1835 mg kg- 1), Pb (8100 mg kg- 1) and Zn (873 mg kg- 1). Due to the location of the deposits on a hillside and the lack of adequate isolation, contaminants have been released downhill despite the solid nature of the waste. Five zones were investigated in each site: the deposit, three affected zones along the plume of contamination and a control zone. In affected zones, contaminants were 2 to 350 times higher than background levels depending on the site. In many cases, contaminants exceeded the German environmental guidelines for the soil-groundwater path and action levels based on extractable concentrations. Resin contamination yielded larger total C/total N ratios in affected zones, but no clear effect was observed on absolute C, N and P concentrations.

30|$|Azo dyes are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} one or more azo (–N=N–) bonds. Almost 109  kg of dyes are produced annually of which about 70  % represent azo dyes. Most of them, and their degraded products, such as aromatic amines, are also potential health hazards because of their mutagenic and carcinogenic properties (Crini 2006; Zaharia et al. 2012; Zhang and Ma 2013). Azo dyes are bright in colours with high intensity and have fair to good fastness properties. In addition, they are available in wide range and have low manufacturing costs. Hence, these dyes are used in textile, pharmaceuticals, plastics, leather, paper, <b>mineral</b> <b>oils,</b> wax <b>industries</b> and even in selected food items and cosmetics. In the dyeing process, ~ 10  % of dye is lost and released in wastewater, making the waterbodies coloured and contaminated with significant amounts of residual dyes (Anjaneya et al. 2013; Olukanni et al. 2009; Stolz 2001). Colour is the first visible pollution in water bodies which hampers its aesthetic nature, cuts-off sunlight penetration, disturbs photosynthesis and causes chronic and acute toxicity (Aksu et al. 2007; Gupta and Suhas 2009). The incorrect disposal of these effluents is a major environmental concern and of great threat to human and animal health. It is, therefore, mandatory to treat the dye bath effluents prior to discharge in the surrounding waterbodies. In addition, the treatment should be economic and eco-friendly.|$|R
