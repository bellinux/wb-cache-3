5000|$|The end of World War II brought Allied {{occupation}} {{forces into}} Germany. United States, British and French forces included numerous soldiers of African American, Afro-Caribbean or African descent, {{and some of}} them fathered children with ethnic German women. At the time, the armed forces generally had non-fraternization rules and discouraged interracial marriages. Most single ethnic German <b>mothers</b> <b>kept</b> their [...] "brown babies", but thousands were adopted by American families and grew up in the United States. Often they did not learn their full ancestry until reaching adulthood.|$|R

25|$|Reginald John Howard {{was born}} on 8 December 1912 to Jack and Ethel Howard, who lived in London's West End. The eldest of nine children, Howard's family {{background}} was working class. His father worked as a barrelmaker for a brewery after serving in the trenches in France during the First World War, while his <b>mother</b> <b>kept</b> the house and looked after the children. During his formative years, Howard was {{active member of the}} Boy Scouts, he also enjoyed attending school and did very well, earning a scholarship to attend secondary school. However, the economic situation at the time was hard and at the age of fourteen he began full-time work, working as a clerk at a broker's firm. In order to further his education he took evening classes and continued with the Scouts. In 1931, however, he found himself out of work, after the brokerage firm that he was working for went out of business.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Bukhara, Genghis headed to the Khwarezmian capital of Samarkand and arrived in March 1220. During this period, the Mongols also waged {{effective}} psychological warfare and caused divisions within their foe. The Khan's spies told him of the bitter fighting between the Shah and his mother, who commanded the allegiance {{of some of his}} most senior commanders and his elite Turkish cavalry divisions. Since Mongols and Turks are both steppe peoples, Genghis argued that Tertun Khatun and her army should join the Mongols against her treacherous son. Meanwhile, he arranged for deserters to bring letters that said Tertun Khatun and some of her generals had allied with the Mongols. This further inflamed the existing divisions in the Khwarezm Empire, and probably prevented the senior commanders from unifying their forces. Genghis then compounded the damage by repeatedly issuing bogus decrees in the name of either Tertun Khatun or Shah Mohammed, further tangling up the already divided Khwarezm command structure. As a result of the Mongol strategic initiative, speedy maneuvers, and psychological strategies, all the Khwarezm generals, including the Queen <b>Mother,</b> <b>kept</b> their forces as a garrison and were defeated in turn.|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} study of mothers' reactions to their babies' symptoms {{was carried out}} in Newcastle upon Tyne. Forty-four <b>mothers</b> <b>kept</b> a health diary about their first infant, recording symptoms that occurred and action taken. Symptoms, most of which were minor, were present on three out of four days. Mothers were therefore making almost daily decisions about their babies' health, usually without medical advice. No evidence was found of mothers failing to appreciate the severity of symptoms or failing to seek medical help. Our findings reinforce those of other studies that parents are able to recognize their babies' illnesses, even in their first children...|$|R
50|$|Furthering the Farm's {{growing pains}} {{was a baby}} boom {{resulting}} from {{the large number of}} young adults of childbearing age combined with an enthusiastic family philosophy being put into practice. Ina May Gaskin and other resident midwives advertised their services in the national underground press, which led to numerous couples and their infants moving in without contributing. A small number of infants were adopted by Farm members after the midwives offered to accept deliver and keep a woman's baby as an alternative to abortion. Most <b>mothers</b> <b>kept</b> their baby after the child was born or came back for them not long after.|$|R

Sue Anne also reports that Dixie tried to keep her from visiting Mac and that she plans to elope with her boyfriend despite her mother's objections. Mac admits he used to hit Dixie and that she divorced him after he tried to kill her in a drunken rage. Sue Anne asks whether Mac remembers a song about a dove he sang to her when she was a baby. He claims he does not, but after she leaves he sings to himself the hymn [...] "On the Wings of a Dove," [...] which references a dove from the Lord saving Noah and descending at Jesus' baptism.|$|E

500|$|Solti {{described}} {{his father as}} [...] "a kind, sweet man who trusted everyone. He shouldn't have, but he did. Jews in Hungary were tremendously patriotic. In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless." [...] Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, [...] "I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." [...] Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, [...] "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." [...] He was not a diligent student of the piano: [...] "My <b>mother</b> <b>kept</b> telling me to practise, but what ten-year-old wants {{to play the piano}} when he could be out playing football?" ...|$|E
500|$|Howard's grandmother, Jannie Mae Howard, was the {{daughter}} of sharecroppers from Belzoni, Mississippi. She had four daughters by her 19th birthday, including Howard's mother Helena. Helena was an employee at a Chicago restaurant when she became pregnant with Juwan. Howard's father, Leroy Watson, had just returned from the Army to a phone company job in Chicago. The two married quickly once they realized Helena was pregnant. For Howard's first week of life, his high school junior <b>mother</b> <b>kept</b> him in a drawer at Jannie Mae's house. Helena, who was 17 years old, {{did not want to be}} restricted or burdened raising her child, so Jannie Mae adopted him. His biological father, Leroy Watson, Jr., wanted to name him Leroy Watson, III, but his grandmother rejected the suggestion, insisting on Juwan Antonio Howard. [...] Although his mother visited on occasion as he was growing up, his grandmother raised him, along with two cousins. Howard has no siblings and is not close to his biological parents; his grandmother was the primary influence in his life. He moved with her to several low-income Chicago South Side projects; she kept him out of trouble and away from gangs as he was growing up. One of their residences was a three-bedroom apartment on 69th Street on the South Side of Chicago. As he blossomed under his grandmother's influence and discipline, he became her [...] "pride and joy".|$|E

The social experiment of taking the children from [...] "unmarried mothers" [...] and [...] "giving them" [...] to adoptive parents became the norm during the BSE.
