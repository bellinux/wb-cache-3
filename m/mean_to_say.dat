We put our foot in our mouths and we wish we didn't — 'No, I didn't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. I take it back. I take it back.'" [...] According to Simpson, the song [...] "kind of relates to the last album , but it grew with the new record. And every girl has gone through that situation.

I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." [...] When Wollstonecraft revised the Rights of Woman for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.|$|E
500|$|In March 1996, Gallagher and {{his brother}} Liam met their father again when the News of the World paid {{him to go to}} their hotel during a tour. He left for his room, later commenting [...] "as far as I'm concerned, I haven't got a father. He's not a father to me, y'know? I don't respect him in any way whatsoever". In August 1996, Oasis sold out two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 fans. Following the {{worldwide}} success of Morning Glory?, Be Here Now (1997) became Oasis' most eagerly anticipated album to date. As with the previous two albums, all the tracks were written by Gallagher. After an initial blaze of publicity, positive critical reviews, and commercial success, the album {{failed to live up to}} long-term expectations, and public goodwill towards Be Here Now was short-lived. The album was ultimately regarded by many as a bloated, over-indulgent version of Oasis, which Gallagher has since blamed on the drug-addicted state and indifference of the band at the time. While the album was a record breaker, selling 660,000 copies in seven days, Gallagher has been critical of the album's popularity, saying: [...] "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> you're any good. Look at Phil Collins." ...|$|E
500|$|The Gallagher {{brothers}} hold differing {{opinions about}} the album. As early as July 1997, Noel was [...] "talking down" [...] Be Here Now in the music press, describing the production as [...] "bland", and remarking {{that some of the}} tracks were [...] "fucking shit". Noel is also very keen to downplay the record's commercial success, saying: [...] "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> you're any good. Look at Phil Collins." [...] In Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, he dismissed the album, and blamed its faults on drugs and the band's indifference during recording. He suggested that the people unsatisfied with the record simply sell it. In contrast, Noel noted that his brother [...] "thinks it fucking rocks." [...] In the same documentary, Liam defended the record, and said that [...] "at that time we thought it was fucking great, and I still think it's great. It just wasn't Morning Glory." [...] In 2006, Liam said of Noel, [...] "If he didn't like the record that much, he shouldn't have put the fucking record out in the first place... I don't know what's up with him but it's a top record, man, and I'm proud of it—it's just a little bit long." ...|$|E

500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E

For Althusser, the economic practice of a society determines which other aspect of that society dominates the society as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|The second specimen, {{found in}} 1952 by Comoran {{fisherman}} Ahamadi Abdallah, {{was described as}} a different species, first as Malania hunti and later as Malania anjounae, after Daniel François Malan, the South African Prime Minister who had dispatched an SAAF Dakota at the behest of Professor Smith to fetch the specimen. It was later discovered that the lack of a first dorsal fin, at first thought to be significant, was caused by an injury early in the specimen's life. Ironically, Malan was a staunch creationist; when he was first shown the primitive creature, he exclaimed, with a twinkle, [...] "My, it is ugly.

2500|$|Bakhtin briefly {{outlined}} the polyphonic concept of truth. He criticized the assumption that, if two people disagree, {{at least one}} of them must be in error. He challenged philosophers for whom plurality of minds is accidental and superfluous. For Bakhtin, truth is not a statement, a sentence or a phrase. Instead, understanding is a number of mutually addressed, albeit contradictory and logically inconsistent, statements. Understanding needs a multitude of carrying voices. It cannot be held within a single mind, or be expressed by [...] "a single mouth". The polyphonic truth requires many simultaneous voices. Bakhtin does not <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that many voices carry partial truths that complement each other. A number of different voices do not make the truth if simply [...] "averaged" [...] or [...] "synthesized". Rather, it is the fact of mutual addressivity, of engagement, and of commitment to the context of a real-life event, that distinguishes understanding from misunderstanding.|$|E
