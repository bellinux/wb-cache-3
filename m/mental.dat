5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, {{it is clear}} that Seth's <b>mental</b> states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have causal effects on his body and vice versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain (<b>mental</b> event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the {{caregiver}} (<b>mental</b> event), and so on.|$|E

5|$|Considering <b>mental</b> {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, <b>mental</b> representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which <b>mental</b> processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of <b>mental</b> content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of <b>mental</b> processes.|$|E
5|$|Coquitlam is {{also the}} home of Riverview Hospital, a large <b>mental</b> health facility, {{operating}} under the governance of BC <b>Mental</b> Health & Addiction Services. Riverview opened in 1913 and had 4,630 patients at its peak, but advances in treatment and cutbacks in funding have resulted in fewer people receiving <b>mental</b> health care, {{and much of the}} facility has closed over the last few decades.|$|E
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how <b>mental</b> and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a <b>mental</b> and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the <b>mental</b> vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for <b>mental</b> states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of <b>mental</b> vocabulary—the search for <b>mental</b> states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that <b>mental</b> phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more <b>mental</b> states {{do not have any}} influence on physical states or <b>mental</b> phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause <b>mental</b> events, but <b>mental</b> events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of a 2016 interdepartmental report into the issue of <b>mental</b> health in the justice system, McEntee stated her belief that it is unacceptable to send people with <b>mental</b> health issues to prison, and that {{this is an issue that}} must be tackled by the government. She also believes the government should address concerns about the <b>mental</b> health of unemployed young people.|$|E
5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how <b>mental</b> representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of <b>mental</b> states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of <b>mental</b> states and the second considers <b>mental</b> states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mental</b> health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of <b>mental</b> well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of <b>mental</b> health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for <b>mental</b> health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various <b>mental</b> disorders.|$|E
5|$|No {{constituents}} of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into <b>mental</b> states and processes. Such subjective experiences do not {{emerge from the}} body, but neither do they emerge from nothing. Rather, all objective <b>mental</b> appearances arise from the substrate, and all subjective <b>mental</b> states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the same {{philosophers}} also claimed that common-sense <b>mental</b> states {{simply do not}} exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either <b>mental</b> states exist and will ultimately be {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that <b>mental</b> phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about <b>mental</b> illness and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|Psychology is {{the science}} that investigates <b>mental</b> states directly. It uses {{generally}} empirical methods to investigate concrete <b>mental</b> states like joy, fear or obsessions. Psychology investigates {{the laws that}} bind these <b>mental</b> states to each other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism.|$|E
5|$|The San Antonio Express {{reported}} in 1939 that the funds {{granted to the}} Hogg Foundation for <b>Mental</b> Health {{would be used to}} establish <b>mental</b> hygiene clinics and conduct lectures and teacher training courses across Texas, for <b>mental</b> health research, and to survey <b>mental</b> hygiene conditions in Texas. On the entry of the United States into World War II, the Foundation researched methods to prevent mentally unsuitable candidates from enlisting in the military, and provided counseling to those traumatized by the war. After the war, the Foundation expanded its educational and philanthropic focus, providing <b>mental</b> health care to the poor and the aged. The Foundation continues to award five $5,000 annual scholarships to individuals pursuing a Master's degree in Social Work.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mental</b> status {{examination}} is a core {{skill of}} qualified (<b>mental)</b> health personnel. It {{is a key}} part of the initial psychiatric assessment in an out-patient or psychiatric hospital setting.|$|E
5|$|The reformers were {{especially}} active at the Byberry Hospital in Philadelphia where four Friends initiated The Attendant magazine {{as a way}} to communicate ideas and promote reform. This periodical later became The Psychiatric Aide, a professional journal for <b>mental</b> health workers. On May 6, 1946 Life Magazine printed an exposé of the <b>mental</b> healthcare system based on the reports of COs. Another effort of CPS, <b>Mental</b> Hygiene Project became the National <b>Mental</b> Health Foundation. Initially skeptical about the value of Civilian Public Service, Eleanor Roosevelt, impressed by the changes introduced by COs in the <b>mental</b> health system, became a sponsor of the National <b>Mental</b> Health Foundation and actively inspired other prominent citizens including Owen J. Roberts, Pearl Buck and Harry Emerson Fosdick to join her in advancing the organization's objectives of reform and humane treatment of patients.|$|E
5|$|Asylums {{has been}} {{credited}} with helping catalyze the reform of <b>mental</b> health systems {{in a number of}} countries, leading to reductions in the numbers of large <b>mental</b> hospitals and of the individuals locked up in them. It has also been influential in the anti-psychiatry movement.|$|E
5|$|In January 1982 three wards of Kew <b>Mental</b> Hospital were proclaimed a Psychiatric Hospital {{under the}} {{provisions}} of the <b>Mental</b> Health Act 1959. These wards were then known as the Willsmere Unit and were established to receive and accommodate short-term acute patients.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Putnam {{abandoned}} his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was {{primarily due to}} the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions {{with respect to the}} externalism of <b>mental</b> content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which <b>mental</b> kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that <b>mental</b> kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same <b>mental</b> state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.|$|E

5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on <b>mental</b> health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to <b>mental</b> health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for <b>mental</b> health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the <b>mental</b> health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal <b>mental</b> health services.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{succeeded in}} its initial aim of {{establishing}} a <b>mental</b> health care system for Alaska, funded by income from lands allocated to a <b>mental</b> health trust. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians systematically stripped the trust of its lands, transferring the most valuable land to private individuals and state agencies. The asset stripping was eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a reconstituted <b>mental</b> health trust {{was established in the}} mid-1980s.|$|E

25|$|In 1963 Kennedy, who had {{a mentally}} ill sister named Rosemary, {{submitted}} the nation's first Presidential special message to Congress on <b>mental</b> health issues. Congress quickly passed the <b>Mental</b> Retardation Facilities and Community <b>Mental</b> Health Centers Construction Act (P.L. 88-164), beginning {{a new era in}} Federal support for <b>mental</b> health services. The National Institute of <b>Mental</b> Health assumed responsibility for monitoring community <b>mental</b> health centers programs. This measure was a great success as there was a sixfold increase in people using <b>Mental</b> Health facilities.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Joint Commission on <b>Mental</b> Health and Health, the Presidential Panel of <b>Mental</b> Retardation, and Kennedy's influence, two important pieces of legislation were passed in 1963: the Maternal and Child Health and <b>Mental</b> Retardation Planning Amendments, which increased funding for research on the prevention of retardation, and the <b>Mental</b> Retardation Facilities and Community <b>Mental</b> Health Centers Construction Act, which provided funding for community facilities that served people with <b>mental</b> disabilities. Both acts furthered the process of deinstitutionalization.|$|E
25|$|NAMI {{successfully}} lobbied {{to improve}} <b>mental</b> {{health services and}} gain equality of insurance coverage for <b>mental</b> illnesses. In 1996, the <b>Mental</b> Health Parity Act was enacted into law, realizing the <b>mental</b> health movement's goal of equal insurance coverage.|$|E
25|$|Non-reductive {{physical}}ism is {{the idea}} that while <b>mental</b> states are physical they are not reducible to physical properties, in that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between the properties of mind and matter. According to non-reductive physicalism all <b>mental</b> states are causally reducible to physical states where <b>mental</b> properties map to physical properties and vice versa. A prominent form of non-reductive physicalism called anomalous monism was first proposed by Donald Davidson in his 1970 paper <b>Mental</b> events, where it is claimed that <b>mental</b> events are identical with physical events, and that the <b>mental</b> is anomalous, i.e. under their <b>mental</b> descriptions these <b>mental</b> events are not regulated by strict physical laws.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mental</b> health nurses must {{complete}} {{further training}} as advanced <b>mental</b> health practitioners {{in order to}} administer client referrals under the <b>Mental</b> Health Act.|$|E
25|$|Since {{numerous}} individuals {{suffering from}} <b>mental</b> illness {{had served in}} the military, many began to believe that more knowledge about <b>mental</b> illness and better services would not only benefit those who served but also national security as a whole. Congress passed the National <b>Mental</b> Health Act of 1946, which created the National Institute of <b>Mental</b> Health (NIMH). NIMH was pivotal in funding research for the developing <b>mental</b> health field.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric <b>mental</b> health nurses {{also work}} in {{forensic}} psychiatry {{with people who}} have <b>mental</b> health problems and have committed crimes. Forensic <b>mental</b> health nurses work in adult prisons, young offenders' institutions, medium secure hospitals and high secure hospitals. In addition forensic <b>mental</b> health nurses work with people in the community who have been released from prison or hospital and require on-going <b>mental</b> health service support.|$|E
25|$|Following WWII, {{articles}} and exposés about the <b>mental</b> hospital conditions bombarded popular and scholarly magazines and periodicals. The COs from the 1946 Life exposé formed the National <b>Mental</b> Health Foundation, which raised public support and successfully convinced states to increase funding for <b>mental</b> institutions. Five years later, the National <b>Mental</b> Health Foundation {{merged with the}} Hygiene and Psychiatric Foundation to form the National Association of <b>Mental</b> Health.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} {{recidivism}} {{of individuals with}} <b>mental</b> illness, a variety of programs are in place {{that are based on}} criminal justice or <b>mental</b> health intervention models. Programs modeled after criminal justice strategies include diversion programs, <b>mental</b> health courts, specialty <b>mental</b> health probation or parole, and jail aftercare/prison re-entry. Programs modeled after <b>mental</b> health interventions include forensic assertive community treatment and forensic intensive case management. It has been argued that the wide diversity of these program interventions points to a lack of clarity on which specific program components are most effective in reducing recidivism rates among individuals with <b>mental</b> illness.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{argued that}} {{anomalous}} monism follows from three plausible theses. Firstly, he assumes {{the denial of}} epiphenomenalism, the denial of the view that <b>mental</b> events do not cause physical events. Secondly, he assumes a nomological view of causation, according to which one event causes another if (and only if) there is a strict, exceptionless law governing {{the relation between the}} events. Thirdly, he assumes the principle of the anomalism of the <b>mental,</b> according to which there are no strict laws that govern the relationship between <b>mental</b> event types and physical event types. By these the theses, Davidson argued, it follows that the causal relations between the <b>mental</b> and the physical hold only between <b>mental</b> event tokens, but <b>mental</b> events as types are anomalous. That ultimately secures token physicalism and a supervenience relation between the <b>mental</b> and the physical, while respecting the autonomy of the <b>mental</b> (Malpas, 2005, §2).|$|E

25|$|As {{the name}} indicates, dirty, {{dangerous}} and demeaning work can impose severe physical and <b>mental</b> costs on workers. There {{is often a}} risk of early retirement due to injury, general joint depletion or <b>mental</b> fatigue.
