25|$|An {{inscription}} dated 445 recognizes a Marcellus as {{the most}} important financial supporter in the rebuilding of the cathedral at Narbonne, carried out during the bishopric of St. Rusticus. John Matthews has argued that this Marcellus is likely to have been a son or near descendant of the <b>medical</b> <b>writer,</b> since the family of an inlustris is most likely to have possessed the wealth for such a generous contribution. The donor had served for two years as praetorian prefect of Gaul. Assuming that the man would have been a native, Matthews weighs this piece of evidence with the Athaulf anecdote from Orosius to situate the author of the De medicamentis in the Narbonensis, but this is a minority view.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{unreasonable}} but also not necessary to conclude that Marcellus was a practicing physician. In his dissertation, the intellectual historian of magic and medicine Lynn Thorndike pronounced him the “court physician” of Theodosius I, but the evidence is thin: Libanius, if referring to this Marcellus, praises his ability to cure a headache. The prevailing view is that Marcellus should be categorized as a <b>medical</b> <b>writer</b> and not a physician. A translator of the medical writings of Isidore of Seville characterizes Marcellus as a “medical amateur” and dismisses the De medicamentis as “nothing {{more than the usual}} ancient home remedies,” and the historian of botany Ernst Meyer seems to have considered him a dilettante.|$|E
25|$|Epistulae diversorum de qualitate et observatione medicinae (“Letters {{by various}} authors on ‘quality’ and ‘observation’ in medicine”), {{a series of}} seven epistles, each {{attributed}} to a different <b>medical</b> <b>writer.</b> The epistles serve as a literary device for discussing methodology, diagnosis, {{and the importance of}} ethical and accurate treatment. They are not, or not wholly, fictional; just as Marcellus’s work begins with a prefatory epistle addressed to his sons, the seven letters represent prefaces to other authors’ works, some now lost. Marcellus has detached them from the works they headed and presented them collectively, translating, sometimes taking liberties, those originally in Greek, as a kind of bonus for his sons. For instance, the “Letter from Celsus”, addressed to a Callistus, deals with the physician’s ethical duty in relation to the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how <b>medical</b> <b>writers</b> define themselves and are defined by others. Functional definitions differed in the three professional societies to which <b>medical</b> <b>writers</b> belong: the American <b>Medical</b> <b>Writers</b> Association (AMWA), the European <b>Medical</b> <b>Writers</b> Association (EMWA) and the Drug Information Association (DIA).

25|$|Marcellus Empiricus, {{also known}} as Marcellus Burdigalensis (“Marcellus of Bordeaux”), was a Latin <b>medical</b> <b>writer</b> from Gaul {{at the turn of}} the 4th and 5th centuries. His only extant work is the De medicamentis, a {{compendium}} of pharmacological preparations drawing on the work of multiple medical and scientific writers as well as on folk remedies and magic. It is a significant if quirky text in the history of European medical writing, an infrequent subject of monographs, but regularly mined as a source for magic charms, Celtic herbology and lore, and the linguistic study of Gaulish and Vulgar Latin. Bonus auctor est (“he’s a good authority”) was the judgment of J.J. Scaliger, while the science historian George Sarton called the De medicamentis an “extraordinary mixture of traditional knowledge, popular (Celtic) medicine, and rank superstition.” Marcellus is usually identified with the magister officiorum of that name who held office during the reign of Theodosius I.|$|E

2500|$|Another popular {{theory is}} that the {{outbreaks}} were all staged, and the appearance of strange behaviour was due to its unfamiliarity. Religious cults may have been acting out well-organised dances, in accordance with ancient Greek and Roman rituals.

60|$|We {{have before}} us, and painted {{by his own}} hand, Tobias Smollett, the manly, kindly, honest, and irascible; worn and battered, but still brave and full of heart, after a long {{struggle}} against a hard fortune. His brain had been busied with a hundred different schemes; he had been reviewer and historian, critic, <b>medical</b> <b>writer,</b> poet, pamphleteer. He had fought endless literary battles; and braved and wielded for years the cudgels of controversy. It was a hard and savage fight in those days, and a niggard pay. He was oppressed by illness, age, narrow fortune; but his spirit was still resolute, and his courage steady; the battle over, he could {{do justice to the}} enemy with whom he had been so fiercely engaged, and give a not unfriendly grasp to the hand that had mauled him. He is like one of those Scotch cadets, of whom history gives us so many examples, and whom, with a national fidelity, the great Scotch novelist has painted so charmingly. Of gentle birth(148) and narrow means, going out from his northern home to win his fortune in the world, and to fight his way, armed with courage, hunger, and keen wits. His crest is a shattered oak-tree, with green leaves yet springing from it. On his ancient coat-of-arms there is a lion and a horn; this shield of his was battered and dinted in a hundred fights and brawls,(149) through which the stout Scotchman bore it courageously. You see somehow that he is a gentleman, through all his battling and struggling, his poverty, his hard-fought successes, and his defeats. His novels are recollections of his own adventures; his characters drawn, as I should think, from personages with whom he became acquainted in his own career of life. Strange companions he must have had; queer acquaintances he made in the Glasgow College—in the country apothecary’s shop; in the gun-room of the man-of-war where he served as surgeon, and in the hard life on shore, where the sturdy adventurer struggled for fortune. He did not invent much, as I fancy, but had the keenest perceptive faculty, and described what he saw with wonderful relish and delightful broad humour. I think Uncle Bowling, in Roderick Random, is as good a character as Squire Western himself; and Mr. Morgan, the Welsh apothecary, is as pleasant as Dr. Caius. What man who has made his inestimable acquaintance—what novel-reader who loves Don Quixote and Major Dalgetty—will refuse his most cordial acknowledgements to the admirable Lieutenant Lismahago? The novel of Humphry Clinker is, I do think, the most laughable story that has ever been written since the goodly art of novel-writing began. Winifred Jenkins and Tabitha Bramble must keep Englishmen on the grin for ages yet to come; and in their letters and the story of their loves there is a perpetual fount of sparkling laughter, as inexhaustible as Bladud’s well.|$|E
