25|$|Duke's father, Washington, {{had owned}} a tobacco company that his sons James and Benjamin (1855–1929) {{took over in}} the 1880s. In 1885, James Buchanan Duke {{acquired}} a license to use the first automated cigarette <b>making</b> <b>machine</b> (invented by James Albert Bonsack), and by 1890, Duke supplied 40% of the American cigarette market (then known as pre-rolled tobacco). In that year, Duke consolidated control of his four major competitors under one corporate entity, the American Tobacco Company, which was a monopoly in the American cigarette market. His robber baron business tactics directly led to the Black Patch Tobacco Wars in 1906-1908.|$|E

25|$|Result: Both teams {{wanted a}} {{designer}} shopping trolley, but Kinetic won it after Lewis unwittingly sabotaged Atomic's pitch by asking irrelevant questions and behaving in an unprofessional manner. Kinetic therefore got the trolley and a handheld vacuum cleaner, while Atomic chose a pie <b>making</b> <b>machine</b> and a bird {{house with a}} built-in camera (Harry M. and Hayley wanted an inflatable support pillow, but Haya ignored them). Both teams struggled to sell {{in the first half}} of the day, and had to resort to cutting prices as the day went on. The standout performers were Harry H. and Lizzie on Kinetic, who overcame their lack of a discount with very effective product demonstrations of the vacuum cleaner, and Harry M. on Atomic, who single-handedly made almost half of his team's revenue by selling five bird boxes at the end of the day. Kinetic won out with a profit of £1,138.77, largely due to Harry H. and Lizzie's work with the vacuum cleaners, while Atomic suffered their fourth successive defeat, raising just £847.42.|$|E
500|$|With its new railway links, Altrincham and the {{surrounding}} areas became desirable places for the middle classes and commuters to live. Professionals and industrialists moved to the town, commuting into Manchester. While some travelled daily by coach, the less well–to–do commuted by express or [...] "flyer" [...] barges from Broadheath. Between 1851 and 1881 the population increased from 4,488 to 11,250. Broadheath's industrial area, covering about , was founded in 1885 by Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford, to attract businesses. By 1900 Broadheath had its own docks, warehouses and electricity generating station. The site's proximity to rail, canal and road links proved attractive to companies <b>making</b> <b>machine</b> tools, cameras and grinding machines. The presence of companies like Tilghmans Sand Blast, and the Linotype and Machinery Company, established Broadheath as an industrial area of national standing. By 1914, 14companies operated in Broadheath, employing thousands of workers. One of those was the Budenberg Gauge Company. Linotype also created 172workers' homes near its factory, helping cater for the population boom created by Broadheath's industrialisation. Between 1891 and 1901 the population of Altrincham increased by 35per cent, from12,440 to16,831.|$|E

40|$|The {{delivery}} {{of high quality}} after-sales assistance in the ice cream <b>making</b> <b>machines</b> market is particularly challenging. The cost of on-site technical support is very high and the high revenue of ice cream <b>making</b> <b>machines</b> calls for the timely detection of failures and prompt technical support interventions. To reduce the costs and improve the efficiency of after-sales assistance operations, Carpigiani launched the highly innovative Teorema project to create a comprehensive e-maintenance platform. Teorema is already in production with hundreds of machines currently being remotely controlled, and the results obtained so far confirm the main motivations {{of the project and}} permit Carpigiani to raise its quality standard even higher...|$|R
2500|$|Milling {{had been}} {{performed}} at Arborfield {{since at least}} 1500, as foundations dating to that time were discovered in 1953. The mill was originally a grist mill, used for grinding corn or flour, but George Dawson converted it to a paper mill. A Mr. Hodgson was the paper maker in 1787, and in 1794 the business was auctioned as a going concern. In 1826, the large water wheel powered a [...] paper <b>making</b> <b>machine.</b> Three years later {{there was a fire}} at the mill, and another in 1861. Output from the mill included fine brown paper. Mrs Hargreaves, the owner of Arborfield Hall, is thought to have demolished part of the mill some time after 1861, but it was offered for sale again in 1919, and at the time included a [...] water wheel and a [...] turbine. Pumps and a dynamo supplied water and electricity to the hall, and powered the machinery on the farm. In the 1840s or 1850s, an engine house was built near the mill, which housed a Barrett, Exall & Andrews steam engine, which was manufactured in Reading. Two steam engines later powered the paper mill. The mill was owned by Guthrie Allsebrook from the 1920s, who hoped to supply water to the local authority, because he also owned the water rights. The ground floor of the building still exists, and was in use by Thames Water in 2004.|$|E

40|$|Carpigiani is {{the world}} leader of the ice cream making market, with more than 50 % market share. Carpigiani ice cream <b>making</b> <b>machines</b> are complex and {{high-duty}} systems which perform critical food processing operations.

This paper presents Teorema, an innovative telemetry solution which enables the remote assistance of Carpigiani’s ice cream <b>making</b> <b>machines.</b> The features provided by the Teorema platform allow to significantly reduce the need for on-site interventions and, as a consequence, after-sales services costs. Teorema also provides Carpigiani customers with a unique point of access to all their after-sales data, thereby offering them a significantly higher value in after-sales support...|$|R
