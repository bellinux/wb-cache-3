5|$|The {{nomenclature}} of <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies is a naming {{scheme for}} assigning generic, or nonproprietary, names to <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies. An antibody is a protein that {{is produced in}} B cells and used by the immune system of humans and other vertebrate animals to identify a specific foreign object like a bacterium or a virus. <b>Monoclonal</b> antibodies are those that were produced in identical cells, often artificially, and so share the same target object. They have {{a wide range of}} applications including medical uses.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of <b>monoclonal</b> antibody production, called hybridoma technology, {{was published in}} 1975 by Georges Köhler and César Milstein, who were awarded the 1984 Medicine Nobel Prize for their discovery together with Niels Kaj Jerne. Muromonab-CD3 was the first <b>monoclonal</b> antibody to be approved for clinical use in humans, in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Alirocumab and evolocumab, both <b>monoclonal</b> {{antibodies}} against PCSK9, {{are specifically}} indicated as adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy {{for the treatment}} of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Certain medications, such as {{corticosteroids}} and infliximab (an anti-αTNF <b>monoclonal</b> antibody), {{are becoming}} increasingly important risk factors, especially in the developed world.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monoclonal</b> {{antibodies}} are structurally identical immunoglobulin molecules with identical epitope-specificity (all of them bind {{with the}} same epitope with same affinity) as against their polyclonal counterparts which have varying affinities for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monoclonal</b> antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
5|$|Olaratumab is an antineoplastic. Its name is {{composed}} of the components olara-t-u-mab. This shows that the drug is a human <b>monoclonal</b> antibody acting against tumors.|$|E
5|$|Targeted <b>monoclonal</b> {{antibody}} {{therapy is}} employed to treat {{diseases such as}} rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and many forms of cancer including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{introduced}} {{the system of}} International Nonproprietary Names in 1950, with the first INN list being published three years later. The stem -mab for <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies was proposed around 1990, and the current system with target and source substems was developed between 1991 and 1993. Due to the collaboration between the WHO and the United States Adopted Names Council, antibody USANs have the same structure and are largely identical to INNs. Until 2009, more than 170 <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies received names following this nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the breast}} cancer {{medication}} trastuzumab can be analyzed as tras-tu-zu-mab. Therefore, the drug is a humanized <b>monoclonal</b> antibody used against a tumor.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioactive}} isotope yttrium-90 {{is used in}} drugs such as Yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide and Yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan {{for the treatment of}} various cancers, including lymphoma, leukemia, liver, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic and bone cancers. It works by adhering to <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies, which in turn bind to cancer cells and kill them via intense β-radiation from the yttrium-90 (see <b>Monoclonal</b> antibody therapy).|$|E
5|$|This naming {{scheme is}} used for both the World Health Organization’s International Nonproprietary Names (INN) and the United States Adopted Names (USAN) for pharmaceuticals. In general, word stems are used to {{identify}} classes of drugs, in most cases placed word-finally. All <b>monoclonal</b> antibody names end with the stem -mab. Unlike most other pharmaceuticals, <b>monoclonal</b> antibody nomenclature uses different preceding word parts (morphemes) depending on structure and function. These are officially called substems and sometimes erroneously infixes, even by the USAN Council itself.|$|E
5|$|Abciximab is a {{commonly}} used medication to prevent platelets from clumping together. Broken down into ab-ci-xi-mab, its name shows {{the drug to}} be a chimeric <b>monoclonal</b> antibody used on the cardiovascular system. This {{and the following two}} names would look the same if the new convention were applied.|$|E
5|$|Adalimumab {{is a drug}} {{targeting}} TNF alpha. Its name {{can be broken down}} into ada-lim-u-mab. Therefore, the drug is a human <b>monoclonal</b> antibody targeting the immune system. If adalimumab had been named after 2009, it would have been adalumab.|$|E
5|$|For {{people with}} relapsed AML, the only proven {{potentially}} curative therapy is a {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant, if one has not already been performed. In 2000, the <b>monoclonal</b> antibody-linked cytotoxic agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) was approved in the United States for people aged more than 60 years with relapsed AML who are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy. This drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer, Pfizer in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, the WHO convoked {{a working}} group to revise the {{nomenclature}} of <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies, to meet challenges discussed in April the same year. This led {{to the adoption of}} the new target substems in November 2009. In spring 2010, the first new antibody names were adopted.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone is an {{immunosuppressant}} {{also used}} in cancer chemotherapy which was approved for MS in the year 2000; whereas natalizumab is a <b>monoclonal</b> antibody that was initially approved in 2004. Both are given by intravenous infusion at monthly intervals {{in the case of}} natalizumab and every three months in the case of mitoxantrone.|$|E
5|$|Recent animal {{research}} coupling a murine <b>monoclonal</b> antibody with doxorubicin {{has created}} an immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice. Current treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) still leaves pockets of HIV within the host. The immunoconjugate could potentially provide a complementary treatment to ART to eradicate antigen-expressing T cells.|$|E
5|$|Several {{drugs that}} target {{molecular}} pathways in lung cancer are available, {{especially for the}} treatment of advanced disease. Erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib inhibit tyrosine kinase at the epidermal growth factor receptor. Denosumab is a <b>monoclonal</b> antibody directed against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand. It may be useful in the treatment of bone metastases.|$|E
5|$|Some immune deficiencies, such as X-linked {{agammaglobulinemia}} and hypogammaglobulinemia, {{result in}} partial or {{complete lack of}} antibodies. These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of immunity called passive immunity. Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies {{in the form of}} human or animal serum, pooled immunoglobulin or <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies, into the affected individual.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called antiserum. Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies in egg yolk. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies. Polyclonal and <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies are often purified using Protein A/G or antigen-affinity chromatography.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA1 synthesis, but SFTPA1 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, pancreas, thymus, colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. Using specific <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein can be detected in lung alveolar type II pneumocytes, club cells, and alveolar macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
5|$|The stem -mab is {{used for}} <b>monoclonal</b> {{antibodies}} {{as well as for}} their fragments, as long as at least one variable domain (the domain that contains the target binding structure) is included. This is the case for antigen binding fragments and single-chain variable fragments, among other artificial proteins. Other antibody parts (such as Fc regions) and antibody mimetics use different naming schemes.|$|E
5|$|The substem {{preceding}} the stem denoted the animal {{from which the}} antibody was obtained. The first <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies were produced in mice (substem -o-, yielding the ending -omab; usually Mus musculus, the house mouse) or other non-human organisms. Neither INN nor USAN has ever been requested for antibodies from rats (theoretically -a-), hamsters (-e-) and primates (-i-).|$|E
5|$|When {{the lesion}} is localized, it is {{generally}} curable. However, long-term survival for children with advanced disease older than 18 months of age is poor despite aggressive multimodal therapy (intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, differentiation agent isotretinoin also called 13-cis-retinoic acid, and frequently immunotherapy with anti-GD2 <b>monoclonal</b> antibody therapy).|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|Other {{immunotherapy}} treatments {{interfere with}} the binding of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein with its ligand PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to switch off T cells that might recognise them as a threat. <b>Monoclonal</b> antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA2 synthesis, but SFTPA2 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, pancreas, thymus, colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. While {{the majority of these}} tissues express both SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 transcripts, only SFTPA2 expression was found in the trachea and prostate. Using specific <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein can be detected in lung alveolar type II pneumocytes, Clara cells, and alveolar macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
25|$|Milstein himself {{made many}} major {{contributions}} to improvements and developments in <b>monoclonal</b> antibody technology—especially {{focusing on the}} use of <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant DNA technology to <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies for use as therapeutics.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Greg Winter and {{his team}} pioneered the {{techniques}} to humanize <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies, eliminating the reactions that many <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies caused in some patients.|$|E
25|$|Anti-cancer <b>monoclonal</b> {{antibodies}} can {{be targeted}} against malignant cells by several mechanisms. Ramucirumab is a recombinant human <b>monoclonal</b> antibody {{and is used}} in the treatment of advanced malignancies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monoclonal</b> {{antibodies}} (mAb or moAb) are antibodies {{that are}} made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. <b>Monoclonal</b> antibodies can have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the antibody). In contrast, polyclonal antibodies bind to multiple epitopes and are usually made by several different plasma cell (antibody secreting immune cell) lineages. Bispecific <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies can also be engineered, by increasing the therapeutic targets of one single <b>monoclonal</b> antibody to two epitopes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monoclonal</b> {{antibodies}} {{for research}} applications {{can be found}} directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine like CiteAb. Below are examples of clinically important <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>monoclonal</b> {{antibodies}} targeting TNF-α are golimumab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol. Etanercept also binds and inhibits {{the action}} of TNF-α, but is not a <b>monoclonal</b> antibody (it is instead a fusion of TNF-receptor and an antibody constant region).|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the {{therapeutic}} market for <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies has grown exponentially. In 2006, the “big 5” therapeutic antibodies {{on the market}} are bevacizumab, trastuzumab (both oncology), adalimumab, infliximab (both autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, ‘AIID’) and rituximab (oncology and AIID) accounted for 80% of revenues in 2006. In 2007, eight of the 20 best-selling biotechnology drugs in the U.S. are therapeutic <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies. This rapid growth in demand for <b>monoclonal</b> antibody production has been well accommodated by the industrialization of mAb manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Studies of mice given <b>monoclonal</b> {{antibodies}} for IL-13 {{results in}} decreased expression of goblet cells in asthma patients. Some treatments that use anti-IL-13 <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies include tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab. These treatments have shown improvements in asthma patients, {{yet there are}} still limitations {{to the use of}} anti-IL-13 <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies. Dupilumab is a newer drug that targets the shared receptor of IL-4 and IL-13, IL4Rα. Since IL-4 and IL-13 have interrelated biological activities, Dupilumab is a more effective form of treatment as it targets both interleukins.|$|E
