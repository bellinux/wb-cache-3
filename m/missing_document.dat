25|$|About 40 {{days after}} the {{election}} of Rojas, Luis Pérez and Estevan Rodríguez arrived together in the harbor, with many men. They did not disembark, and Pérez ordered another search for the <b>missing</b> <b>document.</b> This was now found, and it named Pérez as his father's successor. The city magistrates then withdrew recognition of Rojas, and turned over the government to Pérez. This was seconded by Pérez's soldiers, and by the fleet. Rojas left office, having governed for 40 days.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes!"--And {{here the}} Prefect, {{producing}} a memorandum-book proceeded {{to read aloud}} a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external appearance of the <b>missing</b> <b>document.</b> Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before. In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|A few {{strokes of}} the pick soon {{loosened}} the intervening earth sufficiently {{to let him}} get at a wooden plank on the nearer side of the coffin. It had mouldered away with damp and age till it was all quite soft and pliable; and he broke through it with his hand alone, and saw lying within a heap of huddled bones, which he knew at once for John Cann's skeleton. Under any other circumstances, such a sight, seen {{in the dead of}} night, with all the awesome accessories of time and place, would have chilled and appalled Cecil Mitford's nervous blood; but he thought nothing of it all now; his whole soul was entirely concentrated on a single idea--the search for the missing paper. Leaning over toward the breach he had made into John Cann's grave, he began groping about with his right hand {{on the floor of the}} coffin. After a moment's search his fingers came across a small rusty metal object, clasped, apparently, in the bony hand of the skeleton. He drew it eagerly out; it was a steel snuff-box. Prising open the corroded hinge with his pocket-knife, he found inside a small scrap of dry paper. His fingers trembled as he held it to the dark lantern; oh heavens, success! success! it was, it was--the <b>missing</b> <b>document!</b> ...|$|E

60|$|Here ensued a {{great many}} words between Matthew Maule and the {{proprietor}} of the Seven Gables, on the subject which the latter had thus broached. It seems (although Mr. Pyncheon had some hesitation in referring to stories so exceedingly absurd in their aspect) that the popular belief pointed to some mysterious connection and dependence, existing between {{the family of the}} Maules and these vast unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons. It was an ordinary saying that the old wizard, hanged though he was, had obtained the best end of the bargain in his contest with Colonel Pyncheon; inasmuch as he had got possession of the great Eastern claim, in exchange for an acre or two of garden-ground. A very aged woman, recently dead, had often used the metaphorical expression, in her fireside talk, that miles and miles of the Pyncheon lands had been shovelled into Maule's grave; which, by the bye, was but a very shallow nook, between two rocks, near the summit of Gallows Hill. Again, when the lawyers were making inquiry for the <b>missing</b> <b>document,</b> it was a by-word that it would never be found, unless in the wizard's skeleton hand. So much weight had the shrewd lawyers assigned to these fables, that (but Mr. Pyncheon did not see fit to inform the carpenter of the fact) they had secretly caused the wizard's grave to be searched. Nothing was discovered, however, except that, unaccountably, the right hand of the skeleton was gone.|$|E
60|$|But {{then some}} {{thought of the}} <b>missing</b> <b>document</b> came back upon her, and she remembered in her grief that he {{suspected}} her--that even now he had some frightful doubt as to her truth to him--her faith, which was, alas, alas! more firm and bright towards him than towards that heavenly Friend whose aid would certainly suffice to bring her through all her troubles, {{if only she could}} bring herself to trust as she asked it. But she could trust only in him, and he doubted her! Would it not be better to do as Rebecca said, and make the most of such contentment as might come to her from her triumph over herself? That would be better--ten times better than to be abandoned by him--to be deserted by her Jew lover, because the Jew would not trust her, a Christian! On either side there could be nothing for her but death; but there is a choice even of deaths. If she did the thing herself, she thought that there might be something sweet even in the sadness of her last hour--something of the flavour of sacrifice. But should it be done by him, in that way there lay nothing but the madness of desolation! It was her last resolve, as she still sat at the window counting the sparrows in the yard, that she would tell him everything, and leave it to him to decide. If he would say that it was better for them to part, then he might go; and Rebecca Loth might become his wife, if he so wished it.|$|E
60|$|In {{the further}} {{progress}} of the legend, there is a long, grotesque, and occasionally awe-striking account of the carpenter's incantations (if so {{they are to be}} called), with a view of discovering the lost document. It appears to have been his object to convert the mind of Alice into a kind of telescopic medium, through which Mr. Pyncheon and himself might obtain a glimpse into the spiritual world. He succeeded, accordingly, in holding an imperfect sort of intercourse, at one remove, with the departed personages in whose custody the so much valued secret had been carried beyond the precincts of earth. During her trance, Alice described three figures as being present to her spiritualized perception. One was an aged, dignified, stern-looking gentleman, clad as for a solemn festival in grave and costly attire, but with a great blood-stain on his richly wrought band; the second, an aged man, meanly dressed, with a dark and malign countenance, and a broken halter about his neck; the third, a person not so advanced in life as the former two, but beyond the middle age, wearing a coarse woollen tunic and leather breeches, and with a carpenter's rule sticking out of his side pocket. These three visionary characters possessed a mutual knowledge of the <b>missing</b> <b>document.</b> One of them, in truth,--it was he with the blood-stain on his band,--seemed, unless his gestures were misunderstood, to hold the parchment in his immediate keeping, but was prevented by his two partners in the mystery from disburdening himself of the trust. Finally, when he showed a purpose of shouting forth the secret loudly enough to be heard from his own sphere into that of mortals, his companions struggled with him, and pressed their hands over his mouth; and forthwith--whether that he were choked by it, or that the secret itself was of a crimson hue--there was a fresh flow of blood upon his band. Upon this, the two meanly dressed figures mocked and jeered at the much-abashed old dignitary, and pointed their fingers at the stain.|$|E

60|$|That {{evening the}} matter was talked over by {{the men and the}} boys from every point of view, but nothing came of it. Barwell Dawson agreed with Andy that nothing could be {{accomplished}} until the <b>missing</b> <b>documents</b> were brought to light.|$|R
60|$|There was now no use {{in going}} to Lodgeport to see a lawyer, and instead, Andy and Chet went out again for another search. But this was as useless as the others. Not a trace of the <b>missing</b> <b>documents</b> could be found anywhere.|$|R
60|$|But {{what must}} be her opinion as to the whole transaction? At the present moment she felt herself bound {{to think that this}} <b>missing</b> <b>document</b> would be found. That to her seemed to be the only {{solution}} which would not be terrible to contemplate. That other solution,--of the destruction of the will by her uncle's own hands,--she altogether repudiated. If it were not found, then--! What then? Would it not then be evident that some fraud was being perpetrated? And if so, by whom? As these thoughts forced themselves upon her mind, she could not but think of that pallid face, those shaking hands, and the great drops of sweat which from time to time had forced themselves on to the man's brow. It was natural that he should suffer. It was natural that he should be perturbed under the consciousness of the hostile feeling of all those around him. But yet there had hardly been occasion for all those signs of fear which she had found it impossible not to notice as she had sat there in the parlour while Mr Apjohn was explaining the circumstances of the two wills. Would an innocent man have trembled like that because the circumstances around him were difficult? Could anything but guilt have betrayed itself by such emotions? And then, had the will in truth been made away with by human hands, what other hands could have done it? Who else was interested? Who else was there at Llanfeare not interested in the preservation of a will which would have left the property to her? She did not begrudge him the estate. She had acknowledged the strength of the reasons which had induced the Squire to name him as heir; but she declared to herself that, if that latter document were not found, a deed of hideous darkness would have been perpetrated by him. With these thoughts disturbing her breast she lay awake during the long hours of the night.|$|E

50|$|In that Sunday's editions, the Oregonian {{prominently}} {{published the}} only <b>missing</b> <b>document,</b> a 1910 application for Socialist Party membership. The election coming {{just a few}} months after the Bolshevik Revolution, the revelation and the Oregonian's characterization of it as evidence of Daly's unpatriotic and dangerous radicalism was enough to alarm a substantial number of the city's voters. The protestations of the rival paper, the Oregon Journal, that Daly's dalliance with the socialists had been brief and in understandable disgust toward policies of reactionary control by the established parties, were not enough to reverse the change in Daly's standing in the community. Daly was in fact a supporter of Georgist policies for Portland. Nonetheless, he lost by a margin of only one percent of the vote, a testament both to his popularity, and the progressivism of the city's population at that time.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to documents from Mormon history, Hofmann also forged and sold signatures of many famous non-Mormons, including George Washington, John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Daniel Boone, John Brown, Andrew Jackson, Mark Twain, Nathan Hale, John Hancock, Francis Scott Key, Abraham Lincoln, John Milton, Paul Revere, Myles Standish, and Button Gwinnett, whose signature was the rarest, {{and therefore the}} most valuable, of any signer of the Declaration of Independence. Hofmann also forged a previously unknown poem in the hand of Emily Dickinson. But Hofmann's grandest scheme was to forge what {{was perhaps the most}} famous <b>missing</b> <b>document</b> in American colonial history, the [...] "Oath of a Freeman". The one-page [...] "Oath" [...] had been printed in 1639, the first document to be printed in Britain's American colonies; but only about fifty copies had been made, and none of these was extant. A genuine example was probably worth over one million dollars in 1985, and Hofmann's agents began to negotiate a sale to the Library of Congress.|$|E
40|$|The British-Soviet {{relations}} {{were established in}} 1924 under the Labor Party’s rules. In the same year, so called “Campbell case” and the “Zinoviev letter”, begun the Conservative Party’s campaign against communist propaganda. From 12 th to 14 th May 1927 Metropolitan Police and the Scotland Yard were searching the building at Moorgate 49 which was the headquarter of the All- Russian Cooperative Society Ltd. (Arcos) and Russian Trade Delegation to catch Soviets redhanded. The raid {{was a violation of}} the British-Soviet Agreement of 1921; breaking Soviet’s rights and privileges. This action was taken on account of circumstantial evidences of the espionage practiced in this building, mainly the <b>missing</b> <b>document</b> from War Office, and, unofficially, some secret documents collected by Government Codes and Cipher School (GC&CS) Formally the diplomatic rupture with USSR on 24 th May 1927 and expulsion of the trade delegation were because of exhibits found by searching house at Moorgate 49. It is significant that the <b>missing</b> <b>document</b> was never found and the confiscated materials were not satisfying. To justify the Government’s decision a white paper was published. The book contained intercepted, secret Soviet telegrams what consequently affectcd the GC&CS work adversely. In fact the reasons of severance of diplomatic {{relations were}} more complicated. First of all USSR was interfering into Chinese matters and there promoted subversion and espionage. Moreover the inconvenient trade agreement and an increase of the Labor Party’s popularity were highly uncomfortable for the Stanley Baldwin’s Government. In the conclusion the meaning of Soviet espionage was to camouflage politically motivated decisions and, what is the most important, it have been determining the Government's moves in the entire period of Conservative’s rules.

40|$|Abstract. Providing {{access to}} {{the full text of}} cataloged {{articles}} is a highly desirable feature for a digital library. However, in many such systems, not all metadata records have (a direct pointer to) a corresponding full-text document. In this paper, we present a new service for finding missing documents from digital library catalogs. This service is implemented as a software component in order to be readily deployable to existing systems. It works as a parameterized meta-search engine and allows digital library administrators to easily set up a search strategy, i. e., a list of existing search engines to be queried for the <b>missing</b> <b>document,</b> as well as the filtering and ranking policies to be applied to the results retrieved by each engine. We present a performance evaluation of our service with respect to its efficiency and the effectiveness of a suggested search strategy for collections in the computer science and in the biomedical and life sciences fields. 1...|$|E
