500|$|In May 1866, {{following}} a severe downturn in his financial fortunes, Samuel sold {{the rights to}} the Book of Household Management  to Ward, Lock and Tyler (later Ward Lock & Co). The writer Nancy Spain, in her biography of Isabella, reports that, given the money the company made from the Beetons' work, [...] "surely no man ever made a worse or more impractical bargain" [...] than Samuel did. In subsequent publications Ward Lock suppressed the details of the lives of the Beetons—especially the death of Isabella—in order to protect their investment by letting readers think she was still alive and creating recipes—what Hughes considers to be [...] "intentional censorship". Those later editions continued to make the connection to Isabella in what Beetham considers to be a [...] "fairly ruthless <b>marketing</b> <b>policy</b> which was begun by Beeton but carried on vigorously by Ward, Lock, and Tyler". Those subsequent volumes bearing Isabella's name became less reflective of the original. Since its initial publication the Book of Household Management  has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E

30|$|Active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> play an {{important}} role in this endeavour. There is a long tradition of extensive use of active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> in Denmark, and active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> have been maintained during the Great Recession. With the increase in unemployment this means that there has been a volume increase in active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies.</b> The flipside of this is an expenditure increase, but so far it has been possible to accommodate this since there has been some fiscal space. This points to the importance of creating fiscal space in “good times” to be able to accommodate negative shocks. While it in the current situation may be difficult to find policy measures which significantly can boost job creation, it is important to maintain the active focus of labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> to prevent an increase in long-term and thus structural unemployment.|$|R
