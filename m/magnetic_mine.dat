5|$|Kirov {{was damaged}} by a German <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine</b> while leaving Kronstadt on 17 October 1945 and was under repair until 20 December 1946. She was {{refitted}} from November 1949 to April 1953, during which her machinery was completely overhauled and her radars, fire control systems and anti-aircraft guns {{were replaced by}} the latest Soviet systems. She participated in fleet maneuvers in the North Sea during January 1956. She was reclassified as a training cruiser, regularly visiting Poland and East Germany, on 2 August 1961 and sold for scrap on 22 February 1974. When Kirov was decommissioned, two gun turrets were installed in Saint Petersburg as a monument.|$|E
5|$|Victorian {{composer}} and organist W. H. Jude (1851–1922) was a prolific lecturer and hymnodist, and opened over 1000 organs across the UK and Australasia during his career. Another composer {{associated with the}} school was Peter Fenn (1931–2011), director of music for Anglia Television, who attended the school as an evacuee during World War II. Philip Vassar Hunter (1883–1956) was awarded the CBE for his anti-submarine research in World War I, and in World War II invented the buoyant cable which contributed to {{the defeat of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine.</b> He was later President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and manager of the British Ice Hockey Association.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November Belfast {{was taken}} off the {{northern}} patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at Rosyth. On 21 November, Belfast was {{to take part in the}} force's first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58am she struck a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine</b> while leaving the Firth of Forth. The mine broke Belfasts keel, and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms. Twenty officers and men required hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion, and a further 26 suffered minor injuries. One man, Painter 2nd Class Henry Stanton, was hospitalised but later died of a head injury, having been thrown against the deckhead by the blast. The tugboat Krooman, towing gunnery targets for the exercise, released her targets and instead towed Belfast to Rosyth for initial repairs.|$|E

25|$|Three times Hikawa Maru survived being {{damaged by}} mines. The first was on 3 October 1942 while {{entering}} port at Surabaya, Java. She was repaired in port and departed on 10 October. The second was on 15 July 1944 when a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine</b> damaged {{her off the}} Caroline Islands. She stopped in Davao in the Philippines on 19–26 July where her damage was inspected and on 1 August she reached Yokosuka for repairs. The third was on 17 February 1945 when she was leaving the Port of Singapore. Her stern struck a mine in the Singapore Strait but she returned to port and was repaired. In March and April the Mitsubishi dockyard at Yokohama made further repairs on her, and from 21 June to 4 July she was drydocked at Maizuru.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, the Germans began a naval mine campaign against Britain. The results were devastating. Nineteen ships totaling 59,027 tons were sunk by mines in October, and 27 totaling 120,958 tons in November, along with the destroyer [...] Many more ships were damaged, including the cruiser [...] The nature of the mines was initially unknown, but on 23 November 1939, a bomb disposal team under Lieutenant Commander J. G. D. Ouvry recovered an intact aerial mine from a mudflat at Shoeburyness, and the threat was revealed to be a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|E
500|$|This [...] "cross-channel" [...] trade {{accounted}} {{for most of}} Ireland's trade. The ships ranged, in age, from Dundalk built, {{two years before the}} start of the war, in 1937 to Brooklands built in 1859. The most important vessels to Ireland were the ten colliers and to Britain the livestock carriers. Initially Germany respected the neutrality of Irish vessels, apologising for the first attack on the collier Kerry Head and paying compensation. Losses came from mines, rather than direct attacks. Meath suffered such a fate; while she was being inspected by the British Naval Control Service, she was struck by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine,</b> drowning seven hundred cattle, and destroying both vessels.|$|E

500|$|On 23 April, while {{passing through}} the Fehmarn Belt en route to Kiel, Prinz Eugen detonated a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine</b> dropped by British aircraft. The mine damaged the fuel tank, {{propeller}} shaft couplings, and fire control equipment. The planned sortie with Bismarck was delayed while repairs were carried out. Admirals Erich Raeder and Günther Lütjens discussed the possibility of delaying the operation further, {{in the hopes that}} repairs to the battleship [...] would be completed or Bismarcks sistership [...] would complete trials in time for the ships to join Prinz Eugen and Bismarck. Raeder and Lütjens decided that it would be most beneficial to resume surface actions in the Atlantic as soon as possible, however, and that the two ships should sortie without reinforcement.|$|E
500|$|Five British destroyers mounted {{an attack}} on the German {{squadron}} at 16:17. The ships attempted to close to torpedo range, though heavy seas and overcast conditions hampered their attack. Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen inflicted serious damage to the destroyer [...] At 19:55, Gneisenau detonated a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine</b> off Terschelling. The mine exploded just forward of the rear gun turret but caused only minor damage. Slight flooding was quickly stopped, though the shock disabled the center turbine. The ship stopped for less than 30 minutes before resuming the voyage; by 03:50, Gneisenau and two destroyers reached Helgoland. After being joined there by Prinz Eugen, the ships left for Kiel, but thick ice in the canal forced the ships to stop in Brunsbüttel. While maneuvering in port, Gneisenau struck a submerged wreck. The collision tore a hole in the hull and caused some minor flooding. Gneisenau reached Kiel the following day, where she went into a floating dry dock at the Deutsche Werke dockyard.|$|E

500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Gipsy was deployed with the 1st Destroyer Flotilla for patrols and contraband control in the Eastern Mediterranean, based at Alexandria. Gipsy and her entire flotilla were transferred to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October. On 12 November she collided with her sister ship, , en route to Harwich, and her new assignment with the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, but she was only slightly damaged. The ship rescued three German airmen outside Harwich harbour on 21 November and returned to port to turn them over the army. Later that evening, Gipsy set out with destroyers , [...] and [...] to patrol in the North Sea. She struck a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine</b> amidships outside the harbour, possibly laid by the aircraft whose crew she had rescued earlier that day, and sank. Thirty of her crew, including the captain, were killed. The 115 survivors were rescued by the other destroyers.|$|E
500|$|Scharnhorst did {{not make}} the voyage unscathed, however; at 15:31 she struck an air-dropped <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine</b> in the mouth of the Scheldt, abreast of the forward superfiring turret. The blast damaged the ship's circuit {{breakers}} and knocked out her electrical system for 20minutes. The explosive shock caused serious damage; turret Bruno was jammed, as were the twin and single 15cm mounts on the port side. The blast also damaged the fuel oil pumps and the bearings in the turbo-generators, which brought the ship to a halt. The power outage disabled the emergency shut-off switches to the boilers and turbines, which could not be turned off until power was restored. The explosion tore a large gash {{in the side of the}} hull and allowed [...] of water into the ship, flooding 30 watertight spaces within five main watertight compartments. Scharnhorst took on a list of one degree and was down by the bows by a meter.|$|E
500|$|Admiral Hipper {{rejoined the}} two battleships off Trondheim {{on the morning}} of 11 April, and the three ships {{returned}} to Wilhelmshaven, arriving the following day. There, the damage incurred during the engagement with Renown was repaired. She was then drydocked in Bremerhaven for periodic maintenance on 26–29 April. The ship was to go to the Baltic following the completion of repairs, but {{on the morning of}} 5 May, while steaming at [...] off the Elbe estuary, Gneisenau detonated a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine</b> about [...] off the port rear quarter and [...] below the hull. The explosion caused significant damage to the hull and flooded several compartments, which caused the ship to take on a half-degree list to port. The concussive shock from the blast damaged many internal and topside components, including the starboard low-pressure turbine and the rear rangefinders. Repairs were effected in a floating drydock in Kiel from 6 to 21 May. A brief shakedown cruise followed in the Baltic, and by the 27th, she was back in Kiel at full combat readiness.|$|E

500|$|In early 1942, {{the crews}} of Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, {{and the heavy}} cruiser [...] made {{preparations}} for Operation Cerberus, a daylight dash up the English Channel. The ships were to be redeployed to Norway, {{to assist in the}} disruption of convoys to the Soviet Union, as well as the defence of occupied Norway. The ships left Brest late on 11February, and remained undetected {{for the majority of the}} operation. East of Dover, a flight of six Swordfish torpedo bombers attacked the ships without result. At 15:31, Scharnhorst struck a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mine,</b> which damaged the ship's circuit breakers enough to shut down the entire electrical system. The ship was immobilized briefly—between 15:49 and 16:01, all three turbines were restarted and the ship resumed a speed of [...] A series of air attacks ensued, though through evasive maneuvers, anti-aircraft fire, and Luftwaffe fighters, they were all repulsed. By noon on 13February, Scharnhorst had reached Wilhelmshaven, though after two days she was transferred to Kiel for repairs, which lasted until July 1942.|$|E

She was reclassified as a training cruiser on 2 August 1961, regularly visited Poland and East Germany, and was sold for scrap on 22 February 1974. Two of her gun turrets were installed at Saint Petersburg as a monument. Maxim Gorky tested the first Soviet naval helicopter, the Kamov Ka-10, in December 1950 and began her refit in mid-1953. This was planned much like Kirovs refit, although her displacement was to increase [...] from torpedo bulges, with consequent penalties to her speed and range. The Navy reevaluated {{the scope of the}} work in 1955, deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship, and suspended the refit. Gorky was sold for scrap on 18 April 1959 after it was decided that she was not required as a missile test ship.|$|E
