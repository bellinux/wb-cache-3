5|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began {{under the}} threat of rain, {{so most of the}} teams tried to set a good lap time before the conditions deteriorated. The Audis and Peugeots swapped the overall pole position several times, {{and at the end of}} the session the No. 1 Audi was fastest overall with a time of 3.28.301. The No. 33 Barazi-Epsilon Zytek led LMP2, after an earlier <b>misfiring</b> problem had been repaired. Oreca's Saleens were the fastest two GT1 cars, while Ferrari and Porsche were close to one another in GT2. The session was red flagged about halfway through because of an accident in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago, driven by Marco Apicella, hit the wall at the first Mulsanne chicane. The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd. Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began. The ACO extended the session by fifteen minutes to compensate for the earlier red flag.|$|E
5|$|When {{producing}} a particular chocolate {{for the first}} time, a mini-game is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon. The ingredients and quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe. Each time a circle {{is filled with the}} correct ingredients, it is removed and an empty circle put in its place. The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. If too many ingredients are wasted by <b>misfiring</b> the cannon, production is brought to a halt and the mini-game must be attempted again. The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week. The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct ingredients, and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory. Playing the mini-game advances in-game time by one week. Different chocolate types, such as truffles and squares, require the factory to be upgraded first, costing money.|$|E
40|$|<b>Misfire</b> {{is another}} type of {{abnormal}} combustion. When engine <b>misfires,</b> cylinder (or cylinders) is not producing its normal amount of power. Engine <b>misfire</b> also has negative effects on engine exhaust emissions such as HC, CO, and NOx. Engine <b>misfire</b> should be detected and eliminated. Normal combustion and <b>misfire</b> in the cylinder (if any) generates vibrations in the engine block. The vibration characters due to <b>misfire</b> are unique for a particular cylinder. This can be diagnosed by processing the vibration signals acquired from the engine cylinder block using a piezoelectric accelerometer. The obtained signals were decoded using statistical parameters, like, Kurtosis, standard deviation, mean, median, etc. <b>Misfire</b> identification algorithms such as AdaBoost, LogitBoost, MultiClass Classifier, and J 48 were used as tools for feature selection and classification. The signals were trained and tested by the selected classifiers. The classification accuracy of selected classifiers were compared and presented in this paper.

40|$|Engine <b>misfire</b> {{detection}} is {{an important}} part of the On-Board Diagnostics (OBDII) legislations to reduce exhaust emissions and avoid damage to the catalytic converters. The flywheel angular velocity signal is analyzed, investigating how to use the signal in order to best detect <b>misfires.</b> An algorithm for engine <b>misfire</b> detection is proposed based on the flywheel angular velocity signal. The flywheel signal is used to estimate the torque at the flywheel and a test quantity is designed by weighting and thresholding the samples of estimated torque related to one combustion. During the development process, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to analyze the ability to detect a <b>misfire</b> given a test quantity and how the <b>misfire</b> detectability performance varies depending on, e. g., load and speed. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is also used for parameter optimization to maximize the difference between <b>misfire</b> data and fault-free data. Evaluation shows that the proposed <b>misfire</b> detection algorithm is able to have a low probability of false alarms while having a low probability of missed detections...|$|R
5|$|After two failed {{attempts}} {{to capture the}} fort by straight forward attacks, the British resorted to attrition tactics. On 28 November, instead of launching another infantry assault, the fort was encircled from all sides and placed under siege. This prevented Nepalese reinforcements from entering the fort. Mawbey then instructed his gunners, by now strongly reinforced, to fire into the fort. He also sent scouts to locate and cut off the fort's external water source. The water situation was made worse for the defenders when about a hundred earthen vessels stocked with water, stored in a portico, were destroyed in the bombardment. The eastern and northern walls of the fort were razed to the ground. The continuous bombardment also caused {{three of the four}} cannons installed on the fort's battlements to fall outside the fort, while the other fell inside. The other cannons that the Nepalese possessed were unusable, having either been disabled by <b>misfiring</b> during previous attacks, or because they had been buried under rubble in the British bombardment. Left without any cannons to reply, the garrison suffered heavy casualties. They continued to resist using gunfire and stones, but eventually the few people that remained in the fort became desperate and could not hold on any longer. That night, despite threats to their person and property, desertion became rampant.|$|E

His {{retirement}} allowed Räikkonen to move into the first points-scoring position of sixth. By lap 15, Montoya had a lead of 8.3 seconds over Ralf Schumacher, who in turn was 3.3 seconds in front of Barrichello. Michael Schumacher was a further 9.2 seconds behind his Ferrari teammate, but was drawing ahead of Coulthard in fifth. Barrichello and Panis were the first drivers to make scheduled pit stops on lap 16. The Ferrari and Williams teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Ferrari were planning a two stop strategy for Barrichello whereas the Williams team were only planning for one stop. Räikkonen slowed on track with an driveshaft failure but managed to return to the pit lane and retire on the same lap, while Irvine retired with an <b>misfiring</b> engine. Two laps later, Burti lost tenth position after he spun and was passed by Trulli and Panis.

40|$|<b>Misfire</b> {{occurs when}} {{operating}} an {{internal combustion engine}} with air fuel ratio near the lean limit. To extend the <b>misfire</b> limit, the combustion chamber is redesigned to promote turbulence and swirl. An experimental study has been conducted in a constant volume vessel to investigate {{the effects of the}} swirling flow, the spark location, the spark energy, the spark gap and the equivalence ratio on <b>misfire.</b> The relationship between spark location and <b>misfire</b> is investigated for the three following ignition locations: quarter radius from the wall, half radius from the wall and three quarter radius from the wall. The instantaneous velocities are measured using hot wire anemometer. Mixtures of propane and air with equivalence ratios between 0. 5 and 0. 64 have been tested. <b>Misfire</b> was determined using the pressure trace and by visually inspecting the flame through the quartz glass. The <b>misfire</b> probability decreases as the mean swirling velocity and turbulence intensity decay. Also the <b>misfire</b> probability decreases as the ignition point is nearer to the center even though the turbulence intensity is higher than that near the wall. It is postulated that the rate of growth of the flame area (flame stretching) is higher near the wall, therefore the lean <b>misfire</b> limit is richer...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{three-way}} catalyst in motor vehicles has entailed a radical increase {{in the importance of}} <b>misfire</b> detection. In the case of a <b>misfire,</b> unburned fuel accesses the exhaust system, where its combustion in catalyst causes a dangerous increase of temperature, which may result in damage to the catalyst due to its thermal overload. Moreover, it may also lead to an increased emission of toxic substances. Therefore, <b>misfire</b> in an internal combustion engine must be detected, as specified in the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) regulations beginning from 1996 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (E. P. A.). <b>Misfire</b> detection constitutes an essential ingredient of OBDII. Its implementation entails the use of sophisticated measurement methods and the processing of the measured signals. <b>Misfires</b> tend to be related to a faulty ignition system, (Defective ignition plugs, leaking secondary insulation, damaged ignition control module or high voltage wires). Yet there is still a wide spectrum of other possible causes of <b>misfire,</b> not connected with the spark generation circuit. <b>Misfire</b> may rise, for example; due to the leaky intake manifold, mechanisms damage to the engine, EGR system valve damage, inappropriate air-fuel ratio, Exhaust restrictions, damaged crankcase ventilation system (PVC), damaged injector, damaged intake or outlet valves or their improper control timing. If <b>misfire</b> occurs with such high frequency that the excessive quantity of unburned fuel accessing the catalyst threatens to damage it, the blinking malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will make the driver aware of the extent of the damage of the engine. Many strategies of <b>misfire</b> detection have been developed, including variation in engine shaft angular speed, spark plug voltage, cylinder pressure, oxygen sensor signal, knowledge based expert system, and neural networks. WE propose a new method to use the real time signals of conventional oxygen sensor (EGO) and wide band oxygen sensor (UEGO) to detect <b>misfire.</b> In this paper, <b>misfire</b> was induced on purpose with a <b>misfire</b> generator. The sensors and the <b>misfire</b> trigger signals were recorded simultaneously. In this paper, we suggested a <b>misfire</b> detection method which used the fluctuation of an EGO and an UEGO sensors output signals caused by a <b>misfire.</b> The fluctuation in oxygen concentration in an exhaust manifold was estimated by recording the conventional oxygen sensor signal and the wide band oxygen sensor signal. It was found that the differentiated sensors’ signals give the criteria for <b>misfire</b> detection. The <b>misfire</b> can be detected by monitoring the amplitude of the fluctuation in the differentiated signals. The differentiated signals of UEGO and EGO sensors can be used for <b>misfire</b> detection in a single cylinder motorcycle engine at any operating conditions. The proposed <b>misfire</b> detection method had showed a reliability up to 98 % for UEGO and 90 % for EGO sensors at different engine operating conditions such as: engine speed from idle (2000 rpm) to 5000 rpm, engine loads 20 %TPS to 60 % TPS, and Air-fuel ratio varying from lean to rich.

40|$|Due to {{economic}} gain {{the use of}} explosives for rock breaking has been the preferred choice in the mining industry for extracting minerals and the construction industries for driving tunnels and underground excavations. Although <b>misfires</b> are not an expected outcome in any form of blasting operations, however, due to the confined nature of underground blast the likelihood of blasthole <b>misfires</b> occurring is increased {{compared to that of}} a surface blast. Past research on the use of explosives for rock breaking have been concerned with issues about improving the effective use of explosive energy neglecting such effect as safety hazards and increased operational cost resulting from blasthole <b>misfires.</b> This research project investigate <b>misfires</b> in tunnel blasts with the aim of developing method(s) of minimising it occurrence during the blast design and identify blasthole <b>misfires</b> should they occur. Through a series of test blasts carried out at the Holman’s Test Mine operated by the Camborne School of Mines, three identification techniques based on blast emission data were developed namely; Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP Signature), Light (Optical Signature) and seismic (Vibration Signature). The study therefore concluded that whilst no one single method developed could effectively identify blasthole <b>misfires</b> in tunnel blasts, the vibration signature approach is the most pragmatic method for <b>misfire</b> identification in tunnel blasts as measurements are remotely undertaken. Moreover, blast vibration is well understood and part of almost all tunnel blasting operation. The blast vibration measurements and analyses undertaken {{during the course of this}} research resulted in the identification of potential blasthole <b>misfires</b> and aided in the safe retrieval of unexploded detonators and explosives cartridges. As a result of the research project several <b>misfires</b> were identified immediately after full face tunnel blasts at the Holmans’ Test Mine and appropriate measures taken to handle the <b>misfires.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceLondon Metal ExchangeGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The area of <b>misfire</b> {{detection}} {{is important}} because {{of the effects of}} <b>misfires</b> on both the environment and the exhaust system. Increasing requirements on the detection performance means that improvements are always of interest. In this thesis, potential improvements to an existing <b>misfire</b> detection algorithm are evaluated. The improvements evaluated are: using Gaussian processes to model the classifier, alternative signal treatments for detection of multiple <b>misfires,</b> and effects of where flywheel tooth angle error estimation is performed. The improvements are also evaluated for their suitability for use on-line. Both the use of Gaussian processes and the detection of multiple <b>misfires</b> are hard problems to solve while maintaining detection performance. Gaussian processes most likely loses performance due to loss of dependence between the weights of the classifier. It can give performance similar to the original classifier, but with greatly increased complexity. For multiple <b>misfires,</b> the performance can be slightly improved without loss of single <b>misfire</b> performance. Greater improvements are possible, but at the cost of single <b>misfire</b> performance. The decision is in the end down to the desired trade-off. The flywheel tooth angle error compensation gives nearly identical performance regardless of where it is estimated. Consequently the error estimation can be separated from the signal processing, allowing the implementation to be modular. Using an EKF for estimating the flywheel errors on-line is found to be both feasible and give good performance. Combining the separation of the error estimation from the signal treatment with a, after initial convergence, heavily restricted EKF gives a vastly reduced computational load for only a moderate loss of performance...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{experimental}} investigation of rare <b>misfire</b> and partial burn cycles in a spray-guided spark-ignited direct-injection optical engine. Spark discharge energy, discharge duration, flame imaging, velocity and equivalence ratio were measured every crank angle degree. Imaging was performed using high-speed 2 -D particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser inducted fluorescence (PLIF). The engine was operated near its optimum but produced rare and random partial burn and <b>misfire</b> cycles. Spark energy and spark duration for the partial burn and <b>misfire</b> cycles fell {{within the range}} of those for the well-burned cycles, with a slight bias toward low-energy, short-duration discharges, indicating no abnormal spark discharge events. PIV and PLIF measurements extracted from a 4 mm _ 4 mm region adjacent to and downstream of the spark plug at spark timing revealed that the partial burn and <b>misfire</b> cycles occur under lean mixtures and low velocities, but still {{within the range of}} values for the well-burned cycles. PIV and PLIF images of partial burn and <b>misfire</b> cycles were compared to well-burned cycles, which had similar velocities and equivalence ratios near the spark plug at the onset of spark. Observations of the fuel distribution and flame areas for the partial burns and <b>misfires</b> showed that an early flame kernel was always formed, but failed to develop sufficiently to propagate to the fuel in the bowl. A flame kernel arriving late within the piston bowl found significantly leaner conditions and the mixture was not fully consumed leading to a partial burn. For <b>misfire</b> cycles, the mixture in the measurement plane was significantly leaner surrounding the flame kernel, which disappeared shortly after the spark discharge. It is concluded that the partial burns and <b>misfires</b> are not the result of failed ignition, but failure during the flame propagation process...|$|R
