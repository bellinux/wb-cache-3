40|$|International audienceThe Friant-Kern {{irrigation}} canal is located along {{the foothills of}} the Sierra Nevada, south-east of Fresno, California. It has a length of approximately 240 km, and was designed for a <b>maximum</b> <b>waterflow</b> of 150 m³/s.

Despite the fact that the lime-treated soil has been in constant direct contact with the waterflow, without protective cover, only minor erosion was observed along the waterline. The small holes in the surface of the banks were caused at the construction stage by the loss of “clay balls”, i. e. small lumps of clay that were not completely mixed due to the poor efficiency of the mixing devices used at this time. In addition to the achievement of the initial objective, which was the mechanical stabilization of the banks of the canal, the Bureau of Reclamation reported other advantages of the lime-treatment procedures: the cost savings during the repair works, and the very limited maintenance operations in the lime-treated sections in comparison with others (e. g. concrete-lined sections) ...|$|E
