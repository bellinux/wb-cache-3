5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 <b>minutes.</b> <b>I</b> shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 <b>minutes.</b> <b>I</b> am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy <b>minutes.</b> <b>I</b> wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten <b>minutes</b> <b>I</b> had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E

25|$|On June 10, 2016, Eisley {{revealed}} {{that they had}} begun the process of recording their fifth studio record {{with the assistance of}} producer Will Yip at the band's own studio in Tyler {{at the beginning of the}} month. DuPree-Bemis spoke of the new album in the band's press release, mentioning that, “Musically, you could say it’s classic Eisley, in the sense that it’s melodic, moody pop and is written from the heart. Lyrically, it’s very whimsical; it has a vibe that will take you into its own world and let you escape your normal life for a few <b>minutes.</b> <b>I</b> like to cloak things in a little mystery and romance; I think it’s part of what makes all of Eisley’s songs sound like they’re from the same world. Every record is like opening and reading a book in a series.” Tracking for the album concluded in early July, with mention of plans to release the record in early 2017.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of <b>minutes</b> <b>I</b> seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E
500|$|The Irish {{songwriter}} John Lyons (b. 1934) {{wrote the}} popular song The Kilkenny Louse House. The song contains the lines [...] "Well {{we went up}} the stairs and we put out the light, Sure in less than five <b>minutes,</b> <b>I</b> had to show fight. For the fleas and the bugs they collected to march, And over me stomach they formed a great arch". It has been recorded by Christie Purcell (1952), Mary Delaney on From Puck to Appleby (2003), and the Dubliners on Double Dubliners (1972) among others.|$|E

500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of <b>minutes,</b> <b>I</b> can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E
500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten <b>minutes.</b> <b>I</b> think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{endogenous}} calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the nonadrenergic noncholinergic depressor {{response to}} spinal cord stimulation was {{studied in the}} pithed rat in vivo. Pithed rats were given hexamethonium (2 mg/kg per <b>minute</b> <b>i.</b> v.) to block autonomic outflow, and mean blood pressure was artificially maintained at approximately 100 mm Hg with methoxamine (10 - 15,ug/kg per <b>minute</b> <b>i.</b> v.). Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord {{at the level of}} the lower thoracic vertebra (T 9 - 12) caused a fall in blood pressure in a frequency-dependent (0. 5 - 10 Hz), voltage-dependent (2. 5 - 50 V), and pulse duration-dependent (0. 25 - 8 msec) manner. The heart rate did not change during the depressor response. The depressor response was long lasting, and the maximum response was elicited by stimulation at 4 - 6 Hz. The neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (100,g/kg i. v.) abolished the depressor response to spinal cord stimulation, whereas treatment with propranolol (0. 5 mg/kg per <b>minute</b> <b>i.</b> v.), atropine (0. 05 mg/kg per <b>minute</b> <b>i.</b> v.), or a combination of pyrilamine (0. 5 mg/kg per <b>minute</b> <b>i.</b> v.) and cimetidine (0. 5 mg/kg per <b>minute</b> <b>i.</b> v.) did not affect the response. In pithed rats treated with capsaicin (total dose of 500 mg/kg s. c.), spinal cord stimulation caused a slight depressor response. Exogenous CGRP, but not acetylcholine, isoproterenol, histamine, or substance P, caused a sustained fall in blood pressure that mimicked the spinal cord stimulation-induced depressor response. Continuous infusion of CGRP[8 - 37] (60 nmol/k...|$|R

500|$|... "Running to the Edge of the World" [...] is a David Bowie-inspired ballad, which {{features}} Manson singing in falsetto notes during its middle 8. [...] "I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies" [...] is a primarily bass-driven rock song. At over 9 minutes, it is longest {{song on the}} album. Its lyrics document the disintegration of Manson's relationship with Wood, and his fantasies of [...] "smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer." [...] It {{was one of the}} first tracks the band recorded for The High End of Low, and was originally 25 minutes long. Reluctant to release a double album, they re-recorded a shorter version following the completion of the album's final song, [...] "15", with Manson asking the band: [...] "How many minutes do I have left on this CD ? And it was 9 <b>minutes.</b> <b>I</b> said, 'Roll it, I'm going to sing it.' What appears on the record is one [...] performance." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson, by then Leeds United manager, {{returned}} to his former club in July 1991 to sign two young centre-backs, Jon Newsome first and Wetherall a few days later, for a combined fee of £275,000. The 20-year-old Wetherall's first season at Leeds was {{the final year of}} his degree course, so he played for the reserves while training part-time. He made a brief debut in the First Division, on 3 September 1991 at Elland Road as a late substitute against Arsenal; Leeds {{went on to win the}} 1991–92 league title. He remembers it as [...] "With 20 minutes to go, we were 2–1 down and I was on the touchline ready to go on, then Lee Chapman scored and the gaffer (Howard Wilkinson) told me to sit down again. But he threw me on for the last two <b>minutes.</b> <b>I</b> always tell people that made the difference in winning the title!" [...] As his teammates took the league trophy on a celebratory open top bus tour, Wetherall chose to revise for his examinations, a decision he came to regret, because [...] "those experiences don't come around that often". Though the revision bore fruit: he graduated with first-class honours.|$|E
500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 <b>minutes.</b> <b>I</b> could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left.
