40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the Sigma algorithm that solves fault-tolerant mutual exclusion problem in dynamic systems where {{the set of}} processes may be large and change dynamically, processes may crash, and the recovery or replacement of crashed processes may lose all state information (<b>memory</b> <b>losses).</b> Sigma algorithm includes new messaging mechanisms to tolerate process crashes and <b>memory</b> <b>losses.</b> It does not require any extra cost for process recovery. The paper also shows that the threshold used by the Sigma algorithm is necessary for systems with process crashes and <b>memory</b> <b>losses.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|Many {{psychological}} mechanisms {{have been}} implicated {{in the development and}} maintenance of schizophrenia. Cognitive biases have been identified in those with the diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations.

5|$|The {{early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease are {{difficult}} to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as <b>memory</b> <b>loss</b> through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties {{up to eight}} years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex activities of daily living. The most noticeable deficit is short term <b>memory</b> <b>loss,</b> which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-profile}} shooter, Walsh won numerous tournaments {{within the}} FBI and the Marine Corps, {{as well as}} nationally, and participated in the 1948 Summer Olympics.

At the FBI's 100th anniversary celebration he was recognized as the oldest living former agent and noted as being a year older than the organization itself. Aside from some hearing and <b>memory</b> <b>loss,</b> he remained physically fit at his 103rd birthday and, in March 2013, became the longest-lived Olympic competitor.|$|E

5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, <b>memory</b> <b>loss</b> and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell {{turned himself}} in to {{authorities}} on March 12, 2012, after being indicted on federal tax fraud charges. He was arraigned on March 22 on the charges, and a warrant for his arrest in Indiana for failure to pay child support led to his incarceration in Orange County, Florida. In May 2012, Mitchell {{filed a lawsuit against}} a married couple, who were defendants in his previous charges, citing fraud, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mitchell pleaded guilty on March 8, 2013, to one count of conspiring to file a false tax claim with the federal government. At a hearing on October 24, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, he claimed that his crime stemmed from concussions he suffered during his career in the NFL, adding that he suffers from headaches, insomnia, and <b>memory</b> <b>loss.</b> That <b>memory</b> <b>loss</b> was cited as a possible reason for his failing to pay child support in that case as well.

5|$|Scientists {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} Parkinson’s disease as a synucleiopathy (due to an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain) to {{distinguish it from}} other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease where the brain accumulates tau protein. Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with <b>memory</b> <b>loss,</b> and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are not normal features of Alzheimer's.|$|E
