25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma <b>membrane</b> <b>transport</b> <b>protein</b> known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B {{in the liver}} or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the trans-Golgi network to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, lysyl oxidase, and tyrosinase, depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E

2500|$|Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit many {{isozymes}} of the cytochrome P450 {{system that}} are involved in drug metabolism. Both are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 (which is also the chief enzyme responsible for their metabolism) and CYP2C19, and mild to moderate inhibitors of CYP2B6 and CYP2C9. In vivo, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine do not significantly affect the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. [...] They also inhibit the activity of P-glycoprotein, a type of <b>membrane</b> <b>transport</b> <b>protein</b> that {{plays an important role in}} drug transport and metabolism and hence P-glycoprotein substrates such as loperamide may have their central effects potentiated. This extensive effect on the body's pathways for drug metabolism creates the potential for interactions with many commonly used drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Because TAAR1 is an {{intracellular}} receptor in monoamine neurons, TAAR1 ligands must {{enter the}} presynaptic neuron through a <b>membrane</b> <b>transport</b> <b>protein</b> or {{be able to}} diffuse across the presynaptic membrane {{in order to reach}} the receptor and produce reuptake inhibition and neurotransmitter efflux. Consequently, the efficacy of a particular TAAR1 ligand in producing these effects in different monoamine neurons is a function of both its binding affinity at TAAR1 and its capacity to move across the presynaptic membrane at each type of neuron. [...] The variability between a TAAR1 ligand's substrate affinity at the various monoamine transporters accounts for much of the difference in its capacity to produce neurotransmitter release and reuptake inhibition in different types of monoamine neurons. E.g., a TAAR1 ligand which can easily pass through the norepinephrine transporter, but not the serotonin transporter, will produce – all else equal – markedly greater TAAR1-induced effects in norepinephrine neurons as compared to serotonin neurons.|$|E

For the analysis we have used two well-characterized transporters, that is, the major facilitator superfamily protein LacS and the phosphotransferase system EII Mtl.

Our experiments show that during blue native electrophoresis the detergent bound to the proteins is replaced by the amphipathic Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) dye. The mass of the bound CBB dye was quanti-®ed. Provided this additional mass of bound CBB dye is accounted for and care is taken in the choice and concentration of the detergent used, the mass of LacS, XylP and EII Mtl and four other <b>membrane</b> (<b>transport)</b> <b>proteins</b> could be deduced within 10 % error.
