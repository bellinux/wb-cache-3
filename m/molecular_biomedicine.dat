40|$|Abstract The apoptosome is a multimolecular complex {{assembled}} {{around the}} adaptor protein Apaf 1 upon mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The {{formation of the}} apoptosome needs the presence of ATP/dATP and cytochrome c in the cytosol and triggers the activation of caspases which – in turn – drive cell demise. Apoptosis {{plays a key role}} in the homeostasis of all multicellular organisms and, indeed, with regard to its essential components the apoptosome is evolutionary conserved. However, higher eukaryotes, according to their complexity, have evolved more complicated and finely tuned mechanisms for controlling apoptosome activity. Since apoptosome dysfunctions can cause many human diseases, this complex is also a relevant <b>molecular</b> target in <b>biomedicine</b> and the understanding of its structure and its regulation is matter of great interest for scientists.

Research completed at Department of Chemistry College of Liberal Arts & SciencesPorphyrins with their attractive chemical properties qualify to seek potential technological applications including solar energy conversion, sensors, catalysts, <b>biomedicine,</b> <b>molecular</b> electronics, and photonics. Many of these applications require the Porphyrin {{to be on a}} surface, preferably in a conducting polymer matrix. Electro polymerization is a convenient method to produce such a conducting porphyrin polymer on the electrode surface. Compared to chemical methods, an electrochemical method is simple, and ensures good electrical conductivity across the interface. In the present study, we report electro polymerization of tetrakis N,N-diphenylaminoporphyrinatozinc(II) on the electrode surface. Subsequently, porphyrin-fullerene dyad is formed via axial coordination of a phenylimidazole appended fullerene. The film formation was monitored by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, and characterized by surface and optical methods. The newly formed donor-acceptor dyad was further utilized in photoelectrochemical applications to convert light energy directly into electricity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) is {{the most}} frequent form of DNA variation. The set of SNPs present in a chromosome (called the haplotype) is of interest in a wide area of applications in <b>molecular</b> biology and <b>biomedicine,</b> including diagnostic and medical therapy. In this {{paper we propose a}} new heuristic method for the problem of hap-lotype reconstruction for (portions of) a pair of homologous human chromosomes from a single individual (SIH). The problem is well known in literature and exact algorithms have been proposed for the case when no (or few) gaps are allowed in the input fragments. These algorithms, though exact and of polynomial complexity, are slow in practice. There-fore fast heuristics have been proposed. In this paper we describe a new heuristic method that is able to tackle the case of many gapped frag-ments and retains its effectiveness even when the input fragments have high rate of reading errors (up to 20 %) and low coverage (as low as 3). We test our method on real data from the HapMap Project. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: With an {{overwhelming}} amount of textual information in <b>molecular</b> biology and <b>biomedicine,</b> {{there is a}} need for effective literature mining techniques that can help biologists to gather and make use of the knowledge encoded in text documents. Although the knowledge is organized around sets of domain-specific terms, few literature mining systems incorporate deep and dynamic terminology processing. Results: In this paper, we present an overview of an integrated framework for terminology-driven mining from biomedical literature. The framework integrates the following components: automatic term recognition, term variation handling, acronym acquisition, automatic discovery of term similarities and term clustering. The term variant recognition is incorporated into terminology recognition process by taking into account orthographical, morphological, syntactic, lexico-semantic and pragmatic term variations. In particular, we address acronyms as a common way of introducing term variants in biomedical papers. Term clustering is based on the automatic discovery of term similarities. We use a hybrid similarity measure, where terms are compared by using both internal and external evidence. The measure combines lexical, syntactical and contextual similarity. Experiments on terminology recognition and clustering performed on a corpus of MEDLINE abstracts recorded the precision of 98 and 71 % respectively.

40|$|Discovery and {{integration}} of data is important in many ecological studies, especially those that concern broad-scale ecological questions. Data discovery {{and integration}} are often difficult and time consuming tasks for researchers, which {{is due in part}} to the use of informal, ambiguous, and sometimes inconsistent terms for describing data content. Ontologies offer a solution to this problem by providing consistent definitions of ecological concepts that in turn can be used to annotate, relate, and search for data sets. However, unlike in <b>molecular</b> biology or <b>biomedicine,</b> few ontology development efforts exist within ecology. Ontology development often requires considerable expertise in ontology languages and development tools, which is often a barrier for ontology creation in ecology. In this paper we describe an approach for ontology creation that allows ecologists to use common spreadsheet tools to describe different aspects of an ontology. We present conventions for creating, relating, and constraining concepts through spreadsheets, and provide software tools for converting these ontologies into equivalent OWL-DL representations. We also consider inverse translations, i. e., to convert ontologies represented using OWL-DL into our spreadsheet format. Our approach allows large lists of terms to be easily related and organized into concept hierarchies, and generally provides a more intuitive and natural interface for ontology development by ecologists. 7 page(s...|$|R

The aim of the project was to determine the most suitable embryo stage for the isolation and culturing of pluripotent cells of zebrafish embryos. Studies were carried out to investigate the expression of two pluripotency markers i. e. Oct 4 and Sa 1 l 4 at certain embryonic stages employing Immunohistochemistry. The protein expression studies indicated maximum expression of Oct 4 and Sa 1 l 4 at high stage. Primary cultures were initiated from zebrafish high stage embryos in basal nutrient medium; supplemented with insulin, selenite, epidermal growth factor and Foetal Bovine serum. Experiments were conducted for the determination of optimum concentrations of FBS. The growing cultures identified the signs of differentiation i. e. melanocytes and neurite formation. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was found to inhibit the differentiation in cultures. The developed pluripotency markers were tested on cultured embryonic cells. Results indicated that these markers work well for the identification ofphenotype of embryonic cell colonies in zebrafish.
