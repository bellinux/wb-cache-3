40|$|Objective: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the effect of incontinence, and urge incontinence in particular, on patients' quality of life. This study assessed the effects of urge incontinence on {{quality of life and}} measured the value of a reduction in symptoms. Design: A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 591 patients with urge or mixed incontinence. 495 (83. 8 %) surveys were returned with complete quality of life and symptom data. Of the total sample, 411 patients received the willingness-to-pay (WTP) survey, from which 257 (62. 53 %) returns were judged complete and reliable. Information was collected about the number of <b>micturitions</b> and urinary leakages. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) was measured using the Short Form 36 (SF- 36) Health Survey. Socioeconomic characteristics were also recorded. Value was assessed with a binary WTP question. Main outcome measures and results: Quality of life among the sample population was significantly lower in 5 of 8 dimensions compared with the general US population, and was significantly related to the severity of the symptoms in 6 of 8 dimensions. The median (mean) willingness to pay was $US 27. 24 ($US 87. 74) per month for a 25 % reduction in <b>micturitions</b> and leakages, and $US 75. 92 ($US 244. 54) per month for a 50 % reduction in <b>micturitions</b> and leakages. As expected, the willingness to pay was significantly related {{to the size of the}} reduction in <b>micturitions</b> and leakages, and household income.

25|$|Bladder afferent signals ascend {{the spinal}} cord to the periaqueductal gray, where they project both to the pontine <b>micturition</b> center and to the cerebrum. At {{a certain level of}} afferent activity, the {{conscious}} urge to void becomes difficult to ignore. Once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued, neurons in pontine <b>micturition</b> center fire maximally, causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons. The firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract; as a result, a sudden, sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs. The pontine <b>micturition</b> center also causes inhibition of Onuf's nucleus, resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter. When the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra. The <b>micturition</b> reflex normally produces a series of contractions of the urinary bladder.|$|E
25|$|Urine, {{excreted}} by the kidneys, collects in {{the bladder}} before disposal by urination (<b>micturition).</b> The urinary bladder usually holds 300-350 ml of urine.

Urination is controlled by the pontine <b>micturition</b> center in the brainstem.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{inhibitory}} {{area for}} <b>micturition</b> in the midbrain.

40|$|Radical {{cystectomy}} {{represents the}} gold standard for locally advanced bladder cancer. Orthotopic neobladder is considered the surgical option which may offer the least modification of body image and the best life condition to the unfortunate patient requiring radical cystectomy. Objective {{of this study was to}} investigate long term clinical outcome of orthotopic ileal bladder substitute with special reference to late complications and patient compliance. Twenty male patients 48 to 71 years old (mean age 59. 8 + 7. 4 years) underwent radical cystectomy and Studer orthotopic ileal neobladder for invasive carcinoma of the bladder. Before surgery all patients filled in a phycometric test for evaluating their knowledge capacity; after surgery they underwent a course of biofeedback and instructed to avoid overfilling of the neobladder with timed <b>micturitions</b> and a regular regimen of fluid intake. Pressure flow study was included in the routine follow-up carried out at six months and then yearly. Seventeen patients (85 %), with a good knowledge capacity, reported a good compliance to the modified life style imposed by the bladder substitute, they all were dry during the day with 3 to 5. 5 hour interval between micturitions; fourteen of these patients were continent at night with timed <b>micturitions</b> every 3 - 4 hours (mean: 3. 2); an average cystometric capacity of 450 ml was found in these patients with no residual urine; three patients (18 %) had incontinence episodes once or twice a week during the night; no decompensation of the neobladder, significant ureteral reflux or dilatation were reported; elongation of the afferent loop was found in one patient following small bowel resection for ileal volvulus. Three patients (15 %), with a reduced knowledge capacity, who did not follow the suggested life style: fluid intake was irregular, <b>micturitions</b> were not timed during both day and night time, had residual urine larger than 400 ml. and incontinence episodes requiring pads; nevertheless no dilation of the upper urinary tract was found. Our experience suggests that careful compliance of patients to the new life style imposed by the orthotopic neobladder is of importance to avoid its decompensation. The possible causative role of gastrointestinal hormones such as enteroglucagon (EG) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) in the elongation of the afferent limb of the Studer neobladder is proposed.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIncontinence has {{a greater}} {{detrimental}} effect on quality of life than other symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) and {{is often difficult to}} treat with antimuscarinic monotherapy. ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy and the safety and tolerability of combination (solifenacin 5 mg and mirabegron 50 mg) versus solifenacin 5 or 10 mg in OAB patients remaining incontinent after 4 wk of solifenacin 5 mg. Design, setting, and participantsOAB patients remaining incontinent despite daily solifenacin 5 mg during 4 -wk single-blind run-in were randomised 1 : 1 : 1 to double-blind daily combination or solifenacin 5 or 10 mg for 12 wk. Patients receiving the combination were initiated on mirabegron 25 mg increasing to 50 mg after week 4. Outcome measurements and statistical analysisThe primary end point was a change from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 h (stratified rank analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]). Key secondary end points were a change from baseline to EOT in the mean number of <b>micturitions</b> per 24 h (ANCOVA) and number of incontinence episodes noted in a 3 -d diary at EOT (mixed-effects Poisson regression). A trial (BESIDE) comparing combination treatment (solifenacin plus mirabegron) with one treatment alone (solifenacin) tested the superiority of combination versus solifenacin 5 mg, noninferiority (and potential superiority) of combination versus solifenacin 10 mg (key secondary end points), and the safety and tolerability of combination therapy versus solifenacin monotherapy. Results and limitationsA total of 2174 patients were randomised to combination (n= 727), solifenacin 5 mg (n= 728), or solifenacin 10 mg (n= 719). At EOT, combination was superior to solifenacin 5 mg, with significant improvements in daily incontinence (p= 0. 001), daily <b>micturitions</b> (p< 0. 001), and incontinence noted in a 3 -d diary (p= 0. 014). Combination was noninferior to solifenacin 10 mg for key secondary end points and superior to solifenacin 10 mg for improving daily <b>micturitions.</b> All treatments were well tolerated. ConclusionsAdding mirabegron 50 mg to solifenacin 5 mg further improved OAB symptoms versus solifenacin 5 or 10 mg, and it was well tolerated in OAB patients remaining incontinent after initial solifenacin 5 mg. Patient summaryIn this 12 -wk study, overactive bladder patients who remained incontinent despite initial solifenacin 5 mg treatment received additional treatment with mirabegron 50 mg. Combining mirabegron 50 mg with solifenacin 5 mg was superior to solifenacin 5 mg alone in improving symptoms of incontinence and frequent urination, and it was well tolerated.

40|$|Abstract Background Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic for the {{treatment}} of overactive bladder, a syndrome of urgency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), usually with increased daytime frequency and nocturia. Our objective was to develop predictive models to describe the dose response of fesoterodine. Methods Data from subjects enrolled in double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II and III trials were used for developing longitudinal dose-response models. Results The models predicted that clinically significant and near-maximum treatment effects would be seen within 3 to 4 weeks after treatment initiation. For a typical patient with 11 <b>micturitions</b> per 24 hours at baseline, predicted change was - 1. 2, - 1. 7, and - 2. 2 <b>micturitions</b> for placebo and fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg, respectively. For a typical patient with 2 UUI episodes per 24 hours at baseline, predicted change was - 1. 05, - 1. 26, and - 1. 43 UUI episodes for placebo and fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg, respectively. Increase in mean voided volume was estimated at 9. 7 mL for placebo, with an additional 14. 2 mL and 28. 4 mL for fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg, respectively. Conclusions A consistent dose response for fesoterodine was demonstrated for bladder diary endpoints in subjects with overactive bladder, a result that supports the greater efficacy seen with fesoterodine 8 mg in post hoc analyses of clinical trial data. The dose-response models can be used to predict outcomes for doses not studied or for patient subgroups underrepresented in clinical trials.

25|$|ICD-10 defines {{social phobia}} as {{a fear of}} {{scrutiny}} by other people leading to avoidance of social situations. The anxiety symptoms may present as a complaint of blushing, hand tremor, nausea or urgency of <b>micturition.</b> Symptoms may progress to panic attacks.|$|E
25|$|In healthy individuals, {{the lower}} urinary tract has two {{discrete}} phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine {{is stored in}} the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra. At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the sphincter and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder. At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, {{at which point the}} bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage. The muscles controlling <b>micturition</b> are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. During the storage phase the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During <b>micturition,</b> parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during <b>micturition.</b>|$|E

40|$|Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic agent {{indicated}} for {{the treatment}} of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of fesoterodine versus placebo over selected intervals during a 24 -hour period in subjects with OAB. In a post hoc analysis, data were analyzed from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12 -week phase III trials in which subjects with a history of OAB symptoms for 6 months were treated with morning doses of fesoterodine 4 mg, fesoterodine 8 mg, or placebo. These trials are registered at ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 00220363 and NCT 00138723). Changes were evaluated in number of <b>micturitions,</b> urgency episodes, urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) episodes, and mean voided volume (MVV) divided into three 8 -hour intervals: 08 : 00 - 15 : 59 (daytime), 16 : 00 - 23 : 59 (evening), and 00 : 00 - 07 : 59 (nighttime). Comparisons with placebo were made using analysis of covariance (for least squares mean changes) and Wilcoxon rank sum test (for median percent changes); differences were considered significant at p < 0. 05. Data from 1674 subjects, 80 % of whom were women, were included in the analysis. At the end of treatment, the least squares mean change from baseline for all efficacy endpoints was significantly greater with fesoterodine 4 mg and fesoterodine 8 mg compared with placebo during each 8 -hour time interval (all p < 0. 05).

25|$|Urination is {{the release}} of urine from the urinary bladder through the urethra {{to the outside of}} the body. It is the urinary system's form of excretion.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled. One possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction. Another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine <b>micturition</b> center, which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Due to the {{evolution}} of extracorporeal lithotripsy equipment (ESWL) and presently, the fact that most part of the equipment does not present ultrasound to localize urinary calculi, a system that allows adapting ultrasound equipment to ESWL equipment was developed, disposing only of fluoroscopy. Thus, this equipment was developed and was tested in urinary stones in canine models, to check its precision in relation to fluoroscopy. METHOD: Seven male dogs were utilized with the introduction, in the bladder through the ureteral route, of chalkstones, with initial localization by fluoroscopy, with a further ultrasound coincidence check localization of the vesical stones, being submitted to ESWL with a 3 -hour, 21 days and 60 days follow-up after the procedure. RESULTS: Success of localization in all animals was verified presenting elimination of stones in the first <b>micturitions,</b> after ESWL. No complications were verified in those animals for 60 days. CONCLUSION: We verified that this equipment can lead to an update of the equipment that use only fluoroscopy, increasing in this way, their technical capacity in the treatment of urinary calculi, mainly in cases of non-radiopaque stones.

A 35 -year-old gravida 7, para 1, and abortus 5 female with hypogastric pain and inability to void urine after 14 + 3 weeks of amenorrhea was examined in the emergency department. One year before, a uterine prolapse had been diagnosed in another hospital. Examination showed a uterine prolapse grade 2 with palpable bladder. The patient was unable to void urine. After amanual reduction of the uterine prolapse, the patient underwent an emergency catheterization for bladder drainage. A Hodge pessary (size 70) was placed, which led to spontaneous <b>micturitions.</b> Due to {{the persistence of the}} symptoms the following day, Hodge pessary was replaced by an Arabin cerclage pessary.
