40|$|A {{sustainable}} EU Immigration Policy aims {{to contribute}} to a vibrant European society through more effectively and selectively <b>managed</b> <b>immigration</b> from outside the EU, more attention to integration of immigrants, more rooting out of discrimination, more asylum centres close to areas of conflict, and more attention to education and training in areas where refugees have settled. Immigration from outside the EU is often opposed, mainly because of sluggish integration combined with tensions in actual and perceived values between immigrants and native populations. These divisions affect not only the first generation of immigrants, but also those that follow. We propose a sustainable, win-win policy fostering the benefits of immigration and in line with the preferences of EU citizens holding not only positive but also more sceptical views on immigration while relying on adherence to human rights. The proposed policy is directed towards more effectively and selectively <b>managed</b> <b>immigration</b> based on the employability potential of the immigrant, combined with more attention to integration and stricter measures to fight discrimination. We also acknowledge the need for a robust policy framework to cope with asylum and abrupt large-scale waves of refugees wanting to enter the EU, resulting from conflicts, natural catastrophes, and other sudden or violent events. We propose screening schemes for refugee camps surrounding countries they have fled to determine migrants' refugee status, channelling them either as economic migrants, selected on their employability, or through a humanitarian scheme that respects the EU's multilateral and bilateral commitments. Such a humanitarian scheme would be embedded into education-cooperation policies, to provide better opportunities to qualify for admission and substantially greater support for refugees...|$|E

40|$|Why {{does the}} British {{government}} increasingly lose immigration cases in court? More broadly, what {{can explain the}} changing behaviour of appeal court judges? It is because government powers to <b>manage</b> <b>immigration,</b> delegated by Parliament, are increasingly couched in indeterminate language. Indeterminacy in legislation allows for executive discretion, but also encourages litigation. Parliament has therefore provided the cause of action, and judges are not being ‘activist’. This argument revitalises, with nuance, the legal model of judicial behaviour. New evidence supports the claim, with discourse analysis of all 1, 233 sections of immigration legislation enacted from 1905 to 2016 showing an increase in indeterminacy. Logit regression modelling of 252 immigration appeal cases between 1970 and 2012 shows that changes to language and {{the administration of the}} law can explain the outcome in 73 % of cases...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the experiences of immigrant Filipino women in the United States and state practices <b>managing</b> <b>immigration</b> and immigrant labor. The main question that I pose here is: What are some of the effects that state policies have on the experience of Filipino caregivers and domestic workers in the United States? My tentative argument is that increasingly restrictive immigration policies and gaps in employment laws facilitate the exploitation and subordination of migrant Filipina domestic workers in the United States. Employment law often does not include caregivers and domestic workers in its protections, and immigration policy in the United States does not have any program regulating their entry and work. It is the intersection of both legal bodies which triggers situations of what I call here legalized trafficking and normalization of irregularity...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we {{deconstruct}} the moral panic around ‘sham marriage’—otherwise known as marriages of convenience or marriage for immigration advantage—in Britain. We trace the moral panic over sham marriage through its visual and provocative depiction in media coverage – newspaper articles, investigatory documentaries – to its propagation and perpetuation in the UK government’s continuing project of <b>managing</b> <b>immigration.</b> Marriage-related migration and settlement {{are a significant}} challenge to efforts to cap immigration, resulting in attempts to redraw the moral boundaries of immigration policy. Media and policy representations of ‘sham marriage’ must therefore be understood in this context {{in terms of the}} strategic positioning of moral entrepreneurs. The chapter first outlines how immigration policy relating to spousal migration has come to include reference to ‘sham marriage’, the identification of such marriages becoming a mechanism for controlling immigration. We highlight how these policies sit within a wider context that promotes immigration as a challenge to moral order, revealing how current political discourse about ‘sham marriage’ demonstrates many of the characteristics of moral panic. Through a review of Home Office documents, we demonstrate how ‘sham marriage’ has become firmly embedded in government policy and discourse about marriage-related migration...|$|R

40|$|In Britain, {{international}} migrants {{have very}} recently become the major workforce in labour-intensive agriculture. This paper explores {{the causes of}} the dramatic increase since the 1990 s in the employment of migrant workers in this sub-sector. It locates this major change in a general pattern of intensification in agricultural production related to an ongoing process of concentration in retailer power, and in the greater availability of migrant workers, shaped in part by state initiatives to <b>manage</b> <b>immigration.</b> However, within this narrative of change at the national scale, the paper also finds continuing diversity in agricultural workplace regimes. The paper draws on concepts developed in the US literature on agrarian capitalism. It then uses case histories from British agriculture to illustrate how growers have directly linked innovations involving intensification through labour control to their relationships with retailers. Under pressure on ‘quality’, volume and price, growers are found to have ratcheted up the effort required from workers to achieve the minimum wage through reducing the rates paid for piece work, and in some cases to have changed the type of labour contractor they use to larger, more anonymous businesses. The paper calls for further, commodity-specific and spatially-aware research with a strong ethnographic component...|$|R
40|$|This paper collates {{the limited}} {{empirical}} evidence concerning illegal boat migrations into southern Europe, {{in order to}} identify the migrants' possible role in local, southern or European labour markets. Drawing upon my previous work, it is shown that immigration policies in southern Europe have exhibited a complex and varying mix of responses to non-legal migrations: the three policy instruments available are toleration, legalization and expulsion. Increasingly, the EU has been promoting expulsion as the major solution, and southern EU countries have become more interested in this policy instrument in recent years. However, the "learned" message to North Africa and beyond is clear: come as illegal migrants, and work is available for you. Essentially, the security paradigm of "Sieve Europe" contradicts much of Europe's labour market and demographic requirements: as of 2005, the EU has failed to conclude any meaningful policy texts on <b>managing</b> <b>immigration</b> into the territory, let alone enact policy. This incoherent approach puts the responsibility for immigration solely onto first state of arrival [e. g. Dublin Convention], whilst the concept of "burden-sharing" and refugees concerns only fiscal burdens. The paper concludes that the problem of non-legal immigration into the southern countries is the direct consequence of mismanagement of EU immigration policy, and can be solved only at the EU level...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} motivations and {{underpinnings}} of Irish immigration controls {{in the early}} twentieth century. The broader empirical and theoretical literature suggest that states develop immigration controls for particular domestic needs - the protection of the national population from the intrusion of outsiders. The thesis establishes that the controls introduced in the Irish Free State in 1935 were unusual in that they appear not to have addressed a specific need for to <b>manage</b> <b>immigration</b> to the Free State. They instead replicated other controls previously introduced in the United Kingdom, a state with rather different national circumstances, and from which the Irish Free State had seceded in 1922. The research approach developed for this study is an interdisciplinary methodology of historical sociology. Because of the necessary focus on the roles of structure and agency in the process of shaping Irish immigration controls, realist social theory is adopted as the macro-level social theory used to make historical particulars generalizable. Through a narrative case study method shaped by this methodology, the thesis examines the development of Irish immigration controls. It finds that the interaction between the particular political, economic and cultural contexts of the Irish Free State shaped the process of developing immigration controls. Nationalist politics undoubtedly played a role in their evolution, but in a very different way than suggested by the empirical theoretical literature. Immigration controls are not always about immigration...|$|R
