500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and {{do not know whether}} I will ever be. If I take a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E
500|$|Like its predecessor, {{the second}} {{deputation}} went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany. In Paris, where the 1878 Exposition Universelle was in progress, Kruger saw a hot air balloon {{for the first}} time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. [...] "High up in mid-air", he recalled, [...] "I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as we had gone so far, to take me all the way home." [...] The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal [...] "to remind <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> journey through the air". The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an open letter in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation.|$|E
500|$|Lobengula's {{weakened}} Matabele kingdom uneasily coexisted with Rhodes's Company {{settlements in}} Mashonaland {{and north of}} the Zambezi for about another year. The king was angered {{by the lack of}} respect he perceived Company officials to have towards his authority, their insistence that his kingdom was separated from Company territory by a line between the Shashe and Hunyani Rivers, and their demands that he stop the traditional raids on Mashona villages by Matabele impis. After Matabele warriors began slaughtering Mashonas near Fort Victoria in July 1893, Jameson, who Rhodes had appointed Company administrator in Mashonaland, unsuccessfully tried to stop the violence through an indaba. Lobengula complained that the Chartered Company had [...] "come not only to dig the gold but to rob <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> people and country as well". Monitoring events from Cape Town, Rhodes gauged Jameson's readiness for war by telegraph: [...] "Read Luke 14:31". Jameson wired back: [...] "All right. Have read Luke 14:31".|$|E

500|$|Edward {{continued}} {{to pay for}} the gardeners, insurance and upkeep of the fort in the initial years following his abdication, because it was his wish that he would return there. His possessions from the fort were transferred to the Château de la Croë in the south of France (where he had named the sitting room [...] "The Belvedere") in the spring of 1938, but many were damaged in transit. Edward was informed in March 1940 that the fort was no longer in his possession as his warrant to occupy the grace and favour residence had expired on the termination of his reign and was not to be renewed by the present sovereign, his brother, now George VI. Edward was greatly upset by this, writing in 1940 that [...] "It is crystal clear that this proposed reserving of the Fort by the use of Crown Lands {{is nothing more than a}} piece of bluff, and the first excuse that the king has been able to find to deprive <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> right to occupy the place should I ever desire to do so..." [...] Edward believed that the incident was an example of his 'brother's failure to keep his word to me' after the fort had apparently been reserved for him if he should reside once more in England.|$|E

The two decide that their friendship {{is more important than}} love and renounce their claims to her ("Though p'r'aps I may incur thy blame"). The Lord Chancellor arrives dressed for bed and describes a nightmare caused by his unrequited love for Phyllis ("Love, unrequited, robs <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> rest").

In The Dark Knight (2008), he tells the Joker [...] "We're not intimidated by thugs", to which the Joker replies, [...] "You know, you remind <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father. I hated my father." [...] In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), he defended {{the legacy of the}} Wayne family against attempts to usurp the company by industrialist John Daggett.

Imran watched me on TV, and actually came to the ground to watch the end of the game. The very next day, he met me and told me that I will be going to Sharjah next month. Just meeting Imran at the time was enough of an experience for me, but for him to notify <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> selection was just out of this world." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 May 2006, {{after the}} {{broadcast}} of the Zembla documentary, news stories appeared saying that Hirsi Ali was likely {{to move to the}} United States that September. She was reported to be planning to write a book entitled Shortcut to Enlightenment and to work for the American Enterprise Institute. On 16 May Hirsi Ali resigned from Parliament after admitting that she had lied on her asylum application. In a press conference she said that the facts had been publicly known since 2002, when they had been reported in the media and in one of her publications. She also restated her claim of seeking asylum to prevent a forced marriage, stating: [...] "How often do people who are seeking refuge provide different names? The penalty of stripping <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Dutch citizenship is disproportional." [...] Her stated reason for resigning immediately were the increasing media attention. Owing to the fact that a Dutch court had ruled in April 2006 that she had to leave her house by August 2006, she decided to relocate to the United States in September 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Donna Elvira {{arrives and}} thwarts the {{seduction}} ("" [...] – [...] "Flee from the traitor!"). She leaves with Zerlina. Don Ottavio and Donna Anna enter, plotting vengeance on the still unknown murderer of Donna Anna's father. Donna Anna, unaware {{that she is}} speaking to her attacker, pleads for Don Giovanni's help. Don Giovanni, relieved that he is unrecognised, readily promises it, and asks who has disturbed her peace. Before she can answer, Donna Elvira returns and tells Donna Anna and Don Ottavio that Don Giovanni is a false-hearted seducer. Don Giovanni tries to convince Don Ottavio and Donna Anna that Donna Elvira is insane (Quartet: [...] "" [...] – [...] "Don't trust him, oh sad one"). As Don Giovanni leaves, Donna Anna suddenly recognizes him as her father's murderer and tells Don Ottavio {{the story of his}} intrusion, claiming that she was deceived at first because she was expecting a night visit from Don Ottavio himself, but managed to fight Don Giovanni off after discovering the imposture (long recitative exchange between Donna Anna and Don Ottavio). [...] She repeats her demand that he avenge her and points out that he will be avenging himself as well (aria: [...] "Or sai chi l'onore Rapire a me volse" [...] – [...] "Now you know who wanted to rob <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> honour"). [...] Don Ottavio, not yet convinced (Donna Anna having only recognised Don Giovanni's voice, not seen his face), resolves {{to keep an eye on}} his friend ("" [...] – [...] "On her peace my peace depends").|$|E
2500|$|The textual {{motif of}} empire within Antony and Cleopatra has strong gendered and erotic undercurrents. Antony, the Roman soldier characterised {{by a certain}} effeminacy, is the main article of conquest, falling first to Cleopatra and then to Caesar (Octavius). Cleopatra's triumph over her lover is attested to by Caesar himself, who gibes that Antony [...] "is not more manlike/ Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy/ More womanly than he" [...] (1.4.5–7). That Cleopatra takes {{on the role of}} male aggressor in her {{relationship}} with Antony should not be surprising; after all, [...] "a culture attempting to dominate another culture will [...] endow itself with masculine qualities and the culture it seeks to dominate with feminine ones"—appropriately, the queen's romantic assault is frequently imparted in a political, even militaristic fashion. Antony's subsequent loss of manhood seemingly [...] "signifies his lost Romanness, and Act 3, Scene 10, is a virtual litany of his lost and feminised self, his [...] "wounder chance". Throughout the play, Antony is gradually bereaved of that Roman quality so coveted in his nostalgic interludes—by the centremost scenes, his sword (a plainly phallic image), he tells Cleopatra, has been [...] "made weak by his affection" [...] (3.11.67). In Act 4, Scene 14, [...] "an un-Romaned Antony" [...] laments, [...] "O, thy vile lady!/ She has robb'd <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sword," [...] (22–23)—critic Arthur L. Little Jr. writes that here [...] "he seems to echo closely the victim of raptus, of bride theft, who has lost the sword she wishes to turn against herself. By the time Antony tries to use his sword to kill himself, it amounts to little more than a stage prop". Antony is reduced to a political object, [...] "the pawn in a power game between Caesar and Cleopatra".|$|E

2500|$|The track [...] "Riding the Crest", {{named by}} Paul Waaktaar-Savoy as [...] "an electro-blues", is heavily {{inspired}} by Arcade Fire and their album Neon Bible. Being the principal songwriter on the album, Waaktaar-Savoy also got {{inspired by his}} changing surroundings, dividing his time between New York City and Oslo. [...] "“Shadowside“ feels quite Norwegian in the melody, the chords and the mood. [...] "The Bandstand" [...] reminds <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> first trip to New York City in the early '80s, before A-ha were famous. Songs are like a photo-album – they can really send you back. And this one reminds me of arriving at Port Authority with [...] in my pocket, sporting really high, yellow, almost see-through synthesizer-hair, wearing a tiger-shirt and a brown suit, looking like an alien!" [...] The title track, [...] "Foot of the Mountain" [...] – examines {{one of the fundamental}} conflicts of modern life, the pull between nature and big-city civilization: for Paul, the buzz of New York City versus the beauty and isolation of Norway: [...] "It's the dilemma of loving a city life, yet secretly wondering if we'd be happier being surrounded by open fields and sweeping mountains." [...] "Real Meaning" [...] is inspired by Waaktaar-Savoy calling home only to be greeted by his answering machine. The idea behind [...] "Start the Simulator" [...] was to make a heartfelt song using technical language: [...] "The basic idea was to make a song using only technical terms and phrases, and still make it very emotional and personal. There is such poetry in the old Apollo manuals: [...] "switch to Omni Bravo" [...] and [...] "the bright ejector blanket." [...] The latter should probably be [...] "ejecta blanket." ...|$|E
