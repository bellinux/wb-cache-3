40|$|We {{study how}} the {{introduction}} of a 2 -form <b>field</b> <b>flux</b> modify the dynamics of a T-duality invariant string gas cosmology model of Greene, Kabat and Marnerides. It induces a repulsive potential term in the effective action for the scale factor of the spacial dimensions. Without the 2 -form <b>field</b> <b>flux,</b> the universe fails to expand when the pressure due to string modes vanishes. With the presence of a homogeneous 2 -form <b>field</b> <b>flux,</b> it propels 3 spacial dimensions to grow into a macroscopic 4 dimensional space-time. We find that it triggers an expansion of a universe away from the oscillating phase around the self-dual radius. We also investigate the effects of a constant 2 -form field. We can obtain an expanding 4 dimensional space-time by tuning it at the critical value. Comment: 23 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the <b>field</b> <b>flux</b> in a small electronically commutated single-phase permanent magnet reluctance motor. Its structure is inherently three-dimensional. An analytical model is built so that an analysis of parameters can be easily conducted. With a first simple model, an optimum is found for the magnets' length that may permit to use disk-magnet technology. Yet, the value of the <b>field</b> <b>flux</b> lacks accuracy. In order to locate the main leakage fluxes, the finite element analysis is used on a bidimensional equivalent geometry. A second and satisfying analytical model is determined. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the model to fulfil analysis of parameters...|$|R
40|$|Anomalous cross <b>field</b> plasma <b>fluxes</b> {{induced by}} the {{electric}} field fluctuations has been evaluated in a rotating plasma with shear flow in a helical system. The plasma rotation frequency due to the radial electric field makes the Doppler frequency shift which does not explicity affect the cross <b>field</b> <b>flux.</b> The anomalous ion flux is evaluated by the ion curvature drift resonance continuum in the test particle model. The curvature drift resonance induces a new force term 2 ̆ 7 / which did not make large influence in the ion flux. The shear flow term in the anomalous flux combined with the electric <b>field</b> in neoclassical <b>flux</b> reduces to a first order differential equation which governs the radial profile of the electric field. A general exact analytical solution for the differential equation is derived and a simple approximate solution for the radial electric field is also given. Numerical {{results indicate that the}} shear flow effect is important for the anomalous cross <b>field</b> <b>flux</b> and for determination of the radial electric field particularly in the peripheral region...|$|R

[...] Figure E. shows compensation wires in the field pole face plate that are carrying current opposed to the current in the armature wire adjacent to the gap. The flux in the gap has been restored to the same condition as the case where there is no {{armature flux}}. Even though the armature wires are next to wires carrying current in the opposite direction, the wires of the armature still experience magnetic force from interaction with the <b>field</b> <b>flux.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{forecasting}} process {{starts with}} the last epoch of the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> derived from satellite and observatory data (i.e. 2014.5). For this time point, the secular variation and secular acceleration of the field are computed from the steady flow velocity and acceleration models. Equations 7 and 8 {{show that there is}} a dependence of the secular variation and secular acceleration on the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> itself. Hence, the process is non-linear and has to be stepped forwards at a suitably fine time resolution, in this case, 1 month (Beggan and Whaler 2010). Each month, a new set of matrices relating flow velocity and acceleration to secular variation and secular acceleration are computed based on the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> and secular variation coefficients. This generates a set of predicted secular variation and secular acceleration coefficients, which are added back to the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> coefficients to give the prediction of the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> for the following month. The Gauss coefficients of the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> were advected forward from 2014.5 to 2020.0. The coefficients of the average annual secular variation (in nT/year) were calculated from the difference of the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> models at 2020.0 and 2015.0, divided by 5 years.|$|R
40|$|Background. Desktop nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) units are useful for introducing students {{in a variety of}} disciplines to fundamental aspects of {{magnetic resonance}}. They also are useful for some research purposes. A significant portion of the cost, size and weight of desktop NMR units is the magnet. The configuration of the magnet design, including field gap size, shape, and magnetic <b>field</b> <b>flux</b> density, may place unneeded constraints upon experimenters and researchers who use iron permanent magnets or iron core electromagnets. Objective. The research goal was to devise lighter weight, more compact, and less expensive alternative magnet systems for desktop magnetic resonance systems. Methods. Arrays of low cost and versatile neodymium-ironboron magnets both without and with iron or steel backing were studied by making Hall probe gauss meter measurements. Theoretical calculations of <b>field</b> <b>flux</b> density at individual points and computer generated field line plots were made using commercial software. Results. Flux densities from 0. 1 to 0. 6 Tesla were obtained using low cost and light weight arrays of these magnets. Some arrays gave noticeably better field homogeneity than others as determined by directional <b>field</b> <b>flux</b> density plots. Conclusion. Neodymium-iron-boron magnet arrays show promise for greater use in desktop magnetic resonance applications. Grants. Supported by NSU faculty research grant...|$|R
3000|$|It is {{well known}} that in {{long-term}} <b>main</b> <b>field</b> models such as gufm 1 the field at the core surface is determined by downward continuation of the surface field through the source-free mantle (e.g., Parker 1994). Thus, the surface field constituents highlighted in previous studies by Demetrescu and Dobrica (2005, 2014) and Dobrica et al. (2013) are expected {{to be found in the}} field at the core surface as well. In this paper we focus on the detailed structure of the radial <b>field</b> <b>flux</b> patches given by the sub-centennial constituent in gufm 1 as we analyze its morphology, spatial–temporal characteristics and traveling speeds at core surface.

30|$|The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) is a {{model of}} the {{geomagnetic}} <b>main</b> <b>field</b> and its secular variation, produced every 5 years from candidate models proposed by a number of international research institutions. For this 12 th generation IGRF, three candidate models were solicited: a <b>main</b> <b>field</b> model for the 2010.0 epoch, a <b>main</b> <b>field</b> model for the 2015.0 epoch, and the predicted secular variation for the five-year period 2015 to 2020. The National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has produced three candidate models for consideration in IGRF- 12. The 2010 <b>main</b> <b>field</b> candidate was produced from Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite data, while the 2015 <b>main</b> <b>field</b> and secular variation candidates were produced from Swarm and Ørsted satellite data. Careful data selection was performed to minimize the influence of magnetospheric and ionospheric fields. The secular variation predictions of our parent models, from which the candidate models were derived, have been validated against independent ground observatory data.|$|R
