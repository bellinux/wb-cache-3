O experimento foi realizado em dois reatores anaerÃbios de leito fixo e fluxo ascendente. Como meio suporte foram utilizadas hastes de bambu e aparas de polietileno de baixa densidade. Confeccionados em pexiglass, cada reator foi construÃdo com 75 cm de altura, o volume Ãtil calculado foi de 2, 96 L para o reator com suporte de bambu e 3, 13 L para o reator com suporte de polietileno. O inÃculo, coletado em um reator anaerÃbio piloto, recebeu prÃ-tratamento tÃrmico e foi recirculado nos reatores por 48 h. Em seguida, iniciou-se a alimentaÃÃo em modo contÃnuo. O sistema foi operado com tempo de detenÃÃo hidrÃulica (TDH) de 4 e 3 h, a 36 ÂC e pH inicial 6, 0. No TDH de 4 h foram aplicadas 3 cargas orgÃnicas volumÃtricas (COV) de 28; 15 e 26 g. L- 1. d- 1; no TDH de 3 h foram aplicadas 4 COV de 35; 22; 22 e 27 g. L- 1. d- 1. A aplicaÃÃo das COV nÃo seguiu a um padrÃo devido Ã variabilidade na constituiÃÃo da Ãgua residuÃria. Dessa forma, foram avaliados os efeitos do TDH, da COV e do suporte sobre a produÃÃo fermentativa de hidrogÃnio e tambÃm a influÃncia do bambu e do polietileno de baixa densidade na fixaÃÃo e seleÃÃo dos micro-organismos produtores de hidrogÃnio. A produÃÃo mÃxima de hidrogÃnio no reator com bambu foi de 2, 9 L. d- 1 em TDH 4 h e de 2, 2 L. d- 1 no reator com polietileno em TDH de 3 h.

Attempting to {{associate}} waste treatment {{to the production}} of clean and renewable energy, the present research aimed to evaluate the biological production of hydrogen using wastewater from the <b>manioc</b> <b>starch</b> treatment industry, a liquid wastewater of high organic content, generated during the processes of extraction and purification of <b>manioc</b> <b>starch.</b> The experiment was carried out in two upflow fixed-bed anaerobic reactors. As support, bamboo stems and low density polyethylene scraps. Made with pexiglass, each reactor was built with 75 cm of height, with 2. 96 L of useful volume for the reactor with bamboo support and 3. 13 L for the one with Polyethylene support. The inoculum, collected in a pilot anaerobic reactor, received thermal pretreatment and was recirculated in the reactors for 48 h. Then, alimentation was initiated in a continuum manner. The system was operated with hydraulic detention time (TDH) of 4 and 3 h, at 36 ÂC and initial pH of 6. 0. In the TDH of 4 h, 3 organic loading rates were applied (COV), of 28; 15 and 26 g. L- 1. d- 1; in the TDH of 3 h 4 COV were applied, of 35; 22; 22 and 27 g. L- 1. d- 1. The application of the COV did not follow any particular pattern due to the variability of the wastewater constitution. Hence, the effects of TDH, COV and the support mean on the production of hydrogen were evaluated, as well as the influence of bamboo and of low density polyethylene in the fixation and selection of microorganisms that produce hydrogen. Maximum hydrogen production in the reactor using bamboo was of 2. 9 L. d- 1 in TDH 4 h and of 2. 2 L. d- 1 in the reactor using polyethylene in TDH of 3 h.

40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo {{investigar}} a influência do tamanho das partículas do material pulverulento sobre a força de adesão partícula substrato, utilizando a técnica centrífuga para diferentes velocidades de compressão e desprendimento. Uma microcentrífuga (MA 860, Marconi Equipamentos), cuja velocidade máxima de rotação é de 14000 rpm, foi o equipamento utilizado no desenvolvimento dos experimentos laboratoriais juntamente com um programa de análise de imagens (Image-Pro Plus 3. 0). Para a realização dos experimentos foram especialmente construídos dois tubos e instalados junto ao cabeçote da microcentrífuga. Nesses tubos são colocados os adaptadores cuja finalidade é de sustentar os discos de prova contendo o material pulverulento. A velocidade centrífuga é gerada para promover a compressão (Press-on) ou o desprendimento (Spin-off) das partículas sobre a superfície dos discos. Após a contagem das partículas inicialmente aderidas na superfície, os discos retornam para a microcentrífuga para se fazer o desprendimento destas partículas, também em diferentes velocidades de rotação. Após cada aumento da velocidade rotacional, o número de partículas aderidas na superfície dos discos foi monitorado. A influência das forças aplicadas na adesão do concentrado fosfático (&# 961; = 3, 066 g/cm 3 e dp = 14, 91 m), polvilho doce (&# 961; = 1, 491 g/cm 3 e dp = 4, 93 m) e do calcário dolomítico (&# 961; = 2, 838 g/cm 3 e dp = 11, 97 m) sobre um substrato de aço inoxidável foi investigado usando a técnica centrífuga. As faixas de diâmetro estudadas para esses materiais particulados foram de 10 17 m, 17 24 m e 24 31 m. As partículas de cada pó foram inicialmente pressionadas sobre a superfície do substrato centrifugado a uma velocidade particular, e imediatamente depois desta fase, o perfil de adesão foi determinado. Todos os pós obedeceram uma distribuição log-normal de porcentagem de partículas aderidas em relação a força de adesão. Foi obtida a força de adesão mediana geométrica para todos os pós e verificou-se que houve um aumento linear com a força de compressão aplicada preliminarmente. Para partículas polidispersas aderidas a uma superfície, a força necessária para separar as partículas varia proporcionalmente ao seu tamanho. E a força de adesão entre partículas dos três materiais pulverulentos utilizados nos experimentos, e a superfície do disco de aço inoxidável aumentou com o aumento do tamanho das partículas e com o aumento da força de compressão (press-on). A ordem de aderência indicou a seguinte relação: polvilho doce > calcário dolomítico > concentrado fosfático. The present work {{is dedicated}} to the investigation of the influence of particles size of the powdery material on the adhesion force of particle-substrate, using the centrifugal technique for different compression speeds and detachment. A centrifuge (MA - 860, Marconi Equipamentos), with maximum speed of rotation 14000 rpm, was used in the adhesion experiments and also a program of analysis of images (Image-Pro Plus 3. 0). For the experiments development, two tubes were specially builded and installed in the headstock of the centrifuge. Inside of those tubes there are two adapters placed with the purpose to stand the proof disks containing the powdery material. The centrifugal force speed is generated to promote the compression (Press-on) or the detachment (Spin-off) of the particles {{on the surface of the}} disks. After the count of the particles initially stuck on the surface, the disks were returned back in the centrifuge to proceed the detachment of the particles, using different rotation speeds. After each increase of the rotational speed, the number of particles stuck on the surface of the disks is monitored. The centrifugal speed will exceed above of the adhesion force between the particle and the surface. At equilibrium, the magnitude of the centrifugal force applied equals the adhesion force. The influence of the applied forces in the adhesion of the phosphatic concentrate (&# 961; = 3, 066 g/cm 3 and dp = 14, 91 m), the <b>manioc</b> <b>starch</b> (&# 961; = 1, 491 g/cm 3 and dp = 4, 93 m) and the dolomite limestone (&# 961; = 2, 838 g/cm 3 and dp = 11, 97 m) on a substratum of stainless steel was investigated using the centrifugal technique. The range diameter studied for those particulate materials were of 10 - 17 m, 17 - 24 m and 24 - 31 m. The particles of each powder were pressed initially on the surface of the substratum centrifuged to a private speed, and immediately after this phase, the adhesion profile was determined. All the powders obeyed a log-normal distribution of percentage of particles stuck in relation to adhesion force. It was obtained the force of geometric medium adhesion for all the powders and it was verified that there was a lineal increase with the force of compression applied initially. For polydisperse particles stuck on a surface, the necessary force to separate the particles varies proportionally to your size. And the adhesion force among particles of the three powdery materials, used in the experiments, and the surface of the disk of stainless steel increased with the increase of the size of the particles and with the increase of the compression force (press-on). the order of adherence indicated the following relationship: <b>manioc</b> <b>starch</b> > dolomite limestone > phosphatic concentrate...|$|E
