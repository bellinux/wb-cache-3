40|$|The paper {{puts the}} outcome {{during the most}} recent {{financial}} crisis in a historical perspective by taking {{a closer look at}} the frequency of extreme events in the economic history of Denmark, in some cases based on time series back to the late 1600 s. We focus on the frequency distribution of a range of key <b>macro-financial</b> <b>risk</b> factors that are commonly believed to be important drivers of credit risks and market risks faced by financial institutions. We suggest that marginal historical distributions of <b>macro-financial</b> <b>risk</b> factors might serve as inspiration for design of sensitivity tests and "worst case" scenarios in risk management and macro stress tests...|$|E
40|$|Rapid credit growth, {{short-term}} capital inflows, {{and associated}} <b>macro-financial</b> <b>risks</b> {{in the aftermath}} of the global crisis necessitated the use of alternative policy instruments in Turkey. Accordingly, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has designed and adopted a new policy mix to incorporate financial stability into the inflation targeting framework by utilizing several complementary instruments. This study assesses the new policy strategy implemented by the CBRT. First we introduce the main structure of the new policy and explain how and for what purpose each instrument is used. We then elaborate on the communication strategy and assess the initial impact of the implementation. Although it is too early to draw firm conclusions, initial results so far suggest that a policy mix of lower policy rate, wider interest rate corridor, combined with higher reserve requirement ratios may serve as an appropriate strategy in dealing with short term capital inflows, especially in countries with current account deficits.

40|$|We analyze empirically {{the role}} played by energy {{inflation}} as a determinant of downward corrections in house prices. Using a dataset for 18 OECD economies spanning the last four decades, we identify periods of downward house price adjustment and estimate conditional logit models to measure the effect of energy inflation on the probability of these house price corrections after controlling for other relevant macroeconomic variables. Our results give strong evidence that increases in energy price inflation raise the probability of such corrective periods taking place. This phenomenon could be explained by various channels: through the adverse effects of energy prices on economic activity and income reducing the demand for housing; through the particular impact on construction and operation costs and their effects on the supply and demand of housing; through the reaction of monetary policy on inflation withdrawing liquidity and further reducing demand; through improving attractiveness of commodity versus housing investment on asset markets; or through a lagging impact of common factors on both variables, such as economic growth. Our results contribute {{to the understanding of the}} pass-through of oil price shocks to financial markets and imply that energy price inflation should serve as a leading indicator for the analysis of <b>macro-financial</b> <b>risks.</b> (authors' abstract...|$|R
40|$|Although global {{financial}} stability in late 2010 and early 2011 has, in general, improved {{when compared to}} the 2008 - 2009 period of the sub-prime {{global financial}} crisis, vulnerabilities remain high. The recent World Economic Outlook of the IMF (WEO, September 2011) underlines the two speed recovery processes taking place in the world economies. In advanced economies, especially those hit hardest by the crisis, firms, government and household sectors continue to be heavily indebted and are likely to spur relatively weak demand. Although the financial markets of these economies have, in most parts, returned to profitability, the overall frail balance sheets reflect the general subdued state of the local economy. In sharp contrast, the emerging economies, including those of the SEACEN region, are posting robust growth rates until the second half of 2011, meeting new challenges associated with strong demand, rapid credit and excess liquidity. Price pressures, including potential asset price bubbles, have been the common themes of policy challenges for the SEACEN economies. Managing <b>macro-financial</b> <b>risks,</b> namely balancing growth, balance sheet soundness of the financial institutions, particularly the banking sector, and keeping a lid on inflationary pressures, have been and will likely be the primary policy challenges for these emerging markets in 2011 and 2012. This paper takes stock of recent trends and developments with regard to capital flows in the SEACEN economies. It elaborates in detail, the breakdowns and compositions of the flows. In particular, the focus of the analyses is on key flows such as the international bank lending activities to the region. The paper also summarises and analyses some of the basic push and pull factors of these flows to understand some of the domestic and external drivers of these flows. Some of the economic consequences of these capital flows and policy dilemma facing the SEACEN economies are also looked at. The paper also examines the policy responses of the central banks/monetary authorities, in particular, to mitigate the negative consequences and maximise the benefits of capital flows. ...|$|R
40|$|The credit {{crisis and}} its {{transformation}} into a sovereign debt crisis have illustrated the limited {{character of the}} traditional macro financial politics. The financial crisis {{has shown that the}} priority of price stability does not guarantee macroeconomic stability. Revision of the goals and objectives of the monetary and credit policy is being carried out in many countries. In order to ensure macroeconomic stability, central banks have to use new instruments considering financial stability as an additional object. Since 2009 the IMF recommends central banks to use macro-prudential instruments for reducing <b>macro-financial</b> <b>risks</b> and imbalances in the financial system structure. The effectiveness of macro-prudential policy depends on its calibration with the monetary and credit policy. The growth of financial imbalances in the first decade after the adoption of the euro, presence of contradictory fiscal policies, deployment of a spiral of rapid crediting and price inflation have led to apraxia in the monetary and credit policy, and fiscal policy was limited by institutional arrangements. Accumulating funds during the budget surplus the countries-members of the European Monetary System (EMS) attempted to reduce asymmetric shocks. The priority of price stability in the EMS had been achieved but the economies of these countries suffered from financial imbalances. Macro-prudential policy is aimed at prevention and mitigation of systemic risk, plays a significant role in reforming the new policy of central banks. That is why European countries are developing new methods and an institutional framework for the implementation of a new macro-prudential policy. Problems of structural arbitration and the possibility of emergence of new financial imbalances in the EMS are becoming increasingly real. The flow of financial capitals and financial institutions to more lenient jurisdictions is connected with the establishment of macro-prudential policy. The macro-prudential policy of central banks has been considered, financial imbalances of the EMS since 1999 have been analyzed, the main macro-prudential instruments have been described and EMS countries that had implemented these instruments have been considered. The efficiency of using the main macro-prudential instruments in the extrapolation at mitigating symptoms of systemic risk has been analyzed. The directions of the interaction between macro-prudential and monetary and credit policy in the EMU have been identified. The problem of macro-prudential migration, which may cause a new threat of financial asymmetry in the EMU has been considered...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{framework}} to assess financial system risk. Using a dynamic factor framework based on state-space methods, we construct coincident measures (‘thermometers’) and a forward looking indicator for {{the likelihood of}} simultaneous failure {{of a large number}} of financial intermediaries. The indicators are based on latent <b>macro-financial</b> and credit <b>risk</b> components for a large data set comprising the U. S., the EU- 27 area, and the respective rest of the world. Credit risk conditions can significantly and persistently de-couple from macro-financial fundamentals. Such decoupling can serve as an early warning signal for macro-prudential policy.

40|$|The International Banking and Finance Institute (IBFI) of the Banque de France {{organised}} {{its sixth}} International Monetary Seminar {{on the subject}} of “Credit risk management and financial stability” from 7 to 11 June 2004. This seminar, opened by Governor Christian Noyer, brought together forty five representatives from central banks in developed and emerging countries and from international organisations (such as the Bank for International Settlements and the European Central Bank), as well as twenty speakers from central banks, international institutions and the private sector. The first two days of the seminar were devoted to conferences on: • risks and sources of macro-financial vulnerability, the latest developments on credit risk transfer markets and the presentation of the findings of the cross-sectoral survey on credit derivatives in France; • the technical, financial and legal aspects of securitisation and credit risk management; • the presentation of the French and European experiences with respect to the role of central banks in rating companies and their contribution to financial stability; • bad debts and their impact on financial stability (case of Japan); • Basel II, a prudential framework which better reflects credit risk, and the effect of ratings on market dynamics; • lastly, the <b>macro-financial</b> consequences of <b>risk</b> transfers from the perspective of financial interdependence. Over the next two days, participants attended two workshops on the subjects of “Basel II, credit risk provisioning and accounting standards” and “Credit risk management and its macro-financial consequences”. These gave rise to intensive and fruitful discussions on the following four points: 1. identification of the sources of risk or financial vulnerability 2. credit risk assessment 3. credit risk management 4. implications for economic policy This article summarises the debates held in the workshops and the round table discussions on the last day. ...|$|R
