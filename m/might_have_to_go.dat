Reviewing Chori Chori Chupke Chupke for Hindustan Times, Vinayak Chakravorty noted that [...] "there is an admirable zest that Preity pumps into every role she does". Farhan Akhtar, who directed her in two movies, believes she is an actress who [...] "can mould herself—the way she speaks, works and her body language—and adapt herself to roles," [...] while Vidhu Vinod Chopra (director of Mission Kashmir) credits her {{with the ability to}} [...] "make the viewer believe even in the most convoluted situation." [...] In a review of Salaam Namaste, Australian film critic Jake Wilson observed, [...] "While Preity Zinta isn't the subtlest actress, she's quite a comedienne– for a Hollywood equivalent to her combination of beauty, high-strung emotion and facial gymnastics you <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Natalie Wood." [...] American critic Derek Elley considers her to be [...] "one of Bollywood's best pure actresses." ...|$|E
500|$|After the war {{he wrote}} that the attack by the 7th Armoured Division should have succeeded and that his doubts about Bucknall and Erskine {{increased}} and that they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Dempsey called {{the handling of the}} battle a disgrace and said that the decision to withdraw [...] was made by the corps commander and Erskine. Carlo D'Este called Dempsey's comments [...] "excessively harsh" [...] but historians generally support them, suggesting that a great opportunity to swiftly capture Caen had been squandered by Bucknall.John Buckley wrote that Bucknall was not ready to support the attack once problems developed and that Erskine was not capable of mastering the situation. Lionel Ellis wrote that the result was [...] "disappointing" [...] but that the fighting power of the Panzer-Lehr Division and with the unexpected arrival of the 2nd Panzer Division, the 7th Armoured Division [...] "could hardly have achieved full success". Michael Reynolds wrote that the 2nd Panzer Division tanks were nowhere near Villers-Bocage. Hubert Meyer wrote that Operation Perch failed because the 50th Northumbrian Division and its armoured brigade could not overcome the Panzer-Lehr-Division, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attack in the east of the bridgehead failed and because of the rapid counter-attack by advanced elements of the 2nd Panzer Division.|$|E

[...] "The sight of your uniform calls forth all our gratitude. My three sons enlisted in our German Navy. For four years they have been at Kiel, comfortably fed, playing dominos. They are now at home all safe and happy. Had your brave navy relaxed its vigilance for a moment those boys <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out on the sea, a thing they had never done.

60|$|Jenny had {{no better}} means of {{justification}} {{than the last}} apology to which her sex trust, and usually not in vain; she pressed her handkerchief to her face, sobbed with great vehemence, and either wept, or managed, as Halliday <b>might</b> <b>have</b> said, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the motions wonderfully well.|$|R
60|$|At {{a general}} council of officers, Sammy and Captain Hubbell both {{declared}} {{that they were}} not willing to take any other path homeward except one which led along the seventieth line of longitude.

60|$|But {{she had to}} put up with it, and {{to think}} of it. She had sense enough to know that she was no more than a {{stranger}} in her aunt's family, and that she must go if she made herself unpleasant to them. She was aware that hitherto she had not succeeded with her residence among them. Perhaps she <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Some things she would bear, and in them she would endeavour to amend her conduct. In other matters she would hold her own, and go, if necessary. Though her young imagination was still full of her unsubstantial hero,--though she still had her castles in the air altogether incapable of terrestrial foundation,--still there was a common sense about her which told her that she must give and take. She would endeavour to submit herself to her aunt. She would be kind,--as she had always been kind,--to Gertrude. She would in all matters obey her uncle. Her misfortune with the Newfoundland dog had almost dwindled out of her mind. To Augusta she could not submit herself. But then Augusta, as soon as the next session of Parliament should be over, would be married out of the way. And, on her own part, she did think that her aunt was inclined to take her part in the quarrel with Augusta.|$|E
60|$|Henery Walker wouldn't {{listen to}} 'em, and {{he jumped up}} and carried on like a madman.

They wouldn't 'ear of it at fust, but arter Smith 'ad pointed out that they <b>might</b> <b>'ave</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> jail with Henery, and said things about 'is license, they gave way.

6000|$|Darkness now fell, {{the wind}} howled, and torrents of rain poured upon them.

6000|$|... "When I left you, Phil, I {{felt much}} more anxious than I {{wanted to let}} you see. I had no idea where to go. I knew there were no houses along our trail and I <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> clean back to the tepees--fifteen miles bareback. I didn't dare try any other trail, for I knew nothing of them and wasn't sure that there were even tepees on them. But when I had gone about six miles I saw a welcome sight--nothing less than a spiral of blue, homely-looking smoke curling up from the prairie far off to my right. I decided to turn off and investigate. I rode two miles and finally I came to a little log shack. There was a bee-yew-tiful big horse in a corral close by. My heart jumped with joy. But suppose the inmates of the shack were half-breeds! You can't realize how {{relieved}} I felt when the door opened and two white men came out. In a few minutes everything was explained. They knew who I was and what I wanted, and I knew that they were Mr. Lonsdale and Mr. Hopkins, owners of a big ranch over by Deer Run. They were 'shacking out' to put up some hay and Mrs. Hopkins was keeping house for them. She wanted me to stop and have a cup of tea right off, but I thought of you, Phil, and declined. As soon as they heard of our predicament those lovely men got their two biggest horses and came right with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|This, of course, did not tend to mollify {{the spirit}} of the man to whom it was written, or to make him gracious towards his wife. He {{received}} the letter three weeks before the lodgings at Dovercourt were given up,--but during these three weeks he was very little at the place, and when there did not mention the letter. On these occasions he said nothing about business, but satisfied himself with giving strict injunctions as to economy. Then he took her back to town on the day after her promise to Mrs. Parker that she would [...] "try." [...] Mrs. Parker had told her that no woman ought to be afraid to speak to her husband, and, if necessary, to speak roundly on such subjects. Mrs. Parker was certainly not a highly educated lady, but she had impressed Emily with an admiration for her practical good sense and proper feeling. The lady who was a lady had begun to feel that in the troubles of her life she might find a much less satisfactory companion than the lady who was not a lady. She would do as Mrs. Parker had told her. She would not be afraid. Of course it was right that she should speak on such a matter. She knew herself to be an obedient wife. She had borne all her unexpected sorrows without a complaint, with a resolve that she would bear all for his sake,--not because she loved him, but because she had made herself his wife. Into whatever calamities he might fall, she would share them. Though he should bring her utterly into the dirt, she would remain in the dirt with him. It seemed probable to her that it might be so,--that they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the dirt;--and if it were so, she would still be true to him. She had chosen to marry him, and she would be his true wife. But, as such, she would not be afraid of him. Mrs. Parker had told her that [...] "a woman should never be afraid of 'em," [...] and she believed in Mrs. Parker. In this case, too, it was clearly her duty to speak,--for the injury being done was terrible, and might too probably become tragical. How could she endure to think of that woman and her children, should she come to know that the husband of the woman and the father of the children had been ruined by her husband? ...|$|E

6000|$|Not at home! Where {{was he to}} be found?
