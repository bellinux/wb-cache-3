It is unknown whether any Ju 87s were built from parts unofficially after December 1944 and the end of production.|$|E

Walter convinces Broyles to move the device to Liberty Island to reduce the area affected by the strange events. During this time, Peter wakes with confused memories and leaves the hospital, traveling to a location in New York City and buying a silver dollar coin from a pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|The London and South Western Railway {{arrived in}} 1839 from London, {{and within a}} year it was {{extended}} to Winchester and Southampton. In 1848 a rival company, sponsored by the Great Western Railway built a branch from Reading. In 1854 a line was built to Salisbury by the London and South Western. In the 19th century Basingstoke began to move into industrial manufacture, Wallis and Haslam (later Wallis & Steevens), began producing agricultural equipment including threshing <b>machines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1850s, moving into the production of stationary steam engines in the 1860s and then traction engines in the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{began in}} August 2000, when John Purnell, director {{of security for}} Tesco, the United Kingdom's largest supermarket chain, was telephoned by a newsagent in Bournemouth, Dorset, who had discovered a copy of an extortion letter left on his shop's photocopier. The letter demanded that Tesco give away Clubcards, modified for use in cash <b>machines,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bournemouth Daily Echo. Over the following days, Dorset Police received two other letters, threatening to send bombs to Tesco customers if the demands were not met.|$|E
5|$|While Russia {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{consumers}} of alcohol per capita in the world, the use of non-traditional surrogate alcohols rapidly rose in the 2010s due to ongoing economic difficulties in Russia. With a price far below that of government-regulated vodka, surrogates reached an estimated height of twenty percent of the country's alcohol consumption by 2016. These products were often nearly pure alcohol that could be diluted to a rough approximation of vodka, and were frequently available at all hours via strategically placed vending <b>machines.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Irkutsk incident, the victims drank scented bath lotion that was mislabeled as containing drinkable ethanol.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the 1940s because World WarII created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw injection machine, which allowed much more precise control over the speed of injection {{and the quality of}} articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection, so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected. Today, screw injection machines account {{for the vast majority of}} all injection <b>machines.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted injection moulding process, which permitted the production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste.|$|E

5|$|With Petre {{on active}} duty, Harrison {{took on the}} main {{responsibility}} for providing basic flying training to the pilots {{of the first three}} squadrons to be formed in Australia for overseas service. Many of his students would go on to play a prominent role in the future Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), including Bill Anderson, Harry Cobby, Adrian Cole, Frank McNamara, Lawrence Wackett, and Henry Wrigley. Having graduated twenty-four new pilots by the end of 1915, Harrison was able to establish the first AFC squadron, designated No.67 (Australian) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps; it was however commonly known as No.1 Squadron AFC from its inception, and officially so from 1January 1918. The unit departed for Egypt in March 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel E.H. Reynolds. Nos. 3 and 4 Squadrons AFC were formed at Point Cook in late 1916 to operate in France following advanced training in England. In addition to his instructional and administrative duties, Harrison put his mechanical abilities to use initiating the building of aero engines in Australia and maintaining the CFS's complement of airframes; according to Wackett, only Harrison had the skill to keep the obsolescent <b>machines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. He was appointed officer-in-charge of CFS in June 1917 with the temporary rank of major; this was made permanent in September 1918. The CFS was disbanded at Point Cook on 31December 1919.|$|E

25|$|Inoue did not patent his {{invention}} {{and so did}} not directly profit from the invention that started a booming industry.
