40|$|As a {{discourse}} genre, statements of purpose {{are characterized by}} their occluded status in the academy and by their hybrid nature. Statements of purpose are required in applications for a place in a postgraduate course (master’s degree or doctorate) and they are requested to obtain information about the academic and professional background and skills of each applicant. A study of the genre's linguistic and textual features is needed in Spanish to discover and understand writers’ and readers’ perception of this genre. A corpus of 50 <b>motivation</b> <b>letters</b> in Spanish is analyzed here. We study the distinguishing macro and microtextual features of this particular genre and cooccurrences between both kinds of features. At the macrotextual level, statements of purpose display prototypical rhetorical moves, which can be classified as writer’s moves and reader’s moves. On the microtextual level, modalization resources and discourse markers are discussed. This multiple/nperspectives analysis of the corpus shows evidence of significant cooccurrences between modalization, discourse markers and rhetorical moves.

40|$|Knudsen's {{pioneering}} {{experimental and}} theoretical work performed {{more than a}} century ago pointed to the fact that the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) paradigm is inapplicable to compressible gases at Knudsen numbers (Kn) beyond the continuum range, namely to noncontinua. However, in the case of continua, wherein Kn approaches zero asymptotically, it is nevertheless (implicitly) assumed in the literature that the compressible NSF equations remain applicable. Surprisingly, this belief appears never to have been critically tested; rather, most tests of the viability of the NSF equations for continuum flows have, to date, effectively been limited to incompressible fluids, namely liquids. Given that bivelocity hydrodynamic theory has recently raised fundamental questions about the validity of the NSF equations for compressible continuum gas flows, we deemed it worthwhile to test the validity of the NSF paradigm for the case of continua. Although our proposed NSF test does not, itself, depend upon the correctness of the bivelocity model that spawned the test, the latter provided <b>motivation.</b> This <b>Letter</b> furnishes molecular dynamics (MD) simulation evidence showing, contrary to current opinion, that the NSF equations are not, in fact, applicable to compressible gaseous continua, nor, presumably, either to compressible liquids. Importantly, this conclusion regarding NSF's inapplicability to continua, is shown to hold independently of the viability of the no-slip boundary condition applied to fluid continua, thus separating the issue of the correctness of the NSF differential equations from that of the tangential velocity boundary condition to be imposed upon these equations when seeking their solution. Finally, the MD data are shown to be functionally consistent with the bivelocity model that spawned the present study. Comment: 12 pages, 2 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

The data of the <b>motivation</b> <b>letter,</b> the questionnaire and the interview have been used to track the interest development of the students and to identify the differences and possible boundaries between the contexts. Five themes regarding the differences have been identified: (1) modules, (2) organization, (3) scale, (4) teachers, (5) students. None of the students reported that the differences are experienced as boundaries. They do not consider the programmes connected, but did not report this as troublesome.

40|$|The {{clients of}} the social {{institution}} called "Dům na půli cesty" are young people who spent part of their life in an orphanage, educational institution, or they are leaving an imprisonment, {{or some kind of}} protective treatment. These people were separated from common life in society from different reasons which makes their comeback complicated. Such people usually live on the margin of society and this brings many problems. The ex-prisoners often start over commiting crimes and the young people from the educational institution often start to behave in a socio-pathological way to meet their needs. The goal of "Dům na půli cesty" is to help these people to integrate into the society and provide them with support and a place to stay for some time. The attention is paid to the young people that have expiated a punishment, with focus on factors that may play a role on the way of an individual to prison. Most attention is paid to the institutional education because most of the clients come from such institutions. It describes the conditions from which the children are placed in the institutional education. This work deals with the essential function of family as a key driver and tries to show the issue of integration in the society after leaving the institution. A specific example of "Dům na půli cesty" is described in the practical part of the research. The whole chapter is focused on the function of this institution in Český Krumlov. It describes the work of the employees who are almost indispensable here. Services and connected demands that are provided here are described as well. The main goal of this research is to describe the role of "Dům na půli cesty" in the system of integration young people into the society through monitoring of the activity of the chosen institution. It also tries to find out the view of the clients on the help provided there and on the degree of motivating the clients to get integrated in independent life. The research was focused on gathering answer on the research question: What particular actions done by "Dům na půli cesty" in Český Krumlov support the independence of the clients? A qualitative research was conducted to get the required information. This was achieved by the method of questioning, more specifically using the technique of half- structured interview. The interviews were conducted with seven clients of the "Dům na půli cesty" v Českém Krumlově. Records of these interviews were taken and rewritten with the permission of the communicating partners. The method of coding was used as well. The results were processed by the clustering method. The results of the interviews show that the clients of "Dům na půli cesty" in Český Krumlov are young people missing good family background who got in a difficult life situation which they cannot deal with on their own. Their biggest problems are: insufficient funds and inability of communication. The financial problems are mainly caused not only by the lack of education connected with unemployment, but also the absence of any money management. The inability of communication with the surroundings is connected mainly with the fact that these people were not given the chance to acquire such ability in the institution. "Dům na půli cesty" tries to help dealing with these problems. The clients see the provided help positively, they find this service necessary and are satisfied with it overall. This research highlights the problem connected with the location of the "Dům na půli cesty" in Český Krumlov. The main aims of the clients are: independence, finishing the studies and learning how to use money effectively. The independence of the clients is supported by these arrangements: <b>motivation</b> <b>letters,</b> duties, individual planning and supporting interviews. The acquired data will serve as a tool for improving the quality of the services in this institution. It will help to understand the life situation of clients of "Dům na půli cesty"...|$|R

Common reasons for declining were clustered into lack of technology literacy or access, condition severity, or fear of costs associated with losing the device. Analysis of follow-up interviews after 4 weeks of use indicated that while participants found the monitoring devices practical and informative, only a minority (n = 4) were using the system in full. Crucially, the system element most aligned with contemporary theories of motivation (the online portal) was not used as expected. In addition, feedback from exercise referral professionals indicated that there were demands for support from clients, which might be mitigated by more effective independent system use. Recommendations for larger scale trials using similar systems include consideration of targeted patient groups, equity of access, and providing adequate technological support that is currently beyond the capacity of the NERS system...|$|R

The thesis investigates how young people reflect transitions and life-course in their motivation letters at the moment they are applying to a university. The thesis examines how applicants are categorizing a competent social policy student, how they are representing it in their motivation letters, {{what kind of an}} image they create in their motivation letters, and how do they take up a position in that model they have created. This research is a case study. It is based on a data collected from 16 motivation letters from 2008 and 2010 from young applicants applying for the Comparative Social Policy and Welfare – programme, both to the University of Tampere and Johannes Kepler Universität.   Categorical analysis is the method for the analysis. The main findings were that applicants categorize a competent social policy student to be someone who has social ideas and ideals. In addition, a competent student is someone whose personal trajectories, such as life course or individual choices, will affect the competent social policy student.   Furthermore, they are creating an image of a competent social policy student, who has good language skills and a lot of international experience. In addition, they are creating an image of an active student.   Finally, they create an image of a competent student who is interested about other cultures and societies. Motivation letters are one way to test the motivation of a student to study in a certain programme. Although, as the competition between students is brutal and they might exaggerate themselves in their letters. In addition, after getting accepted to the programme, they might realize how expensive it is to study abroad and decide not to take the position.   Furthermore, the <b>motivation</b> <b>letter</b> only tests the motivation while applying, as when the studies start the motivation might be something very different.

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} called The Employment of Clients of the Halfway House. The {{theoretical}} part {{consists of three}} areas which describe the services of the Halfway House, the characteristics of its clients and also the possibilities of searching work. The practical part {{is focused on the}} research itself, used methodology, obtained results and discussion. The Halfway House is oriented on young people till they are 26 years old and who leave state school facilities for institutional protective upbringing once they reach a legal age. The other groups which this service is oriented on are people who are released from their sentence or from protective treatment. Last but not least, these houses are also intended for young people who suddenly find themselves in an unfavorable life situation which they are not capable to deal with on their own. The Halfway House provides accommodation at a reduced price, advisory and they also try to make the transition of their clients from institutional environment a little bit easier. During this transition, the people have to face many problems and searching for work is only one of them. Thanks to the institutional upbringing, they lack work habits, tend to be more psychically unstable and they usually have more issues with getting into new relationships. Current situation on labour market when the labour supply highly exceeds labour demand and the job offer is quite limited obviously does not benefit to the situation of these people. The aim of this thesis was to map the situation of the clients of the Halfway House and also to answer the research question what problems on the labour market these young people usually face. I chose a qualitative research to gather required data. As a methodology, I used interviewing with a usage of half-structured technique and a method of document analysis with the help of content analysis data technique. The research was performed with twelve people, four respondents were social workers from the Halfway House and other eight people were clients of these providers from whom three were unemployed. Three respondents came to these facilities from upbringing institution and the rest were from children?s home. Two respondents had only basic education, five respondents reached secondary education with certificate of apprenticeship and one respondent had a secondary education with leaving exam. The output of this research is a finding that situation of clients of the Halfway House is unfavorable at current conditions. To find a job, they use internet, job offers in magazines, personal contact with companies, acquaintances and job agencies. During the time they are unemployed, they are obliged to be registered at the Employment Office of the Czech Republic. The social worker stated that other problems the clients encounter on labour market, besides lack of work habits, unstable psyche, low communication skills, were incorporation into work society, solving of conflict situation with co-workers and high salary expectations. Clients themselves stated that the problems on labour market for them were high education expectations from the employers, complications with curriculum vitae compilation and writing of <b>motivation</b> <b>letter.</b> Two respondents also saw the problem in their ethnic membership and as a reason for their unemployment stated discrimination of a society. None of the respondents stated that was discriminated due to their institutional past. In my opinion, it is important to show the facilities like the Halfway House and social issues of young people who try to integrate themselves to a normal life after leaving institutional facilities because it is important to raise public awareness regarding this topic. This thesis can serve as a study material for students of social-law branches and also as a feedback for social worker of the Halfway House...|$|E
40|$|Writing in {{a foreign}} {{language}} is both complex and fascinating, whether viewed {{from the perspective of a}} teacher or a student. My teacher-interest in the writing skill stems from the fact that in my experience it is the most difficult skill to develop successfully. As a non-native user of English and a foreign-language student, on the other hand, I often feel that especially when writing in order to accomplish a specific goal, we have insufficient tools to write successfully. Transmitting information is easier than getting things done. Consequently, in this paper I concentrate on the genre which tends to be most disliked by both teachers and students – formal letters, with the specific focus on letters of complaint. It is this type of letters that each of us may need to write in real life. This type of a letter is interesting as the writer has to combine a number of skills. In order to write successfully it is not enough to master the use of grammar and lexis, a writer has to be aware of the cultural and social context in which the text will function. I believe the genre approach to teaching writing allows students to develop all sub-skills necessary to become proficient writers. In this paper attention will be first given to Common features of formal letters, then to a brief explanation of what genre approach is. The second half of the paper covers some of the of the major problems learners may encounter when writing formal <b>letters</b> (<b>motivation,</b> cultural and linguistic issues).

40|$|This is a {{study of}} Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson’s {{intellectual}} oeuvre {{in terms of his}} representation and appropriation of Chinese civilization. Dickinson is a prominent Cambridge intellectual who {{is best known for his}} popular and influential book Letters from John Chinaman (1901), his astute assessment of Chinese character and achievement in his collection of travel writings entitled Appearances [...] Being Notes of Travel (1914), and his reflections on Eastern civilizations recorded in An Essay on the Civilizations of India, China and Japan (1915). This study is motivated by the thought that Dickinson’s representation of China, which has been largely unattended, may serve as a point of departure to study what F. W. Stella Browne has called a “completely intellectualized” mind, the critic’s moral and political thought, and of the set of socio-historical conditions that shaped his thinking. With the assessment of the development of Dickinson’s intellectual enterprise, this thesis recalls one of those earliest phases of cultural and civilizational exchange in the history of intellectual globalization. Reading Dickinson’s literary, historical and philosophical works, this thesis discusses how Dickinson’s idea of China influences, stimulates and challenges the formation of his moral and political thought. The discussion shall proceed in two chapters. Chapter one explores Dickinson’s <b>motivations</b> for writing <b>Letters</b> from John Chinaman in relation to his vision of an ideal culture and polity. Through a reading of Letters from John Chinaman, it contends that Dickinson’s idea of China played an important role in the knowledge circulation and transformation of the image of “Chinaman” in Europe. This chapter discusses his criticism of Victorian culture and politics and his conception of ideal democracy with reference to his idea of China. It examines how Dickinson’s perception of Chinese civilization contributes to the formation of Dickinson’s moral and political thought, which is foundational to the development of his liberal internationalism in the critical historical conjuncture of WWI. Chapter two analyzes Dickinson’s conceptualization of Chinese civilization and discusses how it contributes to the development of his moral and political thought during and after his trip to China. Dickinson’s view of Chinese civilization, especially traditional Chinese philosophical ideals, echoes as well as challenges his moral and political thought; his idea of China provides the impetus for the shift of his intellectual interest from domestic politics to international politics. The discussion of Dickinson’s idea of China and the development of his political philosophy may contribute to the understanding of the ideology of liberal internationalism he subscribed to in the campaign for the League of Nations. published_or_final_versionEnglishMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
