40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} strength of particleboards made with wood of Pinus taeda, Eucalyptus saligna, Mimosa scabrella and Hovenia dulcis and mixtures in different proportions and two board compositions. The boards were produced in mixtures of two, three and four species for monolayer boards and proportions of the two species for <b>multilayer</b> <b>boards.</b> Panels were also produced with pure pine wood. The adhesive used was based on urea-formaldehyde and the nominal density was 0. 65 g/cm³. We evaluated the properties of density, moisture content, static bending, internal bond and screw withdrawal. The analyzes allowed to evaluating the use of different species wood mixtures in particleboards. The results were also compared the requirements of applicable ANSI A 208. 1. The values of static bending, internal bond and screw withdrawal increased with increasing proportion of Pinus taeda and Hovenia dulcis and decreased with increasing proportion of Mimosa scabrella and Eucalyptus saligna.

40|$|Trend towards {{downsizing}} {{the product}} size {{and at the}} same time to bring more functionality in electronic products, demands electrically interconnecting several miniaturized electronic components with high counts of I (Input/Out put) on smaller and smaller size printed wiring boards [PWB]. These miniature components occupy lower foot print area but require higher routing interconnection densities. However, the conventional <b>multilayer</b> <b>board</b> technologies exhibit limitations when there is need to connect very high IØ components such as ball grid arrays, which require blind and buried interconnections within the multilayer mono-block. This limitation has given raise to newer methods of multi layer construction. Build–up multilayer PWB is now the technology of choice for enhanced routing capability including blind and buried interlayer connections. Build up methods are based on making very small vias within dielectric layers followed by metalisation. Typically blind and buried vias are very small, and hence called “micro vias” connecting the layers selectively within the multilayer mono-block. Buried vias make the interconnection between the consecutive layers, and blind vias connect the surface layers to any one of the interior layers in the build up <b>multilayer</b> <b>board.</b> If the blind vias are filled with a dielectric, the entire top and bottom surface area becomes available for high -density component mounting. The crux in build up board technologies is the method of creating micro-holes; a micro hole is a hole, which is less than 150 micro meter in diameter. Efforts are made to replace existing metalising techniques with “paste filling” methodologies, which would result in “SOLID CONDUCTING VIAS” CALLED AS “MICRO -INTERCONNECTS” The work reported in this thesis aims at demonstrating one such innovative ‘solid conducting via’ formation without using any of the known micro-hole formation techniques. Based on the results obtained some useful conclusions have been drawn which will perhaps go a long way in the name of “PRINTED PILLAR TECHNOLOGY” a novel methodology for building multilayer suitable for very high IØ components such as “ball grid arrays. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) {{for high}} speed digital {{applications}} use meshed planes between the signal layers for shielding and power supply. Both wave impedances {{of the signal}} lines and coupling behavior between different signal layers {{are influenced by the}} properties of these meshed planes. Together with the quick increase of operating frequency of high-speed integrated circuits (IC), this may cause problems such as dispersion, crosstalk, and packaging effects which must be investigated by means of simulations. The Partial Elements Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) method has proven to be suitable to deal with such systems, particularly to investigate ground bounce effects. For analysis of large interconnect and packaging structures, however, the computing time increases very rapidly with the system’s complexity. To reduce the costs of calculation, especially for inductance and capacitance calculation, a method is introduced that leads to both accurate and fast results. The validity of the modeling is verified with Sparameter calculations of blocking measures in a <b>multilayer</b> <b>board</b> and shall be used for investigations of multichip modules. 1...|$|E
40|$|Printed Wiring <b>Multilayer</b> <b>Board</b> (PWMLB) {{structures}} for high speed, high density circuits {{are prone to}} failure due to the microcracking of electrolytic copper interconnections. The failure can occur in the foil that makes up the inner layer traces or in the plated through holes (PTH) deposit that forms the layer to layer interconnections. It is shown {{that there are some}} distinctive differences in the quality of Type E copper and that these differences can be detected before its use in a PWMLB. It is suggested that the strength of some Type E copper can be very low when the material is hot and that it is the use of this poor quality material in a PWMLB that results in PTH and inner layer microcracking. Since the PWMLB failure in question are induced by a thermal stress, and since the poorer grades of Type E materials used in these structures are susceptible to premature failure under thermal stress, the use of elevated temperature rupture and creep rupture testing is proposed as a means for screening copper foil, or its PTH equivalent, in order to eliminate the problem of Type E copper microcracking in advanced PWMLBs...|$|E

40|$|Digital arrays {{offer much}} greater {{flexibility}} {{at a lower}} cost than traditional analog arrays. A digital array need not be fixed to a single purpose, but can be designed to be capable of performing multiple functions at once. ^ As much of a digital array 2 ̆ 7 s functionality is implemented in software, the RF frontend can be quite simple relative to traditional analog arrays. This fact, along with recent advances in solid state technology makes it possible to integrate the RF frontend, including antennas, into a single panel using standard <b>multilayer</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing techniques, as will be demonstrated herein. To further improve this integration, a technique will be demonstrated in which antennas and filters can be designed as a single unit using traditional filter design techniques. ^ Furthermore, these design techniques are extended to multiple antenna systems by enabling simultaneous transmit and receive. Systems designed for simultaneous transmit and receive must implement new techniques in the RF hardware to isolate the receive paths from the high-power transmit signals. The use of tunable resonators at the antenna panel allows deep isolation to be achieved. The largest source of transmit to receive coupling in an array is due to coupling between antenna elements, which can be controlled through active baffle design viewed as a portion of a larger filtering system. Proposed and demonstrated herein are two distinct techniques to ensure high isolation between antenna elements using baffles consisting of tunable filter elements. These techniques improve isolation by over 50 dB, making simultaneous transmit and receive feasible. ...|$|E
40|$|Nearly half {{a century}} ago, the concept of {{microstrip}} antennas has been proposed. After {{a long period of}} being employed only for special military use, they have now found a broad and still strongly increasing field of applications mainly driven by modern communication and navigation technology. Microstrip antennas are well known for several advantages: They are mainly flat, lightweight and can be produced easily and inexpensively in several technologies suitable for RF circuits. This also offers the possibility to integrate them with active devices even as a part of an MMIC-chip. In this way, very small radiating front ends and smart antenna systems can be built up. For high frequencies beginning with Ku-band, LTCC-technology is often used to build multilayer structures with many layers and active and passive components. Large arrays, including complex networks for beamforming and steering, can be fabricated in PCB-technology either as a single <b>multilayer</b> <b>board</b> or in a modular architecture. If they are printed on a flexible substrate they may conform to a given surface and thus can be integrated seamlessly in an aircraft or any other vehicle to reduce drag and meet aesthetical requirements. This talk will present the fundamental concept of microstrip antennas and discuss some basic methods and guidelines for analysis and design. Several examples for their application will then be given including antenna arrays with dual polarization and special networks for beamforming which are used in synthetic aperture radar as well as narrowband, broadband and multifrequency antennas for advanced navigation receivers employing digital beamforming and array processing to mitigate interferes and multipath signals. In communications, some examples for different microstrip antenna technologies especially for high frequency applications in user terminals of satellite systems will be shown. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Design and {{manufacturing}} techniques of {{printed circuit boards}} (PCB's) have advanced from early one or two-layer structures to the <b>multilayer</b> <b>boards</b> where ten or more layers are no longer uncommon. These give additional routing space, potential decrease in device size and various design possibilities like solid ground and power planes. Unfortunately <b>multilayer</b> <b>boards</b> are vulnerable to high coupling between signal vias especially due to PCB resonances. In this study via crosscoupling is investigated on multilayer PCB's. Special attention {{is given to the}} coupling due to resonances and vertically aligned blind vias. Problem is approached from the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) point of view and high accuracy of measurements or models is not the objective. Instead ways to increase isolation are considered important. EMC is considered to include internal functionality of the device. Analytical methods are used to calculate resonant frequencies, fields and quality factors for simple rectangular structures. The PCB cavity is reduced to two-dimensions for numerical calculation of same quantities. Aplac finite-difference time-domain simulator is used to model coupling due to PCB resonances. Isolation between vertically aligned blind vias is estimated analytically. A quasi-static numerical model is used to study a coaxial via structure. <b>Multilayer</b> test <b>boards</b> are constructed for measurement purposes. Simplified resonator structures on two-layer boards are used to test different methods to increase isolation. Measurements show that high coupling between vias may occur due to PCB resonances. This leads to the situation, where previously used isolation methods between vias are not necessarily effective enough. Several means to reduce effects of PCB resonances are described in this study. Measured and modelled results agree well from an EMC point of view. Coupling due to vertically aligned blind vias is also shown to be high. A simple capacitance model may be used to approximate this up to frequencies where the dynamic wave nature of the board starts to be important. From a PCB designer's point of view these results mean that when the board size is not small compared to the wavelength, there is a possibility of resonances and reduction methods have to be taken into account. Also placement of the vias have to be carefully selected especially if blind or buried vias are used...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} {{significant}} {{effort has been}} obtained on the miniaturization of electronic devices, for example {{in the field of}} cellular phones or other portables devices. Mainspring of this process is the huge success that has been obtained with giant integration densities on chip level. In contrast passive components are actually the most important bottlenecks in the upcoming miniaturization process, first of all for applications in power electronics. Especially in the field of electric mobility and innovative lighting technologies an increasing demand arises for miniaturized transformers and converters. Miniaturization of power electronic devices concentrates however the dissipation heat in a smaller volume, leading in most cases to higher operation temperatures. LTCC (Low-Temperature-Cofir ing-Ceramic) as a ceramic multilayer interconnection technology has been employed for the development of 3 D-high integrated electronic modules, marked by an excellent thermal robustness. Actual integration of inductors or capacitors in LTCC-boards is restricted to SMD's, Iimiting further miniaturization in an important manner.
