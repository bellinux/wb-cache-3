25|$|The exact {{population}} of Berber speakers {{is hard to}} ascertain, since most North African countries do not record language data in their censuses. Ethnologue provides a useful academic starting point; however, its bibliographic references are very inadequate, and it rates its own accuracy at only B-C for the area. Early colonial censuses may provide better documented figures for some countries; however, these are also very <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> date.|$|E
25|$|The leg in {{the initial}} {{position}} bends very slightly at the knees, and then kicks the lower leg and the foot downwards similar to kicking a football. The legs may be bent inward (or occasionally outward) slightly. After the kick, the straight leg moves back up. A frequent mistake of beginners is to bend the legs too much or to kick too <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water.|$|E

25|$|After 25 overs, England were 65 for 5, but the Australian spinners didn't get too <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the track. Dot-balls flourished, but the {{partnership}} kept in there, {{and a second}} six – from Jones off Hogg – showed their intent. After 35 overs, England were 113 for 5, and required a run a ball, with four overs of Lee and three of McGrath still to negotiate. However, England kept pushing, never letting the run-rate get above 7. Skipper Ponting showed some desperation when he brought Michael Hussey on with nine overs to spare, knowing that the spinners couldn't keep it tight, but got his reward in Hussey's second over when Collingwood was run out for 53 – off 116 balls.|$|E
25|$|Though the duo never stated so outright, their {{additional}} {{motivation in}} {{getting involved with}} KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the Serbian parliament. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, {{at least until the}} law appears. Divac and Danilović appeared pretty <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continues to be involved with it in a lesser capacity.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match of}} the night saw long time rivals as captains of {{opposite}} teams as La Máscara teams with Máscara Dorada and Valiente and Averno leads {{the rest of his}} group Los Hijos del Averno ("The Sons of Hell"; Mephisto and Ephesto) against each other. The rivalry between the two dates back to early 2011 when the two began a long running, very high-profile storyline feud between the two. The highlight of the storyline came at the 2011 Juicio Final show where La Máscara defeated Averno in a Luchas de Apuestas match and forced Averno to unmask as a result. The two clashed on multiple occasions after the mask match, with the tension being evident in almost all matches. The two were teamed up for both the 2012 and the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournaments. During the 2012 tournament the team only coexisted long enough to defeat the team of Valiente and Olímpico in the first round, but the dissension between the two cost them their second-round match to eventual tournament winners Atlantis and Mr. Niebla. In the 2013 tournament the duo defeated El Hijo de Fantasma and El Felino in the first round, but lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. in the second round. Máscara Dorada and Mephisto had also teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, not so <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> any existing storyline reasons as perhaps more to develop a rivalry between the two. They defeated Máximo and Mr. Águila in the first round, but were defeated by Shocker and Mr. Niebla {{in the second round of}} the tournament. The first match of the show featured a rare teaming of the father/sons team of El Felino teaming with Puma and Tiger, something that had only happened on rare occasions and never at a major CMLL event before. The Casas family (Felino and sons) would face off against two thirds of Los Reyes de la Atlantida ("The Kings of Atlantis") Delta and Guerrero Maya Jr., teaming up with Tritón for a match that had no real storyline behind it.|$|E

Recusants continued to be detained in the castle, which was regarded by the national authorities as a particularly suitable prison for this class of prisoner.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the sale}} of the {{building}} by the Times, the zipper was operated on an inconsistent basis by various news outlets, and was shut off entirely between 1961 and 1965, and again from 1977 to 1986. In 1986, the ticker was revived by Newsday, which operated it until December 31, 1994. The newspaper declined to renew its lease on the ticker, believing that they [...] " [...] get very <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that sign" [...] financially. Publishing company Pearson PLC operated the zipper for a period beginning on December 31, 1994, until ceding its role to Dow Jones & Company in June 1995.|$|E

Byrne {{then went on to}} {{describe}} the massive amount of interest he was getting from companies across the USA. Epstein was horrified, realising he had made an appalling error by accepting such a small percentage, and decided he could never tell The Beatles. He immediately instructed Jacobs to re-negotiate the contract with Byrne, which was finally achieved seven months later, in August 1964, which raised the royalty to 49%.|$|E

Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E
500|$|The Dark Troopers in Dark Forces {{were created}} {{specifically}} for the game by Justin Chin and Paul Mica. Chin notes that they were designed as a more advanced enemy when compared to standard stormtroopers: [...] "Instead of just beefing up the stormtroopers, I designed {{them to be more}} efficient. I wanted something more terrifying and more omnipotent." [...] Three designs for the Dark Troopers were produced for Dark Forces. Lucasfilm licensing department initially rejected two of the designs for looking too <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> character, so Chin produced new designs which were ultimately approved. The development team collaborated with staff at Skywalker Ranch for the sounds, music, and costumes used in the cutscenes.|$|E
500|$|The first chapter, [...] "All About Undead", {{contains}} {{general information}} about undead monsters. The chapter discusses {{the ecology of}} undead creatures, though this section was described as [...] "very small", and talks about undead religion, introducing new deities. The chapter also discusses [...] "stranger areas", including the idea of undead citizenship in cosmopolitan cities. Variant rules are introduced for areas including hauntings and exorcisms, which were received positively, and for undead hunger and appetites. The section also includes {{advice on how to}} combat undead, but according to Casey Smith of D20 Magazine Rack, [...] "veteran players probably won't get <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this part of the book". Overall, the section was described by one reviewer as [...] "one of the more interesting".|$|E

500|$|Carlsen had an {{aggressive}} {{style of play}} as a youth, and, according to Agdestein, his play was characterised by [...] "a fearless readiness to offer material for activity". Carlsen found as he matured that this risky playing style was not as well suited against the world elite. When he started playing in top tournaments, he had trouble getting <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the opening. To progress, Carlsen's style became more universal, capable of handling all sorts of positions well. He opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4, as well as 1.c4, and, on occasion, 1.Nf3, thus {{making it harder for}} opponents to prepare against him and reducing the effect of computer analysis. He has said the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as it comes down to [...] "pure chess".|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Noel Coppage from Stereo Review {{was critical of}} the singing and songwriting, likening Marquee Moon to a stale version of Bruce Springsteen. Nigel Hunter wrote in Gramophone that Verlaine's lyrics and guitar playing were vague and that listeners would need a [...] "strong commitment {{to this type of}} music to get <b>much</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it". In Rolling Stone, Ken Tucker said the lyrics generally amounted to non sequiturs, meaningless phrases, and pretentious aphorisms, but were ultimately secondary to the music. Although he found Verlaine's solos potentially formless and boring, Tucker credited him for structuring his songs around chilling riffs and [...] "a new commercial impulse that gives his music its catchy, if slashing, hook". High Fidelity felt the music's [...] "scaring amalgam of rich, brightly colored textures" [...] compensated for Verlaine's nearly unintelligible lyrics.|$|E

Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts {{in the middle of}} already negotiated contracts. During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series. On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: [...] "When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist?
