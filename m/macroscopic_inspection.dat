40|$|Thermal fatigue {{experiments}} on tungsten mock-ups {{have been carried}} out by an electron beam facility. Different designs of W monoblock mock-ups as well as a W macrobrush mock-up showed very good performance at maximum power densities between 14 and 20 MW/m(2) (absorbed). For two plasma-sprayed tungsten mock-ups, failure limits were reached at 6. 5 MW/m(2). But from the test results, it can be concluded that these failure limits could be increased by improvement of the production methods. Vertical displacement event (VDE) simulation experiments followed by a thermal fatigue test were performed on a tungsten macrobrush mock-up. No indication of failure was observed from the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspections</b> or from the infrared images. But in the metallographic inspection, some cracks were observed at the interface between the tungsten teeth and the soft copper layer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, is {{the most}} commercially {{important}} species in the eastern Bering Sea. Estimates of maturity are critical for setting an appropriate harvest rate for pollock spawning biomass, and correct classification of ovaries into a maturity condi-tion is necessary for accurate estimation of maturity. Data on length, weight, and ovary weight and condition were collected from 4, 996 pollock in 2002 and 5, 201 in 2003 aboard pollock trawlers across the eastern Bering Sea. In 2003, 173 pollock ovaries were collected and prepared for histological analysis. Maturity condition was assessed by <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> of gonads, a gonado-somatic index (GSI), and histological methods. <b>Macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> was based on alterations in ovary size and appearance, whereas histological methods evaluated changes in oocyte stages. The GSI was calculated as the proportion of ovary to body weight. The GSI was a good indicator of pollock that had spawned or were about to spawn. Histological analysis confirmed the overall general appropriateness of macroscopic staging for mature versus immature fish, but it also indicated relatively high misclassi-fication rates for particular maturity stages when using macroscopic staging methods alone. Among ovaries macroscopically classified as developing, 16 % were at immature oocyte stages and 84 % were at pri-mary yolk to more advanced oocyte stages. This indicates that pollock classified macroscopically as “developing ” may mature in either the current or subsequent spawning season. <b>Macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> and 2 Stahl and Kruse—Ovarian Stages of Walleye Pollock GSI in combination {{may be useful to}} determine maturity condition for some maturity stages; however, histological examination of ovaries {{is the most}} accurate method for all stages...|$|E
40|$|Most primate populations remain unobservable; therefore, {{researchers}} {{depend on}} the analyses of indirect evidence encountered at a study-site {{in order to understand}} their behavioral ecology. Diet can be determined through the analyses of scats or feeding remains encountered on-site. This allows aspects of their dietary repertoire to be established, which has implications both for conservation efforts (by locating food resources), and for understanding the evolution of hominin diet (if used as referential models). <b>Macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> of fecal samples is a common method applied to ascertain a primate population's diet. However, new approaches are required to identify food-items unrecognizable at this level. We applied a dry ash extraction method to fecal samples (N[*]=[*] 50) collected from 10 adult chimpanzees in Kanyawara, Kibale National Park, Uganda and also to plant parts (N[*]=[*] 66) from 34 species known {{to be included in the}} diet of this community of apes. We recovered phytoliths in 26 of the 34 plant species. Fifteen phytolith morphotypes were only detected in 14 plant species (termed “distinct” phytoliths). We used these distinct phytoliths to identify plant foods (i. e., that they were associated with) in fecal samples. We then validated findings by checking if the 10 chimpanzees had eaten parts of these plants ∼ 24 [*]hr prior to fecal sample collection; six plant species associated with five distinct phytoliths had been eaten. Finally, we compared plant foods identified in fecal samples from phytolith analyses with plants that had been identified from <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> of the same fecal samples. Findings from phytolith analyses corroborate with those from <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> by expanding the total number of plant species identified per fecal sample (i. e., we identified certain plant parts that remained unrecognizable at macroscopic level).

This proof of concept study aimed to investigate a guided tissue regeneration approach for treatment of tears in meniscus avascular zone in a goat model. DESIGN Full-depth longitudinal tear {{was created in the}} avascular zone of the meniscus and sutured. In the two treatment groups, porcine collagen membrane was wrapped around the tear without (CM) or with injection of expanded autologous chondrocytes (CM+cells), whereas in the control group the tear remained only sutured. Gait recovery was evaluated during the entire follow-up period. On explantation at 3 and 6 months, <b>macroscopic</b> gross <b>inspection</b> assessed healing of tears, degradation of collagen membrane, potential signs of inflammation, and osteoarthritic changes. Microscopic histology scoring criteria were developed to evaluate healing of tears, the cellular response, and the inflammatory response. RESULTS Gait recovery suggested protective effect of collagen membrane and was supported by macroscopical evaluation where improved tear healing was noted in both treated groups. Histology scoring in CM compared to suture group revealed an increase in tear margins contact, newly formed connective tissue between margins, and cell formations surrounded with new matrix after 3 months yet not maintained after 6 months. In contrast, in the CM+cells group these features were observed after 3 and 6 months.

40|$|Purpose: The main {{purposes}} of the paper are to discuss designing problems of machines used in underground mining and investigation of its reasons based on cracked boom of underground mine machine. Design/methodology/approach: Numerical and experimental approach was considered. The finite element method was used for numerical simulation. Fractographic and microscopic evaluation, chemical analysis, hardness tests were used to perform material evaluations. The objectives are achieved by numerical simulation of cracked loader boom, material evaluations of specimens and comparison of results achieved from both approaches. These were determined through a numerical experiment, based on a discrete model of the jib boom and predefined boundary conditions. The finite element analysis for the jib boom provided information about stress distribution for extreme load conditions. The study included <b>macroscopic</b> and fractographic <b>inspection,</b> microscopic evaluation as well as hardness tests of the material used for the jib boom.

Analysis of studies allowing direct comparison between tests was undertaken. We investigated the impact of maternal age on test performance in subgroup analyses. Main results Fifty-nine studies involving 341, 261 pregnancies (including 1, 994 with Down's syndrome) were included. Studies were generally high quality, although differential verification was common with invasive testing of only high-risk pregnancies. Seventeen studies made direct comparisons between tests. Fifty-four test combinations were evaluated formed from combinations of 12 different tests and maternal age; alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated oestriol (uE 3), total human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG), free alpha human chorionic gonadotrophin (αhCG), Inhibin A, SP 2, CA 125, troponin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), placental growth factor (PGF) and proform of eosinophil major basic protein (ProMBP).

40|$|Background Down's {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} a person has three, rather than two copies of chromosome 21; or the specific area of chromosome 21 implicated in causing Down's syndrome. It is the commonest congenital cause of mental disability and also leads to numerous metabolic and structural problems. It can be life-threatening, or lead to considerable ill health, although some individuals have only mild problems and can lead relatively normal lives. Having a baby with Down’s syndrome {{is likely to have}} a significant impact on family life. Noninvasive screening based on biochemical analysis of maternal serum or urine, or fetal ultrasound measurements, allows estimates of the risk of a pregnancy being affected and provides information to guide decisions about definitive testing. However, no test can predict the severity of problems a person with Down’s syndrome will have. Objectives The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). Search methods We conducted a sensitive and comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE (1980 to 25 August 2011), Embase (1980 to 25 August 2011), BIOSIS via EDINA (1985 to 25 August 2011), CINAHL via OVID (1982 to 25 August 2011), The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (The Cochrane Library 25 August 2011), MEDION (25 August 2011), The Database of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in Laboratory Medicine (25 August 2011), The National Research Register (Archived 2007), Health Services Research Projects in Progress database (25 August 2011).

It can be life-threatening, or lead to considerable ill health, although some individuals have only mild problems and can lead relatively normal lives. Having a baby with Down's syndrome {{is likely to have}} a significant impact on family life. The risk of a Down's syndrome affected pregnancy increases with advancing maternal age. Noninvasive screening based on biochemical analysis of maternal serum or urine, or fetal ultrasound measurements, allows estimates of the risk of a pregnancy being affected and provides information to guide decisions about definitive testing. Before agreeing to screening tests, parents need to be fully informed about the risks, benefits and possible consequences of such a test. This includes subsequent choices for further tests they may face, and the implications of both false positive and false negative screening tests (i. e. invasive diagnostic testing, and the possibility that a miscarried fetus may be chromosomally normal). The decisions that may be faced by expectant parents inevitably engender a high level of anxiety at all stages of the screening process, and the outcomes of screening can be associated with considerable physical and psychological morbidity. No screening test can predict the severity of problems a person with Down's syndrome will have.

30|$|Azoxymethane (AOM, MW: 74) and Dextran {{sodium sulfate}} (DSS, MW: 36, 000 – 50, 000) were {{purchased}} from Sigma-Aldrich and MP Biochemicals Inc. USA, respectively. Pathogen free 8 – 10  week old female wild type C 57 /BL 6 mice and SCID mice with a C 57 /BL 6 genetic background, were housed under specific pathogen free conditions with {{free access to}} food and water {{during the course of}} experiments. Mice were injected with a single intraperitoneal administration of AOM dissolved in physiological saline with a dose of 12.5  mg/kg body weight. Ten days later, 2.5 % DSS water was given in the drinking water for 5  days, followed by 14  days of regular water. Mice were treated with 3 cycles of DSS water. At each end point of DSS water, mice fed with DSS water were defined as AD 1, AD 2 and AD 3, respectively. Body weight was measured every week, and the animals were sacrificed at the indicated time intervals for <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspection,</b> histological analysis, and total RNA extraction.|$|E
40|$|Here {{we report}} {{the first human}} case of an outer ear canal {{infection}} with a free-living nematode of the genus Rhabditis. Otomi-croscopy revealed viable worms in the outer ear canal of a patient suffering from chronic otorrhea and hearing loss. The nema-tode was identified by microscopy and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) -PCR. CASE REPORT A 37 -year-old male presented with purulent otorrhea fromboth ears for 8 weeks in a tertiary care center. Additionally, he reported of mild hearing loss {{since the beginning of}} symptomatic disease. Both otorrhea and hearing loss were more pronounced for the right ear, on which the patient had undergone mastoidec-tomy 3 years earlier due to chronic otitis media. The patient re-ported no other underlying disease or recent travel history, owned a pet dog as well as a pet cat, and had beenworking in an industrial agriculture company. <b>Macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> and visualization by otomicroscopy of the outer ear canal confirmed otorrhea and revealed tympanostomy tubes and a retraction of the tympanic membranes on both sides.

40|$|THIS {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of earlier studies in which the relationship of calcified atheroma to cancer was examined (Elkeles, 1949, 1950, 1953, 1956, 1957). It was found that calcified atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta is significantly less common in carcinoma than in control cases of the same age groups. From these results it was concluded that individuals with noticeable calcified atherosclerosis are relatively immune to cancer. Radiography of the abdominal aorta was used to estimate {{the presence or absence of}} calcified atheroma in patients aged more than 50. This method, in contrast to autopsy, permits the examination of a large number of unselected control cases. Moreover, calcium deposits in the aorta can be detected more easily than by <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> and palpation of the arteries. So far 622 carcinoma cases and 1480 controls over the age of 50 have been examined by the radiographic method. The results are shown in Fig. 1. These results refer to carcinomata irrespective of the site of the tumour. They show a significantly lower incidence of calcified atherosclerosis in cance...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} ovarian tissue pre-treatment with 50 µM Trolox followed by heterotopic transplantation in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri collinsi) and to assess tissue functionality via immunohistochemical analysis of the stroma and ovarian follicles. Five healthy and sexually mature squirrel monkey (Saimiri collinsi) females were used. Heterotopic autografting of fresh ovarian tissue with or without previous exposure to the antioxidant Trolox was performed and grafts were recovered for analysis 7 days later. Tissue vascularisation was confirmed by both <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD 31) staining. Trolox prevented massive follicular activation and kept the percentages of morphologically normal follicles higher than in untreated grafts. Expression of anti-Müllerian hormone in developing follicles was observed only in controls and Trolox-treated grafts. Also, immunostaining for growth differentiation factor- 9 was positive only in primordial follicles from controls and from Trolox-treated grafts. Although Trolox improved follicular quality and avoided apoptosis in stromal cells, ovarian tissue fibrosis was increased in Trolox-treated grafts, mainly due to an increase in collagen Type I synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Paleopathological data provide {{valuable}} information about health, longevity and mortality in earlier human populations. We investigated {{the incidence of}} spinal pathologies on 54 individuals (1045 vertebrae and 18 sacral bones) that belong to a medieval skeletal series discovered in the Dalheim monastery (Northwest Germany) and compared them with contemporary and recent populations. The skeletons were analyzed with anthropological methods (sex and age determination), by <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspection,</b> and, if pathologies of the spine and the sacrum were visible, also by X-ray. We investigated evidence of trauma, specific and nonspecific infectious diseases, joint diseases, tumors, and congenital as well as metabolic disorders. Radiocarbon determination of four samples of different specimens was also undertaken revealing a historic dating of ca. 1050 AD. The most common pathological findings were degenerative changes of the spine found in 29 individuals (53. 3 %). Examples of infections of the spine were rare (0. 8 % of all vertebrae). There were no cases of traumatic injuries of the spine. The prevalence of spondylosis deformans, the most commonly found type of pathology {{was found to be}} higher in the lumbar region, in males as well as in individuals of low stature...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, endobronchial ultrasound-guided TBNA (EBUS-TBNA) {{has emerged}} as an {{innovative}} technique for diagnosis and staging of lung cancer and has been successfully introduced into daily clinical practice with several advantages including minimally invasive approach, safe, cost-effective, real time image guidance, broad sampling capability, and rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). Both cytological and histological approach could be useful to have material for diagnosis, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses which may be very important for targeted therapy with successful rate ranging from 89 % to 98 %. The utility of ROSE during EBUS-TBNA has been matter of debate. Indeed, although some evidence concluded that ROSE does not increase the diagnostic efficacy of EBUS-TBNA, other demonstrated that it improves the diagnostic yield of the procedure up to 30 %, allows to avoid repetition of additional diagnostic procedures and reduces risk of complications. Furthermore the sample preparation by cytopathologist is optimized {{with the aid of}} direct <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspection,</b> optimal smearing techniques, and triage of the sample permitting to obtain adequate tissue for diagnosis, ancillary techniques and molecular testing, when needed. Some pathological issues on EBUS-TBNA are reviewed and discussed with particular focus on ROSE and molecular testing...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that free radicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species {{play a critical role}} in gastric mucosal damage. It is well known that the exposure of gastric mucosa to damaging factors such as stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs produces acute ulcers that are mainly mediated by ROS. The aim of the present study was to investigate the gastroprotective properties of bis(1 -hydroxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -piperidinyl) decandioate (IAC), a novel nonpeptidyl low-molecular-weight radical scavenger, in two different models of gastric ulcer in rats caused by ROS. IAC was orally administered at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg before gastric ulceration induced by indomethacin and water immersion and restraint stress. The number and severity of gastric lesions, following <b>macroscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> of the mucosa, were evaluated and expressed as an ulcer score. Oral administration of IAC dosed at 50 and 100 mg/kg was able to significantly prevent gastric ulceration induced by indomethacin and by stress. The gastroprotective effect of IAC on gastric mucosa could be attributed to its intrinsic antioxidant activity, suggesting it as a novel antiulcer agent. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
