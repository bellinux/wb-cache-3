5|$|Ependymal cells {{actively}} regulate neuronal fate {{specification of}} adult neural precursors through release of Noggin. Beating of the cilia of ependymal cells appears {{to set up}} concentration gradients of guidance molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, {{such as in the}} RMS. <b>Microglia</b> also actively regulate adult neurogenesis. Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by unactivated <b>microglia</b> in the adult SGZ. Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated <b>microglia</b> can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action. In one study, the activation of <b>microglia</b> and recruitment of T cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment-induced SGZ neurogenesis, suggesting a possible role in the RMS.|$|E
5|$|The main {{pathological}} {{characteristics of}} PD are cell {{death in the}} brain's basal ganglia (affecting up to 70% of the dopamine secreting neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta {{by the end of}} life) and the presence of Lewy bodies (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells) and {{a significant increase in the}} number of <b>microglia</b> (another type of glial cell) in the substantia nigra.|$|E
5|$|Types of glial cell are astrocytes (including Bergmann glia), oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells (including tanycytes), radial glial {{cells and}} <b>microglia.</b> Astrocytes {{are the largest}} of the glial cells. They are stellate cells with many {{processes}} radiating from their cell bodies. Some of these processes end as perivascular end-feet on capillary walls. The glia limitans of the cortex is made up of astrocyte foot processes that serve in part to contain the cells of the brain.|$|E
5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are {{in a part of}} the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, <b>microglia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Increased microglial {{activation}} following Japanese Encephalitis infection {{has been}} found to influence the outcome of viral pathogenesis. <b>Microglia</b> are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and have a critical role in host defense against invading microorganisms. Activated <b>microglia</b> secrete cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which can cause toxic effects in the brain. Additionally, other soluble factors such as neurotoxins, excitatory neurotransmitters, prostaglandin, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species are secreted by activated <b>microglia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most glia {{are derived}} from {{ectodermal}} tissue of the developing embryo, in particular the neural tube and crest. The exception is <b>microglia,</b> which {{are derived from}} hemopoietic stem cells. In the adult, <b>microglia</b> are largely a self-renewing population and are distinct from macrophages and monocytes, which infiltrate the injured and diseased CNS.|$|E
25|$|These {{cells are}} found in all regions {{of the brain and}} spinal cord. Microglial cells are small {{relative}} to macroglial cells, with changing shapes and oblong nuclei. They are mobile within the brain and multiply when the brain is damaged. In the healthy central nervous system, <b>microglia</b> processes constantly sample all aspects of their environment (neurons, macroglia and blood vessels). In a healthy brain, <b>microglia</b> direct the immune response to brain damage and {{play an important role in}} the inflammation that accompanies the damage. Many diseases and disorders are associated with deficient <b>microglia,</b> such as, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ALS.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cerebral}} cortex glia are oligodendrocytes (75.6%); astrocytes account for 17.3% and <b>microglia</b> for 6.5%.|$|E
25|$|It is {{postulated}} that OECs {{originate in the}} olfactory placode, suggesting a different developmental origin than other similar nervous system <b>microglia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a murine {{model of}} JE, {{it was found}} that in the {{hippocampus}} and the striatum, the number of activated <b>microglia</b> was more {{than anywhere else in the}} brain closely followed by that in the thalamus. In the cortex, the number of activated <b>microglia</b> was significantly less when compared with other regions of the mouse brain. An overall induction of differential expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from different brain regions during a progressive Japanese Encephalitis infection was also observed.|$|E
25|$|Brain {{ischemia}} {{is characterized}} by insufficient {{blood flow to the}} brain. Studies with ischaemic gerbils indicate that, after a delay, levels of quinolinic acid significantly increase, which correlates with increased neuronal damage. In addition, researchers have found that, after transient global ischaemia, there are <b>microglia</b> containing quinolinic acid within the brain. Following cerebral ischaemia, delayed neuronal death may occur in part because of central <b>microglia</b> and macrophages, which possess and secrete quinolinic acid. This delayed neurodegeneration could be associated with chronic brain damage that follows a stroke.|$|E
25|$|That {{the white}} matter loss {{is not nearly}} as clear as that for gray matter {{indicates}} that changes also occur in non-neural tissue, e.g. the vasculature or <b>microglia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pre-active lesions are {{clusters}} of <b>microglia</b> {{driven by the}} HspB5 protein, thought to be produced by stressed oligodendrocytes. The presence of HspB5 in biopsies can be a marker for lesion development.|$|E
25|$|Whatever the {{underlying}} condition for MS is, some damage is {{triggered by a}} CSF unknown soluble factor, which is produced in meningeal areas and diffuses into the cortical parenchyma. It destroys myelin {{either directly or indirectly}} through <b>microglia</b> activation.|$|E
25|$|Others propose an {{oligodendrocyte}} stress {{as primary}} dysfunction, which activates <b>microglia</b> creating the NAWM areas and others propose a yet-unknown intrinsic CNS trigger induces the microglial activation and clustering, which {{they point out}} could be again axonal injury or oligodendrocyte stress.|$|E
25|$|Locally, the {{disruption}} of myelin due to the infiltration of T cells and macrophages, results in the phagocytosis of myelin by <b>microglia</b> or macrophages, suggesting that the T cells are presented with myelin lipids by CD1 molecules at sites of inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid has {{a potent}} {{neurotoxic}} effect. Studies {{have demonstrated that}} quinolinic acid {{may be involved in}} many psychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative processes in the brain, as well as other disorders. Within the brain, quinolinic acid is only produced by activated <b>microglia</b> and macrophages.|$|E
25|$|The various biologically active {{molecules}} secreted by <b>microglia</b> stimulate and recruit endothelial {{cells and}} fibroblasts. These cells help stimulate angiogenesis and collagen secretion into the injured area. Ultimately, {{the amount of}} capillaries extended into the injured area is twice that of uninjured central nervous system regions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Microglia</b> are {{specialized}} macrophages {{capable of}} phagocytosis that protect neurons {{of the central}} nervous system. They are derived from the earliest wave of mononuclear cells that originate in yolk sac blood islands early in development, and colonize the brain shortly after the neural precursors begin to differentiate.|$|E
25|$|Neuroinflammation, {{which is}} a {{fundamental}} reaction to brain injury, {{is characterized by the}} activation of resident <b>microglia</b> and astrocytes and local expression {{of a wide range of}} inflammatory mediators. Acute and chronic neuroinflammation has been studied in the mouse brain following exposure to HZE. The acute effect of HZE is detectable at 6 and 9 Gy; no studies are available at lower doses. Myeloid cell recruitment appears by 6 months following exposure. The estimated RBE value of HZE irradiation for induction of an acute neuroinflammatory response is three compared to that of gamma irradiation. COX-2 pathways are implicated in neuroinflammatory processes that are caused by low-LET radiation. COX-2 up-regulation in irradiated <b>microglia</b> cells leads to prostaglandin E2 production, which appears to be responsible for radiation-induced gliosis (overproliferation of astrocytes in damaged areas of the CNS).|$|E
25|$|<b>Microglia</b> and macrophages {{produce the}} vast {{majority}} of quinolinic acid present in the body. This production is increased during an immune response. It is suspected that this is a result of activation of indoleamine dioxygenases (to be specific, IDO-1 and IDO-2) as well as tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) stimulation by inflammatory cytokines (mainly IFN-gamma, but also IFN-beta and IFN-alpha).|$|E
25|$|Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, {{which include}} {{interleukin-1}} (IL-1), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), Interferon-gamma (IFN-Gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can affect brain growth {{as well as}} neuronal function. Circulating immune cells such as macrophages, as well as glial cells (<b>microglia</b> and astrocytes) secrete these molecules. Cytokine regulation of hypothalamic function is an active area of research {{for the treatment of}} anxiety-related disorders.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{extracellular}} amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), inflammation in {{the form}} of reactive astrocytes and <b>microglia,</b> and neuronal loss are all consistent pathological features of AD, a mechanistic link between these factors is yet to be clarified. Although the majority of past research has focused on fibrillar Aβ, soluble oligomeric Aβ species are now considered to be of major pathological importance in AD. Up-regulation of GSH may be protective against the oxidative and neurotoxic effects of oligomeric Aβ.|$|E
25|$|IDO-1, IDO-2 and TDO {{are present}} in <b>microglia</b> and macrophages. Under {{inflammatory}} conditions and conditions of T cell activation, leukocytes are retained in the brain by cytokine and chemokine production, {{which can lead to}} the breakdown of the BBB, thus increasing the quinolinic acid that enters the brain. Furthermore, quinolinic acid has been shown {{to play a role in}} destabilization of the cytoskeleton within astrocytes and brain endothelial cells, contributing to the degradation of the BBB, which results in higher concentrations of quinolinic acid in the brain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} stages of Huntington's disease, {{patients}} have substantially increased quinolinic acid levels, in particular in the neostriatum and cortex. These areas of the brain that suffer the most damage at these stages. The increase in quinolinic acid correlates with the early activation of <b>microglia</b> and increased cerebral 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) levels. Furthermore, these increased levels of quinolinic acid are great enough to produce excitotoxic neuronal damage. Studies have demonstrated that activation of NMDA receptors by quinolinic acid leads to neuronal dysfunction and death of striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN).|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{responses}} to triggers such as TNF-α involve macrophages with components that include miR-155. miR-155 is overexpressed in atopic dermatitis {{and contributes to}} chronic skin inflammation by increasing the proliferative response of T(H) cells through the downregulation of CTLA-4. In Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, miR-155 showed higher expression in patients' tissues and synovial fibroblasts. In multiple sclerosis, increased expression of mir-155 has also been measured in peripheral and CNS-resident myeloid cells, including circulating blood monocytes and activated <b>microglia.</b> It was also found that mir-155 is implicated in inflammation. Overexpression of mir-155 will lead to chronic inflammatory state in human.|$|E
25|$|As {{noted in}} the above section, {{transforming}} growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2) is an important glial scar stimulant that directly affects astrocyte proliferation. Logan et al. developed monoclonal antibodies to TGFβ2, cerebral wounds were generated in rat brains, and the antibodies were administered via the ventricles, daily for 10 days. Subsequent analysis showed a marked reduction in glial scarring. Particularly, extracellular matrix protein deposition (laminin, fibronectin, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) was closer to baseline (levels of protein expression in an uninjured animal). Further, a reduction in astrocytes and <b>microglia,</b> {{as well as a}} reduction in inflammation and angiogenesis, were observed.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid {{is unable}} {{to pass through the}} blood-brain barrier (BBB) and must be {{produced}} within the brain microglial cells or macrophages that have passed the BBB. While quinolinic acid cannot pass the BBB, kynurenic acid, tryptophan and 3-hydroxykynurenine do and subsequently act as precursors to the production of quinolinic acid in the brain. The quinolinic acid produced in <b>microglia</b> is then released and stimulates NMDA receptors resulting in excitatory neurotoxiticity. While astrocytes are not able to produce quinolinic acid directly, they are capable of producing KYNA, which when released from the astrocytes can be taken in by migroglia that can in turn increase quinolinic acid production.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid is an excitotoxin in the CNS. It reaches {{pathological}} {{levels in}} response to inflammation in the brain, which activates resident <b>microglia</b> and macrophages. High levels of quinolinic acid can lead to hindered neuronal function or even apoptotic death. Quinolinic acid produces its toxic effect through several mechanisms, primarily as its function as an NMDA receptor agonist, which triggers a chain of deleterious effects, but also through lipid peroxidation, and cytoskeletal destabilization. The gliotoxic effects of quinolinic acid further amplify the inflammatory response. Quinolinic acid affects neurons located mainly in the hippocampus, striatum, and neocortex, due to the selectivity toward quinolinic acid by the specific NMDA receptors residing in those regions.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{work has}} also shown that {{olomoucine}} suppresses microglial proliferation within the glial scar. This is particularly important because <b>microglia</b> {{play an important role}} in the secondary damage following lesion to the CNS, during the time of scar formation. Microglial cells are activated via various pro-inflammatory cytokines (some discussed above). Rat spinal cord injury models have shown remarkable improvements after the administration of olomoucine. One hour-post administration, olomoucine suppressed microglial proliferation, as well as reduced the tissue edema normally present during the early stages of glial scar formation. Further, 24 hours post-administration, a reduction in concentration of interleukin-1β was observed. Additionally, the administration of olomoucine has also been shown to decrease neuronal cell death.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{peripheral}} {{nervous system}} injury, injury to {{the central nervous system}} is not followed by extensive regeneration. It is limited by the inhibitory influences of the glial and extracellular environment. The hostile, non-permissive growth environment is, in part, created by the migration of myelin-associated inhibitors, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursors, and <b>microglia.</b> The environment within the CNS, especially following trauma, counteracts the repair of myelin and neurons. Growth factors are not expressed or re-expressed; for instance, the extracellular matrix is lacking laminins. Glial scars rapidly form, and the glia actually produce factors that inhibit remyelination and axon repair; for instance, NOGO and NI-35. The axons themselves also lose the potential for growth with age, due to a decrease in GAP 43 expression.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that latent HIV can cross the blood–brain barrier inside circulating monocytes in the bloodstream ("Trojan horse theory") within the first 14 days of infection. Once inside, these monocytes become activated and are transformed into macrophages. Activated macrophages release virions into the brain tissue proximate to brain microvessels. These viral particles likely {{attract the attention of}} sentinel brain <b>microglia</b> and perivascular macrophages initiating an inflammatory cascade that may cause a series of intracellular signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells and damage the functional and structural integrity of the BBB. This inflammation is HIV encephalitis (HIVE). Instances of HIVE probably occur throughout the course of AIDS and are a precursor for HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The premier model for studying HIV and HIVE is the simian model.|$|E
25|$|Various {{neuronal}} receptors {{present on}} SGCs {{have been named}} as participants in ATP-evoked pain signals, particularly the homomultimer P2X3 and the heteromultimer P2X2/3 purinoceptors. In general, the P2X family of receptors responds to neuronally released ATP. Each of the P2X subtypes are found in sensory neurons {{with the exception of}} the P2X7 receptor, which is selectively expressed by glial cells, including SGCs. The receptor has been implicated in the release of interleukin IL-1β from macrophages or <b>microglia</b> and astrocytes. The receptor likely has a part in the cascade of events that end with inflammation and neuropathic pain. It has been discovered that this receptor has an antagonist in the form of A-317491, which, when present, has the ability to reduce both the evoked and unprompted firing of various classes of spinal neurons, as well as to inhibit release of IL-1β. However, the outside influences of receptors P2X3 and P2Y1 are believed to complicate the interactions between P2X7 and its antagonist, making it a non-ideal target when using pharmacological strategy.|$|E
25|$|The CNS {{consists}} of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that are generated from multipotent stem cells. NCRP Report No. 153 provides the following excellent and short {{introduction to the}} composition and cell types of interest for radiation studies of the CNS: “The CNS {{consists of}} neurons differing markedly in size and number per unit area. There are several nuclei or centers that consist of closely packed neuron cell bodies (e.g., the respiratory and cardiac centers in {{the floor of the}} fourth ventricle). In the cerebral cortex the large neuron cell bodies, such as Betz cells, are separated by a considerable distance. Of additional importance are the neuroglia which are the supporting cells and consist of astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and <b>microglia.</b> These cells permeate and support the nervous tissue of the CNS, binding it together like a scaffold that also supports the vasculature. The most numerous of the neuroglia are Type I astrocytes, which make up about half the brain, greatly outnumbering the neurons. Neuroglia retain the capability of cell division in contrast to neurons and, therefore, the responses to radiation differ between the cell types. A third type of tissue in the brain is the vasculature which exhibits a comparable vulnerability for radiation damage to that found elsewhere in the body. Radiation-induced damage to oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells of the vasculature accounts for major aspects of the pathogenesis of brain damage that can occur after high doses of low-LET radiation.” Based on studies with low-LET radiation, the CNS is considered a radioresistant tissue. For example: in radiotherapy, early brain complications in adults usually do not develop if daily fractions of 2 Gy or less are administered with a total dose of up to 50 Gy. The tolerance dose in the CNS, as with other tissues, depends on the volume and the specific anatomical location in the human brain that is irradiated.|$|E
500|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{white blood cells}} that {{interact}} in the neuroimmune system in the brain. key role of MCs in inflammation [...] and in the disruption of the BBB [...] suggests areas of importance for novel therapy research. Increasing evidence also indicates that MCs participate in neuroinflammation directly [...] and through <b>microglia</b> stimulation , contributing to the pathogenesis of such conditions such as headaches, [...] autism , and chronic fatigue syndrome [...] In fact, a recent review indicated that peripheral inflammatory stimuli can cause <b>microglia</b> activation , thus possibly involving MCs outside the brain.}} Mast cells in {{the central nervous system}} are present in a number of brain structures and in the meninges; they mediate neuroimmune responses in inflammatory conditions and help to maintain the blood-brain-brarrier particularly in those areas where the barrier is absent. Across systems, mast cells serve as the main effector cell through which pathogens can affect the gut–brain axis.|$|E
2500|$|Gliotransmission {{can also}} occur between {{two types of}} glial cells: astrocytes and <b>microglia.</b> Calcium waves within the {{intracellular}} matrix of the astrocyte can cause a response in <b>microglia</b> {{with the presence of}} ATP in the extracellular matrix. [...] One study demonstrated that a mechanical stimulation caused astrocytes to release ATP, which in turn caused a delayed calcium response in <b>microglia,</b> suggesting that astrocyte-to-microglia communication could be mediated by ATP.|$|E
