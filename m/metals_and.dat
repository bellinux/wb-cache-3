5|$|The {{interactions}} of hydrogen with various metals {{are very important}} in metallurgy, as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to store it {{for use as a}} fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> transition <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied to metals that floated on water (lithium, sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals. Only recently, since the mid-20th century, has it been widely {{used to refer to}} elements with intermediate or borderline properties between <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> nonmetals.|$|E

5|$|Different {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} an element are called allotropes. Some allotropes, {{particularly those of}} elements located (in periodic table terms) alongside or near the notional dividing line between <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> nonmetals, exhibit more pronounced metallic, metalloidal or nonmetallic behaviour than others. The existence of such allotropes can complicate the classification of the elements involved.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> metalloids, sandwiched between the true <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E
5|$|Gallium attacks {{most other}} metals by {{diffusing}} into the metal lattice. For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminium-zinc alloys and steel, making them very brittle.

Numerical results are provided to show the validity of this approach...|$|R

5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition <b>metals,</b> <b>and</b> ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E

5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of heavy metals {{need to be}} treated with caution, as the metals involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy metals tend to be less reactive than lighter <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of lighter <b>metals,</b> <b>and,</b> lighter metals such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|E

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
