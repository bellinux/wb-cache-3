2500|$|According to Eusebius of Caesarea (in his Ecclesiastical History, {{composed}} {{in the early}} 300s), Papias (circa AD 110) refers to a story of Jesus and a woman [...] "accused of many sins" [...] as being found in the Gospel of the Hebrews, which might refer to this passage or to one like it. In the Syriac Didascalia Apostolorum, {{composed in}} the mid-200s, the author, {{in the course of}} instructing bishops to exercise a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>clemency,</b> states that a bishop who does not receive a repentant person would be doing wrong – [...] "for you do not obey our Savior and our God, to do as He also did with her that had sinned, whom the elders set before Him, and leaving the judgment in His hands, departed. [...] But He, the searcher of hearts, asked her and said to her, 'Have the elders condemned thee, my daughter?' She said to Him, 'No, Lord.' [...] And He said unto her, 'Go your way; neither do I condemn thee.' In Him therefore, our Savior and King and God, be your pattern, O bishops." ...|$|E

The contemporary debate on this institution refers to its legitimacy. On the question, this paper has endeavored to show that if the right of pardon enables the re-socialization and reintegration of the offender and regulates criminal justice, which makes it acceptable, its exercise by the President of the Republic and the unpredictability that characterize make it questionable...|$|E

40|$|The pardon power, often {{described}} as a safety valve on the criminal justice system, {{is in a state}} of atrophy. Against a backdrop of “tough-on-crime” rhetoric, a systemic devaluation of rehabilitation efforts, and significant racial disparities in punishment, the disuse <b>of</b> <b>clemency</b> means no possibility of exit for those who have transformed themselves while incarcerated. This Note examines the origins, history, and philosophical underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>clemency</b> in the United States, focusing on the delicate balance between executive discretion and accountability.

The Government of the Republic of Indonesia based on the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia Year 1945 is said to embrace the presidential system. Article 14 paragraph (1) The Constitution of the Republic Indonesia NRI 1945 which states that “The President gives <b>of</b> <b>clemency</b> and rehabilitation by taking into consideration MA (Supreme Court) ”. Granting clemency by the head of state has long been known in history. Granting clemency as “a statement from the highest authority stating that the consequences under criminal law of an offense it being dispensed, either entirely or partially”. View of current law, the agency can no longer be used as the generosity of the head of state, but it should be used as a tool to eliminate the injustice that is if the applicable law in the enforcement could lead to an injustice. The formulation of the problem in this research is how the president's <b>of</b> <b>clemency</b> power is connected with the perspective of constitutional law in Indonesia and how the implementation <b>of</b> <b>clemency</b> is connected with the interests of the state. This research is analytical descriptive with normative juridical approach. In this case also said that granting clemency is not related to the legal assessment of the court, because <b>of</b> <b>clemency</b> is not the president's interference in judicial matters, but rather a constitutional right to grant a clemency...|$|R
40|$|Although clemency {{is often}} an {{offender}} 2 ̆ 7 s final prospect to avoid execution within the death penalty context, prior research concerning clemency decisions remains limited {{by the fact that}} it is often atheoretical and researchers have used data more than a decade old. This study specifically placed clemency decisions within a focal concerns framework and examined death row inmates who were either executed or granted clemency between 1984 and 2008. This study used logistic regression as its primary modeling technique to examine whether <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> focal concerns theory were predictive <b>of</b> <b>clemency</b> decisions. While the current measures for offender blameworthiness and protection of the community were not found to influence clemency decisions, practical constraints and consequences measured by political factors and regional location along with offender characteristics were found to predict such decisions. Female offenders, non-white offenders, and offenders with lower educational levels were most likely to be granted clemency. Whereas lame duck governors were more likely to grant clemency, governors in southern states were less likely to grant <b>clemency.</b> The odds <b>of</b> <b>clemency</b> were reduced with each year an offender served...|$|R
