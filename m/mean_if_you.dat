500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as I had {{hoped it would}} be. I <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were going to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, {{it would have been}} nice to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mack {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{catchers}} to position himself directly behind home plate instead of in front of the backstop. [...] According to Wilbert Robinson, [...] "Mack never was <b>mean</b> ... <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had any soft spot, Connie would find it. He could do and say things that got more under your skin than the cuss words used by other catchers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott has {{developed}} a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: [...] "I like working, always, {{with a minimum of}} three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [...] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and– whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up– then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on." ...|$|E

2500|$|From April to August 2011, RT ran {{a half-hour}} primetime show Adam vs. the Man, hosted by former Iraq War Marine veteran and {{high-profile}} anti-war activist Adam Kokesh. David Weigel writes that Kokesh defended RT's [...] "propaganda" [...] function, saying [...] "We're {{putting out the}} truth {{that no one else}} wants to say. I <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want {{to put it in the}} worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit." [...] The conservative media watchdog Accuracy in Media criticized Kokesh's appearance on RT, writing RT uses Americans like Kokesh to make propaganda points.|$|E
2500|$|He was a {{guest on}} The Howard Stern Show on April 10, 2008; {{when he was asked}} if he would direct Ghostbusters III and cast Howard, he said [...] "Do you know how many times I get asked if I want to do Ghostbusters III? Looking at my career so far, I <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> just looked at my two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Buffett {{described}} {{the health care}} reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. Buffett thinks health care costs should head towards 13 to 14% of GDP. (Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the CMS actuary has projected health care costs will reach almost 20% of GDP by 2020.) Buffett said [...] "If you want the very best, I <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).|$|E

2500|$|In a 2007 Beat the Blizzard webzine's article, {{the writer}} Jan Lindsø states that [...] "any metal fans {{are of the}} opinion that Christians should 'not be allowed' to use the black metal {{aesthetics}} musically since they do not inherit this evil and perhaps misantropic [...] trait that many people say is necessary in order to be convincing as black metal musicians". Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to be a Christian, be it with all you've got, {{and if you want to}} be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at all to do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] he said, {{a trifle}} piqued. [...] "I rather imagine it {{concerns}} {{you more than}} it does me. Cut the 'tub' by all <b>means,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think best. But {{it has been the}} usual thing, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'John Grueby {{is quite}} right,' {{interposed}} Mr Gashford, falling back hastily. 'My lord, a life so precious as yours {{must not be}} put in peril. Go forward, John, by all <b>means.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{have any reason to}} suspect the fellow, blow his brains out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|EMMA, who, {{though she}} has not {{formerly}} thought much of Roger, is now proud to trot by his side and will henceforth count the salutes, 'I know what he <b>means.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> carry a sword the snipers know you are an officer, and they try to pick you off.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Hetty eagerly. [...] "That is {{just what}} I <b>mean.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> saw they wanted anarchy, Larry, you {{would come back to}} us? We should be glad to have you!" ...|$|E

6000|$|But Giotto {{came from}} the field, and saw with his simple eyes a lowlier worth. And he painted--the Madonna, and St. Joseph, and the Christ,--yes, by all <b>means</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> choose to call them so, but essentially,--Mamma, Papa, and the Baby. And all Italy threw up its cap,--"Ora ha Giotto il grido." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must {{trouble you}} not {{to tell me that}} you didn't <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please, Dombey,' said Miss Blimber, who {{preserved}} an awful politeness in her admonitions. 'That is a line of argument I couldn't dream of permitting.' ...|$|E
