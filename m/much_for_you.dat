500|$|Halos PC port {{garnered}} mixed {{reactions and}} received a score of 83% on Metacritic.

[...] In her final mention of John in her diary, Queen Mary wrote simply [...] "miss the dear child very much indeed." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward's {{youngest}} brother, Prince John, {{died at the}} age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after {{a severe}} seizure. John suffered from epilepsy, and Edward, who was 11 years older than his brother and had hardly known him, saw his death as [...] "little more than a regrettable nuisance". He wrote to his mistress of the time that [...] " [...] told [...] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic. 's been practically shut up for the last two years anyhow, so no one has ever seen him except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else." [...] He also wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost. She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: [...] "I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie meant to me who hardly knew him... I feel so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> darling Mama, who was his mother." ...|$|E

2500|$|Monk had {{disappeared}} from the scene by the mid-1970s and made {{only a small number}} of appearances during the final decade of his life. His last studio recordings as a leader were made in November 1971 for the English Black Lion label, near the end of a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz, a group which included Gillespie, Kai Winding, Sonny Stitt, Al McKibbon, and Blakey. Bassist McKibbon, who had known Monk for over twenty years and played on his final tour in 1971, later said: [...] "On that tour, Monk said about two words. I mean literally maybe two words. He didn't say 'Good morning,' 'Goodnight,' 'What time?' Nothing. Why, I don't know. He sent word back after the tour was over that the reason he couldn't communicate or play was that Art Blakey and I were so ugly." [...] A different side of Monk is revealed in Lewis Porter's biography, John Coltrane: His Life and Music; Coltrane states: [...] "Monk is exactly the opposite of Miles : he talks about music all the time, and he wants so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to understand that if, by chance, you ask him something, he'll spend hours if necessary to explain it to you." [...] Blakey reports that Monk was excellent at both chess and checkers.|$|E

"The Lord {{is to be}} thanked first," [...] {{said the}} pretty Puritan, [...] "who gave thee, lady, the kind and courteous husband whose love has done so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee.</b> I, too, have done my poor share.

6000|$|... 'If you {{had never}} yielded to this fatal mania, Pancks,' said Clennam, more in commiseration than retaliation, 'it {{would have been}} how <b>much</b> better <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> and how <b>much</b> better <b>for</b> me!' ...|$|R
