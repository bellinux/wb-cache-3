5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, organ {{builders}} began to incorporate digital components into their key, stop, and combination actions. Besides making these mechanisms simpler and more reliable, this also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to record and play back an organist's performance via the MIDI protocol. In addition, some organ builders have incorporated digital stops into their pipe organs.|$|E
5|$|Several details {{contribute}} {{to the fact that}} there are only a few technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to use zirconium for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium-free zirconium in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.|$|E

The nucleic acid double helix has a robust, defined three-dimensional geometry that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to predict and design {{the structures of}} more complicated nucleic acid complexes. Many such structures have been created, including two- and three-dimensional structures, and periodic, aperiodic, and discrete structures.|$|E

5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> {{to hold together}} all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E
5|$|Extant {{documentation}} <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> {{to follow}} the competition more clearly than {{in the case of}} the shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E

5|$|Mathematically, tessellations can be {{extended}} to spaces other than the Euclidean plane. The Swiss geometer Ludwig Schläfli pioneered this by defining polyschemes, which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schläfli symbol notation {{to make it easy}} to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schläfli notation <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. It <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to store large amounts of information outside {{of the human body}} and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort {{have proved to be}} very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue allow {{players to}} trade Pokémon between two {{cartridges}} via a Game Link Cable. This method of trading {{must be done}} to fully complete the Pokédex since certain Pokémon will only evolve upon being traded and each of the two games have version-exclusive Pokémon. The Link Cable also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to battle another player's Pokémon team. When playing Red or Blue on a Game Boy Advance or SP, the standard GBA/SP link cable will not work; players must use the Nintendo Universal Game Link Cable instead. Moreover, the English versions of the games are incompatible with their Japanese counterparts, and such trades will corrupt the save files, as the games use different languages and therefore character sets.|$|E
