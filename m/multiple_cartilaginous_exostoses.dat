Resection was adequate for the osteochondromas, and no recurrence was observed. Out of 14 <b>multiple</b> <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>exostoses,</b> three, all in flat bones showed malignant change. The predominant sites of chondroma were the finger and toe bones, and curettage and bone graft was adequate treatment. Neither recurrence nor malignant change was observed. Two cases of chondromatosis, one of Ollier's disease and one of Maffucci's syndrome, were included in our series. Leg length discrepancy and pathologic fracture were common problems in chondromatosis. Moreover, malignant change was suspected in a hemangioma of the Maffucci's syndrome patient. Benign chondroblastoma was treated by curettage and bone graft, with no recurrence. In our series, 4 primary and 3 secondary chondrosarcomas were observed. Metastasis was seen in only one case. Because of {{the discrepancy between the}} biological behavior and histological findings of cartilaginous bone tumors, the malignancy of tumors should be evaluated by clinical signs and symptoms as well as by histological findings. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{one case}} of forearm deformity {{in a patient}} affected by <b>multiple</b> <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>exostoses</b> – {{also known as the}} forearm “candy stick deformity”. Surgical treatment usually concentrates on the correction of the wrist deformity without correcting the forearm shortening, the latter not being given the same consideration as lower limb shortening. In the presented case, radius and ulna corticotomies were performed and distal forearm deformity and shortening were corrected by two independent monoaxial external fixators, with full pronosupination. It is our belief that simultaneous treatment of forearm shortening and deformity not only results in an improved clinical and functional result, but also provides significant psychological benefit.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thirty-five {{patients}} who had <b>multiple</b> <b>cartilaginous</b> exostosis and deformities of the wrist and forearm were evaluated to determine the natural his-tory and prognostic factors for the deformities. Radial and ulnar shortening were correlated linearly (r = 0. 86), showing that both bones of the forearm were symmetrically involved. The angular growth abnormal-ity of the distal aspect of the radius was correlated with radial shortening (r = 0. 53) and ulnar shortening (r = 0. 61), but it had no correlation with negative variance of the ulna (r 2 = 0. 30).

40|$|Background. <b>Multiple</b> <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>exostoses</b> cause various {{deformities}} of the epiphysis. In exostoses of the ulna, the ulna is shortened and {{the radius}} acquires varus deformity, which {{may lead to}} dislocation of the radial head. In this study, we present the results of exostoses resection, with correction and lengthening with external fixators for functional and cosmetic improvement, and prevention of radial head dislocation. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed seven forearms of seven patients who had deformities of the forearm associated with <b>multiple</b> <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>exostoses.</b> One patient had dislocation of the radial head. Operative technique was excision of osteochondromas from the distal ulna, correction of the radius, and ulnar lengthening with external fixation up to 5 mm plus variance. We evaluated radiographs {{and the range of}} pronation and supination. Furthermore, we conducted a follow-up of ulnar length after the operation. Results. Dislocation of the radial head of one patient was naturally reduced without any operative intervention. At the most recent follow-up, six of the seven patients showed full improvement in pronation-supination. Ulnar shortening recurred with skeletal growth of four skeletally immature patients; however, it did not recur in one skeletally mature patient. Overlength of 5 mm was negated by the recurrence of ulnar shortening about 1. 5 years after the operation. Conclusions. We treated seven forearms of seven patients by excision of osteochondromas, correction of radii, and gradual lengthening of ulnas with external fixators. The results of the procedure were satisfactory, especially for function of the elbow and wrist. However, we must consider the possible recurrence of ulnar shortening within about 1. 5 years during skeletal growth periods in immature patients. © 2006 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association...|$|E

Investigation revealed multiple, additional, non-aggressive, polyostotic proliferations of bone and cartilage throughout the puppy’s skeleton. The lesions, ranging from 1 cm to 9 cm in diameter, were present on his limbs, ribs, vertebrae, within his vertebral canal, and on his pelvis. Although the genetic, autosomal dominant disease is benign, the dysplastic, proliferative masses grow rapidly until the animal reaches physical maturity. MCE is a self limiting disease except when the masses disrupt vital structures, and in this patient, the lesions were compressing his lungs causing clinical deficits.

This study systematically reviewed GSDs as defined in “Nosology and Classification of genetic skeletal disorders (2010 version) ” using Chinese biomedical literature published over the past 34 years from 1978 to 2012. In total, 16, 099 GSDs have been reported. The most frequently reported disorders were Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, fibrous dysplasia, mucopolysaccharidosis, <b>multiple</b> <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>exostoses,</b> neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1), osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, enchondromatosis (Ollier), and osteopoikilosis, accounting for 76. 5 % (12, 312 cases) of the total cases. Five groups (group 8, 12, 14, 18, 21) defined by “Nosology and Classification of genetic skeletal disorders” have not been reported in the Chinese biomedical literature. Gene mutation testing was performed in only a minor portion of the 16, 099 cases of GSDs (187 cases, 1. 16 %). In total, 37 genes for 41 different GSDs were reported in Chinese biomedical literature, including 43 novel mutations.

40|$|In {{clinical}} practice various modalities {{are used for}} whole-body imaging of the musculoskeletal system, including radiography, bone scintigraphy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). Multislice CT is far more sensitive than radiographs {{in the assessment of}} trabecular and cortical bone destruction and allows for evaluation of fracture risk. The introduction of combined PET-CT scanners has markedly increased diagnostic accuracy for the detection of skeletal metastases compared with PET alone. The unique soft-tissue contrast of MRI enables for precise assessment of bone marrow infiltration and adjacent soft tissue structures so that alterations within the bone marrow may be detected before osseous destruction becomes apparent in CT or metabolic changes occur on bone scintigraphy or PET scan. Improvements in hard- and software, including parallel image acquisition acceleration, have made high resolution whole-body MRI clinically feasible. Whole-body MRI has successfully been applied for bone marrow screening of metastasis and systemic primary bone malignancies, like multiple myeloma.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed twenty-three patients (thirty-one forearms) after a mean duration of follow-up of nearly thirteen years. The mean age at the time of the initial procedure was eleven years. The patients underwent a variety of surgical procedures, including excision of exostoses; corrective procedures (lengthening of the radius or ulna and/or corrective osteotomy of the radius and/or ulna) and open reduction or excision of a dislocated radial head. Clinical evaluation involved the assessment of pain, activities of daily living, the cosmetic outcome, and the ranges of motion of the wrist, forearm, and elbow.

40|$|Background: Synovial chondromatosis is a rare, benign {{disorder}} characterised by {{neoplastic proliferation}} of numerous chondral nodules in joint synovium, bursae or tendon sheaths. The disease is usually diagnosed in the third, {{fourth and fifth}} decades of life and is twice as common in men. In most cases, it affects one joint but may appear bilaterally (in up to 10 % of patients). The most common location is the knee joint. Computed tomography (CT) is the best method for detection of calcified intraarticular bodies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also implicate presence of synovial chondromatosis - on T 2 -weighted images calcifications are visible as focal areas of signal void within hyperintense fluid, with hypertrophic synovium. In addition, this technique may show possible extraarticular disease involvement. Ultrasound examination is an alternative method of imaging of synovial chondromatosis.

40|$|Hereditary {{multiple}} exostoses (HME) {{syndrome is}} an autosomal dominant inherited human disorder, which {{is characterized by}} the formation of <b>multiple</b> <b>cartilaginous</b> capped benign tumors (exostoses) that develop from the growth plate of endochondral bones. So far HME has been linked to missense or frameshift mutations in the tumor suppressor genes Ext 1 and Ext 2. Both are glycosyltransferases involved in heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis. It has been shown that in Drosophila the homolog of Ext 1, tout velu (ttv), is required for transport of hedgehog (Hh). One of the vertebrate homologs of Hh, Indian hedgehog (Ihh), is a key regulator of endochondral ossification. Ext 1 knockout mice are embryonic lethal due to gastrulation defects. We are analyzing a mouse line carrying a hypomorphic allele of Ext 1 obtained from a genetrap screen (Ext 1 -GT). Since Ext 1 mutations lead to skeletal deformations in human patients we started to analyze the role of Ext 1 and HS-chains during endochondral ossification focussing on the potential role of Ext 1 in mediating the Ihh signal. Analysis of the Ext 1 -GT mutants revealed a severe delay in chondrocyte differentiation. We could show that less amounts of HS in these mutants allow further diffusion of Ihh whereas treatment of limb explants in a limb culture system with heparin leads to a restriction of the Ihh signal. These experiments implicate an important role of HS in establishing a gradient of Ihh signalling in cartilage thereby regulating chondrocyte differentiation...|$|R

In this paper we report a case of synovial chon-dromatosis of the temporomandibular joint which is of interest not only because of its location but also because of its unusual histological appearance. Case Report A fifty-three-year-old white woman noted a swelling in front of the right ear in October 1974. It became increasingly painful over the next several months. A surgeon resected the superficial lobe of the parotid gland. During the operation he palpated a mass involving the tem-poromandihular joint which he aspirated but did not biopsy. A roent-A low-magnification photomicrograph of the synovium featuring mul-tiple cartilaginous nodules. The stroma is moderately vascular (hematoxylin and eosin, x 100) ...|$|R
30|$|Multiple osteochondromas (also called {{hereditary}} multiple exostoses) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterized by <b>multiple</b> <b>cartilaginous</b> tumors, which {{are caused by}} mutations in the genes for exostosin- 1 (EXT 1) and exostosin- 2 (EXT 2). The goal {{of this study was}} to elucidate the genetic alterations in a family with three affected members. Isolation of RNA from the patients’ blood followed by reverse transcription and PCR amplification of selected fragments showed that the three patients lack a specific region of 90  bp from their EXT 1 mRNA. This region corresponds to the sequence of exon 8 from the EXT 1 gene. No splice site mutation was found around exon 8. However, long-range PCR amplification of the region from intron 7 to intron 8 indicated that the three patients contain a deletion of 4318  bp, which includes exon 8 and part of the flanking introns. There is evidence that the deletion was caused by non-homologous end joining because the breakpoints are not located within a repetitive element, but contain multiple copies of the deletion hotspot sequence TGRRKM. Exon 8 encodes part of the active site of the EXT 1 enzyme, including the DXD signature of all UDP-sugar glycosyltransferases. It is conceivable that the mutant protein exerts a dominant negative effect on the activity of the EXT glycosyltransferase since it might interact with normal copies of the enzyme to form an inactive hetero-oligomeric complex. We suggest that sequencing of RNA might be superior to exome sequencing to detect short deletions of a single exon.|$|R
30|$|Multiple osteochondromas (MO), {{also called}} {{hereditary}} multiple exostoses (HME), is a genetic, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by <b>multiple</b> benign <b>cartilaginous</b> tumors. These tumors (or exostoses) form {{next to the}} growth plate of long bones, ribs and pelvis and protrude into the adjacent perichondrium and neighboring tissue (Huegel et al. 2013). Patients with MO are frequently of short stature and show shortened forearms, changes in the angle of fingers and ankle and unequal length of limbs. Most of the patients have to undergo repetitive surgery to {{remove some of the}} exostoses because they cause pain or functional impairment (Pedrini et al. 2011). The most serious complication of MO is a malignant transformation into a secondary chondrosarcoma, which occurs in 1 – 5  % of the patients.|$|R
40|$|Hereditary {{multiple}} exostoses (HME), a dominantly inherited {{genetic disorder}} characterized by <b>multiple</b> <b>cartilaginous</b> tumors, {{is caused by}} mutations in members of the EXT gene family, EXT 1 or EXT 2. The corresponding gene products, exostosin- 1 (EXT 1) and exostosin- 2 (EXT 2), are type II transmembrane glycoproteins which form a Golgi-localized heterooligomeric complex that catalyzes the polymerization of heparan sulfate (HS). Although {{the majority of the}} etiological mutations in EXT are splice-site, frameshift, or nonsense mutations that result in premature termination, 12 missense mutations have also been identified. Furthermore, two of the reported etiological missense mutations (G 339 D and R 340 C) have been previously shown to abrogate HS biosynthesis (McCormick et al. 1998). Here, a functional assay that detects HS expression on the cell surface of an EXT 1 -deficient cell line was used to test the remaining missense mutant exostosin proteins for their ability to rescue HS biosynthesis in vivo. Our results show that EXT 1 mutants bearing six of these missense mutations (D 164 H, R 280 G/S, and R 340 S/H/L) are also defective in HS expression, but surprisingly, four (Q 27 K, N 316 S, A 486 V, and P 496 L) are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type EXT 1. Three of these four “active” mutations affect amino acids that are not conserved among vertebrates and invertebrates, whereas all of the HS-biosynthesis null mutations affect only conserved amino acids. Further, substitution or deletion of each of these four residues does not abrogate HS biosynthesis. Taken together, these results indicate that several of the reported etiological mutant EXT forms retain the ability to synthesize and express HS on the cell surface. The corresponding missense mutations may therefore represent rare genetic polymorphisms in the EXT 1 gene or may interfere with as yet undefined functions of EXT 1 that are involved in HME pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} patient with tracheopathia osteoplastica (TPO), a rare or perhaps underrecognized disorder, {{detected}} in approximately 1 in every 2000 to 5000 patients who undergo bronchoscopy. TPO is marked by proliferation of bony and cartilaginous spurs leading to airway stenosis. <b>Multiple</b> submucosal <b>cartilaginous</b> and osseous nodules can develop in the respiratory tract and may involve the entire trachea and mainstem bronchi. Symptoms may range from a completely silent condition to life-threatening respiratory failure and diagnosis is made based on radiological and bronchoscopic findings. Although the etiology has not been established, TPO can be familial and is sometimes associated with chronic inflammation, such as seen with rheumatic diseases. This case highlights the need for understanding TPO {{so that it can}} be differentiated from potentially serious conditions such as necrotizing granulomatous diseases, invasive infections, and cancer...|$|R
