2500|$|The quarter-wave {{monopole}} antenna is a single-element antenna fed at one end, that behaves as a dipole antenna. It is formed by a conductor [...] in length, fed {{in the lower}} end, which is near a conductive surface which works as a reflector (see effect of ground) and {{is an example of}} a <b>Marconi</b> <b>antenna.</b> The current in the reflected image has the same direction and phase as the current in the real antenna. The quarter-wave conductor and its image together form a half-wave dipole that radiates only in the upper half of space.|$|E
50|$|The {{monopole}} antenna {{was invented in}} 1895 and patented 1896 by radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi during his historic first experiments in radio communication. He began by using dipole antennas invented by Heinrich Hertz consisting of two identical horizontal wires ending in metal plates. He found by experiment that if instead of the dipole, {{one side of the}} transmitter and receiver was connected to a wire suspended overhead, and the other side was connected to the Earth, he could transmit for longer distances. For this reason the monopole is also called a <b>Marconi</b> <b>antenna,</b> although Alexander Popov independently invented it at about the same time.|$|E
50|$|The {{monopole}} is a resonant antenna; the rod {{functions as}} an open resonator for radio waves, oscillating with standing waves of {{voltage and current}} along its length. Therefore, {{the length of the}} antenna is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves it is used with. The most common form is the quarter-wave monopole, in which the antenna is approximately ¼ of the wavelength of the radio waves. The monopole antenna was invented in 1895 by radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi; for this reason it is sometimes called the <b>Marconi</b> <b>antenna.</b> Common types of monopole antenna are the whip, rubber ducky, helical, random wire, umbrella, inverted-L and T-antenna, inverted-F, mast radiator, and ground plane antennas.|$|E

50|$|The {{counterpoise}} evolved {{with the}} <b>Marconi</b> (monopole) <b>antenna</b> during the 1890s, {{the first decade}} of radio in the wireless telegraphy era, but it was particularly advocated by British radio pioneer Oliver Lodge, and patented by his associate Alexander Muirhead in 1907.|$|R
50|$|The term Marconi rig {{was first}} {{applied to the}} tall Bermuda rig used on larger racing yachts, such as the J class used since 1914 for the America's Cup {{international}} yacht races, as - with the many supporting cables required - it reminded observers of Guglielmo <b>Marconi's</b> mast-like wireless <b>antennas</b> (<b>Marconi's</b> first demonstrations in the United States {{took place in the}} autumn of 1899, with the reporting of the America's Cup at New York). Although sometimes treated as interchangeable with Bermuda rig generally, some purists insist that Marconi rig refers only to the very tall Bermuda rig used on yachts like the J-class.|$|R

50|$|The {{wireless}} telegraphy - trials took place {{first at the}} Technical University of Berlin, and then between Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow and the marine station Kongsnaes in Potsdam. On 7 October 1897, he established a 21-kilometer radio link between Schöneberg and Rangsdorf, a world record at the time. The following summer, he established a link between Berlin to Jüterbog with the end-points being over 60 km apart. Crucial improvements led to the success, not of spark gap transmission antennas as used by <b>Marconi,</b> but inductive <b>antennas.</b>|$|R
50|$|Guglielmo Marconi {{pioneered the}} use of short wave radio for long {{distance}} transmissions in the early 1920s. Using a system of parabolic reflector <b>antennae,</b> <b>Marconi's</b> assistant, Charles Samuel Franklin, rigged up a large antenna at Poldhu Wireless Station, Cornwall, running on 25 kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht Elettra in the Cape Verde Islands. High speed shortwave telegraphy circuits were then installed from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the Imperial Wireless Chain from 1926.|$|R
