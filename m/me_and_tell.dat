500|$|Tillman {{told the}} Senate, [...] "as {{governor}} of South Carolina, I proclaimed that, although I {{had taken the}} oath of office to support the law and enforce it, I would lead a mob to lynch any man, black or white, who ravished a woman, black or white." [...] He told his colleagues, [...] "I have three daughters, but, so help me God, I had rather find either one of them killed by a tiger or a bear [...] than to have her crawl to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> me the horrid story that she had been robbed of the jewel of her womanhood by a black fiend."

And they've all assured me that they don't."

6000|$|... "I went at last because I {{wanted to}} see that boy agin, and the young {{policeman}} follered me quite a long way, shaking his silly 'ead at <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> to be careful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Imagine the man {{coming to}} <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> {{that he was}} a friend of Goarly's. I rather liked him for it. There was a {{thorough}} pluck about it. They say he's going to find all the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not well}} see how Mr. Marble can {{contradict}} <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> the truth, my lord--but it were better I should hear his statement." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{was what}} Aunt Becky calls shiftless, I guess. She says you are; but I don't mind {{as long as}} you take care of <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> me stories." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] {{answered}} the boy, with a shy smile, [...] "when the rats {{make too much}} noise. But nearly every night, when sister goes out, Mother Geehan stays a while with <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> funny stories. I'm not often afraid, sir." ...|$|R
50|$|Let <b>me</b> ponder, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> what I {{think of}} the dead.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why is Fairy Blackstick always advising <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> how {{to manage}} my government, <b>and</b> warning <b>me</b> to keep my word? Does she suppose that I am not a man of sense, and a man of honour?' asks Giglio testily. 'Methinks she rather presumes upon her position.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Write to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> me of yourself. Do you {{remember}} what Rousseau said to some one--"Have we quarrelled? you have talked to me often, and never once mentioned yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I seem to {{have touched}} some chord of {{recollection}} in your mind, O my saviour of Dunwich," [...] said the Man. [...] "Look at <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> me, who am I?" ...|$|E

60|$|Jerry's {{father had}} gone with the fleet, and, as she said, only {{those who had been}} opposed to the war with England, {{remained}} at home.

6000|$|... "Well, I {{am going}} to. And if you gentlemen all {{agreed to pay}} in advance I could make Hamilton pay up, too.
