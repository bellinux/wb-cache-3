5000|$|Serious botches {{resulting}} in injuries often result in improvised endings to matches, or {{the remainder of}} a <b>match</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>canceled</b> if a wrestler cannot continue or requires immediate medical attention. During the match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Owen Hart at Summerslam 1997, Hart botched a piledriver, breaking Austin's neck. Hart was forced to improvise an extended taunt sequence until Austin was able regain his composure and roll him up in a schoolboy pin, ending the match earlier than planned but with the desired winner. If a wrestler is seriously injured, the referee normally signals the need for immediate help by doing an [...] "X" [...] formation with {{his arms over his}} head. In recent years, as some wrestling fans have noticed this, the referee may sometimes perform the symbol in an attempt to indicate a kayfabe injury to another performer, which will lead to the match being called off.|$|R
