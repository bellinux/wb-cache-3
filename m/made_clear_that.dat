5|$|Kikuyu girls {{cut each}} other's vulvas in the 1950s {{as a symbol}} of defiance, {{in the context of the}} {{campaign}} against female genital mutilation in colonial Kenya. The movement came to be known as Ngaitana ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> its victims were also its perpetrators.|$|E

5|$|Others who {{expressed}} {{their interest in}} running included Texas representatives Bill Flores and Michael McCaul, Georgia representative Lynn Westmoreland, Montana representative Ryan Zinke, and California representative and former Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa. However, several candidates <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they would only run if Ryan chose not to, including Issa, McCaul, and Minnesota representative John Kline. On October 12, Flores confirmed that he would run for Speaker, but stated that he would run only if Ryan {{stayed out of the}} contest.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} {{started on}} a sour note, however, when an ownership dispute forced Benson to pull San Antonio out on the same evening the franchise was to be formally introduced. Anderson decided {{to continue with the}} venture after Bensons's withdrawal, but <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{he did not want to}} be the only American franchise after 1993.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{point of}} the Dictum was the {{re-establishment}} of royal authority. The Provisions of Oxford, that had been forced on the king, were repudiated, and it was <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the appointment of ministers was entirely a royal prerogative. King Henry in turn reconfirmed Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest. Measures were taken to renounce the increasing veneration of the fallen Simon de Montfort, whom some were already starting to consider a martyr and a possible saint.|$|E

5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} clear in 1922 {{that he would}} never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conviction}} for manslaughter in 1967 of the Christian Scientist mother of five-year-old Lisa Sheridan, who died without medical care in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the church lobbied the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) {{to add a}} religious exemption to the Code of Federal Regulations. Added in 1974, this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for religious reasons would not be considered negligent. States were thereafter obliged to include exemptions or lose funding; {{the wording of the}} exemptions <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they referred to Christian Science.|$|E
5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> although the Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{failed to}} {{recognize}} Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations that started on December 22, 1917, between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims. During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Council would serve only as an advisory board. This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken {{that led to the}} reformulation of previous versions of the Act.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Corzine, and {{managers}} including Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a court ruling relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the appeal {{was not an}} attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding how those claims would be handled by the trustee after they were paid. Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money and had no desire {{for this to be}} delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, The Telegraph {{reported}} that Miller {{would be allowed}} to leave Manchester United, should the Red Devils receive a suitable offer. It was <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Miller was not part of Alex Ferguson's plans when, despite the huge number of senior players missing, he was still only a substitute in the opening game of the Red Devils' tour of South Africa against Orlando Pirates on 16 July 2006. On 31 August 2006, he moved to Sunderland for free on a three-year deal, joining up with new Sunderland manager and former team-mate Roy Keane. He left Manchester United after playing just nine league games in two seasons.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{stayed with}} the Browns until early 1968, when he quit and was {{replaced}} by Nick Skorich. The Browns had offered him a part-time coaching job but <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he could not stay on as offensive coordinator; Jones declined the reduced role. After leaving the Browns, Jones moved back to Ruston and did occasional scouting for the team at the nearby Grambling State University. He was also a volunteer coach of receivers on Grambling's football team. Later in life, he worked for his son Tom's general contracting business in Ruston.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real. Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye {{to come up with a}} monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|The Court <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of {{the interests}} of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} the sortie was to attack Japanese {{transports}} at Kota Bharu, but in the afternoon of 9 December the Japanese submarine I-56 spotted the British ships, and in the evening they were detected by Japanese aerial reconnaissance. By this time it had been <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> no RAF fighter support would be forthcoming. At midnight a signal was received that Japanese forces were landing at Kuantan in Malaya. Force Z was diverted to investigate. At 02:11 on 10 December the force was again sighted by a Japanese submarine and at 08:00 arrived off Kuantan, {{only to discover that}} the reported landings were a diversion.|$|E
5|$|To {{reestablish}} their {{supply lines}} and retake {{the towns of}} Bardaï, Zouar and Wour, the Libyans sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, also {{through the use of}} napalm. This attack ultimately backfired, causing the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 FANT soldiers to link with the GUNT forces. Also Mitterrand reacted forcefully, ordering a mission which parachuted fuel, food, ammunition and anti-tank missiles to the rebels, and also infiltrated military personnel. Through this action, the French <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they no longer felt committed to keep south of the Red Line, and were ready to act whenever they found it necessary.|$|E
5|$|Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House {{to inform}} him {{personally}} {{and ask him}} to resign. Gibbs <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.|$|E
