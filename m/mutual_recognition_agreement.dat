40|$|This paper {{presents}} a baseline model that illustrates {{the implications of}} <b>Mutual</b> <b>Recognition</b> <b>Agreements</b> (MRAs) for excluded nations. The model shows that MRAs can harm third country exports because of a trade-diversion effect. We use highly disaggregated trade data from developed and developing nations to test whether or not MRAs {{have a negative effect}} on exports from excluded nations.
