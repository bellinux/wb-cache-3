5|$|One of {{the main}} tools {{forensic}} anthropologists use {{in the identification of}} remains is their knowledge of osteology and the various differences that occur within the human skeleton. During the course of an investigation, anthropologists are often tasked with helping to determinate an individual's sex, stature, age, and ancestry. To do this, anthropologists <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how the human skeleton can differ between individuals.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used}} to determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned {{on the sides of}} their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} not on actual {{arithmetic}} computation, {{but rather on}} conceptual understanding and interpretation. The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves exploring data and covers 20–30% of the exam. Students are expected to use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions of data, including univariate, bivariate, and categorical data. The second theme involves planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that {{can be drawn from}} the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E

5000|$|In his work, Moran {{prefers the}} term [...] "interviewers" [...] to [...] "interrogators", and {{suggests}} that the interviewer <b>must</b> <b>be</b> constantly <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his attitude to the prisoner. He further writes that a superior or demeaning attitude breeds nothing but antagonism and resistance. He encourages the interviewer {{to be able to}} speak the language of his captives, without translators. While on the outside Moran's techniques seem to be chitchat, the interviewer <b>must</b> <b>be</b> constantly <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the goals: [...] "Deep human sympathy can go with a business-like, systematic, and ruthlessly persistent approach.” ...|$|R
25|$|In {{physiological}} state {{soft tissues}} usually present residual stress {{that may be}} released when the tissue is excised. Physiologists and histologists <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this fact to avoid mistakes when analyzing excised tissues. This retraction usually causes a visual artifact.|$|E

As of 2017 evidence does not support a long-term benefit for weight loss or in diabetes. Because its breakdown products include phenylalanine, people with the genetic condition phenylketonuria (PKU) <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this as an additional source.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} be {{knowledgeable}} contributors, children <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their surroundings and community's goals. Children's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community. Through this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity {{that they are doing}} within their community and become active participants because they know they are doing it for their community.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{the public}} {{is a major factor}} for the {{effective}} prevention of eutrophication. In order for a policy to have any effect, the public <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their contribution to the problem, and ways in which they can reduce their effects. Programs instituted to promote participation in the recycling and elimination of wastes, as well as education on the issue of rational water use are necessary to protect water quality within urbanized areas and adjacent water bodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{autonomy}} {{functions of}} the Model S, including Autosteer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, have limitations {{that have led to}} collisions when the driver becomes inattentive. Tesla warns in the owners manual that drivers always <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> road conditions and not rely on the cruise control to prevent a collision, as the system may not detect stationary vehicles or obstacles, bicycles, and pedestrians. However, critics such as scientist Andrew Ng have accused Tesla of being irresponsible by releasing a product with such limitations as it can lull drivers into a false sense of security.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} relational dialectics theory, one <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the assumption {{that there are three}} different types of relational dialectics.

25|$|Although {{the goals}} of any {{discussion}} will change depending upon what's under discussion, some goals {{will always be the}} same: to illuminate the subject, to unravel its mysteries, to interpret and share and learn from other points of view, to piece together the puzzle using everyone's contribution. Discussion skills are important. Everyone <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how to get this discussion rolling and keep it rolling and interesting. Just as in any sport, a number of skills are necessary to work on and use at appropriate times. Everyone is expected to contribute by using these skills.|$|E
25|$|The Wii U GamePad was {{described}} as a survival kit for players. It was inspired by the studio's previous game, Peter Jackson's King Kong, in which players make use of the environment to survive (such as using a torch to scare off enemies); the team made the GamePad a survival kit, taking considerable time to fine-tune the GamePad's functions. Although it was initially possible for players to plan strategy with the GamePad, they rarely did so. The team then retooled the system to include features such as the mini-map, resulting in players focusing on the GamePad and ignoring the action on the TV. Eventually, the team balanced player time on both screens by switching from first- to third-person perspective when the player uses the survival kit. Players are vulnerable when using the kit, prompting them to look at the TV screen while using the GamePad. This increases the game's tension, making it more scary to play. According to Guillaume, the team realized this potential when they implemented the lock-pick feature (when players <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their surroundings while trying to unlock a door). To further immerse players in the game, the voice of the Prepper is channeled through the GamePad's speakers and players need to read text with the pad; since the GamePad is a real-world object, the experience is more intimate. The pad displayed most crucial information to the player, and the game did not have a user interface.|$|E
25|$|School psychologists provide {{intervention}} and treatment to reach goals. They assist with trauma and crisis; work with children, teachers, and families {{to deal with}} hurdles that are preventing success; educate and expand skills to cope with problems. They utilize prevention and early intervention to limit troubles in children’s lives and in the school environment. School psychologists help create an equal and encouraging school, bring attention to mental health issues and develop {{ways to deal with}} issues individually and school-wide, they team up with teachers and parents to address effective behavior plans, and ensure acceptance and value of diversity. School psychologists administer assessments and address difficulties all students face in psychological, social, personal, emotional, and educational/learning development. They also review and revise techniques to deal with problems of students and in schools to maintain a good, safe setting. They provide consultation and case management by ensuring students’ needs are met; speak out for students {{in and out of the}} school; make sure all people involved with the student are aware of the needs of the student, what resources are available, and how to get the services; aid in the communication between parents, schools, and community services; and modify achievement plans to best meet needs of student. School psychologists seek assistance from community services in mental health, health, and crisis response; educate the public, parents, and schools through trainings on issues facing students and schools. Finally, School Psychologists are experts in research. As noted by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP, 2007) and the American Psychological Association (APA, 2007), school psychologists adhere to the scientist-practitioner framework and make decisions based on empirical research. School psychologists <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> and contribute to the study of the best approaches to helping students, families, and schools reach their goals.|$|E

50|$|Realists {{believe that}} there are no {{universal}} principles with which all states may guide their actions. Instead, a state <b>must</b> always <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the actions of the states around it and must use a pragmatic approach to resolve problems as they arise.|$|R
50|$|A firm <b>must</b> <b>be</b> prepared, <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{competition}} and ready to face it in the international market. Several companies (competitors) could substitute for products or services of an unpopular firm. A brilliant and innovative strategy will help a firm succeed.|$|R
500|$|Forensic {{toxicology}} is {{the study}} of the pharmacodynamics, or what a substance does to the body, and pharmacokinetics, or what the body does to the substance. [...] To accurately determine the effect a particular drug has on the human body, forensic toxicologists <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> various levels of tolerance that an individual can build up as well as the therapeutic index for various pharmaceuticals. [...] Toxicologists are tasked with determining whether any toxin found in a body was the cause of or contributed to an incident, or whether it was at too low a level to have had an effect. [...] While the determination of the specific toxin can be time-consuming due to the number of different substances that can cause injury or death, certain clues can narrow down the possibilities. [...] For example, carbon monoxide poisoning would result in bright red blood while death from hydrogen sulfide would cause the brain to have a green hue.|$|E
500|$|Henrys left Fez for Meknes {{from which}} he telegraphed Lyautey {{promising}} to [...] "strike hard and fast" [...] so that the [...] "Laverdure disaster" [...] did not threaten the French position in Morocco. [...] He said that [...] "everyone, everywhere <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the fact that our}} forces are numerous, that strong columns are already on their way to Khenifra, and that the repression will be swift". [...] Henrys dispatched Garnier-Duplessix's Groupe Mobile to Khénifra from El Graar and ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Dérigoin to form another Groupe at Ito for mobile support. [...] Garnier-Duplessix was forced to fight his way through groups of Zaian tribesmen and did not reach the town until 16 November. [...] Henrys joined Dérigoin and entered the town himself two days later, encountering no resistance on the way. [...] Another part of the Khénifra relief force was the 6th battalion of the 2nd French Foreign Legion who marched from Mrirt and saw action at El Hammam and along the Oum er Rbia. [...] By {{the end of the month}} the French garrison had swelled to 7,000 troops, an all-time high. [...] Henrys, Garnier-Duplessix and Kroll were all promoted shortly after the battle in recognition of their actions to prevent the loss of Khénifra.|$|E
2500|$|A few {{examples}} will serve {{to illustrate the}} style of the older Midrash halakha. It translates the word [...] "ra'ah" [...] (Ex. xxi. 8) [...] "displease" [...] (Mek., Mishpatim), which is contrary to the interpretation of Rabbi Eliezer. From the expression [...] "be-miksat" [...] (Ex. xii. 4), which, according to it, can mean only [...] "number," [...] the older halakha deduces the rule that when killing the Passover lamb the slaughterer <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the number of persons who are about to partake of it (Mek., Bo, 3 [...] ).|$|E
