25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were not only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going {{all over the world}} at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of his efforts, he is {{considered}} as [...] "one of the greatest wartime heroes". In the foreword to the book The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery, Michael Schudrich, the Chief Rabbi of Poland, wrote as follows: [...] "When God created the human being, God had in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should all be like Captain Witold Pilecki, of blessed memory." [...] In the introduction to that book Norman Davies, a British historian, wrote: [...] "If there was an Allied hero who deserved to be remembered and celebrated, this was a person with few peers." [...] At the commemoration event of International Holocaust Remembrance Day held in the US Holocaust Memorial Museum on 27 January 2013 Ryszard Schnepf, the Polish Ambassador to the US, described Pilecki as a [...] "diamond among Poland's heroes" [...] and [...] "the highest example of Polish patriotism".|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the difficulties, Shankly felt {{immediately}} at home in his new club and he believed that he shared an immediate bond with the supporters, the Liverpool history site saying they [...] "were his kind of people". He quickly established working relationships with the coaching staff of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett who shared his views about loyalty {{to each other and}} to the club. Paisley's influence at Liverpool was [...] "crucial" [...] for, as Kelly puts it, Shankly was [...] "the great motivating force behind Liverpool, but it was Paisley who was the tactician". One aspect of the quartet's legacy to football was the conversion of an old storage room into what became known as the [...] "Boot Room", which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots. Although Shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff, the playing staff were not so impressive – indeed, Shankly said of the latter: [...] "After only one match I knew that the team as a whole was not good enough. I made up my <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed strengthening through the middle, a goalkeeper and a centre half who between them could stop goals, and somebody up front to create goals and score them". To deal with what he saw as a below average playing squad, 24 players were placed on the transfer list and all [...] had left the club within one year.|$|E

2500|$|Wales has speculated on a {{possible}} warning to anonymous editors: [...] "When someone clicks on 'edit,' {{it would be}} interesting if we could say, 'Hi, thank you for editing. We see you're logged in from The New York Times. Keep in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know that, and it's public information' … That might make them stop and think." ...|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Sumerian phonology is certainly very flawed and incomplete {{because of the}} lack of native speakers, the transmission through the filter of Akkadian phonology and the difficulties posed by the cuneiform script. As I.M. Diakonoff observes, [...] "when we try to find out the morphophonological structure of the Sumerian language, we must constantly bear in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not dealing with a language directly but are reconstructing it from a very imperfect mnemonic writing system which had not been basically aimed at the rendering of morphophonemics." ...|$|E
60|$|After this, {{having made}} up our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must attempt the perilous task, came the {{question}} of how it should be done, and on this point the old soldier gave us very little opportunity for discussion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe the}} wisest way, sir, {{is to make}} up our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have reached the point of {{reaction}} in the institutions, {{and be ready to}} submit to the worst. I keep the 'revolver' well primed, and hope to escape being burnt up at least." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; we must {{quite make}} up our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{have got to}} look after ourselves. Fortunately, the Ashantis {{will not be able}} to cross the river to harass them in their retreat; unless, indeed, they know of some ford by which they can get over." ...|$|R
2500|$|In September 2004, the US {{government}} 9/11 Commission {{investigating the}} September 11 attacks officially {{concluded that the}} attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives. In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a videotape released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon: [...] "As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should punish the oppressor in kind {{and that we should}} destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Wasserman {{was taken}} and murdered by Lithuanian {{collaborators}} on the 12th of Tammuz, 1941, in the Seventh Fort of Kaunas Fortress. Before {{he was taken}} he gave this statement: [...] "In Heaven it appears that they deem us to be righteous because our bodies have been chosen to atone for the Jewish people. Therefore, we must repent now, immediately. There is not much time. We must keep in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will be better offerings if we repent. In this way we will {{save the lives of}} our brethren overseas. Let no thought enter our minds, God forbid, which is abominable and which renders an offering unfit. We are now fulfilling the greatest mitzvah. With fire she (Jerusalem) was destroyed and with fire she will be rebuilt. The very fire which consumes our bodies will one day rebuild the Jewish people." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was not in}} our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{would remain}} very long with our new commander. Sergeant Corney {{believed}} General Herkimer had some especial matter in hand in which he thought we three might be of particular service, and when <b>that</b> was done <b>we</b> {{would be allowed to}} return home.|$|R
30|$|Toni {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{insightful}} and creative <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have had the pleasure to know. He always was aware that for a successful research and teaching atmosphere it is very important to realize a friendly atmosphere, to carefully listen to the others, to respect alternative views and to allow the freedom of exploring new directions.|$|R
60|$|Now it {{was that}} I began to {{understand}} what these two were driving at. They were <b>minded</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> of the company should decide the question before us without aid from them, {{and it was not}} difficult to guess that, in their opinion, the Minute Boys ought to remain where they could do the best service for the colony.|$|R

60|$|Our logs drifted {{slowly and}} at last {{grounded}} gently on the bank. Lop-Ear and I crept ashore. The logs drifted on out of the eddy and swept away down the stream. We looked at each other, {{but we did not}} laugh. We were in a strange land, and it did not enter our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could return to our own land in the same manner <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had come.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was of}} no use to say {{anything}} like that to Rectus. He was full {{of the idea of}} scaling the walls, and I found that, when the boy did get worked up to anything, he could talk first-rate, and before we went to sleep I got the notion of it, too, and we made up our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would try it.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment before}} we were bitterly making up our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would ask no more favors of Satan for friends of ours, for {{he did not seem}} to know any way to do a person a {{kindness}} but by killing him; but the whole aspect of the case was changed now, and we were glad of what we had done and full of happiness in the thought of it.|$|R
60|$|You can fancy {{with what}} eagerness I set about {{removing}} the casks, believing we might speedily effect our purpose; {{but it was}} not in Hiram's <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be rash.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is for you}} to find out," [...] Mark replied, with a smile. [...] "You {{must take}} us for simples, if it is in your <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will give all the {{information}} demanded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, fair sir, {{it is in}} my <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can do better," [...] said Simon. [...] "Let us {{take the}} priest with us, so that he who is within may know his voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{regarded}} {{one another}} for {{a moment with a}} curiously easy and confident satisfaction in coming together again. I can't explain our ready zest in one another. The thing was so. We pleased each other, we had no doubt in our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> pleased each other. From the first we were at our ease with one another. [...] "So picturesque, so very picturesque," [...] came a voice from above, and then: [...] "Bee-atrice!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At your nest, of course," [...] {{retorted}} the other. [...] "We made up our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{have had}} a miserable bluejay for a policeman long enough; so the rooks elected me in your place, and I'm {{going to make you}} birds stand around and obey orders, I can tell you! If you do as I command, you'll get along all right; if you don't, I'll pound you with your own club until you obey." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{bought her}} {{early in the}} spring of 1812, when the people were talking {{strongly}} for or against war; but it never entered our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might get mixed up in the fighting, for who could ever have dreamed that the Britishers would come to Benedict? It was enough to satisfy us that the oyster business was fairly good, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could often earn, with the pungy, as high as three dollars a day, not counting the time occupied in running up to Annapolis or Baltimore.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you, my Lord of Pommers," [...] said Sir Nigel, {{pushing his}} way to the front, [...] "it is in my <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might break a lance in gentle and honorable debate over the question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is in his}} <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{can make}} prisoners of all the boat's crew, an' if that could be done, we'd be takin' with us such as would insure a hearty welcome from the commodore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} in my <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might send some of the company down near the prison to loiter there {{in the hope of}} gaining speech with Archie, if so be Seth Jepson's words are true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'No, no. This is {{only where}} we {{compress}} it. But never <b>mind</b> <b>that.</b> All <b>we</b> wish {{you to do}} is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Jacobus Maria Bemelman, {{under the}} stage name [...] "Tommy Wonder", {{has pointed out}} that it is much more effective, from the magician's point of view, to {{concentrate}} on the positive aim of directing the audience's attention. He writes that [...] "Misdirection implies 'wrong' direction. It suggests that attention is directed away from something. By constantly using this term, it eventually becomes so ingrained in our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might start to perceive misdirection as directing attention away from rather than toward something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mamma {{knows all}} about everything,' said Mysie. 'I think it's nature; ad if she does not always take notice at the time, she will have it out sooner or later.' Then {{resuming}} the thread of her discourse: 'So you see, Dolly, we have made up our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will forgive you this time, because you are an only child and don't know what's what, and that's some excuse. Only you mustn't go on telling tales whenever an evident happens.' ...|$|R
