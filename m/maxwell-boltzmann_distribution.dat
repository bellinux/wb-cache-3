5|$|Between 1859 and 1866, he {{developed}} {{the theory of the}} distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the <b>Maxwell–Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution,</b> gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on thermodynamics led him to devise the thought experiment that {{came to be known as}} Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.|$|E
5|$|Fluid models {{describe}} plasmas {{in terms}} of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters). One simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the plasma as a single fluid governed {{by a combination of}} Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. A more general description is the two-fluid plasma picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a <b>Maxwell–Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution.</b> Because fluid models usually describe the plasma {{in terms of}} a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects.|$|E

40|$|A {{recently}} generated {{theoretical line}} list of C II dielectronic recombination lines together with observational data {{gathered from the}} literature is used to investigate the electron temperature {{in a range of}} astronomical objects, mainly planetary nebulae. The electron temperature is obtained by a least-squares optimisation using all the reliable observed lines in each object. In addition, the subset of lines arising directly from autoionising states is used to directly determine the free-electron energy distribution which is then compared with various theoretical possibilities. The method described here can potentially determine whether there are departures from <b>Maxwell-Boltzmann</b> <b>distributions</b> in some nebulae, as has been recently proposed. Using published observations of the three planetary nebulae where the relevant lines are recorded, we find that the data are best matched by <b>Maxwell-Boltzmann</b> <b>distributions</b> but that the uncertainties are sufficiently large at present that kappa-distributions or two-component nebular models are not excluded.

5|$|Kinetic models {{describe}} the particle velocity distribution function at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore {{do not need to}} assume a <b>Maxwell–Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution.</b> A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories {{of a large number of}} individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models.

40|$|Various multi-agent {{models of}} wealth {{distributions}} defined by microscopic laws regulating the trades, {{with or without}} a saving criterion, are reviewed. We discuss and clarify the equilibrium properties of the model with constant global saving propensity, resulting in Gamma distributions, and their equivalence to the <b>Maxwell-Boltzmann</b> kinetic energy <b>distribution</b> for a system of molecules in an effective number of dimensions D_λ, related to the saving propensity λ [M. Patriarca, A. Chakraborti, and K. Kaski, Phys. Rev. E 70 (2004) 016104]. We use these results to analyze the model in which the individual saving propensities of the agents are quenched random variables, and the tail of the equilibrium wealth distribution exhibits a Pareto law f(x) ∝ x^-α - 1 with an exponent α= 1 [A. Chatterjee, B. K. Chakrabarti, and S. S. Manna, Physica Scripta T 106 (2003) 367]. Here, we show that the observed Pareto power law can be explained as arising from the overlap of the <b>Maxwell-Boltzmann</b> <b>distributions</b> associated to the various agents, which reach an equilibrium state characterized by their individual Gamma distributions. We also consider the influence of different types of saving propensity distributions on the equilibrium state. ...|$|R

40|$|Kinetics and {{thermodynamics}} {{are largely}} disconnected in current theories because Arrhenius activation energies (Ea) have strictly no influence on equilibrium distributions. A first step towards {{the incorporation of}} rate theories in thermodynamics is {{the identification of the}} pre-exponential term of the Arrhenius equation as an entropic quantity. The second step examined here is the possible contribution of Ea in equilibrium landscapes. Interestingly, this possibility exists if envisioning the energetic exponential term of rates constants as the probability that the energy of the reactant is sufficient for the transition. This radically new approach which encompasses <b>Maxwell-Boltzmann</b> <b>distributions</b> as particular cases, solves inconsistencies in previous theories, for instance on the role of temperature in kinetics and thermodynamics. These probabilistic rate constants are then reintroduced in dynamic systems to provide them with the two distinct facets of time: the time step and the time arrow...|$|R

25|$|Boltzmann {{is perhaps}} the most {{significant}} contributor to kinetic theory, as he introduced many of the fundamental concepts in the theory. Besides the <b>Maxwell–Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution</b> mentioned above, he also associated the kinetic energy of particles with their degrees of freedom. The Boltzmann equation for the distribution function of a gas in non-equilibrium states is still the most effective equation for studying transport phenomena in gases and metals. By introducing the concept of thermodynamic probability as the number of microstates corresponding to the current macrostate, he showed that its logarithm is proportional to entropy.|$|E
25|$|Absolute, or thermodynamic, {{temperature}} is conventionally measured in kelvins (Celsius-scaled increments) {{and in the}} Rankine scale (Fahrenheit-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies {{the size of the}} degree, so the ratios of two absolute temperatures, T2/T1, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the <b>Maxwell–Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution.</b> It can also be found in Fermi–Dirac statistics (for particles of half-integer spin) and Bose–Einstein statistics (for particles of integer spin).

40|$|Recently, a {{suspicion}} arose {{that the free}} electrons in planetary nebulae (PNe) and HII regions might have non-thermal energy distributions. In this scenario, a kappa index is introduced to characterize the electron energy distributions, with smaller kappa values indicating larger deviations from <b>Maxwell-Boltzmann</b> <b>distributions.</b> Assuming {{that this is the}} case, we determine the kappa values for a sample of PNe and HII regions by comparing the intensities of [OIII] collisionally excited lines and the hydrogen Balmer jump. We find the average kappa indices of PNe and HII regions to be 27 and 32, respectively. Correlations between the resultant kappa values and various physical properties of the nebulae are examined to explore the potential origin of non-thermal electrons in photoionized gaseous nebulae. However, no positive result is obtained. Thus the current analysis does not lend to support to the idea that kappa-distributed electrons are present in PNe and HII regions.
