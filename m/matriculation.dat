5|$|Examinations in Maltese {{secondary}} schools are taken at both age 16 and 18, {{with the latter}} being a final optional set of <b>matriculation</b> examinations. The examinations taken at age 16 are the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) exams, which have operated since 1994, before which the GCE Ordinary Level {{was used as a}} secondary certificate examination. The examinations taken at 18, those enabling entry into university, are the <b>Matriculation</b> Certificate examinations, based on the International Baccalaureate. These examinations replaced the GCE Advanced Levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{education}} system features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by {{six years of}} compulsory primary education, and five years of optional secondary education. Schools in the primary {{education system}} are divided into two categories: national primary schools, which teach in Malay, and vernacular schools, which teach in Chinese or Tamil. Secondary education is conducted for five years. In {{the final year of}} secondary education, students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination. Since the introduction of the <b>matriculation</b> programme in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in <b>matriculation</b> colleges can enroll in local universities. However, in the <b>matriculation</b> system, only 10 per cent of places are open to non-bumiputera students.|$|E

When Hartley died, these manuscripts were purchased in 1885 by Mr. Quaritch. The <b>Matriculations</b> were printed in eight volumes (1891) and the Marriages in one volume (1887) under the editorship of Joseph Foster.

5|$|A sickly child, Gordon Childe {{was educated}} {{at home for}} a number of years, before gaining a private school {{education}} in North Sydney. In 1907, he began attending Sydney Church of England Grammar School, gaining his Junior <b>Matriculation</b> in 1909 and Senior <b>Matriculation</b> in 1910. At school he studied ancient history, French, Greek, Latin, geometry, algebra and trigonometry, achieving good marks in all subjects, but was bullied because of his strange appearance and unathletic physique. In July 1910 his mother died; his father soon took Monica Gardiner as his third wife. Childe's relationship with his father was strained, particularly following his mother's death, and they disagreed on the subject of religion and politics, with the Reverend being a devout Christian and conservative while his son was an atheist and socialist.|$|E

However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various <b>matriculation</b> courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E
30|$|The {{interest}} {{of this article}} lies in the academic ceremonies including <b>matriculations</b> and congregations done by these institutions especially in the University of Education, Winneba. <b>Matriculations</b> are official welcoming ceremonies that seal the admission contract between matriculands and the institution whilst congregations climax formal educational journey and lead to certification of learners. Using the University of Education, Winneba (UEW) as a case study, the study attempts to investigate how the fusion of academical and Ghanaian traditional costumes illuminate these ceremonies and translate into raising the academic pride and hopes of congregants. Through observation of academic ceremonies in the aforementioned university, the researchers opted to offer visual interpretative account of the events and shed more light on its symbolical essence and aesthetical dimensions. Data gathered have been presented in simple narrative manner. In so doing, the researchers approached the study by describing the general characteristic features of Akan traditional processions {{on one side and}} academical processions on the other side. With the assumption that the former has influenced the latter, the researchers attempted to probe into the resultant of the fusion and interlaced its interpretative analysis in a narrative format.|$|R
5000|$|This brought {{consequences}} {{such as a}} large accumulated [...] "social debt" [...] (the sum tabulation {{of governmental}} neglect of a given area, such as the total of all funds {{that could have been}} spent on education, but instead were spent elsewhere), because the number of university <b>matriculations</b> stagnated, resulting in the exclusion of students originating from Venezuela's poorest sectors. Numerous studies agree that entrance to higher education predisposes students from any background to eventually earn greater incomes, both {{of the population of the}} cities and to students originating from elite private schools. On a par with this phenomenon, the tertiary education turning out official governmental managers reduced its participation in the education of private (corporate) management. From 1999, the National Government has dedicated efforts to strengthen the Venezuelan educational system, for which it has been indispensable to rescue the initiative of the State as a guarantor of high quality educational opportunities for all. With respect to the access to higher education, the National Government has achieved an expansion in <b>matriculations</b> to the Institutes and Schools and in good part to the Experimental National Universities, in a joint work with the authorities and the established communities of these institutions.|$|R

This is {{suggested}} as a reason for <b>matriculations</b> at Charsley's at an unusually young age. By the end of 1891 the name of Charsley's had disappeared, as the mastership of the hall was taken over by Charles Abdy Marcon and it thus took his name as Marcon's Hall. Marcon had himself been educated at Charsley's.|$|R
50|$|Today, the {{doctorate}} (doctorat) is a research-only degree. It is {{a national}} degree and its requirements are fixed by the minister of higher education and research.

The redaction of a comprehensive thesis constitutes {{the bulk of the}} doctoral work.

40|$|Has {{access to}} {{selective}} postsecondary schools expanded or contracted? Evaluating this question has proven {{a difficult task}} because data are limited, {{particularly with regard to}} family income. We complement previous work and provide a replicable model of institutional analysis. This paper presents a detailed, quantitative assessment of admissions at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, an elite flagship public university—the type that is supposed to offer excellent opportunities to students from all backgrounds. We use an innovative measure of family income to compare applicant, admissions, and enrollment trends for low-income and minority students from 1972 to 2007. The unique aspects of this study include the more reliable measure of income and the ability to look at the full process from applications, admissions, and <b>matriculations</b> (demand and supply), not generally available in national datasets...|$|R
