5|$|As of 2006, the IFNA {{recognises}} only women's netball. Men's netball teams {{exist in}} some areas but attract less attention from sponsors and spectators. Men's netball started to become popular in Australia during the 1980s, and the first men's championship was held in 1985. In 2004, New Zealand and Fiji sent teams {{to compete in the}} Australian Mixed and Men's National Championships. By 2006, mixed netball teams in Australia had as many <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> as rugby union. Other countries with men's national teams include Canada, Fiji, Jamaica, Kenya, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Unlike women's netball at elite and national levels, men's and mixed gendered teams are largely self-funded.|$|E
5|$|NVC {{has also}} been {{reported}} as effective in reducing domestic violence. <b>Male</b> <b>participants</b> who graduated from an NVC-based batterer intervention program in California had zero percent recidivism within 5 years, according to the relevant District Attorneys' offices. The news report contrasted this with a recidivism rate of 40 percent within 5 years {{as reported by the}} Domestic Abuse Intervention Project for graduates of their batterer intervention program based on the Duluth Model, said to previously offer the lowest known domestic violence recidivism rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{behavior}} of double-dipping involves consuming chips and dip, taking {{a bite of}} the chip, and then re-dipping it into a dip. In March 2013, Tostitos, a U.S. brand of tortilla chips and dips, hired the Ketchum communications agency to perform a survey concerning double dipping that polled over 1,000 Americans. The survey found that 46% of <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> double-dip at a party, compared to 32% of females. 54% stated {{that they would not}} consume dip after seeing another person double-dip, and 22% stated that they did not care. 25% stated that they would verbally object to a person caught double-dipping.|$|E

5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the <b>male</b> <b>participants,</b> who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> {{were more likely to report}} having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} been done into whether words used within the gay {{community}} are understood by heterosexuals. A study of Deaf sign language users showed that all the gay <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> understood the sign for a bathhouse and that 83% of lesbians knew the sign. This compared to zero heterosexual men and {{only one out of}} eleven heterosexual women knowing the sign.|$|E
30|$|The {{differences}} in pitch and word rate have similar behavior across participants. For the “bold” typesetting, the pitch differences were ranging from small (e.g., − 7  %, {{for a female}} participant) to large (e.g., − 36  %, for a <b>male</b> <b>participant).</b> The percentage word rate decrease had similar behavior (e.g., a female participant in a sentence case − 23  %, and a <b>male</b> <b>participant</b> in a phrase case − 56  %). Similar results were observed for the rendition of the “italics” typesetting, e.g., + 11 and + 49 % for pitch differences and + 14 and + 48  % for word rate differences.|$|R

25|$|Ringette {{has thus}} far been {{excluded}} from the Olympics {{partly due to the}} fact that it must have 25% of each gender to qualify. The sport is typically overlooked by <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> due to its lack of widespread recognition and the more widespread availability of other organized winter sports like ice hockey. Currently there are not enough males with the skill to qualify for an Olympic team.|$|E
25|$|Beyond academia, the {{endorsement}} of biological explanations of sex differences in intelligence {{has been associated with}} greater modern day sexism. In their research on the theorization of gender, Morton and colleagues found that people shown scientific claims that males and females are hardwired to be different, compared to those told that such ideas are under debate, expressed more agreement that society treats women fairly. Additionally, <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> became more supportive of sex discrimination at work after reading the scientific facts. Other research indicates that shifting the focus from biological to environmental contributors of behavior can decrease endorsement of sexist hierarchies.|$|E
25|$|Among Open assemblies, also termed Plymouth Brethren, the Eucharist is more {{commonly}} called the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper. It {{is seen as}} a symbolic memorial and is central to the worship of both individual and assembly. In principle, the service is open to all baptized Christians, but an individual's eligibility to participate depends on the views of each particular assembly. The service takes the form of non-liturgical, open worship with all <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> allowed to pray audibly and select hymns or readings. The breaking of bread itself typically consists of one leavened loaf, which is prayed over and broken by a participant in the meeting and then shared around. The wine is poured from a single container into one or several vessels, and these are again shared around.|$|E

25|$|Performance {{in mental}} {{rotation}} and similar spatial tasks {{is affected by}} gender expectations. For example, studies show that being told before the test that men typically perform better, or that the task is linked with jobs like aviation engineering typically associated with men versus jobs like fashion design typically associated with women, will negatively affect female performance on spatial rotation and positively influence it when subjects are told the opposite. Experiences such as playing video games also increase a person's mental rotation ability. A study from the University of Toronto showed that differences in ability get reduced after playing video games requiring complex mental rotation. The experiment showed that playing such games creates larger gains in spatial cognition in females than males. However, <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> still performed superior to female participants {{both before and after}} training.|$|E
25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on than their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E
500|$|The {{program for}} the Beijing Games was quite {{similar to that of}} the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games. [...] Nine new events were held, {{including}} two from the new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the 3000metre steeplechase for the first time. [...] Open water swimming events for men and women, over the distance of , were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events. In fencing, women's team foil and women's team sabre replaced men's team foil and women's team épée. Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian and mixed badminton are the only sports in which men and women compete together, although three events in the Sailing allowed the opportunity for both males and female participants. However, only <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> took part in all three events.|$|E

500|$|Asch's {{conformity}} {{experiment was}} conducted using 123 <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> who {{were told that}} they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive [...] "real" [...] participant). The group was shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a [...] "trial". The [...] "real" [...] participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other [...] "participants" [...] gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the [...] "critical trials". [...] The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond {{the same way as the}} confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.|$|E

2500|$|Rasta women usually wear {{clothing}} that covers their head and masks their body contours, {{in a manner}} akin to traditional Islamic clothing. Long skirts are usually worn rather than trousers. Rasta discourse legitimises this female dress code with the claim {{that it is necessary}} to prevent women attracting men; it also endorses this female dress code as an antidote to the sexual objectification of women in Babylon. Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose. Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies. This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract <b>male</b> <b>participants.</b>|$|E
30|$|After the {{recording}} session, a prosody analysis of pitch and rate was performed using PRAAT [61]. The mean pitch baseline {{is dependent on}} the participant.

2500|$|Another partial {{replication}} {{of the experiment}} was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series Basic Instincts. Burger noted that [...] "current standards {{for the ethical treatment}} of participants clearly place Milgram's studies out of bounds." [...] In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the institutional review board by modifying several of the experimental protocols. Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram found in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the <b>male</b> <b>participants.</b> Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.|$|E
2500|$|While it {{is thought}} that feminizing {{genitoplasty}} typically requires fewer surgeries to achieve an acceptable result and results in fewer urologic difficulties, {{there is no evidence that}} feminizing surgery results in a better psychosocial outcome. [...] In one study, individuals with grade 3 PAIS who were raised male rated their body image and sexual function similarly to those who were raised female, even though they were more likely to have genitalia that were abnormal in size and appearance; more than half of the <b>male</b> <b>participants</b> had a stretched penile length that was below 2.5 standard deviations of the mean, while only 6% of female participants presented with a short vagina in adulthood, and participating physicians gave a lower cosmetic rating to the surgical results of the men than the women. [...] Both male and female participants cited the appearance of their genitalia as being the greatest contributing factor to their dissatisfaction with their body image. [...] In two larger studies, the common predictor of gender reassignment was stigmatization related to having an intersex condition.|$|E
2500|$|The Heraea Games, {{the first}} {{recorded}} competition {{for women in}} the Olympic Stadium, were held as early as the sixth century BC. It originally consisted of foot races only, as did the competition for males. Some texts, including Pausanias's Description of Greece, c. AD175, state that Hippodameia gathered a group known as the [...] "Sixteen Women" [...] and made them administrators of the Heraea Games, out of gratitude for her marriage to Pelops. Other texts related to the Elis and Pisa conflict indicate that the [...] "Sixteen Women" [...] were peacemakers from Pisa and Elis and, because of their political competence, became administrators of the Heraea. Being the consort of Hera in Classical Greek mythology, Zeus was the father of the deities in the pantheon of that era. The Sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia housed a [...] statue in ivory and gold of Zeus that had been sculpted by Phidias circa 445BC. This statue was one of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World.
