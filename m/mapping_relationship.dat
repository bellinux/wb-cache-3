If it can be proven that union or intersection calculation results of feasible methods can still meet requirements of equivalent functions, no matter what scheduling strategies or dynamic combination of these heterogeneous algorithms are done, it will not change the given functions. Accordingly, the <b>mapping</b> <b>relationship</b> between the visual functions {{and the structure of}} the object is no longer unique or certain from the perspective of attackers, which can be used to achieve the active defense by the defenders. Axiom 2：“Everyone has diverse shortcomings while they rarely make the same mistakes on the same tasks in the same place at the same time.”This axiom provides a theoretical basis for applications of multi-mode ruling mechanisms of the heterogeneous redundancy architecture in fault tolerance, handling random failures of hardware and software in the field of reliability. This means that cyber problems based on unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, Trojans, viruses and certain or uncertain threats can be transformed into risk protection problems through heterogeneous and redundant mechanism defense. Unless the attackers have resources and capabilities to achieve the consistent error expression through a cooperative attack dilemma under the condition of non-cooperation in heterogeneous multi-target space, it is difficult for attackers to escape from the multi-mode arbitral mechanism.|$|E

There are usually three attributes in the “helper” tag, the key attribute, the value attribute and the type attribute. The value attribute describes the target element in the customized model and the key attribute describes the target element in Cloud resource runtime models. The type attribute describes the type of the <b>mapping</b> <b>relationship.</b> When its value is “basic”, it is a one-to-one <b>mapping</b> <b>relationship</b> or a many-to-one <b>mapping</b> <b>relationship.</b> When its value is “multi”, it is a one-to-many <b>mapping</b> <b>relationship.</b> The “helper” tag is used {{to describe}} the <b>mapping</b> <b>relationship</b> between elements.

40|$|<b>Mapping</b> <b>relationships,</b> such as (country, country-code) or (company, stock-ticker), are {{versatile}} data {{assets for}} {{an array of}} applications in data cleaning and data integration like auto-correction and auto-join. However, today there are no good repositories of mapping tables that can enable these intelligent applications. Given a corpus of tables such as web tables or spreadsheet tables, we observe that values of these mappings often exist in pairs of columns in same tables. Motivated by their broad applicability, we study the problem of synthesizing <b>mapping</b> <b>relationships</b> using a large table corpus. Our synthesis process leverages compatibility of tables based on co-occurrence statistics, as well as constraints such as functional dependency.

30|$|In {{order to}} avoid the problem of {{cracking}} the key through the linear equations in the LFHE algorithm that may occur in this algorithm, this paper introduces a new mapping function Π, and through the mapping function Π, it can turn the order ciphertext after reach encryption to randomly generate out-of-order ciphertext. The mapping function can ensure that the orders of ciphertext fragments obtained from plaintext data v and v′ through encryption algorithm are independent and irrelevant, and each mapping is random with no rules. For random and independent <b>mapping</b> <b>relationship</b> Π, during execution of certain encryption operation, it requires using a convenient and effective method to save the relative order of result ciphertext (i.e., the specific <b>mapping</b> <b>relationship</b> of this mapping Π into the result ciphertext for subsequent homomorphic operation or decryption operation). Without the assistance of <b>mapping</b> <b>relationship,</b> even the legitimate user cannot accurately match the corresponding relationship between key ki and ciphertext fragment ci and accurately decrypt the original plaintext.|$|E

However, the standard Web service description language (WSDL), defines only the service input and output while ignoring the corresponding input-to-output <b>mapping</b> <b>relationships.</b> This presents a serious challenge in distinguishing services with similar input and output interface. In this paper, we address this challenge by embedding the service policy into the traditional WSDL 2. 0 schema to describe the input-to-output <b>mapping</b> <b>relationships.</b> The service policy is then transformed into a policy binary tree so that the similarity between different Web services can be quantitatively evaluated. Furthermore, a new service redundancy detection approach is proposed based on this similarity.
