30|$|Once {{assessed}} such power-law nature, it {{is interesting}} to identify the <b>main</b> <b>hubs.</b> In the PON R&C network considered here, hubs are public research centres, and this represents a strong point for the relationships of the involved productive system. In fact, it is natural, in the lifecycle of a productive system, that some enterprises rise while others fall, resulting, in the language of networks, in the random removal of vertices described above. Anyway, as previously stated, the random removal of vertices from a scale-free network does not spoil connectivity, which happens with the systematical removal of the <b>main</b> <b>hubs</b> instead. In this case, it is unlikely that one of the <b>main</b> <b>hubs,</b> identified here with large public research centres, could disappear, since this would mean e.g. the closure of a large public university, a quite rare event. This picture was partly expected, since in many cases it was mandatory to involve public research institutions in the TSAs. Nevertheless it still represents a strong indication for a decision maker, suggesting that it is ‘safer’ including public research in a future program, since it is the easiest way to keep a solid relationship network within the productive system.|$|R
