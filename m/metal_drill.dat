This ranges from a rope over a pulley or a pole, attached to the drill pipe with a rope and used as a lever.

50|$|Group Kyushu (Kyūshū-ha) was an edgy, {{experimental}} and rambunctious art group {{that emerged in}} Japan in the late 1950s {{as part of a}} wave of young artists that would go on to change the look of Japanese modern art in the 1960s and 70s. Almost none of the members of Group Kysuhu were formally trained as artists, and hailing from the southernmost island of Japan (Kyūshū), they were remote from the center of haute culture, Tokyo. Reacting against what they saw as a stifling exhibition system that relied on personal connections and master-disciple relationships, they put great energy into fighting against the various institutions of the art establishment. The group worked in paint, sculpture and performance. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, nuts, springs, <b>metal</b> <b>drill</b> shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar.

40|$|This {{technical}} report presents the engineering research, process development and data accomplishments that have transpired {{to date in}} support of the development of Cost Effective Composite Drill Pipe (CDP). The report presents progress made from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005 and contains the following discussions: (1) Qualification Testing; (2) Prototype Development and Testing of ''Smart Design'' Configuration; (3) Field Test Demonstration; and (4) Commercial order for SR-CDP from Torch International. The objective of this contract is to develop and demonstrate ''cost effective'' Composite Drill Pipe. It is projected that this drill pipe will weigh less than half of its steel counter part. The resultant weight reduction will provide enabling technology that will increase the lateral distance that can be reached from an offshore drilling platform and the depth of water in which drilling and production operations can be carried out. Further, composite drill pipe has the capability to carry real time signal and power transmission within the pipe walls. CDP can also accommodate much shorter drilling radius than is possible with <b>metal</b> <b>drill</b> pipe. As secondary benefits, the lighter weight drill pipe can increase the storage capability of floating off shore drilling platforms and provide substantial operational cost savings...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic field {{strength}} and magnetic susceptibility were logged with the geological high-resolution magnetic tool (GHMT) at {{three of the}} holes drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 178 {{to the west of}} the Antarctic Peninsula. Polarity stratigraphies derived from the GHMT logs bear close resemblance to the polarities determined from core paleomagnetism at two of the holes and were used for magnetostratigraphic dating, especially in intervals where no core was recovered. Polarity is determined in the following way. First, the susceptibility log is used to determine the induced magnetization of the sediment. Then the background field, the field of the <b>metal</b> <b>drill</b> pipe, and the field anomaly of the sediment's induced magnetization are removed from the measured total field to leave the downhole anomaly of the sediment's remanent magnetization. The sign (positive or negative) of this anomaly gave a good polarity stratigraphy for Holes 1095 B and 1096 C, which are located in sediment drifts. A further step, correlation analysis, is based on the fact that in an interval of normal polarity sediment the remanent anomaly will correlate with the induced anomaly, whereas in reversed polarity sediment they will anticorrelate. The magnetite-rich, fine-grained sediments found in the two holes drilled into the sediment drift have a ratio of remanent to induced magnetization (the Koenigsberger ratio) of ~ 1. In contrast, the coarser-grained diamict sediments on the shelf have a Koenigsberger ratio of ~ 0. 2, and extracting the remanent part of the downhole anomaly is much more difficult. By the comparison of core and log results, we can assess the viability of the GHMT polarities in detail, what proportion of the overprint in the cores is imparted by the coring process, and whether any paleointensity information is extractable from the GHMT logs...|$|E

40|$|Advanced Composite Products and Technology, Inc. (ACPT) has {{developed}} composite drill pipe (CDP) {{that matches the}} structural and strength properties of steel drill pipe, but weighs less than 50 percent of its steel counterpart. Funding for the multiyear {{research and development of}} CDP was provided by the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy through the Natural Gas and Oil Projects Management Division at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Composite materials made of carbon fibers and epoxy resin offer mechanical properties comparable to steel at less than half the weight. Composite drill pipe consists of a composite material tube with standard drill pipe steel box and pin connections. Unlike <b>metal</b> <b>drill</b> pipe, composite drill pipe can be easily designed, ordered, and produced to meet specific requirements for specific applications. Because it uses standard joint connectors, CDP can be used in lieu of any part of or for the entire steel drill pipe section. For low curvature extended reach, deep directional drilling, or ultra deep onshore or offshore drilling, the increased strength to weight ratio of CDP will increase the limits in all three drilling applications. Deceased weight will reduce hauling costs and increase the amount of drill pipe allowed on offshore platforms. In extreme extended reach areas and high-angle directional drilling, drilling limits are associated with both high angle (fatigue) and frictional effects resulting from the combination of high angle curvature and/or total weight. The radius of curvature for a hole as small as 40 feet (12. 2 meters) or a build rate of 140 degrees per 100 feet is within the fatigue limits of specially designed CDP. Other properties that can be incorporated into the design and manufacture of composite drill pipe and make it attractive for specific applications are corrosion resistance, non-magnetic intervals, and abrasion resistance coatings. Since CDP has little or no electromagnetic force fields up to 74 kilohertz (KHz), a removable section of copper wire can be placed inside the composite pipe to short the tool joints electrically allowing electromagnetic signals inside the collar to induce and measure the same within the rock formation. By embedding a pair of wires in the composite section and using standard drill pipe box and pin ends equipped with a specially developed direct contact joint electrical interface, power can be supplied to measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD) bottom hole assemblies. Instantaneous high-speed data communications between near drill bit and the surface are obtainable utilizing this 'smart' drilling technology. The composite drill pipe developed by ACPT has been field tested successfully in several wells nationally and internationally. These tests were primarily for short radius and ultra short radius directional drilling. The CDP in most cases performed flawlessly with little or no appreciable wear. ACPT is currently marketing a complete line of composite drill collars, subs, isolators, casing, and drill pipe to meet the drilling industry's needs and tailored to replace metal for specific application requirements...|$|E

The bamboo drill piece is driven into the ground using only manpower and acts as a conduit once water The well sunk at Wenela now supplies water to the villagers who are ready to teach the techniques which they have mastered to people in other villages. The use of bamboo technology is becoming increasingly popular with Africans.

The review suggest low to moderate bioaccumulation and toxicity of <b>metals</b> in <b>drill</b> cuttings to marine organisms.

Ratios of 67 and 76 for the respective species showed significant uptake of barium from marine sediments spiked with barite. Similarly, significant uptake of titanium were observed in organisms exposed to ilmenite. All other elements (Al, Li, Fe, Zn, Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Cr and Ni) showed no significant uptake and ratios within the range 0, 6 - 1, 5. This result was partly explained by anomalous low concentrations of Pb in the barite test substance, partly by the presence in several test substances of major fractions of Cr, Ni, Zn and Cu insoluble in standard nitric acid digestion (NS 4770).
