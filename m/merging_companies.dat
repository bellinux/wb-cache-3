50|$|Construction of {{the first}} transcontinental {{telegraph}} {{was the work of}} Western Union, which Hiram Sibley and Ezra Cornell had established in 1856 by <b>merging</b> <b>companies</b> operating east of the Mississippi River.

Eventually, the only bidder would be Sibley, because all competitors—Theodore Adams, Benjamin Ficklin and John Harmon—withdrew at the last minute. Later they joined Sibley in his effort.|$|E
50|$|In {{homogeneous}} markets, unilateral {{effects can}} be pronounced when two significant competitors merge to create a large, dominant player {{with only a few}} or no other competitors. In these markets, {{an important role in the}} assessment is played by market shares and by the capacity available in the market. In differentiated markets, unilateral effects tend to arise particularly when the two <b>merging</b> <b>companies</b> have highly substitutable goods. Such a price increase does not depend on the merged firm being the dominant player in the market. The likelihood and magnitude of such an increase will instead depend on the substitutability of the products supplied by the two firms - the closer the substitute, the greater the unilateral effects.|$|E

50|$|Rane Engine Valve Limited {{was formed}} after Engine Valves Limited (EVL) was merged with its 100% {{subsidiary}} Engine Components Ltd (ECL) {{in the year}} 1999.

5000|$|What {{amounts to}} a {{substantial}} lessening of, or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study. The market shares of the <b>merging</b> <b>companies</b> can be assessed and added, although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions, not conclusions. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index {{is used to calculate}} the [...] "density" [...] of the market, or what concentration exists. Aside from the maths, {{it is important to consider}} the product in question and the rate of technical innovation in the market. A further problem of collective dominance, or oligopoly through [...] "economic links" [...] can arise, whereby the new market becomes more conducive to collusion. It is relevant how transparent a market is, because a more concentrated structure could mean firms can coordinate their behaviour more easily, whether firms can deploy deterrents and whether firms are safe from a reaction by their competitors and consumers. The entry of new firms to the market, and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{conventional}} merger or acquisition, the <b>merging</b> <b>companies</b> become a single legal entity, with one business buying the outstanding {{shares of the}} other. However, when a DLC is created, the two companies continue to exist, and to have separate bodies of shareholders, but they agree to share all the risks and rewards of the ownership of all their operating businesses in a fixed proportion, {{laid out in a}} contract called an [...] "equalization agreement." [...] The equalization agreements are set up to ensure equal treatment of both companies’ shareholders in voting and cash flow rights. The contracts cover issues that determine the distribution of these legal and economic rights between the twin parents, including issues related to dividends, liquidation, and corporate governance. Usually, the two companies will share a single board of directors and have an integrated management structure. A DLC is somewhat like a joint venture, but the two parties share everything they own, not just a single project; in that sense, a DLC is similar to a general partnership between publicly held corporations.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{commentators}} have {{commented on the}} need to create a new test. Legal academic Richard Whish described the EUMR of 2004 as [...] "disarmingly simple", in that the 'dominance test' remains but the question posed by test is reversed. The new test, most commonly known as the 'SIEC' (significant impediment to effective competition) test, was employed to tackle the inefficiencies of the [...] "dominance test" [...] that mainly stemmed from the wording of the test and the prerequisite of an undertaking assuming a dominant position or the strengthening a dominant position in the market. The new 'SIEC' test is a reorganisation of the [...] "dominance test" [...] that eliminates [...] "dominance" [...] as a necessary requirement for SIEC and instead expresses SIEC as the single and sufficient condition for incompatibility with EU merger regulation. What amounts to a substantial lessening of, or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study. The market shares of the <b>merging</b> <b>companies</b> can be assessed and added, although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions, not conclusions. The new test focuses on the subsequent changes to competition in a market following a merger, rather than whether the merged undertaking has acquire an excessive level of market power.|$|E
