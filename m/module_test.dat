This meant Borman's crew was scheduled to fly two to three months sooner than originally planned, leaving them a shorter time for training and preparation, thus placing more demands than usual on their time and discipline.|$|E
50|$|The MLS has {{historically}} been most notable for its Aerospace exhibit, which focuses on the early NASA space program. Most of the artifacts on display are on long-term loan from the National Air and Space Museum.

The MLS came into possession of these artifacts through the influence of James E. Webb, the second NASA administrator and a native of North Carolina.

40|$|System-on-chips (SOCs) and 3 D stacked ICs {{are often}} tested for {{manufacturing}} defects in a modular fashion, enabling us {{to record the}} <b>module</b> <b>test</b> pass probability.

We present a model for calculation of expected test time, for which the abortable test unit can be a <b>module</b> <b>test,</b> a test pattern or a clock cycle. Given an SOC, with test architecture consisting of <b>module</b> <b>test</b> wrappers and test access mechanisms (TAMs), and given <b>module</b> <b>test</b> pass probabilities, we schedule the tests on each TAM to minimize the expected test time.

In the <b>module</b> <b>testing</b> phase, single software modules are evaluated individually, which allows the identification of elementary errors like overflow, underflow, round-off, as well as discrepancies between algorithm model simulation results and the signals coming from the engine management system (EMS). The integration testing phase, performed afterwards, aims to verify whether the <b>tested</b> <b>module</b> is correctly integrated in the overall software system. Finally, functional testing (also called validation testing) is applied to validate the algorithms concerning functional requirements. This stage is usually performed after the calibration phase and characterizes an overall system testing, concluding the new software testing phase, and allowing, therefore, its release.|$|R
