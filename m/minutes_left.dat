40|$|Ischemia and reperfusion of {{a tissue}} or a viscera may also show a {{protective}} effect such as development of preconditioning {{on the other}} tissues which have another source of arterial blood flow. This mechanism of action is known as remote ischemic preconditioning. In this study, we have investigated the effects of preconditioning induced by pulmonary artery occlusion on myocardial ischemia and ischemia- reperfusion injury on a rat model. For this purpose, we used adult, in both sex, 30 Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 6). There were five experimental groups; Group 1 : Control (Sham operated), Group 2 : 30 minute myocardial ischemia induced by left coronary artery occlusion, Group 3 : 30 <b>minute</b> <b>left</b> coronary artery occlusion followed by 60 minute reperfusion, Group 4 : Pulmonary ischemic preconditioning followed by 30 <b>minute</b> <b>left</b> coronary artery occlusion, Group 5 : Pulmonary ischemic preconditioning followed by 30 <b>minute</b> <b>left</b> coronary artery occlusion and 60 minute reperfusion. Malonyldialdehyde and purine nucleotide levels of myocardial tissue were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. As a conclusion, remote preconditioning evoked by pulmonary artery occlusion and reperfusion may induce a protective effect against myocardial ischemia and ischemia- reperfusion injury. It can be suggested that the protective effect of remote preconditioning is related with myocardial adenosine...|$|R
5|$|Liverpool {{tried to}} find a way back into the match. With 16 <b>minutes</b> <b>left,</b> Whelan was brought down in the Juventus penalty area by Massimo Bonini, but the referee decided {{that it was not a}} foul.

The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 <b>minutes</b> <b>left,</b> Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for a foul, resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game.|$|E
