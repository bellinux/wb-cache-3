40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} robot gripper in {{polymeric}} material for solid micro-meso parts. The gripper is developed using a light-weight, highly deformable and low cost material, that allows elastic deformations. The proposed solution {{consists of a}} simple geometry, incorporating {{the complexity of the}} mechanical transmission in the non-linear high deformations of the flexible elements of the device. This choice permits to grip multi-sizes objects. The design approach focuses on Ludwick material model, that describes deformable materials with a nonlinear elastic behavior. The kinematics of the gripper is presented and the results are verified with the finite element analysis. Finally, the gripper was fabricated and validated through a set of experimetal tests. The obtained resulsts confirmed the theoretical and simultion models. The <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> and <b>force</b> of the gripping jaws are 1, 500 μm and 155 mN, repsectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the force decay {{properties}} of different kinds of orthodontic elastics after subjecting them to static and cyclic testing. Latex and non-latex elastics obtained from GAC, American Orthodontics and Ortho-Organizers were used in a sample size of 10 elastics per group. Static testing involved stretching the elastics three times the internal diameter, while in cyclic testing, the elastics were stretched up to 50 mm to simulate <b>maximum</b> mouth <b>opening.</b> Elastic <b>forces</b> generated were measured using the Instron testing machine and recorded in grams. Elastics on average lose 10 % and 12 % as a result of static test and 30 % and 35 % as result of cyclic test for latex and non-latex brands respectively, and most of the force loss occurs during the ﬁrst half hour and after the ﬁrst 10 cycles. This difference in force loss between latex and non-latex elastics could be due to the different structure and composition of the polymer involved. There are no signiﬁcant differences between different groups of latex elastics in terms of force loss or even between the different groups of the non-latex elastics under static testing, however, under cycling testing differences between the groups were detected. Forces generated by the elastics are different from the manufacturers’ labeled forcesKing Saud Universit...|$|R

Subjects and methods: Subjects were 36 healthy elderly individuals aged ≥ 65  years without dysphagia (16 men and 20 women; mean age 75. 5  years, range 65 – 88  years). Videofluorographic images during the swallowing of 10  mL of 40 % (w/v) barium sulfate were obtained and the degrees of anterior, superior, and hypotenuse displacements of the hyoid bone and maximum/resting hyoid position were evaluated. Jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> was measured three times using a jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> sthenometer; the mean of these three measurements was used for analysis. Results: In men, there was a positive correlation between jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> and resting hyoid position and negative correlations among all the degrees of anterior, superior, and hypotenuse displacements of the hyoid bone. In women, there was no statistically significant correlation between jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> and any of the measurement items. There was no statistically significant correlation between jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> and <b>maximum</b> hyoid position in either men or women. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> leads to low resting hyoid position only in elderly men, and a lower hyoid position in healthy elderly men results in a larger total amount of hyoid displacement during swallowing. Moreover, a maximum hyoid position in healthy individuals of either gender does not differ depending on their jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force.</b> Keywords: aging, deglutition disorders, dysphasia, gender difference...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Angle and {{internal}} position of lateral pterygoid muscle leads to contraction over two {{half of the}} mandible in <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> and protrusion position so it can affects impression prosthetic procedures. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the mandibular flexure in two transverse and antro-posterior dimensions. Methods: Seventy edentulous patients at Mashhad Faculty of Dentistry as the main group and 50 dentulous patients as the control group were selected. In these patients, transverse dimensions between second molar areas and also canine eminence from one side to another side, and longitudinal dimensions based on the distance between canine to second molar area at centric occlusion and <b>maximum</b> mouth <b>opening</b> were measured. Dimensional differences as the mandibular flexure were measured. Results: The mandibular dimensions in <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> and closed mouth were different. Average reduction in transverse dimension on second molar region at <b>maximum</b> mouth <b>opening</b> and closing position were almost equal to - 0. 0787 mm for target group and 0. 7512 mm for control group. On anterior side, averages of these changes were equal to 0. 3069 mm for target group and were 0. 2254 mm for control group. Conclusion: Transverse dimensions in anterior region at <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> position are smaller than the same dimension at closed mouth in edentulous and dentulous patients...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper was}} to describe a novel radiologic protocol and a new occlusal radiographic index that give the clinician the possibility of identifying patients with limited interarch space. Three patients undergoing NobelGuide treatment of the edentulous upper jaw were selected as candidates for this study. In the first patient, the radiographic occlusal index was built using an addition silicone material to occupy the space between the 2 arches <b>forced</b> into the <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> position. In the other 2 patients different silicone materials were used and 2 interpositional wedges were placed in between 2 silicone bites to ensure <b>maximum</b> mouth <b>opening.</b> In the first patient, the bite made with addition silicone alone resulted in distinct noise on computer tomography since the patient was not forced to achieve his <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> position. In the second patient the mandibular addition silicone was still quite visible, while in the third patient the condensation silicone was invisible {{and the quality of the}} image was excellent with the possibility of measuring <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> position and virtually predicting interference with the opposite arch. The new radiological occlusal index made with condensation silicone (Sandwich Index) proved to be effective in reproducing the maxillary <b>forced</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> position during the initial planning phase, preventing errors in the inclusion or exclusion of patients suitable for NobelGuide treatment...|$|R

40|$|This article proposes an {{effective}} methodology for the fluid-dynamic design optimization of the sliding spool of a hydraulic proportional directional valve: {{the goal is}} the minimization of the flow force at a prescribed flow rate, so as to reduce the required <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> while keeping the operation features unchanged. A full three-dimensional model of the flow field within the valve is employed to accurately predict the flow force acting on the spool. A theoretical analysis, based on both the axial momentum equation and flow simulations, is conducted to define the design parameters, which need to be properly selected {{in order to reduce}} the flow force without significantly affecting the flow rate. A genetic algorithm, coupled with a computational fluid dynamics flow solver, is employed to minimize the flow force acting on the valve spool at the <b>maximum</b> <b>opening.</b> A comparison with a typical single-objective optimization algorithm is performed to evaluate performance and effectiveness of the employed genetic algorithm. The optimized spool develops a maximum flow force which is smaller than that produced by the commercially available valve, mainly due to some major modifications occurring in the discharge section. Reducing the flow force and thus the electromagnetic force exerted by the solenoid actuators allows the operational range of direct (single-stage) driven valves to be enlarged...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were, first, to report {{normative}} values for jaw movements in Caucasian children and adolescents (<b>maximum</b> <b>opening,</b> laterotrusion, and protrusion) and, second, to investigate the influence of age, gender, and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) on jaw movement capacity. The population-based study included 1, 011 randomly selected German children and adolescents, aged 10 - 17 yr. Case histories, as well as mandibular movements {{and the presence of}} TMD, were assessed according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). The mean +/- standard deviation for <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> was 50. 6 +/- 6. 4 mm, for laterotrusion to the right was 10. 2 +/- 2. 2 mm, for laterotrusion to the left was 10. 6 +/- 2. 3 mm, and for protrusion was 8. 2 +/- 2. 5 mm. Bivariable (t-test) and multivariable (linear regression) analyses showed that normative values for jaw opening capacity were influenced by age and gender. No influence on jaw movement capacity was seen when TMD were present. Based on the distribution of the measurements in the population (lowest decentile), the mandibular mobility of subjects with a <b>maximum</b> <b>opening</b> of < 43 mm and laterotrusive movements < 8 mm or protrusive movements < 5 mm might be considered as being limited. However, these limitations do not necessarily require treatment...|$|R
