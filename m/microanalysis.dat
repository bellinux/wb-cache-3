25|$|ESEM is {{especially}} useful for non-metallic and biological materials because coating with carbon or gold is unnecessary. Uncoated Plastics and Elastomers can be routinely examined, as can uncoated biological samples. Coating {{can be difficult}} to reverse, may conceal small features {{on the surface of the}} sample and may reduce the value of the results obtained. X-ray analysis is difficult with a coating of a heavy metal, so carbon coatings are routinely used in conventional SEMs, but ESEM makes it possible to perform X-ray <b>microanalysis</b> on uncoated non-conductive specimens; however some specific for ESEM artifacts are introduced in X-ray analysis. ESEM may be the preferred for electron microscopy of unique samples from criminal or civil actions, where forensic analysis may need to be repeated by several different experts.|$|E

In 2013, however, {{researchers}} {{reported that the}} bees had used synthetics, including caulk, to seal the cells. [...] Compositional analysis of these materials revealed calcium, titanium, and iron. [...] They resembled polyurethane-based sealants typically used in building construction. [...] It {{is not uncommon for}} insects to live inside found objects made of plastic. [...] However, these findings are the first known of insects actually building nests with plastic. [...] With help from citizen scientists in Toronto, over 200 nest boxes were placed throughout the city. [...] Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray <b>microanalysis,</b> and infrared microscopy were employed in identification of polymeric specimens. [...] Researchers suggest the bees' behavior may be an example of adaptive behavior. Since some of the bees were free of parasites, these novel and possibly more robust methods of nest building may offer additional protection. [...] Incorporation of plastic into the walls and sealants of the cell nests appeared to provide some protection against brood parasite invasion. [...] However, use of these more readily available synthetic materials, in an urban setting, may be incidental. [...] In fact, exposure of brood to polyurethane and polyethylene based plastics could be detrimental, as the Canadian team noted, since diffusion of moisture could be inhibited. [...] Some of the brood specimens were heavily affected by mold growth. [...] Additionally, synthetic materials in the nest might hinder the bees ability to move and breath. [...] Toxin exposures and other effects of urbanization are well documented contributors towards pollinator decline in general.|$|E

2500|$|Archaeologists have {{discovered}} {{two forms of}} jade {{that can be found}} across Taiwan through the Philippines, East Malaysia, central and southern Vietnam, and even extending to eastern Cambodia and peninsular Thailand. [...] These two forms are called linling-o penannular earring with three pointed circumferential projections and the double animal-headed ear pendant. [...] The forms are very similar in size and range from about 30–35mm in diameter. [...] Furthermore, radiocarbon dates have dated these forms in Southeast Asia from around 500 BC to 500 AD. The electron probe <b>microanalysis</b> shows that the raw material of these two types of artifacts was nephrite jade from Taiwan called Fengtian nephrite. Evidence recovered from multiple sites from Taiwan, the Philippines, and the mainland southeast Asia suggests that Taiwan was the main source of the exchange of this kind jade. During the Iron Age of Southeast Asia, there may have been skilled craftsmen traveling from Taiwan to southeast Asia along the coastline of the South China Sea, making jade ornaments for local inhabitants.|$|E
