40|$|Abstract: On the First of December 2008, the Public Interest Institution System was {{drastically}} reformed. The former {{system has}} been effectively based on the Civil Code since 1898 and public interest institutions have been providing various services to society such as scientific research and development, art and culture promotion, environment protection and international cooperation. However, the reform undertakings could not be conducted by making use of the statistics that correctly described their activities in the Japanese economy and society {{because there were no}} such statistics, official or private, that would show the activities of public interest institutions by industry or number of persons engaged. With the aim to developing such statistics, we carried out exact matching between the administrative records and the official statistical survey data to make exact matching data. Administrative records have been accumulated through the supervising activities of the government. The Establishment and Enterprise Census, which is conducted every five years by the government, covers all establishments residing in Japan. The census data include the industrial classification and employee data which are comparable to other official statistics. Among 25, 541 administrative records (25, 541 public interest institutions), 66. 4 % was matched with the census data by computer. With the help of human observation and field surveys, a matching rate of 67. 1 % was accomplished. The matching rate was low for the institutions without regular employees; a 79. 5 % matching rate was achieved for the institutions with more than two regular employees. The total annual income of matched institutions covers 87. 9 % of the total annual income of all public interest institutions. The followings tables are presented as new statistics: ・Distribution of institutions by <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>group</b> and by the number of persons engaged ・Number of persons engaged and annual income by <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>group</b> ・Assets by <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>group</b> and by institution type (corporation or foundation) ・Comparison with the other statistics; tax statistics, statistics on private incorporated companie...|$|E

We demonstrate that MS effectively correct non-normality problems and outshine both GARCH and the mixing normal models, with the former (latter) alternative being subject to over- (under-estimating) the persistence of stock return volatility (hereafter volatility). As for estimating the 5 % VaR, MS appears to be equally effective as Bayesian mixing normal and GARCH. In contrast, MS significantly outperforms the two non-linear alternatives for estimating VaR with 1 % or 2. 5 % tail probabilities. Fur-thermore, as for the window of learning period on rare events, we find that one need to go much farther back to effectively depict the left as opposed to the right tail...|$|E

This is an exploratory study, based on the way a consultancy firm explain " 5 steps" - a method co- designed by the consultancy firm's director and the Information Systems Direction of a <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>group</b> - with three ideal-typical interlocutors: the grandmother, the knowledgeable friend, the prospect. Discourses were collected at a particular point in time of the method's development: this collection has been designed and implemented with and within a major company, but it is still poorly known and has not been diffused to other customers: the discourses on the method are still being prepared. Analysis shows that discourses held enable to outline a minimal description of the method's contents and its main characteristics presented as advantages. The utterances are globally expositive. The protocol also enables to highlight the discourses' specificities {{on the basis of the}} interlocutors' figures. The discourse to the grandmother figure is general and descriptive, on an educational tone. The discourse to the friend figure becomes more precise with a specialised vocabulary on the management fundamentals but especially on the method specific technical elements. The discourse to the prospect figure integrates a dialogic dimension. It takes on an educational and promissive tone referring to the management fundamentals rather than to the technical vocabulary of the method. Observation reveals that the discourse to the prospect is simpler than to a friend, whereas more specialised vocabulary could have been expected when addressing a prospect.

40|$|This thesis surveys some of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of the economy of Ilorin in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The aspects surveyed are (1) the involvement of Ilorin Town in long-distance trade; (2) three of its major industries, namely, the production of lantana beads, narrow-loom cloth, and pottery; and (3) the town’s agricultural hinterland, called the “metropolitan districts” in colonial times. The initial general impression gained by a student of the Ilorin economy is one of great importance and prosperity in the nineteenth century, followed by a marked decline and failure to redevelop during the colonial period. Thus, a major theme of this thesis is an examination of this impression, with regard to the three aspects named above. Ilorin’s commitment to an intermediary role is of particular importance to an understanding of its prosperity and decline, and this role is examined in the chapters on trade and the metropolitan districts. Further themes include the following: the economic continuities between Old Oyo and Ilorin; the role of the slave trade, slaves and other dependants in the Ilorin economy; the part played in this economy by members of the Ilorin elite; and the similarities and differences between <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>groups.</b> Prior to the discussion of these themes, a brief outline of the political and administrative history of Ilorin provides necessary background information and an introduction to names and terms. ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the article}} {{is the study of}} new {{qualitative}} approaches to development of investment strategies in <b>major</b> financial and <b>industrial</b> corporations. The article uses the games theory and methods of system analysis for modelling these processes. It considers strategies that would result in the maximal general system effect, which is the main task of the target co-ordination. The main difficulty of modelling the investment activity in major financial and production groups lies in the necessity to take into account interconnection between individual participants of the investment process and co-ordination of their interests and actions. The proposed approaches to analysis and selection of investment projects inside a <b>major</b> financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>group</b> facilitates making a co-ordination decision on distribution of investment resources of the general system fund and funds of individual system subdivisions. In the result of the study the article offers to use specific models of co-ordination of investment activity.

We construct a model where greater access to credit has opposing e¤ects on job ow volatility. On the one hand, greater access facilitates expansion of existing 8 ̆ 5 rms in response to favorable productivity shocks, increasing the {{volatility of}} job ows for a given distribution of shocks. On the other hand, with greater access to credit more 8 ̆ 5 rms can expand, which leads to an increase in aggregate demand for labor and higher wages.

The objective of this dissertation is to examine empirically the dividend behavior of Indian corporations. Theoretical and empirical literature on corporate finance in industrialized countries is substantial. However, this issue is not well probed in developing economies. Empirical studies of the determinants of dividend payments in India are scarce. The findings of these studies are inadequate and unsatisfactory in several respects: (1) the specification of the model, in the majority of the studies, is naive, (2) most of the studies are based on data from the l 950 s and l 960 s, (3) the results of time series are inconclusive as the sample size used in these studies is very small, (4) most of the cross-sectional studies ignore the inter-industry and/or inter-company differences in their analysis, and (5) most studies include only a few industries or <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> in their analysis. As an alternative, this study employs a simultaneous equations model of dividends, investment and external financing. This study includes the most recent data available (1950 - 51 to 1982 - 83). Our study is comprehensive. The analysis is carried at the aggregate level of all public limited companies, at the level of 8 <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> and for the 28 individual industries. A three-stage least squares method is employed to estimate the simultaneous equations model. Our major findings include: (1) In general, investment expenditures have a significantly negative impact on dividend payments. (2) Investment decisions are not independent of dividend decisions. This is inconsistent with Fama and Miller's separation principle. (3) Dividend decisions are not entirely independent of the availability of external funds. (4) Financial variables, internal and external, are important determinants of fixed investment. (5) Among the accelerator variables, only current sales have the major contribution in the determination of the level of investment. (6) There is some support for the permanent income hypothesis of dividends...|$|R
