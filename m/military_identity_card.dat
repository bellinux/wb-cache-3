Shortly afterwards, the corporals were dragged across the road to Casement Park, where they were beaten further. A local priest intervened to stop the beating, but was pulled away when a <b>military</b> <b>identity</b> <b>card</b> was discovered, raising speculation that the corporals were {{members of the}} SAS. The two were bundled semi-conscious over a wall by IRA operatives, who jumped over the wall and forced the corporals {{into the back of a}} black taxi and sped away. The taxi took the corporals and the IRA men to an area of waste ground in West Belfast, the IRA men continuing to beat the soldiers en route. Six men were seen leaving the vehicle. The two corporals, apparently dazed from their injuries, staggered from the taxi, but were quickly restrained. Another IRA man arrived with a pistol taken from one of the soldiers, with which he repeatedly shot each of the corporals before handing the weapon to another man, who shot the corporals' bodies multiple times. Margaret Thatcher described the corporals' killings as the [...] "single most horrifying event in Northern Ireland" [...] during her premiership.|$|E

50|$|Moorthy {{joined the}} armed forces in 1988. He was one of ten people in the Malaysia Everest 1997 team among whom two members, M. Magendran and N. Mohanadas, became the first Malaysians who climbed to the summit of Mount Everest, {{reaching}} the peak on 23 May 1997. On 14 August of the following year, while at the Sungai Udang army camp in Melaka, he fell during a training exercise and became paralysed from the waist down. According to his wife, his mental faculties also declined in parallel with his physical condition; he suffered emotional disturbances and short-term memory loss, and once forgot {{the way back to}} his house and had to telephone for help. Records of the Malaysian Armed Forces state that he embraced Islam on 11 October 2004 and filed an application with his superiors to be registered as such on 8 March 2005; however, his <b>military</b> <b>identity</b> <b>card</b> was never modified to reflect this change of religion or his reported new Muslim name of Mohammad Abdullah. His older brother Muhammad Hussein, formerly known as Maniam Sugumaran (born c. 1958), had earlier converted to Islam after getting married to a Muslim woman in Sabah. His younger brother Shangalingam (born c. 1980) remained a Hindu. Despite his conversion to Islam, Moorthy remained uncircumcised, still took part in Hindu festivals, ate pork, and drank alcohol; he appeared on television on 31 October 2005, being interviewed about his celebration of Deepavali. On 11 November 2005, he fell from his wheelchair, injuring his head and entering into a coma from which he would never recover.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the period}} of the {{rebellion}} against the British and the civil war against the Arabs, Begin lived openly under a series of assumed names, often while sporting a beard. Begin would not come out of hiding until April 1948, when the British, who still maintained nominal authority over Palestine, were almost totally gone. During {{the period of}} revolt, Begin was the most wanted man in Palestine, and MI5 placed a 'dead-or-alive' bounty of £10,000 on his head. Begin had been forced into hiding immediately prior to the declaration of revolt, when Aliza noticed that their house was being watched. He initially lived in a room in the Savoy Hotel, a small hotel in Tel Aviv whose owner was sympathetic to the Irgun's cause, and his wife and son were smuggled in to join him after two months. He decided to grow a beard and live openly under an assumed name rather than go completely into hiding. He was aided {{by the fact that the}} British authorities possessed only two photographs of his likeness, of which one, which they believed to be his <b>military</b> <b>identity</b> <b>card,</b> bore only a slight resemblance to him, according to Begin, and were fed misinformation by Yaakov Meridor that he had had plastic surgery, and were thus confused over his appearance. Due to the British police conducting searches in the hotel's vicinity, he relocated to a Yemenite neighborhood in Petah Tikva, and after a month, moved to the Hasidof neighborhood near Kfar Sirkin, where he pretended to be a lawyer named Yisrael Halperin. After the British searched the area but missed the street where his house was located, Begin and his family moved to a new home on a Tel Aviv side street, where he assumed the name Yisrael Sassover and masqueraded as a rabbi. Following the King David Hotel bombing, when the British searched the entire city of Tel Aviv, Begin evaded capture by hiding in a secret compartment in his home. In 1947, he moved to the heart of Tel Aviv and took the identity of Dr. Yonah Koenigshoffer, the name he found on an abandoned passport in a library.|$|E
50|$|As the Germans {{advanced}} {{along the}} Somme throughout May and June 1940, {{more and more}} tanks, cannons and munitions passed through Rue. One resident of Rue remembered how the sky towards Abbeville being red. The town was literally burning. Seeing Stukas or Messersmitt’s (German fighter aeroplanes) in the skies over Rue was a common sight. By 22 May 1940, the German control of Northern France was becoming more visible. Barbed wire was appearing along roads around Rue and military outposts had been established. In Rue, the German Commander implemented <b>military</b> rule. <b>Identity</b> <b>cards</b> were distributed and a curfew was set at 2100h. <b>Identity</b> <b>cards</b> (called Ausweis) had to be collected Montreuil.

5000|$|It {{turned out}} that there was more to his plan than simply keeping a low profile. Later in March 1942 he {{obtained}} a manual printing press which, using a handcart, he transported from Kreuzberg to Käte Kausel's cellar in Wilmersdorf, where he set it up. [...] He used the press to create himself a fictitious identity as [...] "Oskar Haupt", creating both an official (seeming) identity document and a certificate of military unfitness. The quality was excellent: even the usual watermarks were correctly incorporated. [...] According to the documents Oskar Haupt was employed as a scientific draftsman at the Botanical Institute in Königin-Luise-Straße ("Queen Luise Street"). Having perfected his technique he quickly branched out, specialising in official documents, notably <b>military</b> <b>identity</b> <b>cards</b> and food coupons for butter ("Reisebuttermarken [...] "). Most food ration coupons were marked with the identity of the retailer who would exchange them, but the butter coupons were not assigned to any particular retailer, which may have reflected the relative volatility of butter supplies. In any event, it meant that the butter coupons were untraceable and could be used and traded for other ration coupons on behalf of people who were living illegally (unregistered) and therefore received no ration coupons from the authorities. [...] Quality was characteristically excellent: butter coupons incorporated watermarks as a protective device to prevent forgery. Oskar Huth's butter coupons incorporated the same water marks. It was estimated that more than 60 people, mostly Jewish, who were hidden in the cavity directly under the rafter in the or cellars of people's homes, were able to survive because of the coupons produced by Oskar Huth in Käte Kausel's cellar.|$|R
