40|$|Biomass flow {{characteristics}} and forage accumulation were evaluated in Bermudagrass (Tifton 85) pasture managed under intermittent stocking with different management strategies. The management levels utilized were conventional (10 cm residual height and unfertilized), light (20 cm residual height and unfertilized), moderate (20 cm residual height with fertilization of 300 kg N/ha. year) and intensive (10 cm residual height with fertilization of 600 kg N/ha. year). A randomized design was used with repeated measurements over time, in two periods of the year, with four replicates. There was {{significant effect of}} <b>management</b> × <b>period</b> of the year on the leaf elongation rate (LER). The management levels under fertilization (0. 59 and 0. 60 cm/tiller. day for the intensive and moderate management, respectively) and the rainy season (0. 49 cm/tiller. day) showed the greatest stem elongation rate. Leaf senescence rate (LSR) before and after and total LSR were modified by the <b>management</b> × <b>period</b> of the year interaction. The intensive management, with 0. 38 leaves/tiller. day, {{as well as the}} dry period, with 0. 27 leaves/tiller. day, showed higher leaf appearance rate. The lowest phyllochron was observed in intensive <b>management</b> and dry <b>periods,</b> as well as an interaction with the management of the same periods of the year. There was <b>management</b> × <b>period</b> of year interaction effect on leaf lifespan; the highest value was found under conventional <b>management</b> and dry <b>period.</b> Both production and forage accumulation rates were higher in the intensive and moderate management levels and dry season, and there was interaction of the intensive management system with the seasons.

40|$|Twenty-two {{years of}} water quality time-series {{of the two}} Dutch lakes Veluwemeer and Wolderwijd were subject to {{predictive}} modelling by hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA). The modelling aimed at forecasting changes of the phytoplankton community {{in response to the}} control of external nutrient loadings and fish abundances as consecutively implemented to both lakes since 1979. The water quality time-series of both lakes were structured for HEA modelling in order to reflect the following three different <b>management</b> <b>periods</b> by both training and validation datasets: no management (1976 - 1978), lake flushing and waste water treatment (1979 -onwards) and lake flushing, waste water treatment and food web manipulation (1991 - 1993). This approach facilitated a comparative analysis for the two lakes and the three <b>management</b> <b>periods.</b> Firstly HEA achieved reasonably accurate results for 5 -days-ahead forecasting of chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton functional groups. Secondly hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA) achieved similar good forecasting results but also provided model representations for chlorophyll-a and algae functional groups in the form of rule sets. HEA has been designed to evolve both the structure of rule sets as well as the parameter values imbedded in the rule sets by means of a genetic algorithm. With regards to the different approaches for eutrophication management, modelling results have shown that only the combination of external nutrient control with food web manipulation has changed the lakes from hypereutrophic to mosotrophic conditions as reflected by the change in the dominance of algae groups and chlorophyll-a concentrations. HEA provides rule sets for the explanation of these ecological changes. The rules revealed that phosphorus limitation by means of seasonal lake flushing and wastewater treatment with food-web manipulation diminished the abundance of the harmful blue-green algae but enhanced the abundance of harmless green algae and diatoms.

40|$|Effects of two tillage {{treatments}} and two fallow <b>period</b> <b>managements</b> under continuous maize cropping on soil temperature, soil water dynamics and maize development were evaluated over a 4 -year period (2005 - 2008). Tillage treatments were conventional tillage with mouldboard ploughing and conservation tillage with disk harrowing. The fallow <b>period</b> <b>managements</b> were bare soil or soil sown {{with a cover}} crop after maize harvest. For each year, topsoil temperature (0 - 20 cm-depth) was lower under conservation tillage systems at sowing, from 0. 8 to 2. 8 degrees C. This difference persisted several weeks after sowing, and disappeared afterwards. Under conservation tillage, higher soil water content was generally measured at sowing and {{during the growing season}} strong fluctuations were observed at 40 cm-depth. Under conventional tillage, soil water content varied mainly in the tilled layer (20 cm-depth). Tillage and fallow <b>period</b> <b>management</b> affected water flow rate at 40 cm-depth.

40|$|Contemporary {{electricity}} distribution systems are {{being challenged by}} the variability of renewable energy sources. Slow response times and long energy <b>management</b> <b>periods</b> cannot efficiently integrate intermittent renewable generation and demand. Yet stochasticity can be judiciously coupled with system flexibilities to enhance grid operation efficiency. Voltage magnitudes for instance can transiently exceed regulation limits, while smart inverters can be overloaded over short time intervals. To implement such a mode of operation, an ergodic energy management framework is developed here. Considering a distribution grid with distributed energy sources and a feed-in tariff program, active power curtailment and reactive power compensation are formulated as a stochastic optimization problem. Tighter operational constraints are enforced in an average sense, while looser margins are enforced to be satisfied at all times. Stochastic dual subgradient solvers are developed based on exact and approximate grid models of varying complexity. Numerical tests on a real-world 56 -bus distribution grid and the IEEE 123 -bus test feeder relying on both grid models corroborate {{the advantages of the}} novel schemes over their deterministic alternatives.
