5000|$|Division 10 — Specialties Lockers: Division 10 — Specialties is a {{category}} within the National <b>Master</b> <b>Specification</b> (NMS) {{set of guidelines}} developed by Public Works and Government Services Canada. Division 10 — Specialties items that could be required within a locker room (to meet commercial building and construction regulations) are lockers, washroom accessories, toilet compartments, and toilet partitions. Lockers are constructed of two sides: a back, top and a bottom. Different types of materials are used in locker manufacturing, offering {{a wide variety of}} metal lockers, stainless steel lockers, solid plastic lockers, solid phenolic lockers, and custom lockers. A padlock is the most common way to lock a locker; however, you can also use a keyed cylinder lock, built in combination locks or keypad locks. There are a lot of optional extras that can be utilized for lockers, for example: bases, sloping tops, end panels, customized shelves and hooks as well as the locking method (coin-operated lockers are another option). The environment {{is the best way to}} distinguish what type of locker will be required for which type of space. For example, if you are putting gym lockers into a humid area, or anywhere close to showers, stainless steel or solid plastic lockers would be most suitable because they are moisture-resistant and rust-resistant. Wood lockers would not be appropriate for this type of environment because the moisture from the humidity would rot the wood.|$|E

40|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons why {{software}} construction is an inherently hard process to <b>master.</b> <b>Specification</b> plays a central role here; therefore, better means of specification improve productivity. One way of achieving this may be the use of formal specification languages, which have the advantage of being unambiguous. This thesis proposes and motivates a new formal specification language called AFSL (Almost Formal Specification Language or Another Formal Specification Language). AFSL is not a full-grown tool that can be used productively in the software industry right away.

40|$|The {{building}} in the top photo is the new home of the National Permanent Savings Bank in Washington, D. C., designed by Hartman-Cox Architects. Its construction {{was based on a}} money-saving method of preparing building specifications which derived from NASA technology developed to obtain quality construction while holding down cost of launch facilities, test centers and other structures. Written technical specifications spell out materials and components to be used on construction projects and identify the quality tests each item must pass. Specifications can have major impact on construction costs. Poorly formulated specifications can lead to unacceptable construction which must be replaced, unnecessarily high materials costs, safety hazards, disputes and often additional costs due to delays and litigation. NASA's Langley Research Center developed a novel approach to providing accurate, uniform, cost-effective specifications which can be readily updated to incorporate new building technologies. Called SPECSINTACT, it is a computerized - system accessible to all NASA centers involved in construction programs. The system contains a comprehensive catalog of <b>master</b> <b>specifications</b> applicable to many types of construction. It enables designers of any structure to call out relevant sections from computer storage and modify them to fit the needs of the project at hand. Architects and engineers can save time by concentrating their efforts on needed modifications rather than developing all specifications from scratch. Successful use of SPECSINTACT has led to a number of spinoff systems. One of the first was MASTERSPEC, developed from NASA's experience by Production Systems for Architects and Engineers, Inc., an organization established by the American Institute of Architects. MASTERSPEC, used in construction of the bank building pictured, follows the same basic format as SPECSINTACT and can be used in either automated or manual modes. The striking appearance of the bank building shows that, while MASTERSPEC saves time and money, its use involves no sacrfice in architectural design freedom. The Naval Engineering Facilities Command employs an automated specifications system based on SPECSINTACT. The Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration used SPECSINTACT as a starting point in a plan to make its guideline specifications available to architects and engineers on a nationwide computer network. Public Technology, Inc., a NASA Technology Application Team, is working with Production Systems for Architects and Engineers, Inc., to promote widespread use of the system by state and local governments for cost benefits to taxpayers...|$|R

The optimal synthesis of spherical parallel manipulators is performed using a realcoded Genetic Algorithm based method. Simulations on the actuator responses of the structure allowed us the validate it. In order to control this robot, we have also designed a haptic device that provides easiness to use as well as force feedback.

Subsequently, <b>specification</b> of organ axes programs the distribution of distinct tissue types within the organs that themselves develop unique identities. The C-class, AGAMOUS-clade MADS box genes are primary promoters of the gynoecium, which is divided into a distal style and a subtending ovary along the apical-basal axis. We show that members of a clade of B 3 domain transcription factors, NGATHA 1 (NGA 1) to NGA 4, are expressed distally in all lateral organs, and all four have a redundant and essential role in style development. Loss of all four genes results in gynoecia where style is replaced by valve-like projections {{and a reduction in}} style-specific SHATTERPROOF 1 (SHP 1) expression. In agreement, floral misexpression of NGA 1 promotes ectopic style and SHP 1 expression. STYLISH 1, an auxin biosynthesis inducer, conditionally activated NGA genes, which in turn promoted distal expression of other STY genes in a putative positive feedback loop. Inhibited auxin transport or lack of YABBY 1 gene activities resulted in a basally expanded style domain and broader expression of NGA genes. We speculate that early gynoecium factors delimit NGA gene response to an auxin-based signal, elicited by STY gene activity, to restrict the activation of style program to a late and distal carpel domain...|$|R

In {{response to the}} September 11 th attacks, new legislation culminating in the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2010 was established and reinforced food safety regulations for the {{brewing industry}}. Under this expanded regulation, breweries are required {{to comply with the}} modernized Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). The regulatory climate for the brewing industry is very complicated. The brewing industry is regulated primarily {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and the Food and Drug Administration. Based upon the regulatory environment and business considerations, Boulevard Brewing Company has opted to develop a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan. Before a HACCP plan can be implemented a foundation of prerequisite programs, based on the FDA’s cGMPs, must be in place. Prerequisite programs establish the operational and environmental conditions required for a successful HACCP plan. Failure to comply with the cGMPs can lead to fines, re‐inspection fees, forced recalls, and possible criminal prosecution. Prerequisite programs were developed for the following areas: facilities, including sanitary design principles, utilities, traffic and product flow; production equipment, including preventive maintenance and calibration; receiving, warehousing, and shipping, including supplier control, chemical control, and raw material testing; pest control for insects, rodents and birds; cleaning and sanitation under a <b>Master</b> Sanitation Schedule; <b>specifications,</b> including ingredients, products, and packaging materials; personal hygiene for both employees and visitors; and lastly a system of traceability and recall.

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{have been}} used increasingly {{over the past few}} years. Special Forces of various countries utilise these systems successfully in war zones such as Afghanistan. The biggest advantage is rapid information gathering without endangering human lives. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) also identified the need for local short range aerial reconnaissance and information gathering. A detailed literature survey identified various international players involved in the development of small hand-launch UAV systems. Unfortunately, these overseas systems are too expensive for the SANDF. A new system had to be developed locally to comply with the unique requirements, and budget, of the SANDF. The survey of existing systems provided valuable input to the detailed user requirement statement (URS) for the new South African development. The next step was to build a prototype using off-the-shelf components. Although this aircraft flew and produced good video images, {{it turned out to be}} unreliable. The prototype UAV was then replaced with a standard type model aircraft, purchased from Micropilot. Some modifications were needed to ensure better compliance with the URS. Laboratory and field tests proved that the aircraft can be applied for aerial images, within range of 10 km from the ground control station (GCS). The major limitation is that it can only fly for 40 minutes. Furthermore, the airframe is not robust, needing repairs after only 15 flights. Although the system has shortcomings, it has already been used successfully. It is expected that improved battery technologies and sturdier light-weight materials will further help to improve the system beyond user <b>specifications.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Using {{kerosene}} as an aromatic organic diluent in the liquid–liquid {{separation process}} for the extraction of uranium in the solvent extraction section of the AngloGold Ashanti South Uranium Plant {{near the town of}} Orkney in South Africa, incurs a multitude of safety, health and environmental problems. A possible solution may be to replace the currently used aromatic–based organic diluent with an aliphatic–based organic diluent. A range of aliphatic organic diluents were tested to determine the extraction efficiency of these alternative diluents, if they were to be applied to the process currently implemented by the AngloGold Ashanti South Uranium Plant. The aliphatic organic diluents under investigation were: Biodiesel-B– 100 Shellsol D 70 Sasol Wax SSX 150 Sasol Wax SSX 210 The aliphatic diluent yielding the highest uranium extraction efficiency, and having the most desirable physical characteristics, was Sasol Wax SSX 210. Sasol Wax SSX 210 was selected to replace kerosene as the diluent in the solvent composition to conduct the next phase of the study. The solvent’s composition was then optimised to obtain a desirable solvent make–up containing the newly chosen aliphatic diluent, third–phase inhibitor and tertiary alkyl amine. The most favourable solvent composition was found to be; 5 vol. % Alamine 336 with 2 vol. % isodecanol and 93 vol. % SSX 210. A third parameter, pH, was identified as an influencing factor on the overall efficiency of the process. A theoretical explanation for the influence that pH has on the process, confirmed by an experimental analysis, was examined to determine which pH characteristics contributed to the efficiency of the extraction process. A final indication {{of the success of the}} newly implemented aliphatic solvent was determined via a precipitation simulation. The structure of crystals precipitated from the loaded strip liquor (OK liquor) was evaluated to ensure that the required product would adhere to product <b>specifications.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{attached}} Geothermal (Ground-Source) Heat Pump (GHP) Guide Specifications {{have been}} developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{with the intent to}} assist federal agency sites and engineers in the preparation of construction specifications for GHP projects. These specifications {{have been developed}} in the industry-standard Construction Specification Institute (CSI) format and cover several of the most popular members of the family of GHP systems. These guide specifications are applicable to projects whether the financing is with conventional appropriations, arranged by GHP specialty ESCOs under the U. S. Department of Energy's Technology-Specific GHP Super ESPCs, arranged by utilities under Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs) or arranged by generalist ESCOs under the various regional ESPCs. These specifications can provide several benefits to the end user that will help ensure successful GHP system installations. GHP guide specifications will help to streamline the specification development, review, and approval process because the architecture and engineering (AE) firm will be working from the familiar CSI format instead of developing the specifications from other sources. The guide specifications help to provide uniformity, standardization, and consistency in both the construction specifications and system installations across multiple federal sites. This standardization can provide future benefits to the federal sites in respect to both maintenance and operations. GHP guide specifications can help to ensure that the agency is getting its money's worth from the GHP system by preventing the use of marginal or inferior components and equipment. The agency and its AE do not have to start from scratch when developing specifications and can use the specification as a template and/or a checklist in developing both the design and the contract documents. The guide specifications can save project costs by reducing the engineering effort required during the design development phase. Use of this guide specification for any project is strictly optional and at the discretion of the responsible party in charge. If used as a construction <b>specification</b> <b>master</b> template for GHP systems, this guide specification must, in all cases, be edited to apply to the specific project in question and to reflect the site-specific conditions relevant to the project.
