40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a classification of <b>misses</b> <b>and</b> of {{components of the}} data traffic in shared-memory multiprocessors based on inter-processor communication.

The rest of the <b>misses</b> <b>and</b> of the data traffic is non-essential and could be ignored without affecting the correctness of program execution. To illustrate the classification of <b>misses</b> <b>and</b> traffic, we apply it {{to a set of}} parallel scientific programs and observe the overhead created by different hardware mechanisms when block sizes and cache sizes are varied.
