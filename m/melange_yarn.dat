40|$|A queuing {{model of}} staple yarn {{structure}} {{was presented in}} Part I of this work, where the migration behaviours of fibres were simulated by the movement of customers in a Markovian network of queuing systems. Part II of the series proposes (i) a multi-dimensional minimization method for estimating the migration probabilities of fibres based on {{the analysis of the}} distribution of number of fibres in yarn cross-sections; (ii) a yarn structure simulation algorithm which uses the migration probabilities of fibres, yarn technical specifications (e. g. linear density and twist) and colour composition to produce a realistic three-dimensional image of a <b>melange</b> <b>yarn.</b> The result is a high quality three-dimensional image of a <b>melange</b> <b>yarn</b> showing its fibrous structure as well as the formation of hairiness. Due to the generic nature of the model and the simulation algorithm, this approach can be applied {{to a wide range of}} yarns including ring-spun or open-end spun yarns of solid shade or produced from melange blends. Further improvements to the proposed model are discussed including the application of inhomogeneous Poisson process and the analysis of energy relationships which govern the migration behaviour of fibres...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{evaluation}} method by the melange-colored disc for melange (heathery coloring) {{effect on the}} non-woven disc by the blended chips of the differently colored fibers from each other was proposed, and applied to {{the assessment of the}} desirability on the coloring of two colored fiber assembly, replacing with the coloring of a two colored <b>melange</b> <b>yarn.</b> The desirable color combinations were assessed by the 31 observers in the respective testing disc, comparing with the pattern-designed disc of the same color combination, and then were discussed in relation to color differences between differently colored fibers. The results of the assesement by the 31 observers pointed out that it was necessary for the desirable color combinations to select higher contrast coloring in the melange-colored disc than in the pattern-designed disc owing to very small visual size of the colored fibers...|$|E
40|$|A queuing {{model of}} staple fiber yarn is {{presented}} {{that enables the}} modeling and {{a better understanding of}} fiber migration in a yarn. The model provides a fine yarn structure where the migrational behavior of fibers is associated with the behavior of customers traveling across an open network of queuing systems to get services. Based on this analogy, the underlying mathematical foundation of the queuing theory is used for the modeling of yarn structure and properties. The model uses yarn technical specifications including yarn linear density and twist level, fiber linear density and length distribution, together with specific parameters such as fiber packing density distribution and migration probabilities. The model can be used for modeling a wide range of structurally different yarns; examples include marl, mottle and <b>melange</b> <b>yarns,</b> yarns with different levels of hairiness, and yarns produced by various spinning systems. The model can be used for 3 D simulation of yarns in computer-aided design systems for textile design and for the prediction of mechanical properties of yarns. EPSR...|$|R
40|$|It is {{actually}} for history of textile technologies and Lithuanian culture heritage to investigate deeply peculiarities of manufacturing and appearance of folk textile, to establish {{local and global}} tendencies of their distribution. This investigation seeks to discover alternation of home weaving traditions establishing raw material of yarns, types of yarn structure and features of threads colours in authentic folk fabrics used in Lithuanian villages in the 19 th century in peasants clothing and showing yarns types territorial distribution in Lithuanian regions Žemaitija and Aukštaitija. It was investigated 468 pieces of clothing of this period from the album saved in National M. K. Čiurlionis Museum of Art. It is unexpected that cotton yarns are very common in warp of hand made clothing fabrics {{at the end of}} the 19 th century. Cotton yarns replaced flax and wool in warp. It was established that plied yarns dominate in warp and plain yarns – in weft. Fancy dyed, mouline, <b>melange</b> and <b>yarns</b> with multiplex winding were identificated in the fabrics. Also it was innovative to found the metallic thread in weft of two examples of the fabrics. Frequency of colours distribution was established analyzing colours of yarns. The analysis of territorial distribution of fancy yarns types showed the tendency to spread the novelties of yarns and threads in traditional textile from the West part of the country.
