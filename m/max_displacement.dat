For example, a muscle that generates force without changing length (isometric contraction) will show a vertical line 'work loop'. Reciprocally, a muscle that shortens without changing force (isotonic contraction) will show a horizontal line 'work loop'. Finally, a muscle can behave like a spring which extends linearly as a force is applied. This final case would yield a slanted straight line 'work loop' where the line slope is the spring stiffness.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A serious {{limitation}} {{in the use}} of GPS in {{the monitoring}} of important structures like bridges, and especially in the identification of their modal frequencies, is whether this geodetic sensor can identify more than one modal frequency. In order to contribute in the solution of this problem, we made a large number of experiments with a linear oscillator of predetermined characteristics and with three degrees of freedom and <b>max</b> <b>displacements</b> up to 3. 4 cm. A GPS receiver was mounted on the sliding mass most remote from the generator and was recording simultaneously with another receiver in nearby, stable position, both sampling at 20 Hz rate. Experiments were made with different excitation frequencies, up to 4 Hz, either constant or linearly increasing from 0. 05 to 4 Hz. Recorded displacements were analyzed in the frequency domain using least-squares software, suitable for the spectral analysis of short and non-equi-spaced time series. From the spectral analysis it was revealed that GPS records can determine accurately the excitation frequency and the significant modal frequencies of the oscillating mass even when the excitation frequency is not constant or the time series are very short (50 - 60 observations). These results are very promising for they were obtained from signals a few seconds long and with very small amplitude. The conclusion is therefore that GPS can identify multiple frequencies, including transient and modal ones in real structures, especially in flexible ones, in which the oscillation amplitude is larger than those tested and this leads to a higher signal-to noise value. 1...|$|R

The SP developed as a space filling accommodation zone for S. America-Antarctica relative motions, mostly during the last 40 m. y. The SSR also hosts several restraining and releasing bends. The SP, PB and SOM have complex evolution histories including large-scale displacement and stretching of the SOM, {{as well as other}} continental fragments within the SP, all of which were incorporated into a background of changing sea floor spreading geometries. The SOM defines an ~ 300 km segment of the SSR opposite a section of the SP that is primarily oceanic crust with a few small, stretched continental fragments. Two large earthquakes, M 7. 6 and 7. 8, with aftershock zones largely confined to the northern SOM boundary, occurred on the SSR in 2003 and 2013. Moment tensor solutions show they occurred on faults dipping ~ 30 and 45 ° to the south. The 2013 event was almost pure, left-lateral strike-slip, while the 2003 event was oblique but predominantly strike-slip. This is an unusual combination of fault dip and slip direction for a strike-slip plate boundary. The half duration of both events is also relatively long. A continuous GPS (CGPS) station on Laurie Island is located immediately west of the rupture zone of the 2003 event and at the approximate center, and close to the surface projection, of the finite fault models for the 2013 earthquake.

Anterior and lateral cover deficiency is seen, as a result a dysplastic hip joint. Various incision modifications have been developed because of the muscle dissection and wide wound scar in Smith-Peterson incision, which was originally used in Bernese osteotomy. This study evaluates applicability of the modified Stoppa approach {{in the performance of}} Bernese periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). Materials and Methods: Ten hemipelvises of five donor cadavers were used. The transverse Stoppa incision was made 2 cm over the symphysis pubis for quadrilateral surface exposure and pubic and ischial bone osteotomies. The second skin incision, a few centimeters lateral to the original incision, was made along the tensor fascia lata. Iliac bone osteotomy was performed starting just above the rectus femoris insertion. The displacement of the osteotomy was measured clinically and radiographically. Results: The mean anterior coverage calculated with center-edge angle was improved from 22. 8 ° ± 2. 8 (range 20 ° min– 28 ° max) preoperatively to 44. 1 ° ± 3. 7 (range 36 ° min– 48 ° <b>max).</b> The <b>displacement</b> of the osteotomy at the iliopectineal line calculated on the iliac inlet view radiographs was 22. 1 ± 3. 4 mm (range 15 mm min– 26 mm max).

40|$|The soil {{flexibility}} {{effect is}} generally ignored in seismic design of building frames {{and the design}} is carried out based on results of dynamic analysis considering fixed base condition. Flexibility of soil causes lengthening of lateral natural period due to overall decrease in lateral stiffness of the structure. Such lengthening of lateral natural period(T) may considerably alter the seismic response of the building frames resting on Raft foundation. Hence {{it is necessary to}} incorporate the flexibility of soil on which the foundation rests during analysis, such study being termed as Soil Structure Interaction. The present paper deals with dynamic behaviour of building frames asymmetric in plan with Raft footings under seismic forces incorporating soil-structure interaction. The analysis is carried out using FEM software SAP 2000 *V 14. The structure is idealized as 3 D space frame where in beam and column are modeled as 2 noded line elements with six degrees of freedom at each node and slabs are modeled as thin shell with four noded plate elements having six degrees of freedom at each node. The soil is modeled as equivalent springs with single(Winkler) and six degrees of freedom(Modified winkler) the stiffness of which varies with type of soil based on the properties, viz., dynamic shear modulus and poissons ratio of soil. The raft foundation for winkler and Modified Winkler are modeled as thin shells with four noded plate elements having 6 degrees of freedom at each node and is discritised, such that the aspect ratio of the elements are equal to one. The response in terms of fundamental Natural Period, Seismic Base Shear and <b>Max.</b> Lateral <b>Displacement,</b> for a variety of building frames with and without consideration of soil flexibility is compared to evaluate the contribution of soil structure interaction on building frames. Influence of of parameters such as different soil types (i. e, Soft, Medium and Stiff), different span lengths, number of bays and number of stories are considered in the parametric study for Zone V. It is found that the effect of soil flexibility on building frames appreciably alters the fundamental lateral natural period and seismic base shear of the system. Due to the effect of soil flexibility, the lateral natural period and seismic base shear increase with the decreasing stiffness of soil. It is also observed that the lateral period and base shear of the building increases with increase in number of bays. The Maximum lateral displacement increases with increase in number bays and stories. Â© 2013 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} first oil was {{discovered}} in Norway in 1971 the production rates have varied. The development has gone from few wells with high production rates to several wells with lower production rates. It is expected that the production rate will continue to decrease in the future. Taking this into consideration, {{it is apparent that}} operations which will enhance the production rate are important. Workover operations are operations where the well is cleaned out, which enhances the production rate. Moreover, Workover operations are conducted with a Workover Riser Systems. The Workover riser system is a long slender structure stretching from the vessel down to the sea bed, which is exposed to loads from the environment and the platform. If a storm is coming and the operational limits are expected to be exceeded, the system has to perform a planned/normal disconnection. The disconnection takes place between the Emergency Disconnect Package (EDP) and the Lower Riser Package (LRP). This is done to prevent damage to the components, especially the well head. The criteria for conducting disconnection are defined in the operation envelopes. When a planned/normal disconnection is performed there are some critical scenarios that should be avoided. On such scenario is collision between the EDP and the remaining structure at the sea bed, the LRP. The scope of this Master Thesis is to study this event, collision between these two components. The purpose is to study the risk of contact between the Emergency Disconnect Package and the Lower Riser Package and propose a strategy for reducing it. To study the collision event the computer program RIFLEX has been applied. Two different models have been developed, both are based on the model applied in the Project Thesis. One model on - 348 m water depth and one model on - 996 m water depth. Several analyses and disconnection events have been conducted. The first set of analysis conducted is the different disconnection events. These events are disconnection at heave displacement top, heave displacement bottom, half way up the heave <b>displacement</b> (<b>max</b> velocity) and a random in time. The vertical displacement of the EDP after disconnection is studied. Additionally, a mean study has been performed {{in order to determine the}} trend for the vertical displacement after disconnect. Based on the different disconnection events, a probability study has been performed to study the frequency of hits. To enable for the probability study a MATLAB script has been developed. This checks if the EDP is within the limits of the LRP. Moreover, a correlation study has been performed. This has been done to determine if there exists a relation between the vertical velocity 30 seconds in advance of disconnection and at the actual disconnection timing. The reason for studying a 30 seconds time interval is because this is the time it takes for the electrical signal to be sent from the platform down to EDP. Finally, the last set of analyses which have been completed is disconnection analyses with riser lift up. When the disconnection is done the riser is lifted up 2 - 4 meters. A set of random disconnection events with retraction for both the shallow and deep water model has been conducted. The results from the different disconnection events show that when the disconnection is performed at the heave displacement top, the EDP will experience a negative vertical displacement immediately after disconnection. Simultaneously as the EDP is disconnected the riser is locked to the vessel at the top. For disconnection at heave displacement top it is locked at a higher location in the riser, this leads to a longer effective length of the riser underneath the vessel. Thus, the mean vertical displacement is below the location of the LRP. The results from the mean study show that the trend is an immediate negative displacement after disconnect. Additionally, the probability study shows that disconnection at the heave displacement top, has the highest mean percent of time when the EDP is within the LRP limits. On the other hand, the results from disconnection at the heave displacement bottom show that the EDP will have displacement in positive z-direction, and the mean vertical displacement is above the location of the LRP. The mean percentage of time the EDP is within the limits of the LRP, is zero. When the disconnection is performed in the middle of the heave displacement, the average value of the mean vertical displacement lies at the initial position of the EDP. The mean percent of time the EDP is within the LRP limits is the second lowest. The results from the random disconnection show that the mean percent of time the EDP is within the limits of the LRP, is the second highest. Therefore it can be concluded that the most critical disconnection is the disconnection at the heave displacement top. The second most critical is the random disconnection. However, to avoid collision the most optimal disconnection event is disconnection at the heave displacement bottom. Finally, riser disconnection analyses with a 0 - 4 meter lift-up have been performed for the deep and shallow water model. Before the disconnection is performed the riser is retracted 2 - 4 meters to avoid collision. The results from these analyses show that when the riser is lifted up either two or four meters there is a significant clearance between the EDP and LRP. However, the analysis was also done with zero and one meter retraction, which illustrated that the number of hits is lower for the deep water model than the shallow water model. This may have to do with the length of the riser that is exposed to the current. The deep water model will therefore have a bigger horizontal displacement. From these results it can be concluded that if the riser is lifted up a minimum of two meters, it is likely that the EDP will never collide with the LRP...|$|R
40|$|A novel wavelet seismic {{denoising}} method using type II fuzzyDOI: 10. 1016 /j. asoc. 2016. 06. 024 Link: [URL] Filiació URV: SIWavelet based denoising of {{the observed}} non stationary time series earthquake loading has become an important process in seismic analysis. The process of denoising ensures a noise free seismic data, which is essential to extract features accurately (max acceleration, max velocity, <b>max</b> <b>displacement,</b> etc.). However, the efficiency of wavelet denoising is decided by the identification of a crucial factor called threshold. But, identification of optimal threshold is not a straight forward process as the signal involved is non-stationary. i. e. The information which separates the wavelet coefficients that correspond to the region of interest from the noisy wavelet coefficients is vague and fuzzy. Existing works discount this fact. In this article, we have presented an effective denoising procedure that uses fuzzy tool. The proposal uses type II fuzzy concept in setting the threshold. The need for type II fuzzy instead of fuzzy is discussed in this article. The proposed algorithm is compared with four current popular wavelet based procedures adopted in seismic denoising (normal shrink, Shannon entropy shrink, Tsallis entropy shrink and visu shrink). It was first applied on the synthetic accelerogram signal (gaussian waves with noise) to determine the efficiency in denoising. For a gaussian noise of sigma = 0. 075, the proposed type II fuzzy based denoising algorithm generated 0. 0537 {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) and 16. 465 signal to noise ratio (SNR), visu shrink and normal shrink could be able to give 0. 0682 RMSE with 14. 38 SNR and 0. 068 RMSE with 14. 2 SNR, respectively. Also, Shannon and Tsallis generated 0. 0602 RMSE with 15. 47 SNR and 0. 0610 RMSE with 15. 35 SNR, respectively. The proposed method is then applied to real recorded time series accelerograms.

A Box-Behnken design {{was used to}} develop models for the objective responses. The experiments were performed at screw speed 45 rpm and feeding speed 20 g/min. Tapioca starch, PHBV and plasticizer of the raw material formulation of total weight was set for 1 kg. The levels of PHBV/tapioca starch ratio were 7 : 3, 6 : 4, 5 : 5, the levels of xylitol were 45 g, 60 g, 75 g and the levels of barrel temperature of extruder were 140 ℃, 155 ℃, 170 ℃. Individual contour plots of the different responses were overlaid. Regions meeting 243. 75 N, 2. 56 mm, 24. 64 % were identified at 37. 40 %, 59. 60 g and 154. 82 ℃. The results indicated that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of extruded pellets ranged from - 8. 81 ~- 12. 54 ℃, the melting temperature (Tm) ranged from 154. 48 ~ 159. 56 ℃and the thermal degradation temperatures (Td) ranged from 290. 12 ~ 296. 65 ℃. The biodegradability of the extruded pellets were tested according to the CNS 14432 standard. The result indicated that the biodegradability of the extruded pellets reached 70. 4 % after 34 days and 75. 5 % after 45 days, respectively.
