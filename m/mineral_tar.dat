40|$|The SOS Chromotest on Escherichia coli strain PQ 37 {{was used}} to detect DNA damage induced by 16 {{chemical}} compounds and urine samples from smokers and a non-smoking psoriatic patient treated with <b>mineral</b> coal <b>tar.</b> The results confirmed the strong SOS inducing activity of 2 -aminoanthracene and benzo[a]pyrene with metabolic activation and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C and 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide without metabolic activation. A weaker response {{in the absence of}} microsomal enzymes was observed with hydroxyurea (only at high doses) and the soluble Cr(VI) compounds potassium chromate and potassium dichromate. No effect was observed with ampicillin, cadmium chloride, cyclophosphamide, griseofulvin, the insoluble Cr(VI) compound lead chromate, the soluble Cr(III) compounds chromium nitrate, chromium chloride, chromium potassium sulphate, and the chelating agent sodium nitrilotriacetate. Among the Cr(III) compounds only chromium acetate produced a low but significant increase of SOS inducing activity. Solubilization by nitrilotriacetate of genotoxic Cr(VI) from insoluble lead chromate was observed, whereas no interaction occurred between nitrilotriacetate and the soluble Cr(VI) and Cr(III) compounds. Using urinary XAD- 2 extracts, we found the SOS Chromotest poorly sensitive to the mutagens present in urine from tobacco smokers which, on the other hand, were detected by the gene mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). A urine sample obtained from a psoriatic patient, therapeutically treated with <b>mineral</b> coal <b>tar,</b> had a significant SOS inducing activity with and even without metabolic activation, whereas in the Ames test it was active only in the presence of metabolic activation. These results indicate that the SOS Chromotest, although poorly sensitive to urinary mutagens, could detect genotoxic compounds different from those detected by the Salmonella/microsome assay...|$|R

40|$|Black carbon (BC) {{aerosols}} {{are a large}} {{source of}} climate warming, impact atmospheric chemistry, and are implicated in large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation. Inventories of BC emissions suggest {{significant changes in the}} global BC aerosol distribution due to human activity. However, little is known regarding BC's atmospheric distribution or aged particle characteristics before the twentieth century. Here we investigate the prevalence and structural properties of BC particles in Antarctic ice cores from 1759, 1838, and 1930 Common Era (C. E.) using transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The study revealed an unexpected diversity in particle morphology, insoluble coatings, and association with metals. In addition to conventionally occurring BC aggregates, we observed single BC monomers, complex aggregates with internally, and externally mixed metal and <b>mineral</b> impurities, <b>tar</b> balls, and organonitrogen coatings.

40|$|One {{important}} aspect of photomedicine {{is the use of}} nonionizing electromagnetic radiation with and without exogenous photosensitizers to treat diseases. Phototoxicity (cell injury by photons) is a likely mechanism for phototherapy and photochemotherapy of several skin diseases. The mechanism of action for phototherapy of hyperbilirubinemia and of uremic pruritus appears to be photochemical alteration of extracellular inetabolites. Psoriasis {{is an example of a}} disease benefitted by several forms of phototherapy and photocheinotherapy with varying relative effectiveness and safety. Two successful forms of treatment are oral psoralen photochemotherapy and UVB plus topical adjunctive agents. New information about UVB therapy of psoriasis includes data about the therapeutic action spectrum and about the relative roles of various topical agents such as coal <b>tar,</b> <b>mineral</b> oil, “lubricants” and steroids.

40|$|Three {{methods for}} the {{biological}} monitoring of human exposure to coal tar were compared. Levels of 1 -hydroxypyrene(1 -OH PYR), {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH) and mutagens (Ames plate incorporation assay using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 98 {{in the presence of}} S 9 and beta-glucuronidase) were determined in urinary samples from psoriatic patients undergoing topical treatment with <b>mineral</b> coal <b>tar.</b> A single sample of urine with a high content of PAH was diluted with urine of nonexposed, non-smoking subjects in order to obtain nine samples with a decreasing content of PAh metabolites. Mutagenicity of the extracts was detectable down to the dilution corresponding to a content in 1 -OH PYR of about 50 micrograms/g creatinine and total PAH of 7 micrograms/g creatinine. In a second phase the three indicators of exposure to PAH were compared in 16 urinary samples from four psoriatic patients. The total PAH levels determined by the acidic deconjugation/reduction method were confirmed to be nearly always lower than the corresponding levels of 1 -OH PYR alone. Most of the extracts were mutagenic, however, some of the samples with a high content in PAh metabolites were not mutagenic. In all the urinary samples analyzed the excretion of 1 -OH PYR was markedly greater than in control subjects. 1 -OH PYR and urinary mutagenicity levels were well correlated. The present data suggest that both the determination of mutagenicity and 1 -OH PYR in urine may be used to monitor occupational exposure to PAH, the latter method being cheaper and of greater specificity and sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative structure-activity {{relationships}} (QSAR) {{models for}} the dermal penetration of 60 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were established with the CODESSA program. The QSAR {{models for the}} PAH dermal penetration are obtained by selecting descriptors from a wide diversity of constitutional, topological, electrostatic and quantum structural indices. Standard quantum chemistry packages are used for optimizing the molecular geometry and for semi-empirical quantum computations. A heuristic algorithm selects the best multiple linear regression equation according to the highest statistical indices; the predictive power of each QSAR is estimated with the leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation method. The best QSAR model with two descriptors has r 2 = 0. 748, r 2 LOO = 0. 719, s = 6. 5, and F = 84. 42. A significant improvement of the statistical indices is obtained by adding a third theoretical descriptor, i. e. r 2 = 0. 761, r 2 LOO = 0. 725, s = 6. 4, and F = 59. 39. Our results demonstrate that QSAR models {{can be used in}} risk assessment studies in order to estimate the dermal penetration properties of PAHs from <b>mineral</b> oils, coal, <b>tar,</b> and derived products...|$|R
40|$|In Alberta, Canada, amongst its {{mixture of}} sand, clay, water and other <b>minerals,</b> the <b>tar</b> sand’s heavy and viscous {{component}} bitumen, a thick, sticky form {{of crude oil}} is extracted through two methods; open-pit mining for shallower deposits ( 75 m). This degree project consists of a comparison between these two extraction methods impact on air, nature and water, which all have been evaluated by reviewing and analyzing literature. Studies showed that in situ methods cause a higher impact on air than open-pit mining, through higher {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} and sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and will surpass the carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions caused by the open-pit mines when the shallower, more accessible tar sands dwindle. Open-pit mining causes a higher impact on water due to its large tailing ponds that causes leakage of processing water and fine tailings, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH: s) and these 13 following elements considered priority pollutants (PPE) by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); antimony (Sb), arsenic (As), beryllium (Be), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), selenium (Se), silver (Ag), thallium (Tl) and zinc (Zn). However studies remain unclear whether or not in situ methods are worse due to underground tailing ponds. Finally, when it comes to nature, open-pit mining causes a more direct environmental impact through deforestation, drainage of peat and wetland, and blasting of rock. In situ methods however, seem to cause more of a long term environmental impact through fragmentation. Dividing the landscape into smaller units through roads, wells, pipelines and seismic lines, leads to domestic biodiversity and homogenization of flora and fauna as unfavorable conditions is created for the nature’s wildlife. In conclusion, in situ methods causes a bigger impact on air than open-pit mining, while open-pit mining causes a bigger impact on water. Due to lack of time and resources, more research about the direct impact on nature is needed to fully evaluate which of the two extraction methods causes the least environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{particulate}} matter (including TSP, PM 10, PM 2. 5, and PM 1) were collected at an urban site in Xi'an during winter 2010. Individual particles {{were analyzed using}} scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX). The morphologies, size distributions, and relative abundance of aerosol particles in each size were summarized. The monomodal particle size distribution was found in all the samples under different weather conditions, with the peaks located at less than 1. 0 μm. The majority of particles were composed of soot, <b>mineral</b> dust, and <b>tar</b> balls, with minor fly ash particles. Soot aggregates were the predominant species (in numbers), ranging from 56. 6 % in TSP {{on a sunny day}} to 86. 3 % in PM 1 on a cloudy day, with an average of 73. 2 % in all the samples. The particle mass concentration and chemical composition, including water-soluble inorganic ions, elemental compositions, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) contents of 24 -hr integrated PM 2. 5, were also subject to chemical bulk analysis. Soot was predominantly observed in the PM 2. 5 samples (from 74. 7 % to 82. 7 % in numbers), whereas EC accounted for only a small amount (< 8 %) of the PM 2. 5 mass. Corresponding to the mass concentrations of geological materials (29. 2 %, 44. 5 %, and 37. 3 % on sunny, cloudy, and hazy days), the number concentrations of mineral dust and fly ash particles on the sunny, cloudy, and hazy days were 14. 6 %, 7. 1 %, and 7. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|International audienceSyngas from {{thermochemical}} conversion of waste or {{biomass is a}} renewable energy carrier that may contain pollutants – such as tar – that should be removed before further syngas utilisation. Chars {{have proved to be}} promising catalysts for tar cracking, but the influence of the physico-chemical properties on their reactivity is still unclear. This work aimed to better understand the structure and the composition of the mineral species of pyrolysis char, as well as their catalytic role in tar cracking. For this purpose, a characterisation of the minerals has been performed at bulk, surface (studied at micro and nano-scale) and crystallite scale. Pyrolysis chars were produced from wastes generated on cruise ships – namely used wood pallets (UWP), food waste (FW) and coagulation flocculation sludge (CFS) – having different mineral amount and content. Ethylbenzene was used as surrogate of light aromatic hydrocarbons in a tar cracking process. The results showed that ethylbenzene was converted into lighter gases meaning that the chars were efficient for this. Ethylbenzene conversion at 650 °C was found to be significantly higher with the char from a mixture of sludge and food waste (c. FW/CFS) compared to that of wood-based char (c. UWP) : 71 wt. % against 45 wt. %, respectively. The combination of multi-scale and complementary techniques has highlighted that the higher catalytic activity of this char was mainly attributed to the mineral content. Well dispersed mineral particles with various morphologies and natures were observed on the surface of c. FW/CFS using Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM and TEM). Especially, Ca, Al and P were the main mineral species identified using XRFS and SEM. These mineral species in form of oxides and hydroxyapatite were considered to be the main active <b>mineral</b> components for <b>tar</b> cracking. Oxides were identified using EDX-analysis. XRD analysis highlighted the presence of crystalised particles of hydroxyapatite (Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 (OH)), while Raman spectroscopy revealed that these particles were embedded in the carbon matrix...|$|R
40|$|Elucidating the {{relationship}} between characteristics of aerosol particles and optical absorption is important to deepen the understanding of atmospheric chemistry. Aerosol particles play significant roles in climate forcing via their optical absorption properties. However, {{the relationship}} between characteristics of aerosol particles and optical absorption remains poorly understood. Aerosol optical properties and morphologies were measured by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS), a nephelometer and an Aethalometer in a urban site of Beijing from 24  May to 22  June. Five episodes were categorized according to the meteorological conditions and composition. The {{results showed that the}} clear episode (EP- 2 and EP- 4) featured as the low aerosol optical depth (AOD [*]=[*]  0. 72) and fewer pollutants compared with haze (1. 14) and fog (2. 92) episodes and the particles are mostly externally mixed. The high Ångström exponent (>  2. 0) suggests that coarse particles were scarcely observed in EP- 2 due to the washout of a previous heavy rain, whereas they were widespread in EP- 4 (Ångström exponent [*]=[*]  0. 04), which had some mineral particles introduced from the north. In contrast, industry-induced haze (EP- 1) and biomass-burning-induced haze (EP- 5) were both affected by the south air mass. Compared with the EP- 2 and EP- 4, the AOD values and the size distribution of particles during EP- 1 and EP- 5 were much greater because of relatively high particle concentrations. All of the particles were classified into nine categories, i. e. S-rich, N-rich, <b>mineral,</b> K-rich, soot, <b>tar</b> ball, organic, metal and fly ash, on the basis of TEM analysis. In contrast to the EP- 1, a large fraction of soot, which sticks to KCl, sulfate or nitrate particles, was detected during EP- 5. Additionally, evident enhancement of light absorption was observed during the EP- 5, which was mainly ascribed to both black carbon (BC) acceleration and other absorbing substances. However, soot was found mostly internally mixed with sulfate and nitrate during a soot fog episode (EP- 3), resulting in evident enhancement of light absorption. The larger size distribution was likely to be caused by both hygroscopic growth and collision between particles during the aging. About 28  % of particles were internally mixed during the foggy days, which favoured the light absorption. The comparison of all the episodes provides a deeper insight into how mixing states influence the aerosol extinction properties and also a clue as to how to control air pollution in the crop burning seasons...|$|R
40|$|This {{item was}} {{digitized}} by the Internet Archive. Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityEvidence {{is presented to}} show that carcinogenesis is affected by heredity. However, of equal importance are internal factors such as hormonal, environmental and virus influences. The works of Strong (1935), Russell and Green (1943) and Andrevont (1948), among others, are used to show the inter-relationship of these factors. The entire theory was set down in formula form by Loeb in 1916, HS=C, where H stands for the heritable gene, S for the external environment, and C the resultant cancer. There are various theories as to how cancer occurs. Many of the statements {{can be reduced to}} the theory of somatic mutation, which causes the rapid and uncontrolled proliferation of the cells. However, the means whereby the cells become mutants has been attributed to various methods. Bittner's virus factor, Murphy's virus acting upon the chromatin and Needham's theory of the evocator action of the virus extract compared with the neural plate induction in embryology are all briefly discussed. The methods for obtaining accurate information on cancer inheritance are discussed at some length. The importance of inbreeding and of using the resultant pure bred strains is stressed by citing the classical argument between Slye and Little (1928), whose work on the same animals gave diametrically opposite results. In ordinary cases of inbreeding, it is usually possible to develop an animal strain that is either pure recessive or pure dominant. However, by using data compiled by Dr. Little and his associates (1943), it has been demonstrated that by examining highly inbred cancerous mice of known parentage, no pure dominants or recessives are found. To the contrary, none of the strains develops a one hundred per cent susceptibility to all types of tumors, nor are any one hundred per cent resistant. All the intermediate percentages are found. This seems to indicate that the method of transmission is one of multiple factors. Added proof of this method of transmission is suggested by the works of Andrevont and Heston whose work on the pulmonary tumors of mice seems to corroborate the multiple factor method. The difficulty involved in studying the heredity of cancer in human beings is explained by the small families involved, the reluctance of families to offer accurate information, the long period between generations and uncertainty of diagnoses. Man and the experimental animals used are both multicellular organisms. They probably both obey the Mendelian laws of inheritance. Therefore, the data obtained from animal experimentation can be reasonably applied to human beings. Wells (1930) described a mouse with a broken tooth which irritated the mucous membrane of the mouth. The resultant cancer spread to surrounding areas and caused ultimate pressure on the brain. Identical symptoms of cancer have been noted in human patients. Although it is likely that human beings obey Mendelian inheritance laws, no definite evidence has been presented that human carcinoma obeys these laws. This {{is not to suggest that}} the lair has been broken, but merely to show that the mode of transmission is probably one of multiple factors complicated by external factors such as the aforementioned hormonal and environmental influences. The relation of Mendelian laws of heredity to the incidence of cancer may be produced by a somatic mutation. The rate of occurence of this mutation is in turn influenced by genetic factors. Certain measures have been recommended for the future control of this disease which strikes one person in eight in the United States. Persons whose family tree shows a large percentage of cancer should avoid chronic irritations of any form. They should refrain from working in industry where they may be exposed to any of the carcinogens such as <b>mineral</b> oil, <b>tar</b> or coal tar products, paraffin or the other carcinogenic agents. Finally, as a general preventive measure, a person who has a family history of multiple carcinoma should not marry a person who has a similar history. Eugenic control of high cancer ratio families is in the long run a possible way of eradicating this disease. [URL]...|$|R
