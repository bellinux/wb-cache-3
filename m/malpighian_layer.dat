40|$|This report {{describes}} the preparation and detection of antibodies to chemically unmodified prekeratin and stratum corneum proteins of cow and human epidermis. The antibodies are specific for epidermal fibrous proteins {{and do not}} cross-react with those of hair and nail which have the same molecular configuration but distinctive physical and chemical properties. The antibodies did cross-react with epidermal fibrous proteins {{from a number of}} other vertebrate sources indicating an immunologic relationship among epidermal proteins whose polypeptide compositions and amino acid contents are somewhat dissimilar. Both antibodies give intense immunofluorescence localized to the <b>malpighian</b> <b>layers</b> but not to the stratum corneum. The antigenic sites in the native configuration of the stratum corneum layer may be buried, since denatured stratum corneum proteins react readily with the antibody. These antibodies have permitted the first detection of a form of keratin whose solubility properties are quite different from either prekeratin or stratum corneum proteins...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{revealed}} that the filaments of cytokeratin express different antigenic sites in the basal and suprabasal cell compartment of the skin and oral mucosa. It has been demonstrated that the keratin polypeptide subunit of molecular weight 67, 000 dalton (67 K) is a valuable marker of the suprabasal cells, since the normal basal cells remain unlabeled by antibodies against this large polypeptide. In the present study, {{the distribution of the}} 67 K polypeptide has been investigated on human and guinea pig keratinocyte suspensions, purified basal cells of guinea pigs, normal human abdominal skin and normal human buccal mucosa, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. The results of this investigation confirmed ultrastructurally that the 67 K-antigen expression is lacking in the epidermal basal cell compartment. However, it could be shown that 67 K polypeptide is a component of the tonofilaments in the upper <b>Malpighian</b> cell <b>layers</b> of the skin and oral mucosa.

In ichthyosiform ery-throderma, a marked increase in the numbers of mitochondria and clustered ribosomes accompanied by the formation of extraordinarily large keratohyalin granules was observed. These results strongly suggested that the epidermal cells in ichthyosis have a lower metabolic activity and that the epidermal cells in ichthyosiform erythroderma have a higher metabolic activity and an increased rate of cell turnover. In ichthyosiform erythroderma, there were found numerous aggregates of disopganized tonofibrils within the cytoplasm of the cells in the <b>malpighian</b> and granular <b>layers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet light (UV) {{irradiation}} of mammalian cells {{results in}} changes in DNA synthesis. In this study {{the effect of}} monochromatic UV at 250, 280 and 300 nm radiation (3 MED's) on DNA synthesis in rabbit epidermis was compared by autoradiography using in vitro and in vivo methods of administering tritiated thymidine. Skin biopsies were taken from unirradiated control sites at 3, 12, 24, and 48 hours after irradiation. The in vivo and in vitro methods of labeling epidermal nuclei (undergoing DNA synthesis) showed similar results in control and irradiated sites. Heavy labeling of nuclei seen in the basal or epibasal layer representing the DNA synthesis phase of cell cycle appeared to be decreased at 3 hours but significantly increased at 24 and 48 hours. Irradiation with 300 nm consistently produced maximal labeling at 48 hours with more than threefold increase above the controls. Maximal labeling at 250 and 280 nm sites occurred either at 24 or 48 hours but more frequently at 24 hours and {{may be related to}} the fact that sunburn erythema observed at 24 hours is less noticable at these wavelengths compared to the 300 nm range. The mean of the sum of all three wavelengths indicated maximum labeling at 48 hours in both in vivo and in vitro methods. Uniform sparse labeling of nuclei in the <b>malpighian</b> and basal <b>layer,</b> probably representing unscheduled or repair DNA synthesis, was seen at the 3 hour post irradiation sites...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the effect on the}} normal synthesis and metabolism of filaggrin of treatment of guinea pig skin with a chemical irritant, hexadecane, or with erythemal doses of UV radiation. Examination of the skin by immunofluorescence with an antiserum against filaggrin demonstrates 3 phases of the response. The first phase is an apparent stabilization of the filaggrin present at the time of treatment. Thus, a zone of stratum corneum is produced which moves up toward the skin surface over the days following treatment, without the loss of immunoreactivity which normally results from the metabolism of filaggrin to free amino acids. The second phase of tile reaction, which occurs during the first day after treatment, is a loss of immunoreactive material from the upper viable epidermis, which results over the next day in the formation of a zone of filaggrin- deficient stratum corneum. The third phase, 2 – 3 days after the treatment, is the reestablishment of immunoreactivity in the newly re-formed granular layer, followed by the formation of an immunoreactive zone {{at the bottom of the}} stratum corneum. This zone remains very thin despite the rapid passage of cells through it. This shows that the filaggrin being formed during this phase of the reaction is being broken down normally as the stratum corneum matures. Investigations of the kinetics of filaggrin synthesis and breakdown using a [3 H]histidine pulse/chase method, confirm the impression gained from immunofluorescence studies that the time between formation and breakdown of the filaggrin is much reduced in the hyperplastic epidermis resulting from the irritation. Thus, although the hyperplasia is reflected in a thickening of <b>malpighian</b> and granular <b>layers</b> of the epidermis, it does not result in any thickening of the filaggrin-positive zone at the bottom of the stratum corneum...|$|R

50|$|If the {{exposure}} to beta radiation is intense, the beta burns may first manifest in 24-48 hours by itching and/or burning sensation that last {{for one or two}} days, sometimes accompanied by hyperaemia. After 1-3 weeks burn symptoms appear; erythema, increased skin pigmentation (dark colored patches and raised areas), followed by epilation and skin lesions. Erythema occurs after 5-15 Gy, dry desquamation after 17 Gy, and bullous epidermitis after 72 Gy. Chronic radiation keratosis may develop after higher doses. Primary erythema lasting more than 72 hours is an indication of injury severe enough to cause chronic radiation dermatitis. Edema of dermal papillae, if present within 48 hours since the exposition, is followed by transepidermal necrosis. After higher doses, the <b>malpighian</b> <b>layer</b> cells die within 24 hours; lower doses may take 10-14 days to show dead cells.

There was a considerable overlapping of ail 3 states of the disease—mild, moderate and severe—in the range of the intermediate titers. On the individual level, 20 of the 24 patients showed a positive correlation between steroid-induced clinical improvement and a fall in the antibody titer.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the rate of}} maturation of MCV in vivo, we injected tritiated thymidine intradermally into 23 lesions of molluscum contagiosum and obtained biopsies at intervals from 1 hour to 8 days later. The tissues were processed for electron microscopic autoradiography, and the patterns of viral maturation were determined by the localization of silver grains over developing virions at different time intervals. The findings demonstrate that maturation of molluscum contagiosum (MCV) in vivo is asynchronous. Some virions mature rapidly, within 1 to 2. 5 hours, but the majority mature more slowly; 94 percent are mature in 5 days. A comparative study revealed that maturation of virions in infected cells occurred more rapidly in the granular layer than in the <b>malpighian</b> <b>layer.</b> Uncoated virions in newly infected cells were seen in viable epidermal cells in all layers, including dividing basal cells. “Second-stage uncoating” together with “viral factory” formation were observed only in malpighian cells at the time intervals examined...|$|E

40|$|Human skin biopsies {{were taken}} from {{patients}} with candidosis of the groin, axillary and submammary areas. The majority of the fungal cells were situated inside epithelial cells. The fungi invaded the entire stratum corneum. They were often found in parakeratotic epithelial cells. They could not be detected in noncornified cells of the <b>malpighian</b> <b>layer.</b> Mycelial forms predominated by far. They apparently invade the epidermis actively. Blastospores were found less often and they mostly were situated between or in superficial cells of the horny layer. Pseudomycelia and germ tubes were rarely observed. Remarkable was the frequent finding of lomaomas in Candida albicans cells in vivo, whereas these structures were rarely demonstrable in vitro. They probably represent structures that occur in damaged fungal cells {{as a result of}} defense mechanisms of the host. The fungal elements inside the epithelial cells were often surrounded by electron-transparent areas. These areas possibly resulted from keratolytic activities of the fungus. Characteristic manifestations of candidosis of the human skin were parakeratosis, spongiosis, and intracorneal and subcorneal micro-abscesses. However, fungal elements failed to occur in the center of these abscesses, possibly because the process of phagocytosis, killing, and lysis of the fungi had been completed...|$|E
40|$|Paget's {{disease is}} usually {{associated}} with an underlying adenocarcinoma of the breast. The initial manifestation is an eczematous or psoriasiform lesion of the nipple, soon extending to the mammary areola {{and then to the}} surrounding skin. The histology of the lesions is characterized by the presence, within the epidermal layer, of the so-called Paget's cells, i. e. large cells with vesicular nucleus and clear cytoplasm. The authors report a recent case of Paget's disease of the breast in a 75 -year-old woman, unusual both for clinical course and observed histology. As for the clinico-evolutive aspects, although in the case observed the initial skin lesions appeared 20 years before, the different diagnostic procedures repeatedly performed showed no evidence in this patient of an underlying adenocarcinoma. The histologic aspect, on the other hand, was peculiar since the typical characteristics of an acantholytic disease were evident. The presence of intraepidermal cleavages with lost, at times, of the normal contacts among the cells of the <b>Malpighian</b> <b>layer</b> has been described only once in Paget's disease. This fact caused some diagnostic difficulties: however, the typical finding of the Paget cells, their positivity to histochemical methods such as cytokeratin and acid phosphatase allowed the diagnosis.

40|$|Two {{cases of}} lichen amyloidosus and 8 cases of macular {{amyloidosis}} were examined by electron microscopy. Epidermal keratinocytes showed variable degrees of focal degeneration in the basal or lower <b>Malpighian</b> <b>layer.</b> The primary change {{was seen in}} cells which contain fibrillar (30 nm in thickness) cytoplasmic inclusion. The following developments seemed to lead to filamentous degeneration (colloid bodies) : (1) aggregation of tonofilaments within the granular or fibrillar cytoplasm, (2) filamentous cells, which are composed of bundles of 7 -nm thick filaments surrounded by cell membrane and desmosomes, and (3) filamentous masses composed of bundles or whorls of tightly packed 7 -nm thick filaments in the intercellular spaces. At the dermo-epidermal junction, some of the filamentous masses were surrounded by the basal lamina of the epidermis and others were dropping into the dermis. Occasionally, loosened filaments (similar to amyloid filaments) were about to drop into the dermis. Early formation of amyloid islands consisted of electron-dense and electron-light parts. They were located directly beneath the epidermis. In the deeper portion of the papillary dermis and in the upper reticular dermis, the majority were electron-light masses. Electron dense parts were the densely packed 7 -nm thick filaments, whereas electron-light parts were the typical straight amyloid filaments. Small tubular filaments were seen in common in the filamentous cells, filamentous masses, and amyloid islands.

40|$|Normal {{human skin}} is remarkably {{resistant}} to infection {{from the large}} numbers of microorganisms that routinely colonize its surface. In addition to the role of skin as a mechanical barrier, it has long been recognized that skin and other epithelia can produce a range of anti-microbial chemicals that play an important part in eliminating potential cutaneous pathogens. Anti-microbial peptides are an important evolutionarily conserved innate host defense mechanism in many organisms. Human β defensin- 1 and - 2 are cysteine-rich, cationic, low molecular weight anti-microbial peptides that have recently been shown to be expressed in epithelial tissues. In this study, we describe the characterization of human β defensin- 1 and - 2 mRNA and peptide expression in normal human skin. Using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction we demonstrate that human β defensin- 1 is consistently expressed in skin samples from various body sites. Human β defensin- 2 demonstrates expression that is more variable and is more readily detectable in facial skin and foreskin compared with skin from abdomen and breast. In situ hybridization localizes the human β defensin- 1 and - 2 transcripts to keratinocytes within interfollicular skin. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that human β defensin- 1 and - 2 peptides are localized to the <b>Malpighian</b> <b>layer</b> of the epidermis and/or stratum corneum and that there are interindividual and site-specific differences in intensity of immunostaining and the pattern of peptide localization. The localization of human β defensins to the outer layer of the skin is consistent with the hypothesis that human β defensins play an essential part in cutaneous innate immunity...|$|E
