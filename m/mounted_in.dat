5|$|Butterflies {{are widely}} used in objects of art and jewellery: <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> frames, {{embedded}} in resin, displayed in bottles, laminated in paper, and used in some mixed media artworks and furnishings.

5|$|Defence against torpedo boats was {{provided}} by eight QF 6-pounder guns, although the exact type of gun is not known. Four of these were mounted on the main deck in casemates {{on the sides of}} the hull and suffered from the same problems as the six-inch guns. Hood also mounted a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> the superstructure and fighting tops. Like her sisters, the ship was fitted with seven 18-inch Torpedo tubes. Two of these were <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> the bow below the waterline, four were placed in the sides of the hull, two on each broadside, and one in the stern. These last five tubes were all above water. She also was fitted with a plough-shaped underwater ram.|$|E
5|$|In its design, the XR-1 bore {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, a helicopter developed by Henrich Focke in Germany that, flown by Hanna Reitsch, had impressed Platt-LePage co-founder Wynn LePage during a tour of Europe. The XR-1 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial engine, <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> a buried installation within the fuselage. The aircraft had two, three-bladed rotors, <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> a side-by-side arrangement on wing-like pylons. The pylons were aerodynamically designed to produce some lift when in forwards flight, slightly unloading the rotors. The construction of the XR-1 was conventional {{by the standards of}} the time, with the aircraft's frame consisting of a steel-tube framework, which was covered with fabric. The XR-1 had tail surfaces similar to those of a conventional aircraft, and was equipped with a fixed, taildragger landing gear. The aircraft's wheels freely castered for easier maneuvering on the ground.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the project}} was to {{localize}} the co-expression areas of neuropilin- 2 and that of primary neurons and to confirm the full protocol of whole <b>mount</b> <b>in</b> situ hybridization and whole mount immunostaining. Two-colour labeling was attempted with whole <b>mount</b> <b>in</b> situ hybridization (with RNA probe synthesized from zebrafish neuropilin- 2 cDNA) followed by whole mount immunostaining using anti-mouse monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin on zebrafish embryos (12 hpf, 16 hpf and 22 hpf). Successful trial on whole mount immunostaining using anti-mouse monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin on 22 hpf zebrafish embryos solely without whole <b>mount</b> <b>in</b> situ hybridization preceding it, allowed room for preliminary comparison to be done whole <b>mount</b> <b>in</b> situ hybridization (with RNA probe synthesized from zebrafish neuropilin- 2 cDNA) on the 22 hpf embryos...|$|R
5|$|The {{almond-shaped}} spores {{are typically}} 10–12.5 by 6–7μm with thick walls measuring between 0.5–1.2μm. They {{have a small}} central apiculus (a depressed area when the spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma). When <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> distilled water, they have a coarsely warty surface and appear rusty brown in colour. When <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> a 3% KOH solution, the spores are pale lilac grey, and the surface ornamentation forms swollen pustules that loosen and dissolve. Spores are dextrinoid (meaning they turn reddish-brown when stained with Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilic (red in acetocarmine). The basidia are club-shaped, and four-spored with sterigmata up to 9.5μm long. The ridges of the locules comprise erect cystidia mixed with chains of erect cylindrical hyphae measuring 4–6μm in diameter. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical, and have dimensions of 20–60 by 4–9μm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The guns <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> {{the open}} battery were lighter {{than those in}} the casemates and were not {{enclosed}} but traversed on rails in the open air. A covered section between each emplacement led to an ammunition lift shaft up which the shells and cartridges were raised using lifting gear that still survives.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four 12-inch/40 caliber Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of eight 8-inch/45 caliber guns and twelve /50 caliber Mark 6 guns. The 8-inch guns were <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> four twin turrets; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets, {{with the other two}} turrets abreast the forward funnel. The 6-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve /50 caliber guns, <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> casemates {{along the side of the}} hull, and twelve 3-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Nebraska carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.|$|E

5|$|A mid-wing, all-metal, {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with two}} Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> streamlined nacelles under the wing, the XTSF-1 {{was intended to}} carry two crew members in tandem seats, and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR-720 radar set, the radar later being replaced in the design by an AN/APS-3 or AN/APS-4 set.

Rome fought back, {{mounting}} a campaign under CountTheodosius in 369 which reëstablished a province which was renamed Valentia {{in honor of}} the emperor. Its location is unclear, but it is sometimes placed on or beyond Hadrian's Wall. Another campaign was <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> 384, but both were short-lived successes.

5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought {{prosperity}} to the Brazilian economy. The government of Brazil used some of the extra money from this economic growth to finance a large naval building program in 1904, which authorized the construction of a large number of warships, including three battleships. The Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906. While the first designs for these ships were derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship Norge and the British (originally Chilean) , the contracted ships were to follow Armstrong Whitworth's Design 439 (Design 188 in Vickers' files). They would displace 11,800longtons (12,000tonnes), have a speed of 19knots (22mph; 35km/h), and be protected by belt armor of 9inches (23cm) and deck armor of 1.5 in (3.8cm). Each ship would be armed with twelve 10-inch (25cm) guns <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> six twin turrets. These turrets would be <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> a hexagonal configuration, similar to the later German s.|$|E
