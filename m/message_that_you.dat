He intensively studied the technique of Usain Bolt to improve his own times, seeing Bolt as the new generation's Maurice Greene. Though he was still banned from Euromeetings-organised events, he set a new personal best of 6.52s in the 60m at the Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix, then became the UK Indoor Champion, equalling Mike Rodgers' world leading time of 6.51s. At the 2009 European Indoor Championships he broke Ronald Pognon's European 60m record with a 6.42s run in the semi-finals, then {{won the gold medal}} with a time of 6.46s in the final. British head coach van Commenee stated that Chambers had undergone vigorous testing and that his performance sent [...] "a <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can win and break European records in the proper way." ...|$|E

6000|$|The count smiled. [...] "Well, we {{will see}} what we can do in your case; anyhow, you must keep on that dress--for a day or two. And now, Guy, about yourself. I have {{arranged}} for you to lodge with a man who gets news for me; it is in the butchers' quarter, which is the last place where anyone would think of looking for you. Besides, there you will see all that is going on. I have two other disguises in addition to that I sent you; one is that of a young butcher, another is that of one of the lads who live in misery, who sleep at the market where they can earn a few sous by doing odd jobs, and beg or steal when they can do nothing else. I hear that you have also arranged for a shelter in the quarter between the walls; that too may be very useful, and it will be well for you to go thither to- morrow and arrange so that you can have a place to go to when you choose; it will doubtless be much more pleasant for you there than in the market quarter. Lastly, I have got you a white hood, which may be most useful of all." [...] Guy looked surprised. [...] "Henceforth," [...] the count went on, [...] "white is to be the butchers' colour. All who march this evening are to be so clad, and as soon as it is known to-morrow, you will find three-fourths of the people wearing it, for not to do so will be taken as a sign of hostility to their faction. They will have started by this time, and if it pleases you to put on the butcher's dress and the white hood over it you can mingle in safety with them and see all that is done; then when they return to their quarter, you can go with them. The house to which you are to go is the third on the left-hand side of the Rue des Couteaux. My man lodges at the top of the house, the room to the left when you mount the stair-- his name is Simon Bouclier. The lane is at the back of the butchers' market. The man has no idea who you are. I have simply told him that I will send a young man to help gather news for me of what is going on, that you would work separately, but that he was to do all in his power to aid you, and that at any time if he wanted to send a message to me and could not himself come, he was to intrust it to you, and similarly he was to bring any <b>message</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might want to send to the spot where he meets my messenger. The man works for one of the Thiberts. He does not know who I am, but I think he believes me to be an agent of Burgundy's, and that I collect the information so that he may be privately informed of what is doing. I have encouraged that idea, because it is more likely to keep him truthful to me, since he would think that were he to play me false the duke would see that some harm or other befell him. Therefore, it is as well that you should drop a word as if by accident that will confirm that notion, and will lead him to believe that you too are working under the orders of the duke. This will lull any suspicion that he might feel on seeing, as he must do, that you live in a position far higher than would appear from your garb. And now, if you would see to-night's doings, you had best put on that disguise and the white hood, and be off without delay; you will find the things in the room above." ...|$|E
