In particular this paper studies the <b>transportation</b> <b>system</b> of Singapore to address how this system is progressing in this three-pronged approach towards a modern <b>transportation</b> <b>system.</b> While sustainability targets environmental justice and social equity without compromising economical efficiency, smartness incorporates qualities like automated sensing, processing and decision making, and action-taking into the <b>transportation</b> <b>system.</b> Since a system cannot be viable without being safe, the safety of the modern <b>transportation</b> <b>system</b> aims minimizing crash risks of all users including motorists, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists.

The other purpose is to identify the types of functions and the types of FTR information that are supported by such systems and the values and benefits that are created for actors of the transportation networks by using such systems. A literature study was conducted to identify the smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> and its elements. Documents of more than 65 companies working on the area of smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> are studied as a source of empirical data to provide a complete list of the smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> and services. Semi-structured interviews with representatives of the companies are conducted to understand the types of the FTR information that are supported by smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> and functions that are carried out by using such information.

This responsibility includes managing the transportation of SNF and HLW from origin sites to the Repository for disposal. The <b>Transportation</b> <b>System</b> Concept of Operations is the core high-level OCRWM document written to describe the <b>Transportation</b> <b>System</b> integrated design and present the vision, mission, and goals for <b>Transportation</b> <b>System</b> operations. By defining the functions, processes, and critical interfaces of this system early in the system development phase, programmatic risks are minimized, system costs are contained, and system operations are better managed, safer, and more secure. This document also facilitates discussions and understanding among parties responsible for the design, development, and operation of the <b>Transportation</b> <b>System.</b> Such understanding is important for the timely development of system requirements and identification of system interfaces. Information provided in the <b>Transportation</b> <b>System</b> Concept of Operations includes: the functions and key components of the <b>Transportation</b> System; <b>system</b> component interactions; flows of information within the system; the general operating sequences; and the internal and external factors affecting transportation operations. The <b>Transportation</b> <b>System</b> Concept of Operations reflects OCRWM's overall waste management system policies and mission objectives, and as such provides a description of the preferred state of system operation.
