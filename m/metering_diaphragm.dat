2500|$|Once {{airborne}} {{and having}} reached the cruising altitude, the pilot moves the mixture control from auto rich to auto lean.

50|$|For example, in {{the case}} of an orifice flow meter, the {{differential}} pressure across the orifice plate is the primary flow element. A turbine meter is equipped with a magnetic pickup that senses the proximity of the turbine blades as the fluid motion causes the turbine to spin; this pickup is the primary flow element for a turbine <b>meter.</b> <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>meters</b> and other positive displacement meters are equipped with a crank shaft, the rotation of which acts as the primary flow element.|$|R
50|$|Positive {{displacement}} flowmeters {{are very}} accurate and have high turndown. They {{can be used}} in very viscous, dirty and corrosive fluids and essentially require no straight runs of pipe for fluid flow stream conditioning though pressure drop can be an issue. They are widely used in the custody transfer of oils and liquid fluids (gasoline) and are applied on residential home natural gas and water <b>metering.</b> A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>meter,</b> with which most homes are equipped, {{is an example of a}} positive displacement meter. This type of meter is appealing in certain custody transfer flow applications where it is critical that the metering be functional in order for any flow to take place.|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{positive}} displacement meters have a turndown ratio of between 10:1 and 80:1, {{depending on the}} manufacturer and the application. <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>meters</b> are considered to have a turndown ratio of 80:1.|$|R

50|$|Turbine, rotary, and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>meters</b> can be {{compensated}} using a calculation specified in American Gas Association Report No. 7. This standardised calculation compensates {{the quantity of}} volume as measured to quantity of volume at a set of base conditions. The AGA 7 calculation itself is a simple ratio and is, in essence, a density correction approach to translating the volume or rate of gas at flowing conditions to a volume or rate at base conditions.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid leakage at the packing or seal {{particularly}} when a liquid is dangerous, toxic, or noxious, diaphragm pumps are used for <b>metering.</b> <b>Diaphragm</b> pumps have a diaphragm through which repeated compression/decompression motion is transmitted. The liquid does not penetrate through the diaphragm, so the liquid inside the pump is sealed off from the outside. Such motion changes the volume of a chamber in the pump head so that liquid enters through an inlet check valve during decompression and exits through an outlet check valve during compression, {{in a manner similar}} to piston pumps. Diaphragm pumps can also be made which discharge at fairly high pressure. Diaphragm metering pumps are commonly hydraulically driven.|$|E

5000|$|Rotary meters {{are highly}} {{machined}} precision instruments {{capable of handling}} higher volumes and pressures than <b>diaphragm</b> <b>meters.</b> Within the meter, two figure [...] "8" [...] shaped lobes, the rotors (also known as impellers or pistons), spin in precise alignment. With each turn, they move a specific quantity of gas through the meter. The operating principle {{is similar to that}} of a Roots blower. The rotational movement of the crank shaft serves as a primary flow element and may produce electrical pulses for a flow computer or may drive an odometer-like counter.|$|R
50|$|These are {{the most}} common type of gas meter, seen in almost all {{residential}} and small commercial installations. Within the meter there are two or more chambers formed by movable diaphragms. With the gas flow directed by internal valves, the chambers alternately fill and expel gas, producing a nearly continuous flow through the <b>meter.</b> As the <b>diaphragms</b> expand and contract, levers connected to cranks convert the linear motion of the diaphragms into rotary motion of a crank shaft which serves as the primary flow element. This shaft can drive an odometer-like counter mechanism or it can produce electrical pulses for a flow computer.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{membrane}} has {{to separate the}} process fluid from the oil circuit in <b>metering</b> <b>diaphragm</b> pumps, it is the critical component of these machines. Sometimes, depending on the operating conditions, {{the membrane}} may crack and {{it is necessary to}} disassemble the pump and replace this component part. Therefore it is important to improve the design of the membrane to avoid this. In this paper, the behaviour of a membrane mounted in a <b>metering</b> <b>diaphragm</b> pump has been simulated by using f. e. m.

5000|$|A {{relatively}} small diameter booster unit is required; {{for a very}} conservative 50% manifold vacuum, an assisting force of about 1500 N (150 kgf) is produced by a 20 cm radius diaphragm with an area of 0.03 square <b>meters.</b> The <b>diaphragm</b> will stop moving when the forces {{on both sides of}} the chamber reach equilibrium.

Run out occurs when the pressure in one chamber reaches atmospheric pressure and no additional force can be generated by the now stagnant differential pressure. After the run out point is reached, only the driver's foot force can be used to further apply the master cylinder piston. In some new models, in addition to providing functionality for ABS, Traction Control, and dynamic stability control, brake hydraulics are being used to augment braking when little or no vacuum is detected in the booster, or booster run-out is reached, or pre-applying the brakes if certain panic braking or wet driving conditions are detected.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, smart static gas {{measurement}} technologies {{are available on}} the market and are used for metering natural gas consumption of final consumers. Both ultrasonic and thermal-mass flow metering technologies are considered today as “new electronic gas meters”. Such new digital meters require an adequate knowledge of the measurement principle in order to carry out correct calibration procedures. In other words, we are in the digital age of the {{gas measurement}}: digital meters require digital calibrations. The calibration procedures in use to calibrate a traditional (mechanical) “analogue” gas meter (such as a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>meter</b> or a rotary piston meter) are not fully adequate for the calibration of an electronic, digital meter...|$|R
40|$|Different {{solutions}} to the metering of natural gas consumption can be adopted according to whether the distribution is domestic or industrial.

40|$|This work {{describes}} an in situ method for {{the testing of}} mechanical flow meters. The method was developed on <b>diaphragm</b> gas <b>meters,</b> but {{can be applied to}} most mechanically-based flow meters. The proposed fingerprint method analyses the behaviour of the meter during a work cycle. The result from the analysis is a ''fingerprint'' of the meter, in which mechanical errors in the meter can be detected. This is explained by the mechanical connection between the sensing mechanism and the mechanical output from the meter. An error analysis of a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>meter</b> was carried out to deduce the type of errors that are likely to occur in such meters. The most severe malfunctions are leakage, internal friction and liquid in the meter. These errors can either lead to measuring errors or can cause the meter to cease functioning. The fingerprint method has been tested on meters with simulated errors and on used meters taken from the gas grid in Lund. The fingerprint method can correctly diagnose errors such as leakage, increased friction and liquid in the meter. Godkänd; 1998; 20061029 (ysko...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vacuum booster}} or vacuum servo {{is used in}} most modern {{hydraulic}} brake systems which contain four wheels. The vacuum booster is attached between the master cylinder and the brake pedal and multiplies the braking force applied by the driver. These units consist of a hollow housing with a movable rubber diaphragm across the center, creating two chambers. When attached to the low-pressure portion of the throttle body or intake manifold of the engine, the pressure in both chambers of the unit is lowered. The equilibrium created by the low pressure in both chambers keeps the diaphragm from moving until the brake pedal is depressed. A return spring keeps the diaphragm in the starting position until the brake pedal is applied. When the brake pedal is applied, the movement opens an air valve which lets in atmospheric pressure air to one chamber of the booster. Since the pressure becomes higher in one chamber, the diaphragm moves toward the lower pressure chamber with a force created by {{the area of the}} diaphragm and the differential pressure. This force, in addition to the driver's foot force, pushes on the master cylinder piston. A relatively small diameter booster unit is required; for a very conservative 50% manifold vacuum, an assisting force of about 1500 N (200n) is produced by a 20 cm diaphragm with an area of 0.03 square <b>meters.</b> The <b>diaphragm</b> will stop moving when the forces {{on both sides of the}} chamber reach equilibrium. This can be caused by either the air valve closing (due to the pedal apply stopping) or if [...] "run out" [...] is reached. Run out occurs when the pressure in one chamber reaches atmospheric pressure and no additional force can be generated by the now stagnant differential pressure.

40|$|Abstract. This {{project is}} focused on the {{performance}} curve of gas metering calibration system for low pressure low flow rate domestic gas meter. Visual Basic 6. 0 has been employed to carry out comparison of the calibration performance curve. Data gathered from previous work will be used to enable performance comparison. Wet type gas meter will be used as the reference meter in order to calibrate domestic gas meter due to its high accuracy and suitable operating condition at low pressure and low flow rate. <b>Diaphragm</b> gas <b>meter</b> has been selected as predominant domestic gas meter that normally represents common domestic gas meter application as a gas-measuring device. From the experiment, several operating condition will be carried out to obtain high accuracy measurement to calibrate the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>meter</b> with flow capacity up to 1. 20 m 3 /hr at an operating pressure of 35 milibar (14 inches water column), with setting temperature of 19 °C to 23 °C. The operation of calibration process incorporates the use of three types of test fluid namely; compressed air, nitrogen and liquefied petroleum gas. Results obtained show that pressure drop increases when flow rate increases and error of new meters increases with the increasing of flow rate until a maximum point reached at less than 2. 0 %. Therefore all the results obtained are valid and traceable...|$|R
