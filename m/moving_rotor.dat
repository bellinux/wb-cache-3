5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and <b>moving</b> <b>rotor</b> blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E

As such, {{wind turbines}} are primarily working devices. However, the large size and height above surroundings of modern industrial wind turbines, combined with their <b>moving</b> <b>rotors,</b> often makes them conspicuous. A few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines, either by putting visitor centers on their bases, or by providing viewing areas. The wind turbines themselves are generally of conventional horizontal-axis, three-bladed design, and generate power to feed electrical grids, but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration, public relations, and education.|$|R

A few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display, either with visitor centers on their bases, or with viewing areas farther away.

Selene, {{empowered}} by Alexander's ancient and pure blood, tore away the talon and drove it upwards through Marcus's skull before throwing {{him into the}} <b>moving</b> <b>rotor</b> blades and killing him. After Selene defeats Marcus and Michael defeats William, sunlight lands on Selene's arm, revealing that Alexander's blood has purged the vampiric weakness to sunlight.|$|E
50|$|Paraphrasing from Alger in Knowlton, an {{induction}} motor {{is simply an}} electrical transformer the magnetic circuit of which is separated by an air gap between the stator winding and the <b>moving</b> <b>rotor</b> winding. The equivalent circuit can accordingly be shown either with equivalent circuit components of respective windings separated by an ideal transformer or with rotor components referred to the stator side {{as shown in the}} following circuit and associated equation and parameter definition tables.|$|E
50|$|To achieve full rated torque, the coils in a {{stepper motor}} must reach their full rated current during each step. Winding {{inductance}} and counter-EMF {{generated by a}} <b>moving</b> <b>rotor</b> tend to resist changes in drive current, so that as the motor speeds up, less and less time is spent at full current — thus reducing motor torque. As speeds further increase, the current will not reach the rated value, and eventually the motor will cease to produce torque.|$|E

50|$|Before {{starting}} a centrifuge, an accurate {{check of the}} rotor and lid locking mechanisms is mandatory. Centrifuge rotors should never be touched while moving, because a spinning rotor can cause serious injury. Modern centrifuges generally have features that prevent accidental contact with a <b>moving</b> <b>rotor</b> as the main lid is locked during the run. For example, the new NuAire NuWind centrifuge has an automatic lid locking mechanism that tightly locks the centrifuge lid. The chamber can be accessible only when the rotor {{has come to a}} complete stop.|$|E
50|$|Many rotary {{electrical}} machines require current to be conveyed to (or extracted from) a <b>moving</b> <b>rotor,</b> usually {{by means of}} sliding contacts: a commutator or slip rings. These contacts are often the most complex and least reliable part of such a machine. It may also represent a limit on the maximum current that the machine can handle. For this reason, when machines must use two sets of windings, the windings carrying the least current are usually placed on the rotor and those with the highest current on the stator.|$|E
5000|$|Brushed {{machines}} are machines where the rotor coil is supplied with current through brushes {{in much the}} same way as current is supplied to the car in an electric slot car track. More durable brushes can be made of graphite or liquid metal. It is even possible to eliminate the brushes in a [...] "brushed machine" [...] by using a part of rotor and stator as a transformer which transfer current without creating torque. Brushes must not be confused with a commutator. The difference is that the brushes only transfer electric current to a <b>moving</b> <b>rotor</b> while a commutator also provide switching of the current direction.|$|E

40|$|Acceleration using {{centrifugal}} relays is {{a recently}} discovered method for {{the acceleration of}} spaceborne payloads to high velocity at high thrust. Centrifugal relays are <b>moving</b> <b>rotors</b> which progressively accelerate reaction mass to higher velocities. One important engineering problem consists of accurately tracking {{the position of the}} projectiles and rotors and guiding each projectile exactly onto the appropriate guide tracks on each rotor. The topics of this research are the system kinematics and dynamics and the computerized guidance system which will allow the projectile to approach each rotor with exact timing with respect to the rotor rotation period and with very small errors in lateral positions. Kinematics studies include analysis of rotor and projectile positions versus time and projectile/rotor interactions. Guidance studies include {{a detailed description of the}} tracking mechanism (interrupt of optical beams) and the aiming mechanism (electromagnetic focusing) including the design of electromagnetic deflection coils and the switching circuitry...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an R&D effort to apply neural-net processed electronic holography to NDE of rotors. Electronic holography was used to generate characteristic patterns or mode shapes of vibrating rotors and rotor components. Artificial neural networks were trained to identify damage-induced changes in the characteristic patterns. The development and optimization of a neural-net training method were the most significant contributions of this work, and the training method and its optimization are discussed in detail. A second positive result was the assembly and testing of a fiber-optic holocamera. A major disappointment was the inadequacy of the high-speed-holography hardware selected for this effort, but the use of scaled holograms to match the low effective resolution of an image intensifier was one interesting attempt to compensate. This report also discusses in some detail the physics and environmental requirements for rotor electronic holography. The major conclusions were that neural-net and electronic-holography inspections of stationary components in the laboratory and the field are quite practical and worthy of continuing development, but that electronic holography of <b>moving</b> <b>rotors</b> is still an expensive high-risk endeavor...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Wind {{power is a}} rapidly growing energy technology, popular for being a clean, {{reliable}} and cost-efficient renewable energy source. However, recently concern has been growing over the impact of wind turbines on flying wildlife, with both birds and bats found dead around turbine bases and observed collisions with <b>moving</b> turbine <b>rotors.</b> This phenomenon is widespread and has received enough attention to warrant investigation into how and why these collisions occur. In this paper we investigate the acoustic interaction of bats with wind turbines, in particular the interpretation of reflected sound pulses (echolocation) used by bats to navigate. This paper focuses {{on the effects of}} <b>moving</b> turbine <b>rotor</b> blades on reflected acoustic pulses, analogous to what might be presented to an echolocating bat approaching an operational turbine at rotor height. High frequency, simulated FM bat pulses were used to assess reflected echo properties from microturbines (experimentally and in simulation) in order to investigate what interaction rotor movements had with incoming pulses and the potential consequences for an echolocating bat near a moving wind turbine...|$|R
50|$|It {{was clear}} to US cryptographers well before World War II that the {{single-stepping}} mechanical motion of rotor machines (e.g. the Hebern machine) could be exploited by attackers. In {{the case of the}} famous Enigma machine, these attacks were supposed to be upset by <b>moving</b> the <b>rotors</b> to random locations at the start of each new message. This, however, proved not to be secure enough, and German Enigma messages were frequently broken by cryptanalysis during World War II.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} a time-stepping finite-element technique for modelling transient torques and currents in a slip-ring induction motor. The method {{is based on}} a coupled fields and circuit equation approach that allows the winding inductances to be modified to account for certain three-dimensional effects. The numerical solution incorporates a <b>moving</b> <b>rotor</b> so that slotting and saturation effects can be modelled accurately. The method is verified by direct comparison with experimental results obtained from a motor subjected to a supply reconnection at speed. It is shown that the general method can be extended in a straightforward manner to accommodate cage induction motors...|$|E

Computed results are compared with three-port wave rotor experimental data. The model is applied to predict {{the performance of a}} planned four-port wave rotor experiment. Two-dimensional flow features that reduce machine performance and influence rotor blade and duct wall thermal loads are identified. The performance impact of rounding the inlet port wall, to inhibit separation during passage gradual opening, is assessed...|$|E

The sensor is realised as a trailing edge flap which is elastically moveable relative {{the main part of the}} wind turbine blade. By measuring motion of the trailing edge flap or corresponding motions of components of the sensor system, the aerodynamic forces acting on the blade can be determined. Due to the relative small dimensions of the sensor flap and the relative small displacements of the flap, the sensor system only affects the aerodynamic properties insignificantly...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a numerical {{evaluation of the}} performance of the first stage of a new-generation turbine design. The numerical method solves the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations using a system of patched grids. Three-dimensional effects of stream-tube contraction are also modeled. The study focuses on the effects of axial gap variation on the unsteady rotor-stator interactions and on stage performance. Results are presented for three different axial gaps. The results indicate that the unsteady interactions can be very large in this design. These interactions affect not only the stage efficiency but also substantially alter the time-averaged features of the flow. In particular, for the case of the smallest axial gap, it was found that there was an unsteady shock on the stator suction surface which spanned the gap region and impinged upon the <b>moving</b> <b>rotor</b> airfoils...|$|E
40|$|The {{generator}} {{consists of}} the stator, two windings on it - stator and the windings of the traction electromagnet, a rotating shaft, a <b>rotor</b> <b>moving</b> magnetic conductor with permanent magnets, able to move on the shaft in the axial direction (within the small range - from 0, 5 mm to 4 - 5 mm), a return damping spring, the electronic regulator of current of the traction electromagnet. With the changing of rotor angular frequency the electronic regulator changes current of a traction electromagnet in accordance with a given law, <b>moving</b> a <b>rotor</b> magnetic conductor along the rotor shaft, changing {{the size of the}} main magnetic air gap of the electric machine. Thus the magnetic flux linkage and, therefore, the rotating torque (resistance torque) on a rotor shaft are changing depending on the angular speed of the rotor. With a small angular frequency of the rotor the main air gap in a magnetic circuit of the electric machine has the maximum value. With the increasing of the angular frequency of rotation the traction electromagnet reduces the main air gap in a magnetic circuit of the generator thus increasing the flux linkage...|$|R
