5|$|Ants {{also are}} quite popular {{inspiration}} for many science-fiction insectoids, {{such as the}} Formics of Ender's Game, the Bugs of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. These characters are often credited with a hive <b>mind,</b> <b>a</b> common misconception about ant colonies.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him {{a sense of the}} vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
5|$|Born about 1339, Elizabeth was the {{daughter}} of Ban StephenII of Bosnia, the head of the House of Kotromanić. Her mother, Elizabeth of Kuyavia, {{was a member of the}} House of Piast and grandniece of King Władysław I of Poland. The Hungarian queen dowager Elizabeth of Poland was first cousin once removed of Elizabeth's mother. After her daughter-in-law Margaret succumbed to the Black Death in 1349, Queen Elizabeth expressed interest in her young kinswoman, having in <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> future match for her widowed and childless son, King LouisI of Hungary. She insisted on immediately bringing the girl to her court in Visegrád for fostering. Despite her father's initial reluctance, Elizabeth was sent to the dowager's court.|$|E

From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a <b>mind.</b> <b>A</b> simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} final round of games, both teams were equal on points with Spain, with Scotland ahead thanks to a {{superior}} goal difference; however, Spain's final game at home to Iceland was scheduled to be played two weeks after Wales and Scotland had played each other. With this in <b>mind,</b> <b>a</b> draw for Scotland would be sufficient to virtually guarantee second place in Group 7 and advance at the very least through to the two legged play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament, while a win would likely see them top the group and qualify automatically. For Wales, anything less than a win would virtually end their hopes of qualification.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Beecham was {{approached}} by the rising young conductor Malcolm Sargent with a proposal {{to set up a}} permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent's patrons, the Courtauld family. Originally Sargent and Beecham had in <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> reorganised version of the LSO, but the orchestra baulked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch. The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), as it was named, consisted of 106 players including a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO's leading members.|$|E

5|$|Jennings was {{determined}} to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of <b>Mind,</b> <b>a</b> well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with {{the intricacies of the}} Arab–Israeli conflict, including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.|$|E

5|$|A report {{had been}} {{prepared}} for the parish council in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood – 2,700 by that time, with 530 houses – compared with the largely rural character {{of the rest of}} Ruislip parish. At a meeting of the Ruislip parish council on 28 October 1903, the forthcoming extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge was also discussed as it was known that a station would be opened in Ruislip on the new line. Councillors were also aware that King's College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish and lords of the manor, were planning to sell some for development. With this in <b>mind,</b> <b>a</b> vote was cast which went in favour of becoming an urban district. The new district was designed to better reflect to increase in development, as councillors felt a parish council would work slower than an urban district.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Cloud never qualified for SOLDIER, and instead enlisted as an infantryman in Shinra's army. During {{the mission to}} Nibelheim, Cloud served under Sephiroth and Zack, a SOLDIER 1st Class, hiding his identity from the townspeople out of embarrassment. Following Sephiroth's defeat of Zack at the Mt. Nibel Mako reactor, Cloud took up Zack's sword, catching Sephiroth off guard and stabbing him. Zack urges Cloud to kill Sephiroth after Sephiroth emerges alive, but when Cloud pursues him, he is run through by Sephiroth's sword. Cloud, to Sephiroth's shock, summons the strength to grab hold of the blade and lift Sephiroth off the ground, tossing him into a Mako vat below. Cloud and Zack are then imprisoned by Shinra's lead scientist, Hojo, for experimentation. Zack later escapes with Cloud, bringing him {{to the outskirts of}} Midgar before Shinra soldiers gun Zack down. Due to exposure to Mako radiation and the injection of Jenova's cells, in addition to the shame stemming from his personal failures, Cloud's mind fabricated a story blending together his own memories with accounts of Zack's heroics, creating a false personality. After piecing back together his identity, Cloud resumes his role as leader. At the game's conclusion, Sephiroth reappears in Cloud's <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> final time, but he is defeated in a one-on-one fight.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{took over}} the Philippine Islands from the Spanish in 1898 after the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley began Americanizing the former Spanish colony. In 1900 he {{appointed}} William Howard Taft to head the Philippine Commission to evaluate {{the needs of the}} new territory. Taft, who later became the Philippines' first civilian Governor-General, decided that Manila, the capital, should be a planned town. He hired as his architect and city planner Daniel Hudson Burnham, who had built Union Station and the Postal Square Building in Washington. In Manila, Burnham had in <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> long wide, tree-lined boulevard along the bay, beginning at a park area dominated by a magnificent hotel. To execute Burnham's plans, Taft hired William E. Parsons, a New York City architect, who envisioned an impressive, comfortable hotel along the lines of a California mission but grander. The original design was an H-shaped plan that focused on well-ventilated rooms on two wings, providing grand vistas of the harbor, the Luneta, and Intramuros. The top floor was, in fact, a large viewing deck that was used for various functions, including watching the American navy steam into the harbor.|$|E
