50|$|This biodisk is an {{integration}} of multiple technologies in different areas. The designer must {{be familiar with}} the process of biology testing before designing the detailed micro-structures in the compact disk. Some basic element components such as valves, <b>mixing</b> <b>units,</b> and separating units should all be used to complete the full testing process. The most basic principles applied in such micro-fluidic structures are centrifugal force, coriolis effect, and surface tension. The micromachining techniques, including patterning, photolithography, and etching should all be used as long as the design is verified. Once the testing process is successful in the biodisk, the complex detection technique is started. There are many methods proposed by scientists in this area. The most popular method is immunoassay which is widely use in the testing of biology. The final step is receiving data from the biodisk by means of a CD drive and modifying either software or hardware that can achieve this function. A popular method is reading data from the biodisk using a common CD drive with some developed software, which contains the advantage of being low on cost.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{order to}} design a compact urea {{selective}} catalytic reduction system, numerical simulation was conducted by computational fluid dynamics tool. A swirl type static mixer and a mixing chamber were considered as <b>mixing</b> <b>units</b> in the system. It had great influence on flow characteristics and urea decomposition into ammonia. The mixer caused flow recirculation and high level of turbulence intensity, and the chamber increased residence time of urea- water-solution injected. Because of those effects, reaction rates of urea decomposition were enhanced in the region. When those <b>mixing</b> <b>units</b> were combined, it showed the maximum because the recirculation zone was significantly developed. NH 3 conversion was maximized in the zone due to widely distributed turbulence intensity and high value of uniformity index. It caused improvement of NOx reduction efficiency of the system.

Aqueous solutions of alkanolamines are well known to be efficient chemical solvents for the CO 2 capture. Reliable experimental data for solubility and enthalpy of solution of acid gases in aqueous solutions of alkanolamines are required for the design of gas treating equipments and to develop thermodynamic models describing this process. A customized flow <b>mixing</b> <b>units</b> adapted to the SETARAM C- 80 calorimeter [1, 2] was used to measure the enthalpy of solution of CO 2 with aqueous solutions of alkanolamines (MEA, DEA, TEA, AMP and MDEA). The experiments are carried out at constant temperature and pressure for different gas loading up to the saturation of the solvent (Fig. 1). The gas solubility can be determined from the analysis of the enthalpic data. Our solubilities were compared to available literature data [3, 4]. The influence of pressure, temperature and amine composition was studied.

40|$|In this research, {{we explore}} the {{possibility}} of improving the efficiency of Dean vortex-based mixers by only employing smooth-walled simple two-dimensional (2 D) geometries. Numerical simulation results reveal that the symmetries of Dean flows in the prevalent 2 ̆ 2 S-shaped 2 ̆ 2 mixers can be broken up by adding a simple 180 ° turn between two consecutive curved channels. A planar labyrinth micromixer that is composed of multiple such <b>mixing</b> <b>units</b> is designed for improved mixing. The mixer is fabricated in a single soft lithography step and the labyrinth has a footprint of 7. 32 mm x 7. 32 mm. Experiments using fluorescein isothiocyanate solutions and deionized water demonstrate that our design achieves fast and uniform mixing within 9. 8 s to 32 ms for Reynolds numbers (Re) between 2. 5 and 30. For the first time, multiple fluid bands are observed at Re = 5 in a simple 2 D microchannel design without using obstructions or split-and-recombine features. An inverse relationship between mixing length and mass transfer Péclet number (Pe) is observed. Due to the simple planar structure, the micromixer can be easily integrated into lab-on-a-chip devices where passive mixing is needed. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new {{low-cost}} passive microfluidic mixer design, {{based on a}} replication of identical <b>mixing</b> <b>units</b> composed of microchannels with variable curvature (clothoid) geometry. The micromixer presents a compact and modular architecture {{that can be easily}} fabricated using a simple and reliable fabrication process. The particular clothoid-based geometry enhances the mixing by inducing transversal secondary flows and recirculation effects. The role of the relevant fluid mechanics mechanisms promoting the mixing in this geometry were analysed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for Reynolds numbers ranging from 1 to 110. A measure of mixing potency was quantitatively evaluated by calculating mixing efficiency, while a measure of particle dispersion was assessed through the lacunarity index. The results show that the secondary flow arrangement and recirculation effects are able to provide a mixing efficiency equal to 80 % at Reynolds number above 70. In addition, the analysis of particles distribution promotes the lacunarity as powerful tool to quantify the dispersion of fluid particles and, in turn, the overall mixing. On fabricated micromixer prototypes the microscopic-Laser-Induced-Fluorescence (μLIF) technique was applied to characterize mixing. The experimental results confirmed the mixing potency of the microdevice...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new “twisted” 3 D {{microfluidic}} mixer fabricated by a laser writing/microfabrication technique. Effective and efficient mixing using the twisted micromixers {{can be obtained}} by combining two general chaotic mixing mechanisms: splitting/recombining and chaotic advection. The lamination of mixer units provides the splitting and recombination mechanism when the quadrant of circles is arranged in a two-layered serial arrangement of <b>mixing</b> <b>units.</b> The overall 3 D path of the microchannel introduces the advection. An experimental investigation using chemical solutions revealed that these novel 3 D passive microfluidic mixers were stable and could be operated at a wide range of flow rates. This micromixer finds application in the manipulation of tiny volumes of liquids that are crucial in diagnostics. The mixing performance was evaluated by dye visualization, and using a pH test that determined the chemical reaction of the solutions. A comparison of the tornado-mixer with this twisted micromixer was made to evaluate the efficiency of mixing. The efficiency of mixing was calculated within the channel by acquiring intensities using ImageJ software. Results suggested that efficient mixing can be obtained when more than 3 units were consecutively placed. The geometry of the device, which has a length of 30 [*]mm, enables the device to be integrated with micro total analysis systems and other lab-on-chip devices...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{will address}} the problem of {{scheduling}} operations in refineries. Such a problem is to define the sequence and the time of completion of each activity related to oil refining and derivatives. The system under consideration can be defined as a multiproduct system of three stages in series, consisting of tanks, production units and <b>mixing</b> <b>units</b> (mixers). Such a system is subject to operational constraints and availability of resources, and operate continuously. In this context, in order to support the decision process, an optimization model is proposed capable of representing the operating environment of such a system, which is applied to the particular context of a refinery. Two approaches are proposed for the model solution, the first based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (PLIM) and the second based on Genetic Algorithms (GA). The model&# 039;s main objective is to meet the expected demand for manufactured products, in compliance with the operational constraints of the refinery and minimizing the number of operational changes during the horizon of programming. To validate the proposed approach, we used a set of real data related to production of fuel oil and asphalt in a large refinery. The results suggest that both approaches are able to get good solutions to the problem at hand, and the AG more efficient in terms of goals of care, which is due to the incorporation of a multi-criteria approach which is able to update the weights each goal adaptively during the evolutionary process...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} of bioreactors with immobilized cells {{is a complex}} process, incorporating in itself different complex operations. Depending {{on the design of}} the bioreactor and the biotechnological process are possible different combinations of mathematical models. Knowledge of the kinetics of biological processes and mass transfer are necessary to understand the basic principle of operation of the bioreactor. An important step in developing a complete model of the bioreactor is to explore and describe the flows’ structure in the working volume of the apparatus. For reactors with different flow and mixing characteristics are needed different methods for design, modeling and scaling-up. In this work an analysis of the experimental curves to determine the liquid residence time distribution (RTD) of liquid in the bioreactor was made. Based on this analysis, two different combined models of the flow structures were built. The study was done using specialized software RTD 3. 14. The estimation of the models parameter was made using least square method. The algorithm permits parallel, serial and other kinds of connections of building blocks, including recycles. Directions of flows between blocks and flow fractions, when necessary, are set by user. The models are characterized with simple structure and with good ability to reproduce experimental results with high accuracy. They were built by plug flow and ideal <b>mixing</b> <b>units,</b> which is a prerequisite for easy and quick integration in the synthesis model of the fermentation process in the bioreactor.

Three modified engines derived from simple Rankine engine using regeneration (incorporation of regenerator or feedliquid heaters) are analyzed through a novel approach, called exergy-topological method based on the combination of exergy flow graphs, exergy loss graphs, and thermoeconomic graphs. For the investigations, three working fluids are considered: R 134 a, R 245 fa and R 600. The incorporated devices produce different results with different fluids. Exergy destruction throughout the systems operating with R 134 a was quantified and illustrated using exergy diagrams. The sites with greater exergy destruction include turbine, evaporator and feedliquid heaters. The most critical components include evaporator, turbine and <b>mixing</b> <b>units.</b> A regenerative heat exchanger has positive effects only when the engine operates with dry fluids; feedliquid heaters improve the degree of thermodynamic perfection of the system but lead to loss in exergetic efficiency. Although, different modifications produce better energy conversion and less exergy destroyed, the improvements are not significant enough and subsequent modifications of the simple Rankine engine cannot be considered as economically profitable for heat source temperature below 100 Â Â°C. As illustration, a regenerator increases the system's energy efficiency by 7 %, the degree of thermodynamic perfection by 3. 5 % while the exergetic efficiency is unchanged {{in comparison with the}} simple Rankine cycle, with R 600 as working fluid. The impacts of heat source temperature and pinch point temperature difference on engine's performance are also examined. Finally, results demonstrate that energy analysis combined with the mathematical graph theory is a powerful tool in performance assessments of Rankine based power systems and permits meaningful comparison of different regenerative effects based on their contribution to systems improvements.
