Physician targeted promotion through <b>medical</b> <b>representatives</b> {{is one of the}} most common tactic for drug promotion by pharmaceutical drug companies. WHO states that <b>medical</b> <b>representatives</b> to work in an ethical way should make available to prescribers and dispensers complete and unbiased information for each product discussed; therefore this study aimed to evaluate the ethics in the medical brochures of generic pharmaceutical companies that are given through <b>medical</b> <b>representatives</b> to physicians in Iraq. Materials and Methods: An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in Iraq - Baghdad from February to April 2014. Promotional drug brochures were collected mainly from pharmaceutical exhibition during attendance of medical conferences that were sponsored by generic pharmaceutical companies.

Emotional picture presented in 70 % of brochures. Reference citation was present in 72 % of brochures, however only 75 % of references in these brochures were correct. Conclusions: The information that is provided in medical brochures is biased and mainly persuasive since it is mainly focusing on the positive aspect of drug therapy...|$|R

40|$|Drug {{promotion}} by <b>medical</b> <b>representatives</b> {{is one of}} {{the factors}} that influence physicians' prescribing decisions and choice of drugs. To assess the influence of <b>medical</b> <b>representatives</b> on prescribing practice of physicians in health facilities, Mekelle, Northern Ethiopia. Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted enrolling all physicians working in public and private health facilities. All public and private health facilities were included and similarly, all physicians rendering services in these facilities were sampled in the study. The data were collected from February to March, 2015. Data were then entered into Epidata Version 3. 1 and transferred to STATA version 12 for analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine predictors. Of the ninety physicians approached in this study, 40 (48. 2 %) of the physicians believed that their prescribing decisions were influenced by visits of <b>medical</b> <b>representatives</b> (MRs). The odds of physicians who received gifts from MRs being influenced to prescribe their respective products was six times higher than those who reported not accepting any gifts [AOR = 6. 56, 95 % CI: 2. 25, 19. 13]. Stationery materials 23 (35. 4 %) and drug samples 20 (54. 2 %) were the commonest kinds of gifts given to physicians and face to face talking 45 (54. 2 %) was the most frequent promotional methods. The finding of this study showed that around thirty-nine percent of MRs have had negative attitude toward competitors' product. Moreover, working in private health facility was also another predictor of influence of prescribing decision in the study area [AOR = 12. 78, 95 % CI: 1. 31, 124. 56]. Nearly half of the physicians working in Mekelle reported that their prescribing decisions were influenced by MRs in the last 12 months. Accepting gifts and working in private health facilities were predictors of influencing prescribing decisions. However, most MRs fails to provide adequate and accurate information regarding their products and they had a negative attitude towards the competitors' product(s) ...|$|R
