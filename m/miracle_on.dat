5|$|In its semi-final game, the American {{team was}} upset by Sweden, marking {{the first time}} that it had lost to an {{opponent}} other than Canada. The upset drew comparisons to the <b>Miracle</b> <b>on</b> Ice from 1980. In the medal games, Canada defeated Sweden to claim its second consecutive gold medal, while the Americans beat Finland to win the bronze.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{has several}} {{references}} to Christmas films. The title is {{a play on}} <b>Miracle</b> <b>on</b> 34th Street while the scene where everyone rallies around to support the Simpsons {{is reminiscent of the}} last scene of the classic holiday movie It's a Wonderful Life. The film is further spoofed when Homer tells Lisa to stop playing the piano which parodies a similar scene involving George Bailey.|$|E
5|$|The final rankings {{were based}} on points {{accumulated}} in matches against the other teams in the medal round. Despite the common misconception that the Americans won gold the night they beat the Soviets, this did not occur until February 24 when they defeated Finland 4–2 and finished the tournament undefeated. The Soviets finished with silver; Sweden won the bronze. In 2008, the IIHF picked the <b>Miracle</b> <b>on</b> Ice as the top international hockey story of the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved {{in one way or another}} on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the <b>Miracle</b> <b>on</b> Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{also has}} a history of success in ice hockey {{including}} four State Championships (1947, 1953, 1955, 1963), three second-place finishes, and three third-place finishes in 22 State Tournament appearances. Johnson was the only Twin Cities high school to win the Minnesota high school boys' hockey tournament for the first 25 years. Herb Brooks, who coached the <b>Miracle</b> <b>on</b> Ice gold medal winning team, played on the school's 1955 state championship winning team. Brooks' number five jersey was retired following his death in 2003. During the 1950s students shoveled off parts of Lake Phalen because there were no enclosed ice arenas. Most of the bantam hockey team players from the East Side attend either Johnson or Hill-Murray School. During the 1950s and 1960s Johnson was considered a feeder school for the University of Minnesota's ice hockey team. Recently the school's teams have suffered from lack of enrollment in the sports teams. Johnson is along with Como Park the only Saint Paul City Conference school to field a hockey team.|$|E
5|$|The same tournament format {{was used}} at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, United States. The NHL's Olympic break did not start until {{the second week of}} the Games. Because the Olympics were in the United States, where the {{majority}} of NHL teams are located, teams participating in the preliminary tournament were allowed to use NHL players who were not obligated to play with their NHL club. Slovakia was particularly affected by the inability to use all of its NHL players, and the team failed to advance to the final round. Three months later, Slovakia won gold at the 2002 World Championships. Finnish centre Raimo Helminen became the first ice hockey player to compete in six tournaments. In the quarter-finals, Belarus defeated Sweden in one of the biggest upsets since the <b>Miracle</b> <b>on</b> Ice. The team advanced to the bronze medal game, but lost to Russia. The Canadian team rebounded from a disappointing first round and defeated the American team in the gold medal game, winning their first gold medal in 50 years.|$|E

25|$|The film, {{which went}} into general release on January 7, 1947, placed 26th ($3.3 million) in box office {{revenues}} for 1947 (out {{of more than}} 400 features released), one place ahead of another Christmas film, <b>Miracle</b> <b>on</b> 34th Street. The film {{was supposed to be}} released in January 1947, but was moved up to December 1946 to make it eligible for the 1946 Academy Awards. This move was seen as worse for the film, as 1947 did not have quite the stiff competition as 1946. If it had entered the 1947 Awards, its biggest competition would have been <b>Miracle</b> <b>on</b> 34th Street. The number one grossing movie of 1947, The Best Years of Our Lives, made $11.5 million.|$|E

50|$|Two miracles were {{required}} for her beatification and the C.O.R. validated the two informative processes on 24 April 1942 that investigated the two separate cases. An antepreparatory committee approved these two healings as <b>miracles</b> <b>on</b> 30 November 1943 {{as did the}} preparatory one on 31 May 1949 and the general one on 22 November 1949.

25|$|Indicative of the {{importance}} of the grinder is that Bobby Clarke and Mike Eruzione, both grinder-style players, played major roles in their respective country's victories over the offensively skilled Soviet Union national team. Bobby Clarke was a significant factor in Team Canada's victory in the 1972 Super Series as was Mike Eruzione as Captain for United States' Olympic team in the 1980 <b>Miracle</b> <b>on</b> Ice victory.
