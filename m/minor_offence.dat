In a gross miscarriage of justice, the colonial authorities convicted Swiney and had him flogged. But Knibb refused to let the matter drop, and published details in an island newspaper, {{for which he was}} threatened with a prosecution for libel. His account reached the Secretary of State in London, who eventually dismissed from office the two responsible magistrates.|$|E
25|$|In 14 AD, her son Lü Yu (呂育), who {{had served}} in the {{government}} of Haiqu County, was executed by the county magistrate for a <b>minor</b> <b>offence.</b> To avenge his death, Mother Lü plotted a rebellion, using her wealth to recruit poor peasants and purchase weapons and supplies. She soon raised an army of several thousand people from a populace that had already been dissatisfied with the government. Mother Lü assumed the title of General and led her rebel force to storm the capital of Haiqu County. After capturing the county magistrate, she beheaded him and sacrificed his head on her son's tomb.|$|E
25|$|Kali is the {{grandfather}} of Svarocisa Manu, {{one of the}} progenitors of mankind. As previously mentioned, Kali had a son named Svarocisa with the Apsara Varuthini. Svarocisa once traveld to Mt. Mandara and was met by Manorama, a cursed-woman being chased by a demon. In the past, she had made fun of a sage practicing Tapasya austerities on Mt. Kailas and was cursed to be captured by a demon. When her friends Vibhavari and Kalavati berated the sage for enacting a curse for such a <b>minor</b> <b>offence,</b> he cursed one to be a leper {{and the other a}} carrier of diseases. Manorama had knowledge of a powerful spiritual weapon, but {{did not know how to}} wield it, so she taught it to Svarocisa. When the demon leaped out of the forest and grabbed a hold of the woman, Svarocis called forth the weapon. But the demon stayed his hand and explained he was actually Manorama’s father, Indivara. He had also been cursed to become a demon by the sage Brahmamitra because he tried to covertly obtain the secrets of Ayurveda medicine without the sage’s knowledge. The sage told him that the curse would end when he was about to eat his own daughter. Once he regained his true form, Indivara taught Svarocisa the Ayurveda medication, which he used to cure Manorama’s friends. He later married the three and had three sons with them. He learned the languages of all creatures from Vibhavari and the Padmini vidya from Kalavati.|$|E

500|$|Geir was {{strongly}} criticized in the April 2010 {{report of the}} Special Investigative Commission into the financial collapse, being accused of [...] "negligence" [...] along with three other ministers of his government. Iceland's parliament voted 33–30 to indict Geir, but not the other ministers, on charges of negligence in office at a session on 28 September 2010. He will stand trial before the Landsdómur, a special court to hear cases alleging misconduct in government office: {{it will be the}} first time the Landsdómur has convened since it was established in the 1905 Constitution. The trial began in Reykjavik on 5 March 2012. Geir Haarde was found guilty on one of four charges on 23 April 2012, for not holding cabinet meetings on important state matters. Landsdómur said Mr. Haarde would face no punishment, as this was a <b>minor</b> <b>offence.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Commentary in the {{newspaper}} Ming Pao also remarked on the widespread outrage about the perceived selective application of legal principles – that a person charged with an apparently <b>minor</b> <b>offence</b> being denied bail whilst two others, unnamed, with allegedly heavier involvement in {{the spread of the}} photographs were allowed out on bail.

2500|$|Sultan Bahram Shah was {{the last}} Ghaznavid King, ruling Ghazni, the first and main Ghaznavid capital, for thirty five years. In 1148 he was {{defeated}} in Ghazni by Sayf al-Din Suri, but he recaptured the capital the next year. Ala al-Din Husayn, a Ghorid King, conquered the city in 1151, for the revenge of his brother Kutubbuddin's death, who was son-in-law of the king but was publicly punished and killed for a <b>minor</b> <b>offence.</b> Ala al-Din Husayn then razed the city and burned it for 7 days, after which he became known as [...] "Jahānsuz" [...] (World Burner). Ghazni was restored to the Ghaznavids by {{the intervention of the}} Seljuks, who came to the aid of Bahram. Ghaznavid struggles with the Ghurids continued in subsequent years as they nibbled away at Ghaznavid territory, and Ghazni and Zabulistan was lost to a group of Oghuz Turks before captured by the Ghurids. Ghaznavid power in northwestern India continued until the Ghurid conquest of Lahore from Khusrau Malik in 1186.|$|E
2500|$|After {{four years}} Wingate left Charterhouse and in 1921 he was {{accepted}} at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, the Royal Artillery's officers' training school. For committing a <b>minor</b> <b>offence</b> against the rules, a first-year student would {{be subjected to}} a ragging ritual named [...] "running". [...] This ritual consisted of the first-year being stripped and forced to run a gauntlet of senior students, all of whom wielded a knotted towel which was used to hit the accused on his journey along the line. On reaching the end, the first-year would then be thrown into an icy-cold cistern of water. When {{it came time for}} Wingate to run the gauntlet, for allegedly having returned a horse to the stables too late, he walked up to the senior student {{at the head of the}} gauntlet, stared at him and dared him to strike. [...] The senior refused. Wingate moved to the next senior and did the same; he too refused. In turn, each senior declined to strike; coming to the end of the line, Wingate walked to the cistern and dived straight into the icy-cold water.|$|E
2500|$|Duncan {{was found}} to be in {{possession}} of a mocked-up HMS Barham hat-band. This apparently related to an alleged manifestation of the spirit of a dead sailor on HMS Barham, although Duncan appeared unaware that after 1939, sailors' hat bands carried only 'H.M.S.' and did not identify the ship they were serving on. She was initially arrested under section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, a <b>minor</b> <b>offence</b> tried by magistrates. The authorities regarded the case as more serious, and eventually discovered section 4 of the Witchcraft Act 1735, covering fraudulent [...] "spiritual" [...] activity, which was triable before a jury. Charged alongside her for conspiracy to contravene this Act were Ernest and Elizabeth Homer, who operated the Psychic centre in Portsmouth, and Frances Brown, who was Duncan's agent who went with her to set up séances. There were seven counts in total, two of conspiracy to contravene the Witchcraft Act, two of obtaining money by false pretences, and three of public mischief (a common law offence). The prosecution may be explained by the mood of suspicion prevailing at the time: the authorities were afraid that she could continue to reveal classified information, whatever her source was. There were also concerns that she was exploiting the recently bereaved, as the Recorder noted when passing sentence.|$|E

60|$|We were impanelled {{to inquire}} {{concerning}} {{the death of}} a very little mite of a child. It was the old miserable story. Whether the mother had committed the <b>minor</b> <b>offence</b> of concealing the birth, or whether she had committed the major offence of killing the child, was the question on which we were wanted. We must commit her on one of the two issues.|$|E
60|$|The miserable young {{creature}} {{who had given}} birth to this child within a very few days, and who had cleaned the cold wet door-steps immediately afterwards, was brought before us when we resumed our horse-hair chairs, and was present during the proceedings. She had a horse-hair chair herself, being very weak and ill; and I remember how she turned to the unsympathetic nurse who attended her, and who might have been the figure-head of a pauper-ship, and how she hid her face and sobs and tears upon that wooden shoulder. I remember, too, how hard her mistress was upon her (she was a servant-of-all- work), and with what a cruel pertinacity that piece of Virtue spun her thread of evidence double, by intertwisting it with the sternest thread of construction. Smitten hard by the terrible low wail from the utterly friendless orphan girl, which never ceased during the whole inquiry, I took heart to ask this witness a question or two, which hopefully admitted of an answer that might give a favourable turn to the case. She made the turn as little favourable as it could be, but it did some good, and the Coroner, who was nobly patient and humane (he was the late Mr. Wakley), cast a look of strong encouragement in my direction. Then, we had the doctor who had made the examination, and the usual tests as to whether the child was born alive; but he was a timid, muddle-headed doctor, and got confused and contradictory, and wouldn't say this, and couldn't answer for that, and the immaculate broker was too much for him, and our side slid back again. However, I tried again, and the Coroner backed me again, for which I ever afterwards felt grateful to him as I do now to his memory; and we got another favourable turn, out of some other witness, some member of the family with a strong prepossession against the sinner; and I think we had the doctor back again; and I know that the Coroner summed up for our side, and that I and my British brothers turned round to discuss our verdict, and get ourselves into great difficulties with our large chairs and the broker. At that stage of the case I tried hard again, being convinced that I had cause for it; and at last we found for the <b>minor</b> <b>offence</b> of only concealing the birth; and the poor desolate creature, who had been taken out during our deliberation, being brought in again to be told of the verdict, then dropped upon her knees before us, with protestations that we were right--protestations among the most affecting that I have ever heard in my life--and was carried away insensible.|$|E
