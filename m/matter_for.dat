Usually, breaking down releases energy and building up consumes energy.|$|E

The sense and subjects might be borrow'd plentifully from the Proverbs of Solomon, from all the common appearances of nature, from all the occurrences in the civil life, both in city and country: (which would also afford <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> other Divine Songs.)

5|$|At the age {{of eight}} the younger Reginald began {{attending}} the local grammar school at Whitchurch, where he remained for five years. In 1796 {{he was sent to}} Bristow's, a small private school in Neasden a few miles north of Central London. This establishment provided intensive learning for around a dozen boys, preparing them for eventual entry to Oxford or Cambridge universities. At Bristow's Reginald met John Thornton, who became a lifelong friend. The pair shared a lively interest in church history and beliefs; a lengthy letter, written by Heber to Thornton, is described by Heber's biographer Arthur Montefiore as being worthy of a learned theologian. In October 1800 Heber entered Brasenose College, Oxford; Thornton's decision to go to Cambridge was a <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> Heber's considerable regret.|$|E
5|$|But {{apart from}} the {{clerical}} business, Las Casas had also traveled to Spain for his own purpose: to continue the struggle against the colonists' mistreatment of the Indians. The encomienda had, in fact, legally been abolished in 1523, {{but it had been}} reinstituted in 1526, and in 1530 a general ordinance against slavery was reversed by the Crown. For this reason it was a pressing <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> Bartolomé de las Casas to plead once again for the Indians with Charles V who was by now Holy Roman Emperor and no longer a boy. He wrote a letter asking for permission to stay in Spain a little longer in order to argue for the Emperor that conversion and colonization were best achieved by peaceful means.|$|E

Como's older son, Ronnie, and his daughter, Terri, could not agree on their interpretations of Como's 1999 living will and it became a <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> the courts in the year before his death.

5|$|He {{took this}} {{development}} {{to a new}} level with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux—its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject <b>matter</b> (<b>for</b> example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano Catalogue d'oiseaux completed in 1958, and La fauvette des jardins of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.|$|E
5|$|In February 1846 Stone intimated to Abby Kelley Foster {{that she}} was {{thinking}} of becoming a public speaker, but not until the following summer did a storm of controversy over Foster’s speaking at Oberlin decide the <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> her. Faculty opposition to Foster ignited impassioned discussion of women’s rights among the students, especially of woman’s right to speak in public, which Stone vigorously defended in a joint meeting of the men’s and women’s literary societies. She followed that campus demonstration by making her first public speech at Oberlin’s August 1 commemoration of Emancipation in the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, {{living in}} small amounts of debris, in various forms such as bark and fallen logs. Species {{have been found to}} be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous; {{reported}} to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consist of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal <b>matter.</b> <b>For</b> protection from predators, the species Doru taeniatum of earwigs can squirt foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 19th century, {{there were}} very few schools. Most of those that existed were run by the church, for the church, {{stressing}} religious education. In {{the latter part of the}} 19th Century, compulsory attendance at school ceased to be a <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> local option, with the introduction of the Elementary Education Act 1870 a milestone in the British school education system. Children had to attend between the ages of 5 and 10 though with some local discretion such as early leaving in agricultural areas.|$|E
5|$|The Wonder World Tour {{has been}} {{described}} as part of Cyrus' transitional period, with more elaborate and edgier characteristics. Each concert was divided into seven segments, each of which bared different themes, the subject of <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> the tour's title. The show opened with Cyrus performing rock-oriented songs. It also featured her and backup dancers being suspended above the stage with aerial rigging various times. At one point, she mounted a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as it was elevated and made its path across the venue. Cyrus also rendered a tribute to the deceased singer Michael Jackson and performed two Hannah Montana-credited songs as herself.|$|E

5|$|The {{disappearance}} of De Mauro remained a mystery and a <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> many speculations. In May 1994 Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta {{declared that the}} Sicilian Mafia {{had been involved in}} the murder of Mattei. He also claimed that De Mauro was killed because of his investigations into the death of Mattei. According to Buscetta, Mattei was killed {{at the request of the}} American Cosa Nostra because his oil policies had damaged important American interests in the Middle East. The American Mafia in turn was possibly doing a favour to the large oil companies.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} English Church {{had been}} a <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> great debate in the {{years prior to the}} 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had {{traditionally}} exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit and was deeply disturbed by his work tending wounded French soldiers. For a very brief period {{he served as a}} volunteer ambulance driver before ill health forced his return to Britain. Subsequently, Nevinson volunteered for home service with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He used these experiences as the subject <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> a series of powerful paintings which used the machine aesthetic of Futurism and the influence of Cubism to great effect. His fellow artist Walter Sickert wrote at the time that Nevinson's painting La Mitrailleuse, 'will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated utterance on the war in the history of painting.' In 1917, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist, but he was no longer finding Modernist styles adequate for describing the horrors of modern war, and he increasingly painted in a more realistic manner. Nevinson's later World War One paintings, based on short visits to the Western Front, lacked the same powerful effect as those earlier works which had helped to make him {{one of the most famous}} young artists working in England.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{then settled}} an {{incident}} involving {{the abuse of}} the protection afforded by icons of the princeps, in which the emperor's images were being used to shield the guilty. Gaius Cestius Gallus brought a complaint into the Senate, and claimed he was being abused under this safeguard by Annia Rufilla. Drusus was soon brought in to weigh on the <b>matter,</b> <b>for</b> the Senate felt only {{a member of the}} imperial family could speak on such a delicate matter. At the request of many senators, Drusus had Rufilla arrested and imprisoned. Later, he was given credit for the condemnation of two Roman equites, Considius Aequus and Coelius Cursor, who had attacked the praetor, Magius Caecilianus, with false charges of maiestas. It is unlikely that he himself was responsible, for every verdict was given by the Senate with Tiberius' authority, but this did not prevent his popularity.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
