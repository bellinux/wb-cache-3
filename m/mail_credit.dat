50|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to reduce waste in {{sustainable}} living. Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk <b>mail</b> like <b>credit</b> card and insurance offers and direct mail marketing and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails. Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009. Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.|$|R
5000|$|Key {{provisions}} include:(1) Giving consumers {{enough time}} to pay their bills. Credit card companies have to give consumers at least 21 days to pay {{from the time the}} bill is <b>mailed.</b> <b>Credit</b> card companies can not [...] "trap" [...] consumers by setting payment deadlines on the weekend or {{in the middle of the}} day, or changing their payment deadlines each month.(2) No retroactive rate increases. Credit card companies must give consumers at least 45 days notice if their rates are about to go up, and can not change any terms of the contract within a year. Low introductory rates must last at least six months.(3) Easier to pay down debt. Credit card companies must apply payments to a consumer's highest interest rate balances first. Statements must show consumers how long it would take to pay off their existing balance if the consumer made only the minimum payment, and must show the payment amount and total interest cost to pay off the entire balance in 36 months.(4) Eliminates [...] "fee harvester cards." [...] The act restricts fees on low-balance cards sold to cardholders with bad credit. For many of these cards, the up-front fees charged exceeded the remaining credit. The act also restricts the fees that can be charged for gift cards and other prepaid cards. (5) Eliminates excessive marketing to young people. Consumers under the age of 21 must prove that they have an independent income or get a co-signer before applying for a credit card. The Act also prevents credit card companies from mailing offers to consumers under 21 unless they [...] "opt in," [...] and prohibits companies from wooing students with T-shirts, free pizza and other free gifts at university-sponsored events.|$|R

50|$|Today, batch {{prescreen}} is {{ubiquitous in}} the financial industry. The most common method for distributing batch prescreen offers is direct mail. During {{the first quarter of}} 2010, U.S consumers received 481 million direct <b>mail</b> prescreen <b>credit</b> offers which represents a 29 percent increase on the 372.4 million mailed {{in the first quarter of}} 2009. However, as the volume of direct mail prescreen offers increases, the acceptance rate of those offers tends to decrease. The reason for this inverse correlation is that the number of U.S consumers interested in responding to direct mail prescreen offers tends to remain relatively static. Direct Mail prescreen, while compelling to some consumers, just doesn't appeal to everyone. Additionally, the printing and mailing of billions of direct mail pieces a year (most of which are immediately thrown away) contributes more than 4 million tons of paper to the nation's landfills each year.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new way in which one can view and tackle a {{relevant}} class of feature interaction problems in telephony. One can view them as mode confusions, which are {{well known in the}} human-computer interface of shared-control systems. In telephony, call control is shared between users and many modern telephony features. Some examples are call screening, call forwarding, voice <b>mail,</b> and <b>credit</b> card calling. We find that a considerable number of undesired telephony feature interactions in the feature interaction benchmark of Cameron et al. are also shared-control mode confusions. We therefore adapt the known measures from the shared-control area for preventing mode confusions and apply them against undesired feature interactions in telephony. To prove our idea, we show how the concerned feature interaction problems in the benchmark can be avoided. Attention to mode confusions helps to design features with less undesired surprises. Key words: mode confusion, feature interaction, telephony, human-computer interface, shared-control systems...|$|R

Several Devils fans and other {{observers}} believed that there was inconsistency with the officials' calls, and that they missed a couple of calls on the Kings {{at the time of}} that hit, such as one Jarret Stoll made on the Devils' Stephen Gionta. But James Mirtle of The Globe and <b>Mail</b> gave <b>credit</b> to the referees for making the hard call, stating that [...] "Scuderi had his back to Bernier much of the play ... It's also the type of play the league showcased at the GM meetings as one where more and more players had been 'letting up' rather than plowing a vulnerable opponent from behind. The NHL, in other words, wants these hits out of the game." [...] With the win, the Kings became only the second California-based NHL team to win the Stanley Cup, following the Anaheim Ducks, who beat Ottawa in , the 12th expansion team to win it, and the second to last of the surviving 1967 expansion teams to do so (as of 2017, the only surviving franchise from the 1967 expansion not to win the Cup are the St. Louis Blues).|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the limited effectiveness of direct mail batch prescreen, financial institutions developed a new application for the concept of prescreen, instant prescreen, in 1992. The basic premise of instant prescreen {{is the same as}} direct <b>mail</b> prescreen. Using <b>credit</b> data to evaluate a consumer for a credit product without that consumer's knowledge. However, the execution of instant prescreen is radically different than batch prescreen. With instant prescreen, financial institutions prescreen new or existing customers for additional credit products in realtime at the point of contact. So instead of sending unsolicited prescreen offers to huge batches of unknown consumers, instant prescreen enables banks to offer known customers relevant credit products whenever those customers choose to contact the bank. This approach to prescreen focuses on deepening existing customer relationships and tends to produce higher acceptance rates than direct mail prescreen.|$|R

Two other groups were also included, faculty members and managers of credit association chapters. Three hundred and fifteen surveys were mailed and 207 anonymous responses received. The statement rankings were applied against a series of three way contingency tables. ^ A second survey consisting of interviews among banking and business people familiar with industrial credit practices listed reasons for accepting or rejecting the implied trends. ^ Salient points were that in the future the accounts receivable asset will be managed like other company investments to fit in with company needs and objectives. The credit department will not act as an independent unit in a company and credit departments will no longer be considered adversaries of the sales and marketing functions. An activist role will be assumed or sought out in business activities aided by an increasing favorable image of the credit department and an upgrading of staff quality. ^ While credit work will still carry a 2 ̆ 2 specialist 2 ̆ 2 label, future credit department employees will come from other business and educational disciplines. Computers will facilitate greater involvement of credit personnel in business transactions and also foster credit people performing cash forecasting, estimating receivables levels for corporate planning, predicting financial impairment of customers and counseling management of financially marginal companies. ^ While the days sales outstanding (DSO) ratio, will remain a common measurement of accounts receivable vitality, other statistics such as average days past due and average number of days credit granted will be considered more meaningful standards. ^ Bad debt ratios probably will not be a prime measurement of a credit department 2 ̆ 7 s efficiency and effectiveness. ^ There was no strong preference for either a physically centralized or regionalized form of organization for credit departments in the future and a reporting line to a treasurer was preferred over a reporting line to a controller or marketing executive. ...|$|R
