5|$|Despite {{being over}} 60 {{years old and}} having {{been out of the}} Army for 25 years, the crisis of the Union {{compelled}} Greene to seek to rejoin the service. He was essentially apolitical and was not an abolitionist, but he was a firm believer in restoring the Union. He was appointed colonel of the 60th New York Volunteer Infantry on January 18, 1862. The regiment of upstate New Yorkers had been dissatisfied with their colonel and the company commanders had petitioned for his removal. Governor Edwin D. Morgan, although initially reluctant to appoint Greene because of his age, saw his 13 years of regular army experience as a solution to his political/military problem. During this period, Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts was also prepared to offer Greene a regiment, but Greene chose to serve New York. The officers of the 60th were dismayed when the elderly, gray-haired <b>man</b> <b>reported</b> for duty. They had requested that their lieutenant colonel be promoted, which would have raised many of them in rank themselves.|$|E

25|$|On March 25, 1864, Forrest {{commenced}} his attack. He met Colonel Stephen G. Hicks at Fort Anderson {{and demanded}} an unconditional surrender. Knowing that Forrest's main objectives were to obtain supplies and horses, Hicks declined. For the most part, Hicks {{was right in}} his assumption that Forrest would not assault the fort, but Confederate colonel Albert P. Thompson, {{a native of the}} area, did briefly attempt to capture it before being killed with 24 men from his unit. Forrest held the city for ten hours, destroying the Union headquarters, as well as the buildings housing the quartermaster and commissary. Forrest also captured a total of 200 horses and mules before withdrawing to Mayfield. Following the raid, Forrest granted furlough to the Kentuckians under his command so they could secure better clothing and mounts. As agreed, every <b>man</b> <b>reported</b> back to Trenton, Tennessee on April 4.|$|E

500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room. They said they heard two women arguing about {{business}} matters. Selena told Saldívar {{she could no}} longer be trusted, and demanded Saldívar return her financial papers. Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw the gun. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed it at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's maintenance <b>man,</b> <b>reported</b> hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen clutching her chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing the gun at her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll shoot me again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again". DeLeon tried to talk to Selena but noticed she was beginning to lose consciousness; he said she was moaning and moving less often. DeLeon noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.|$|E

2500|$|On February 25, 2009, Police Chief Bratton {{addressed}} {{the press for}} the first time regarding the case, at which time the police formally gave the killer the [...] "Grim Sleeper" [...] nickname chosen by L.A. Weekly. Bratton also released a 911 call from the 1980s in which a <b>man</b> <b>reported</b> seeing a body being dumped by the Grim Sleeper, giving a detailed description and license plate number of a van connected with the now-closed Cosmopolitan Church.|$|E
2500|$|The total {{death toll}} was {{calculated}} originally as 2,209 people, making the disaster the largest loss of civilian {{life in the}} United States at the time. This number of deaths was later surpassed by fatalities in the 1900 Galveston hurricane and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. However, as pointed out by David McCullough in 1968 (pages 266 and 278), a <b>man</b> <b>reported</b> as presumed dead (not {{known to have been}} found) had survived. In 1900, Leroy Temple showed up in Johnstown to reveal he had not died but had extricated himself from the flood debris at the stone bridge below Johnstown {{and walked out of the}} valley. [...] Until 1900 Temple had been living in Beverly, Massachusetts. [...] Therefore, the official death toll should be 2,208.|$|E
2500|$|Little Slackwater was {{a tricky}} place to navigate. Not {{only did it}} {{have a lot of}} hairpin turns, but also just before Guard lock #5, there was a strip of land in the water called [...] "the pier" [...] : loaded boats going {{downstream}} would have to go outside the pier, and unloaded boats on the inside, thus making steering difficult for the loaded boats to get into the lock. If the current was fast in the river it could go as fast as the boat, rendering the tiller useless, and thus, a boat could be almost impossible to steer. One <b>man</b> <b>reported</b> that at the slackwater, they had him sit {{at the front of the}} boat with a hatchet in case they had to cut the towline , and had a couple of [...] hatches turned upside down, so that they could escape to shore on the hatches. On 1 May 1903, the towline to Boat No. 6 broke, with Captain Keim, Mrs. Keim, their two daughters, and Harry Newkirk aboard. One daughter drowned, another suffered a broken leg, and the captain died later of injuries. The rest (including the mules aboard) survived.|$|E

5000|$|Female-on-male rape is under-researched {{compared}} {{to other forms of}} sexual violence. Statistics on the prevalence of female-on-male sexual violence vary. One study (Hannon et al.) found 23.4% of women and 10.5% of <b>men</b> <b>reported</b> they were raped while 6.6% of women and 10.5% of <b>men</b> <b>reported</b> they were victims of attempted rape. A 2010 study by the CDC found that 93.3% male rape victims reported only male perpetrators. 1 in 21 or 4.8% of <b>men</b> <b>reported</b> being [...] "made to penetrate". The survey also found that male victims reported only female perpetrators in instances of being made to penetrate (79.2%), sexual coercion (83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (53.1%). A 2008 study of 98 men interviewed on the United States National Crime Victimization Survey found that nearly half of the <b>men</b> (46%) who <b>reported</b> some form of sexual victimization were victimized by women.|$|R
3000|$|... 7 There is {{empirical}} evidence that women {{care about the}} fraction of their co-workers who are female.

60|$|Cuffe assented, and {{the lead}} was hove. At this moment the ship was going eight knots, and the <b>man</b> <b>reported</b> no bottom, with fifteen fathoms of line out. This was well, {{and two or three}} {{subsequent}} casts confirmed it. Orders were now given to drag every bowline, swig-off on every brace, and flatten-in all the sheets. Even the halyards were touched in order that the sails might stand like boards. The trying moment was near; five minutes must decide the matter.|$|E
60|$|Before {{we went to}} {{the table}} I sent a servant {{to the top of the}} house, with orders to look down the road, in order to {{ascertain}} when my red friends might be expected.

They had stopped; and he thought that he could perceive, by means of his glass, that they were painting their faces, and otherwise arranging their toilets, in preparation for the anticipated interview. On receiving this information we took our seats at table, expecting to be ready to receive the chiefs, as soon as they should arrive.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} attachment pattern change of partner violent men {{over the course}} of 17 weeks of integrated cognitive–behavioral/psychodynamic group treatment. Results indicated {{a significant increase in the}} number of <b>men</b> <b>reporting</b> a secure attachment from pre- to posttreatment. Subsequent analysis indicated that secure-changed <b>men</b> <b>reported</b> significant increases in comfort with closeness and depending on others from pre- to posttreatment. From pre- to posttreatment, insecure and secure-unchanged <b>men</b> <b>reported</b> an increase in avoidance of closeness. Ad-ditionally, secure-changed men re-ported lower anxiety and depression than insecure men at posttreatment. Finally, the total sample reported sig-nificant reductions in partner violence from pre to posttreatment. Based on these results, it would be important for clinicians and researchers to distin-guish between men who changed to a secure attachment pattern {{over the course of}} treatment and securely at-tached men who remained unchanged...|$|R
