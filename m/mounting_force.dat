40|$|Background: The motion {{artifact}} is an ever-present {{challenge in}} the mobile monitoring of surface potentials. Skin-electrode impedance is investigated as an input parameter to detect the motion artifact and to reduce it using various methods. However, {{the impact of the}} used impedance measurement frequency on the relationship between measured impedance and the motion artifact and the relationship between the impedance and the motion is not well understood. Methods: In this paper, for the first time, we present the simultaneous measurement of impedance at 8 current frequencies during the application of controlled motion to the electrode at monitored electrode <b>mounting</b> <b>force.</b> Three interwoven frequency groupings are used to obtain a spectrum of 24 frequencies between 25 Hz and 1 MHz for ten volunteers. Consequently, the surface potential and one channel of ECG are measured from the electrode subject to controlled motion. The signals are then analyzed in time and frequency domain. Results: The results show that the different frequencies of impedance measurements d...|$|E
40|$|Collimator {{design is}} {{essential}} for meeting the requirements of high-precision telescopes. The collimator diameter should be larger {{than that of the}} target for alignment. Special supporting structures are required to reduce the gravitational deformation and control the surface deformation induced by the <b>mounting</b> <b>force</b> when inspecting large-aperture primary mirrors (M 1). A ZERODURÂŽ mirror 620 mm in diameter for a collimator was analyzed using the finite element method to obtain the deformation induced by the supporting structures and adjustment mechanism. Zernike polynomials were also adopted to fit the optical surface and separate corresponding aberrations. The computed and measured wavefront aberration configurations for the collimator M 1 were obtained complementally. The wavefront aberrations were adjusted using fine adjustment screws using 3 D optical path differences map of the mirror surface. Through studies using different boundary conditions and inner ring support positions, it is concluded that the optical performance was excellent under a strong enough supporter. The best adjustment position was attained and applied to the actual collimator M 1 to prove the correctness of the simulation results...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{substrate}} design, efficient washcoat/catalyst formulation {{and robust}} packaging are critical elements to assure performance and durability of catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters. Radial seals, axial seals and L-seals made of knitted wiremesh are used with conventional mounting systems to provide compressible and durable support cushions for catalyst and filter substrates. Axial and radial mounting {{forces of the}} seals are optimized by material type, seal density, wiremesh strand, wiremesh surface profile (flat or round), wiremesh surface characteristics, wiremesh temper, thermal impacts, and wiremesh geometry. Compression characteristics of stainless steel alloy A 286 tremendously increase (> 20 %) during heat treatment as precipitation and hardening occurs. Compression force tends to stabilize during cycling, retaining a residual force. Radial seals provide radial mounting pressure and mat erosion protection. V-seal is an exhaust gas blocking seal used with stainless steel knitted wiremesh support to prevent exhaust gas from bypassing the ceramic monolith in catalytic converter. L-seals provide combination of axial and radial <b>mounting</b> <b>force</b> for the converter whereas axial seals are designed to provide only axial supports. L-seals are designed to insert before or after stuffing the substrates in the converter assembly...|$|E

40|$|IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, to appearWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} computing realistic contact forces during manipulation, backed with ground-truth measurements, using vision alone. Interaction forces are traditionally measured by <b>mounting</b> <b>force</b> transducers onto the manipulated objects or the hands. Those are costly, cumbersome, and alter the objects' physical properties and their perception by the human sense of touch. Our work establishes that interaction forces can be estimated in a cost-effective, reliable, non-intrusive way using vision. This is a complex and challenging problem. Indeed, in multi-contact, a given trajectory can generally be caused by an infinity of possible distributions. To alleviate the limitations of traditional models based on inverse optimization, we collect and release the first large-scale dataset on manipulation kinodynamics as 3. 2 hours of synchronized force and motion measurements under 193 object-grasp configurations. We learn a mapping between high-level kinematic features based on the equations of motion and the underlying manipulation forces using recurrent neural networks (RNN). The RNN predictions are consistently refined using physics-based optimization through second-order cone programming (SOCP). We show that our method can successfully capture interaction forces compatible with both the observations and the way humans naturally manipulate objects, on an acquisition system no more complex than a single RGB-D camera...|$|E
40|$|Free-piston Stirling convertors are {{fundamental}} {{to the development of}} NASA s next generation of radioisotope power system, the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG). The ASRG will use General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) modules as the energy source and Advanced Stirling Convertors (ASCs) to convert heat into electrical energy, and is being developed by Lockheed Martin under contract to the Department of Energy. Achieving flight status mandates that the ASCs satisfy design as well as flight requirements to ensure reliable operation during launch. To meet these launch requirements, GRC performed a series of quasi-static mechanical tests simulating the pressure, thermal, and external loading conditions that will be experienced by an ASC E 2 heater head assembly. These mechanical tests were collectively referred to as lateral load tests since a primary external load lateral to the heater head longitudinal axis was applied in combination with the other loading conditions. The heater head was subjected to the operational pressure, axial <b>mounting</b> <b>force,</b> thermal conditions, and axial and lateral launch vehicle acceleration loadings. To permit reliable prediction of the heater head s structural performance, GRC completed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) computer modeling for the stress, strain, and deformation that will result during launch. The heater head lateral load test directly supported evaluation of the analysis and validation of the design to meet launch requirements. This paper provides an overview of each element within the test and presents assessment of the modeling as well as experimental results of this task...|$|E

40|$|The zero-gravity surface {{figure of}} optics used in {{spaceborne}} astronomical instruments must be known to high accuracy, but earthbound metrology is typically corrupted by gravity sag. Generally, inference of the zero-gravity surface figure from a measurement made under normal gravity requires finite-element analysis (FEA), and for accurate results the <b>mount</b> <b>forces</b> must be well characterized. We describe how to infer the zero-gravity surface figure very precisely using the alternative classical technique of averaging pairs of measurements {{made with the}} direction of gravity reversed. We show that <b>mount</b> <b>forces</b> as well as gravity must be reversed between the two measurements and discuss how the St. Venant principle determines when a reversed <b>mount</b> <b>force</b> may {{be considered to be}} applied at the same place in the two orientations. Our approach requires no finite-element modeling and no detailed knowledge of <b>mount</b> <b>forces</b> {{other than the fact that}} they reverse and are applied at the same point in each orientation. If mount schemes are suitably chosen, zero-gravity optical surfaces may be inferred much more simply and more accurately than with FEA...|$|R

40|$|The {{technical}} innovation involves {{refinement of}} the classic optical technique of averaging surface measurements made in different orientations with respect to gravity, so the effects of gravity cancel in the averaged image. Particularly for large, thin mirrors subject to substantial deformation, the further requirement is that <b>mount</b> <b>forces</b> must also cancel when averaged over measurement orientations. The zerogravity surface figure of a mirror in a hexapod mount is obtained by analyzing the summation of <b>mount</b> <b>forces</b> {{in the frame of}} the optic as surface metrology is averaged over multiple clockings. This is illustrated with measurements taken from the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) PT-Ml mirror for both twofold and threefold clocking. The positive results of these measurements and analyses indicate that, from this perspective, a lighter mirror could be used; that is, one might place less reliance on the damping effects of the elliptic partial differential equations that describe the propagation of forces through glass. The advantage over prior art is relaxing the need for an otherwise substantial thickness of glass that might be needed to ensure accurate metrology {{in the absence of a}} detailed understanding and analysis of the <b>mount</b> <b>forces.</b> The general insights developed here are new, and provide the basic design principles on which mirror mount geometry may be chosen...|$|R
