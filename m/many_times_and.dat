5|$|The {{story has}} been retold <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> used to {{illustrate}} widely varying viewpoints. Among them: in 1960 about sympathy towards the Soviet Union during the Cold War; in 1980 about the impending collapse of civilization anticipated by survivalists; in the 1990s about inaction in response to climate change and staying in abusive relationships. It has also been used by libertarians to warn about slow erosion of civil rights.|$|E

5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{building}} housed {{a succession of}} tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because {{a sufficient number of}} local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As {{the building}} continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural problems at the mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely a year after the mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|Medical issues forced Schweitzer {{to leave}} Africa <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> {{sometimes}} Albert {{kept her from}} returning at times. When Albert {{decided to return to}} Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.|$|E

5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E

5|$|The {{site has}} a long history of human occupation, from prehistoric farming to its use as a {{prisoner}} of war camp in the Second World War. The reserve attracts large numbers of visitors, contributing significantly to the economy of Cley village.

New wetlands are being created further inland to compensate for the loss of coastal habitats.|$|E
5|$|Creutz {{became a}} professor, {{the head of}} the Physics Department, and the head of Nuclear Research Center at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1948.

In addition to his work on nuclear physics, he cultivated flowers and orchids at his home. He published eight papers on floral species, and named three varieties of violets after his children. One 1966 paper, published in the New York Botanical Garden Journal was on Apetahia raiateensis, a rare flower found only on the island of Raiatea in French Polynesia.

5|$|For the US Navy, the Battle of Savo Island would {{institute}} many changes. Virtually every cruiser {{would be}} retrofitted with emergency diesel electric generators. The fire mains {{of the ships}} would be changed to a verticle loop design that could be broken <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> still function. Fires were set at Savo which were attributed to aviation facilities filled with gas, oil, and planes. Motorboats were filled with gasoline and also caught fire. In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready service lockers added to the destruction and {{it was noted that}} these lockers were never close to being depleted. The Commander in Chief would order sweeping changes be made before ships entered surface combat in the future.|$|E
