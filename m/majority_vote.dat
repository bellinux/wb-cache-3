40|$|Directors have {{traditionally}} been elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that in uncontested elections, a candidate who receives even a single vote is elected. Proponents of "shareholder democracy" have advocated a shift to a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> rule in which a candidate must receive a <b>majority</b> of the <b>votes</b> cast to be elected. Over the past decade, they have been successful, and the shift to <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> {{has been one of}} the most popular and successful governance reforms. Yet critics are skeptical as to whether <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> improves board accountability. Tellingly, directors of companies with <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> rarely fail to receive majority approval - even more rarely than directors of companies with plurality voting. Even when such directors fail to receive majority approval, they are unlikely to be forced to leave the board. This poses a puzzle: why do firms switch to <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> and what effect does the switch have, if any, on director behavior? We empirically examine the adoption and impact of a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> rule using a sample of uncontested director elections from 2007 to 2013. We test and find partial support for four hypotheses that could explain why directors of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> firms so rarely fail to receive majority support: selection; deterrence/accountability; electioneering by firms; and restraint by shareholders. Our results further suggest that the reasons for and effects of adopting <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> may differ between early and later adopters. We find that early adopters of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> were more shareholder-responsive than other firms even before they adopted <b>majority</b> <b>voting.</b> These firms seem to have adopted <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> voluntarily, and the adoption of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> has made little difference in their responsiveness to shareholders responsiveness going forward. By contrast, for late adopters, we find no evidence that they were more shareholder-responsive than other firms before they adopted <b>majority</b> <b>voting,</b> but strong evidence that they became more responsive after adopting <b>majority</b> <b>voting.</b> Differences between early and late adopters can have important implications for understanding the spread of corporate governance reforms and evaluating their effects on firms. Reform advocates, rather than targeting the firms that, by their measures, are most in need of reform, instead seem to have targeted the firms that are already most responsive. They may then have used the widespread adoption of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> to create pressure on the nonadopting firms. Empirical studies of the effects of governance changes thus need to be sensitive to the possibility that early adopters and late adopters of reforms differ from each other and that the reforms may have different effects on these two groups of firms...|$|R

40|$|A robust {{character}} of combining diverse classifiers using a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> {{has recently been}} illustrated in the pattern recognition literature. Furthermore, negatively correlated classifiers turned out to offer further improvement of the <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> performance even comparing to the idealised model with independent classifiers. However, negatively correlated classifiers represent a very unlikely situation in the real-world classification problems and their benefits usually remain out of reach. Nevertheless, it is theoretically possible to obtain 0 % <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> error using {{a finite number of}} classifiers at the error level lower than 50 %. We attempt to show that structuring classifiers into relevant multistage organisations can widen this boundary as well as the limits of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> error even more. Introducing discrete error distributions for analysis, we show how <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> errors and their limits depend on parameters of a multiple classifier system with hardened binary outputs (correct/incorrect). Moreover, we investigate sensitivity of boundary distributions of classifier outputs to small discrepancies modelled by the random changes of votes and propose new more stable patterns of boundary distributions. Finally, we show how organising classifiers into different structures can be used to widen the limits of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> errors and how this phenomenon can be effectively exploited...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We present {{three new}} voting schemes for multi-classifier {{biometric}} authentication using a reliability model {{to influence the}} importance of each base classifier’s vote. The reliability model is a metaclassifier computing {{the probability of a}} correct decision for the base classifiers. It uses two features which do not depend directly on the underlying physical signal properties, verification score and difference between user-specific and user-independent decision threshold. It is shown on two signature databases and two speaker databases that this reliability classification can systematically reduce the number of errors compared to the base classifier. Fusion experiments on the signature databases show that all three <b>voting</b> methods (rigged <b>majority</b> <b>voting,</b> weighted rigged <b>majority</b> <b>voting,</b> and selective rigged <b>majority</b> <b>voting)</b> perform significantly better than <b>majority</b> <b>voting,</b> and that given sufficient training data, they also perform significantly better than the best classifier in the ensemble. ...|$|R

We construct a model in which households are differentiated by income and have the option of choosing between publicly provided services and private services.

Even though preferences over tax rates are not single peaked, we provide conditions under which a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> equilibrium exists. We illustrate our existence result with CES preferences and a Dagum income distribution. ...|$|R
