500|$|The {{occurrence}} of intense religious feelings in persons with epilepsy {{in general is}} considered rare, with an incident rate of about 2–3%. Sudden religious conversion, together with visions, has been documented in {{only a small number}} of individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. The {{occurrence of}} religious experiences in TLE-patients <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> explained by religious attribution, due to the background of these patients. Nevertheless, the neurological research of mystical experiences is a growing field of research, searching for specific neurological explanations of mystical experiences. Study of ecstatic seizures may provide clues for the neurological mechanisms giving rise to mystical experiences, such as the anterior insular cortex, which is involved in self-awareness and subjective certainty.|$|E
500|$|Spider {{decided to}} [...] "dodge his responsibilities" [...] and began {{staying away from}} Toyah, who was {{not happy about it}} as she wanted them to make a commitment. Spider {{eventually}} changed his mind and Hancock commented [...] "The fact is that he really fancies Toyah, and he figures that he <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> hung for a sheep as a goat." [...] The actor reckoned that Spider and Toyah brought out the best in each other. Spider and Toyah soon began a proper relationship and briefly lived together. However, when Spider announced that he wanted to settle down and buy a house with Toyah, the couple realised that they had started to drift apart. Spider thought that if they got a mortgage together it would help save the relationship, but Toyah did not want that at all. When Spider was offered a promotion, he realised {{that he did not want}} to work for the DSS anymore and quit. He then told Toyah that he had bought them tickets to India so that they could go and [...] "find themselves." [...] However, Toyah insisted that she did not want to leave Weatherfield. Nicole Carmichael from Inside Soap wrote that while Spider did not want to lose Toyah, he felt that he could not stay and soon departed.|$|E

500|$|Cannibal {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics upon its release. The album holds a score 73 out of 100 based on 11 critical reviews, {{according to the}} music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic was positive in the review of Cannibal. Erlewine was somewhat critical of the choice to release the EP noting that the only real reason for the release was that Animal had been [...] "squeezed dry of hits". Although critical of the re-release, Thomas' consensus of the album was positive, writing: [...] "aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal’s brevity trumping the scattershot Animal -- but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She’s all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage in her wake. She is who she is and she offers no apologies." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Kesha's writing of the album noting that her [...] "herky-jerky rhymes still sound like {{they came from the}} bathroom wall of a reform-school kindergarten", not citing that as a negative but instead noting that the album had a [...] "sulfurous end-of-days whiff about it". Greenblatt ended her review of the album giving it a rating of [...] "B+" [...] and called [...] "Sleazy" [...] and [...] "Blow" [...] the standout tracks on the album. Will Hermes from Rolling Stone noted that Kesha's main pop competitor was Lady Gaga writing, [...] "This EP proves Kesha would kick Gaga's ass in a freestyle battle" [...] praising her rhyming and production by Dr. Luke calling Kesha the [...] "snap queen of clubland." [...] Chad Grischow from IGN met the album with a positive review, giving the album a score of 6.5 out of 10. Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of Auto-Tune writing that there was [...] "so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> sung by a spunky robot". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads [...] "The Harold Song" [...] and [...] "C U Next Tuesday" [...] in the album's review. Grischow ended his review writing, [...] "Cannibal proves to be too mired in mindless lyrics and excessive vocal effects to have any lasting appeal." ...|$|E

He wrote that the relationship of Caroline and Johnson fulfilled the [...] "adage that [...] "behind every good man is a good woman", since he depends on Caroline to fulfill the role of executing his directives {{as well as providing}} comfort and support for the man in charge, himself". He added that [...] "while Johnson warns his listeners jokingly that 'pretty as a postcard' Caroline is off limits because 'She's married.
