40|$|The <b>medical</b> <b>librarian</b> of 1967 {{lives in}} a period of {{changing}} concepts, dramatic new methods, everwidening scientific horizons. In looking toward the immediate past he may think of the <b>medical</b> <b>librarian</b> of thirty years ago as a complacent follower of accepted procedures, not as a pioneer in a brave new world. Yet the corps of trained medical librarians today and the resources of our collections and their management are dependent upon the efforts of those who were then pioneers in medical librarianship. Training, standards, recruitment, literature control, international relations, all had continuing attention at a time when financial assistance through government funds, support by administrators, concern by scientists was almost nonexistent. In these years the day of the devoted amateur passed; the trained <b>medical</b> <b>librarian</b> came into being and matured. This, the first Janet Doe Lecture, is named for one who illustrates the best in medical librarianship, serving with scholarly distinction.

40|$|Objective – Evidence based {{library and}} {{information}} services help to link best evidence with {{decision making in}} library practice. Current library and information science practice operates in both a knowledge and evidence‐based environment. Health service librarians provide information services in an evidence based health care context to improve patient care. But the evidence based practice movement has influenced many fields of human knowledge, including librarianship. Therefore, this study seeks {{to answer the following}} questions: 1) What are the perceptions of Iranian <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> regarding the use of an evidence based approach in their decision making processes? 2) Do Iranian <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> apply an evidence based approach in their professional work? 3) How do Iranian <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> practice an evidence based approach? 4) What are the barriers and limitations for Iranian <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> who engage in evidence based library and information practice (EBLIP) ? Methods – This study utilized a survey to discover medical librarians’ attitudes and perceptions towards the use of an evidence based approach to library practice in Iran. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire to identify medical librarians’ attitudes toward EBLIP. Results – The findings of the study indicate that Iranian <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> are aware of EBLIP and that they utilize an evidence based approach towards their LIS work. They practice the five steps of an evidence based answering cycle in formulating, locating, assessing, applying, and redefining questions. However, they have less knowledge about levels of evidence, research methodologies, and critical appraisal. Conclusions – <b>Medical</b> <b>librarians</b> in Iran are familiar with the concept of an evidence based approach. More training is needed in some elements of evidence based practice to improve their approach to evidence based library and information practice...|$|R

40|$|Academic <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> {{responsible}} for monograph acquisition face a challenging task. From {{the plethora of}} medical monographs published each year, academic <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> must select those most useful to their patrons. Unfortunately, none of the selection tools available to <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> are specifically intended to assist academic <b>librarians</b> with <b>medical</b> monograph selection.

As these are the only selection tools available, however, many academic <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> spend considerable time reviewing these collection lists and place heavy emphasis on the acquisition of listed books. The study reported here was initiated to determine whether the circulation of listed books in an academic library justified the emphasis placed on the acquisition of these books. Circulation statistics for “listed” and “nonlisted” books in the hematology (WH) section of Indiana University School of Medicine's Ruth Lilly Medical Library were studied. The average circulation figures for listed books were nearly two times as high as the corresponding figures for the WH books in general.

40|$|Since ancient times, {{libraries}} constitute site {{of knowledge}} and place where everybody can find the required information but, at the same time, be educated in order to acquire information literacy. The <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> following the developments in health sciences and in adults’ education get continuously into roles that result from their conditions of work and make the systematic education essential. In order to cope with their role they owe to combine knowledge, skills and attitudes so much concerning their job what concerning the training of adult scientists. The subject, therefore, {{of the present study}} is the research of training needs of <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> of Greece. It is more specifically researched on one side: (1) The way that the educational needs of <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> are shaped according to the subject specialisation, the training programs that have participated in and the informative needs of library’s users and on the other side, (2) the opinions of <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> for the necessity of subject specialisation of their work, but also for their ability to instruct the users of medical libraries. Objective of this study (target group) are the librarians of health sciences of Greece. The study is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative approach. Questionnaires were sent to all <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> and interviews were taken place in order to study their opinions deeply. The results of the study showed that the Greek <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> have specific educational needs that are also detected by them. These educational needs concern in the continuing education in their job, in the subject specialisation and in the acquisition of the ability to instruct adult users. At the same time, the <b>medical</b> <b>librarians</b> prefer distance learning as main training method (on-line courses, workshops). The most important motive for their educational training is the increase {{of knowledge and}} skills, while the cost of the courses is the major disincentive. Even though, they consider continuing education important they haven’t participated in any educational course concerning their job because they are not provided such by any institution. The medical librarians– impelled by the developments- train informally the users of the library, but, at the same time, declare that they need further education in teaching techniques and learning theories for the constitution of a line of a more effective training. ...|$|R
