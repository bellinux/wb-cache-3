Around busy airspace {{there is often a}} regulatory requirement that all aircraft be equipped with altitude-reporting <b>mode</b> <b>C</b> or mode S transponders. In the United States, this is known as a <b>Mode</b> <b>C</b> veil. Mode S transponders are compatible with transmitting the <b>mode</b> <b>C</b> signal, and have the capability to report in 25 foot increments. Without the pressure altitude reporting, the air traffic controller has no display of accurate altitude information, and must rely on the altitude reported by the pilot via radio.

A metallic titanium target was reactively sputtered {{in a mixture}} of argon and oxygen. The influence of smooth d. c. and pulsed d. c. discharge power on films thickness, crystallinity, surface morphology, photocatalytic activity (methylene blue degradation) and hydrophilic activity were studied. At pulsed d. c. sputtering, plasma generator has been used to provide the asymmetric pulsed d. c. bias of the target at 100 kHz and pulsed off-time 4016 ns. The structures of the films at 100 nm and 300 nm thick showed nano-grain size structure. The pulsed d. <b>c.</b> <b>mode</b> deposition exhibited a considerably lower surface roughness, but higher grain size compared to the films deposited with the smooth d. <b>c.</b> <b>mode.</b> At film thickness about 300 nm, the XRD peaks indicated that the dominant structure was anatase for which the preferred orientation was in (101) plane. It did not show any definite change of phase between the films deposited in the smooth d. <b>c.</b> <b>mode</b> and the film deposited in the pulse d. <b>c.</b> <b>mode.</b> For the photocatalytic activity, it was clearly seen that the films deposited by smooth d. <b>c.</b> <b>mode</b> showed a higher photocatalytic activity.
