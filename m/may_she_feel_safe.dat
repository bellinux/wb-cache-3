Through her skills she learned in Kaer Morhen she impresses the group, which ask her to choose a new name for her. She responds in the Old Speech, choosing the dreaded name of Falka. The book also expands on Ciri's prophecy as the bearer of Elder Blood, where it is revealed that she holds great power and her son will herald the new age, followed by the destruction of the old.|$|R
5000|$|Medea has an odd personality. Medea is a vindictive, selfish {{girl who}} resents her siblings, and sees them as having {{more of her}} parents' love then herself. She is dark, cold-hearted and mysterious. She is mainly quiet but is {{intelligent}} and [...] She is detached from everyone, and feels no compassion for anyone or anything. She has no friends and never wishes to socialise with her family. She prefers to spend her time locked in her tower room where <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>safest.</b> When <b>she</b> does join her family she is locked in a deep and brooding silence. She blames her family for her loneliness. She has great trouble communicating her needs and her feelings. She chooses to become evil rather than good as those with magical ability inherited from the Old Ones must make that choice.

50|$|Scholes {{was also}} {{interested}} in the naïve art created by a people with mental disturbance or trauma, and its similarities with prehistoric art (he studied case histories as a student in Melbourne). That is why Ruby fills notebooks with her own drawing. She is much younger than Henry, {{and she has been}} traumatised as a child. She has created her own cosmology, based on fear and observation of the natural world. <b>She</b> <b>feels</b> <b>safe</b> only in the day. When Henry and Gem go off trapping for days on end, she is alone with her fears in the hut. She identifies the colour white with the sun, warmth and light; that is why she uses flour to make her face white. By this stage in the movie we are fully aware of Ruby’s mental instability and her terror of the dark. That is why her journey is so remarkable: to be out after dark requires a supreme act of will.|$|R

Nor did <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> until <b>she</b> had set a mile or two of by-road between herself and the marketplace, and had crept into a copse, like a hunted animal, to hide and recover breath. Not until then for the first time did she venture to recall how she had looked over her shoulder before turning out of the town, and had seen the sign of the White Lion hanging across the road, and the fluttering market booths, and the old grey church, and the little crowd gazing after her but not attempting to follow her.|$|R

The two {{eventually}} declare their love for each other prior to a car accident in her limousine while being chased by paparazzi. Though both recover, Blair suffers a miscarriage from the crash. After the crash Blair decides that she must commit herself to Louis, converting to Catholicism and cutting off any connection with Chuck. At the wedding, Gossip Girl releases a recording of Blair confessing her love for Chuck. Nevertheless, Louis and Blair get married, making Blair a Princess of Monaco, though Louis informs her that they will have a loveless marriage of convenience.

30|$|Based on survey responses, {{there are}} several {{important}} trends to consider for the deployment of mobile/Internet-based interventions or communication methods with displaced women and girls. Most often shared or borrowed phones are owned by parents or intimate partners. If service providers are considering ICT channels for engagement with female beneficiaries, this has {{a significant impact on}} the types of services that can be safely offered and safe communication methods via mobile or the Internet. For example, in considering phone-based services, service providers can and should ask women and girls about the way that they would like to receive the service. The service provider should ask the women and/or girls about the time that she would like to have a call, e.g., if she prefers to call rather than receiving a call or if she would prefer to send a missed call to the service provider when <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>safe.</b> Further, applications that facilitate a user accessing online GBV counseling need to be weighed against the likelihood of an intimate partner accessing this information, which could result in an increased risk of harm.|$|R

The only person that Hitoha trusts is Yuumurasaki; because other courtesans yell at her all the time and scare her. Yukari met Hitoha for the first time when he blacked out and entered Yuumurasaki’s body. He felt bad for the girl and helped cheer her up when se was scolded by the other ladies in Yoshiwara. Then, Yukari met a fellow fan that he believes is the reincarnated soul of Hitoha. His fan is extremely shy just like Hitoha and she told him that <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>safe</b> with him. Apparently his fan also has some vivid memories from her past life as Hitoha. She also confined in Yukari and told him that she felt that her parents were trying to kill her.

The more blissful the hours just spent, the greater the desolation when they are over. Of such is the nature of love, as he was now discerning. The longing to have her always with him was growing fast. Since her husband knew--why wait? There would be no rest for either of them in an existence of meetings and partings like this, with the menace of that fellow. She must come away with him at once--abroad--until things had declared themselves; and then he must find a place where they could live and <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> and happy. He must show he was in dead earnest, set his affairs in order. And he thought: 'No good doing things by halves. Mother must know. The sooner the better. Get it over--at once!' And, with a grimace of discomfort, he set out for his aunt's house in Cadogan Gardens, where his mother always stayed when she was in town.|$|R

She treasures her friendship with [...] "Mitty" [...] (Shizuku), and gets depressed whenever Shizuku turns down her interactions with her. She develops a crush on Mitchan because he often comforts her. She recalls that in her second year in middle school, she had turned down the boys' confessions 42 times in 5 days and was thus hated by her female classmates for stealing their crushes. <b>She</b> <b>feels</b> <b>safe</b> around Haru because he has Shizuku, and around Sasayan because he doesn't fawn over her like the other boys. After Mitchan turns down her initial confession, Asako vows to keep trying to win his heart, until Mitchan turns her down for good. She later spends more time talking with Sasayan but is bothered by his candid observations of her behavior and when he later mentions that he has grown to like her too.|$|R

Therefore it is good for this poor, sinful woman, that she hath an infant immortality, a being capable of eternal joy or sorrow, confided to her care--to be trained up by her to righteousness, to remind her, at every moment, of her fall, but yet to teach her, as if it were by the Creator's sacred pledge, that, if she bring the child to heaven, the child also will bring its parents thither!

It begins with a soft piano sound and then changes into a high-energy electro song. The composition is in a sing-along style, with Gaga belting out [...] "I don't want be alone forever, but I can be tonight" [...] during the chorus, talking about navigating an unknown road based only on her instincts. The lyrics also talk about falling in love while being true to oneself, which was the initial inspiration for the track.

He would not only boast of it to all that vulgar comradehood of his, but it might get into those terrible papers which published the society scandals. There would be no way but to appeal to his pity, his generosity. She fancied herself writing to him, but he could show her note, and she must send for him to come and see her, and try to put him on his honor. Or, that would not do, either. She must make it happen that they should be thrown together, and then speak to him. Even that might make him think she was afraid of him; or he might take it wrong, and believe that she cared for him. He had really been very good to Alan, and <b>she</b> tried to <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> in the thought of that. <b>She</b> did <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> for a moment; but if she had meant nothing but to make him believe her grateful, what must he infer from her talking to him in the light way she did about forgiving him for not coming back to dance with her.
