50|$|A bench hook is a {{workbench}} accessory used in woodworking, and {{its purpose}} {{is to provide a}} stop against which the piece of wood being worked can be firmly held, without having to use the vice, thus saving time. It makes handsawing safer and more accurate. This simple appliance (three sticks of wood) uses the force of the tool and gravity to hold the workpiece and helps guide the tool blade to keep the cuts right on the line. It also allows one to perform with ease (and safety) those cuts that would be terrifying on a power saw and which should be carefully avoided. The bench hook is simply a short wooden board with a batten fixed along the top edge (the stop), with another one—called the hook—astened underneath the bottom at the opposite end (see diagram to the right). The correct practice is to have the stop shorter than the width of base and offset from one edge, thus allowing the saw to complete the cut without scarring the workbench surface. Left handers are obviously obliged to set the stop in reverse. In use the bench hook is laid flat over the bench, with the hook hard up against the front edge of same. With the workpiece thus firmly held against the stop, is easy to see that no clamps or other <b>mechanical</b> <b>fixing</b> are required, the wood being held in place by the combined pressure of the tool (a saw generally) and the hand. Bench hooks are meant to be an aid commonly used with hand tools, such as the backsaw, a hand plane and, somewhat less frequently, a chisel of some kind. Although very simple to make, commercially made bench hooks have become increasingly available.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{manufacturing}} concept {{on the basis}} of the LIGA-technology for the production of hybrid integrated micro-optical modules was developed. For monomode applications an alignment accuracy of #+-# 1 #mu#m is necessary, which is guaranteed so far by a complex active alignment procedure of the micro-optical components. With the new concept the active and passive optical components are aligned passively, which simplifies the assembling, whereby the manufacturing costs will be reduced. The advantage of the passive assembly by means of highly precise LIGA structures was proven within this work by the realization and characterization of a heterodyne receiver (coherent receiver). The passive alignment of the active and passive micro-optical components is done by means of resist structures of PMMA, which are manufactured on a ceramic substrate by X-ray lithography. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>fixing</b> takes place with UV-curable adhesive and the electrical contracting of the active components with conductive epoxy resin, which is hardened at 70 C.

We formulate different kernels for comparing these context vectors and use kernel classifiers, e. g. rank classifiers, to determine the right match.

40|$|Thermal {{absorbers}} {{and their}} integration methods {{are critical to}} solar photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) modules. These two elements directly influence the cooling effort of PV layers and as a result, the related electrical/thermal/overall efficiency. This paper conducts a critical review on the essential thermal absorbers and their integration methods for the currently-available PV modules {{for the purpose of}} producing the combined PV/T modules. A brief overview of different PV/T technologies is initially summarized, including aspects of their structure, efficiencies, thermal governing expressions and their applications. Seven different types of thermal absorbers and four corresponding integration methods are subsequently discussed and summarized in terms of their advantages/disadvantages and the associated application for various PV/T modules. Compared to traditional thermal absorbers, such as sheet-and-tube structure, rectangular tunnel with or without fins/grooves and flat-plate tube, these four types, i. e. micro-channel heat pipe array/heat mat, extruded heat exchanger, roll-bond heat exchanger and cotton wick structure, are promising due to the significant enhancement in terms of efficiency, structure, weight, and cost etc. The appropriate or suitable integration method varies in different cases, i. e. the ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) based lamination method seems the best option for integration of PV layer with thermal absorber when compared with other conventional methods, such as direct contact, thermal adhesive and <b>mechanical</b> <b>fixing.</b> Finally, suggestions for further research topics are proposed from five aspects. The overall research results would provide useful information for the assistance of further development of solar PV/T modules with high feasibility for widespread application in energy supply even at district or city-level in the near future...|$|E

There are also different types of substrates (masonry walls [made from units of clay, concrete, calcium silicate, autoclaved aerated concrete or stone]; in situ or prefabricated concrete walls; wood structures.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results in the research of the load-carrying ability of reinforced-concrete nonpressure pipes with inner lining intended to protect concrete against corrosion. The lining (covers) are mounted as a stay-in-place formwork when manufacturing the pipes. The covers are made of 3 - 5 mm thick polyethylene sheets. To be fixed in the pipe wall concrete, the linings are provided with special anchoring elements. Two lining types are considered: 1 – with anchoring elements {{in the form of}} solid longitudinal ribs; 2 – with anchoring elements distributed equidistantly over the shell surface (≈ 400 pcs/m 2). The research has been performed by numerical simulation using a three-dimentional finite element model. The load was applied according to a three-linear pattern used to test pipes for strength (including that specified in ЕN 1916). The computation was performed by the iteration method taking into account physical non-linearity of concrete. The computation makes allowance for formation and opening of cracks in the longitudinal pipe wall sections. The examples of computation of a pipe with the diameter of 2, 000 mm and wall thickness of 150 mm reinforced with two cylindrical cages and a pipe with the diameter of 1, 000 mm and wall thickness of 110 mm reinforced with a single cylindrical cage are given. It has been determined that the load-carrying ability of pipes with type 1 protective linings is lower than that of pipes with type 2 linings. Maximum (up to 25 %) reduction of the load-carrying ability is observed in pipes reinforced with a single cylindrical cage. In pipes of this type, cracks are formed at lower loads. The load-carrying ability of pipes is reduced due to entering of anchoring ribs of the protective shell into the compression zone of the pipe wall concrete in the sections located {{at the level of the}} horizontal diameter. The results of the numerical computation are in good agreement with those obtained when testing full-scale specimens of pipes with specified technical parameters. To protect interior faces of reinforced-concrete non-pressure pipes, it is recommended to use lining covers with V-type discrete anchoring members ensuring reliable <b>mechanical</b> <b>fixing</b> of the linings in the pipe wall concrete. This type of anchoring elements causes almost no effect upon the load-carrying ability of pipes...|$|E

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{method of}} surgical repair of fractured bones would incorporate recent and future {{advances in the}} art of composite materials. The composite materials used in this method would be biocompatible and at least partly bioabsorbable: that is, during the healing process following surgery, they would be wholly or at least partly absorbed into the bones and other tissues in which they were implanted. Relative to the traditional method, the proposed method would involve less surgery, pose less of a risk of infection, provide for better transfer of loads across fracture sites, and thereby promote better healing while reducing the need for immobilization by casts and other external devices. One requirement that both the traditional and proposed methods must satisfy is to fix the multiple segments of a broken bone in the correct relative positions. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>fixing</b> techniques used in the traditional method include the use of plates spanning the fracture site and secured to the bone by screws, serving of wire along the bone across the fracture site, insertion of metallic intramedullary rods through the hollow portion of the fractured bone, and/or inserting transverse rods through the bone, muscle, and skin to stabilize the fractured members. After the bone heals, a second surgical operation is needed to remove the mechanical fixture(s). In the proposed method, there would be no need for a second surgical operation. The proposed method is based partly on the observation that in the fabrication of a structural member, it is generally more efficient and reliable to use multiple small fasteners to transfer load across a joint than to use a single or smaller number of larger fasteners, provided that the stress fields of neighboring small fasteners do not overlap or interact. Also, multiple smaller fasteners are more reliable than are larger and fewer fasteners. However, there is a trade-off between structural efficiency and the cost of insertion time and materials. The proposed method is further based partly on the conjecture that through-the-thickness reinforcements could be excellent for fixing bone segments for surgical repair. The through-the-thickness reinforcements would superficially resemble nails in both form and function. Denoted small-diameter rods (SDRs) to distinguish them from other narrow rods, these reinforcements would be shot or otherwise inserted through adjacent segments of fractured bone to fix them in their correct relative positions (see figure). Shot insertion would be effected by use an applicator that would amount to a miniaturized and highly refined version of the pneumatic guns often used in carpentry to drive nails and brads. The applicator, envisioned to be {{about the size of a}} ball-point-pen, would be driven by pressurized carbon dioxide. To further promote stabilization of the segments, layers of bone glue could be applied to the fracture surfaces prior to insertion of the SDRs. The bone glue could be therapeutically loaded with chemicals to promote growth of bone and fight infectio...|$|E
