5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that {{while there is a}} lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
25|$|For 60 days, my {{body was}} used as a {{thoroughfare}} for all the hoodlums, militia men and soldiers in the district... Those men completely destroyed me; they caused me so much pain. They raped me in front of my six children... Three years ago, I discovered I had HIV/AIDS. There {{is no doubt in my}} <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was infected during these rapes.|$|E
500|$|... "The Unnatural" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the series that Duchovny wrote by himself. He had {{previously}} co-developed the stories for the second season episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "Anasazi" [...] - both with series creator Chris Carter, and received teleplay credits for the third season episodes [...] "Avatar" [...] and [...] "Talitha Cumi". As The X-Files entered its sixth season, Duchovny {{decided that it was}} an appropriate time to try writing a full episode. Before then, he had felt {{that he did not have}} the skills necessary; he said, [...] "I didn't have the surety, the confidence in my <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could write a teleplay...It took me to the sixth year of the show to actually sit down and write one of my ideas." [...] In late 1998, Duchovny met with series creator Carter and they agreed that Duchovny would write a late-season installment for the series.|$|E

It is positively ridiculous the way they seem to do nothing in the way of proper investigation, but only make up their <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have killed my cousin. Why! they don't even seem to trouble about the weapon with which the murder was committed." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and released {{as the third}} single from Like a Prayer (1989). The song is built around the themes of love and relationships, with William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet one of its major inspirations. Madonna was reading Romeo and Juliet during the breaks during rehearsals for Speed the Plow, a Broadway show {{in which she was}} starring in 1988. On the third day of the Like a Prayer recording sessions, she presented Leonard with the lyrics of [...] "Cherish", and explained that she had written the song [...] "one sunny afternoon by the beach", but later confessed that it was actually written in her make-up room. [...] "I wrote it in a superhyper-positive state of <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew was not going to last", the singer recalled. Leonard introduced one line from the similar titled song by the 1960s band The Association, [...] "Cherish is the word I use", after which Madonna decided to include it on Like a Prayer. The B-side of the single release of [...] "Cherish" [...] was a previously unreleased track called [...] "Supernatural", initially composed during the recording sessions of her third studio album, True Blue and later completed in 1989. In 2009, during an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna confessed that she {{had never been able to}} predict if her songs would be successful, irrespective of her personal opinion of them. As an example, she cited [...] "Cherish" [...] as one of the most [...] "retarded" [...] songs she had written, but noted it became a commercial success. The song was also included on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and the two-disc edition of her 2009 compilation Celebration.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was under}} no {{illusion}} {{that it was}} going to be [...] a financial catastrophe—to say the least—this year. That was not even remotely in my <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to walk in there and make any money this year.|$|E

60|$|This has {{not been}} done solely for my own gratification. I confess to a very strong feeling of curiosity as to the mental {{experience}} on this point of other field naturalists; and as these, or some of them, may have the same wish to look into their neighbours' <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have, {{it may be that}} the example given here will be followed.|$|R
6000|$|Aye, and I'll say {{it with my}} dying breath, {{though you}} may send me to the {{guillotine}} ... as you probably will, for you are all thieves and murderers, every one of you, and you have already made up your <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> and my man are guilty of having sheltered that accursed Englishman whom they call the Scarlet Pimpernel ... and of having helped him to escape.|$|R

2500|$|Cigarette smoke plays a {{large role}} in the {{characterization}} of Syrian protesters. “Syria’s disenfranchised Bouazizis are the greatest population of this revolution. Incidentally, {{a lot of them are}} also four-pack-a-day smokers.” Prominent activist bloggers advertise their smoking habits. A young Bouazizi from the city of Binnish said in July 2011, “I was lost for 12 hours in the mountains. Never <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had no food or water — my agony was, I had no cigarettes!” ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, Roh {{reconciled}} with Kim when he endorsed his candidacy in the 1997 Presidential election. At the meeting, Kim Dae-jung welcomed Roh {{and his party}} saying [...] "Today is a very pleasant day. That pleasure is not only because we now work together, but also because I could relieve a burden in my <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been carrying (since we separated)."

2500|$|Referring to {{widespread}} doubt that Labor {{could win the}} 2007 election under a leader who had already lost two elections, Beazley said: [...] "There's {{no doubt in my}} <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can lead a winning team in the next election. The road to the prime ministership of this nation is a long and hard road. It's not an easy one. And there are many twists and turns on that road.

2500|$|Elliott, later {{speaking}} about the session, said [...] "The technique I used on this man was {{to get him to}} completely relax. I got him started counting by ones, twos, threes, etc., to a hundred and then backwards. I had established in his <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was his friend. He knew he was in very serious trouble and he knew he was innocent. When he went under, he was counting by threes backward. He was completely relaxed. The critical stage is the next state when you say the subject is cataleptic. The longer you keep them in the state of catalepsy, the deeper they sink into the third state. I kept him ten minutes in this state of catalepsy. He {{was in a state of}} extreme exhaustion. Sweat was on his face. Observing that even Bill [...] was still somewhat skeptical of hypnosis, whether or not the man was truly hypnotized or faking, I resorted to a fail safe demonstration. Through suggestion, I removed all feeling, reflex actions, etc., from the subject's right arm and stuck a burning cigarette to his arm--absolutely no reaction. Bill was thoroughly convinced." ...|$|E
2500|$|And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; {{the same}} is Hebron {{in the land of}} Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 4 I am a {{stranger}} and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself {{to the people of the}} land, even to the children of Heth. 8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. 10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. [...] 16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: {{the same is}} Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.|$|E
