50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{and computer}} engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and {{are increasingly being}} incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from magneto in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact breaker (points), and these were increasingly superseded by Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel <b>magneto</b> <b>system</b> with contact breakers to similar flywheel driven solid-state systems {{at about the same}} time.|$|E

25|$|Many {{small town}} <b>magneto</b> <b>systems</b> {{featured}} party lines, anywhere {{from two to}} ten or more subscribers sharing a single line.

25|$|With the {{universal}} adoption of electrical starting for automobiles, {{and the availability}} of a large battery to provide a constant source of electricity, <b>magneto</b> <b>systems</b> were abandoned for systems which interrupted current at battery voltage, using an ignition coil to step the voltage up {{to the needs of the}} ignition, and a distributor to route the ensuing pulse to the correct spark plug at the correct time.|$|R

50|$|Magnetos {{adapted to}} produce impulses of high voltage for spark plugs {{are used in}} the {{ignition}} systems of spark-ignition piston engines. Magnetos are used in piston aircraft engines for their reliability and simplicity, often in pairs. Motor sport vehicles such as motorcycles and snowmobiles may use magnetos because they are lighter in weight than an ignition system relying on a battery. Small internal combustion engines used for lawn mowers, chain saws, portable pumps and similar applications use magnetos for economy and weight reduction. Magnetos are not used in highway motor vehicles which have a cranking battery and which may require more control over ignition timing than is possible with a <b>magneto</b> <b>system</b> although sophisticated solid state controllers are becoming more prevalent.|$|E
5000|$|The upgrade {{program began}} in 1949 and was {{completed}} by 1951. The project began with heavy line reconstruction in 1949-50. Next was the move to a new, more spacious location. The Thedford Legion Hall site was purchased and a new building was erected with final completion in 1951. During this time, the telephone system in Rockwood was purchased {{as part of the}} general area upgrade. Finally, when the new office was complete workers could be found stringing countless strands of wires into a distribution frame, connecting them up with a shining, brand-new central switchboard. The newspaper headline boldly declared: “Hurontario Telephones Becoming Modernized.”. Office Manager Roy Elliot said the old harmonic-type <b>magneto</b> <b>system</b> first installed in 1909 was being replaced by the common battery system. [...] The conversion scheme would entirely eliminate the need for hand-cranking rural telephones to gain the attention of the operator or another party on the same line.|$|E
50|$|The Blindicide {{was also}} {{produced}} in a 100 mm version (the RL-100). The 83mm version fired a 1.6 kilogram projectile with a 0.5 kg warhead, while the 100 mm version fired a 2.75 kg projectile. The {{rate of fire}} was six rounds per minute and the range 400 meters for both versions. This rate of fire was considerably {{in excess of the}} M20A1 Bazooka since Blindicide used a mechanical firing pin hitting a percussion cap in the tail of the rocket motor rather than a hand grip <b>magneto</b> <b>system</b> that required trailing wires from each rocket to be connected to terminal posts on the launcher as each round was loaded. The muzzle velocity of both versions varied, with the 83 mm version firing at 100 m/s while the 100 mm version fired at 195 m/s. A later round introduced for the RL-83 has a muzzle velocity of 120 m/s and uses a rocket booster to achieve a velocity of 300 m/s. The effective range of this 2.4 kg projectile is 500 meters.|$|E
50|$|A {{distributor}} is {{an enclosed}} rotating shaft used in spark-ignition internal combustion engines that have mechanically-timed ignition. The distributor's main {{function is to}} route secondary, or high voltage, current from the ignition coil to the spark plugs in the correct firing order, and for the correct amount of time. Except in <b>magneto</b> <b>systems,</b> the distributor also houses a mechanical or inductive breaker switch to open and close the ignition coil's primary circuit.|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, magneto-equipped aircraft engines have typically been dual-plugged, whereby each cylinder has two spark plugs, with each plug having a separate <b>magneto</b> <b>system.</b> Dual plugs provide both redundancy should a magneto fail, and better engine performance (through enhanced combustion). Twin sparks provide two flame fronts within the cylinder, these two flame fronts decreasing the time needed for the fuel charge to burn, thereby burning more of the fuel at a lower temperature and pressure [...] As the pressure within a cylinder increases, the temperature rises; {{and if there is}} only a single plug, the unburnt fuel away from the original flame front can self-ignite, producing a separate unsynchronized flame front. This leads to a rapid rise in cylinder pressure, producing engine [...] "knock". Higher octane fuel delays the time required for auto-ignition at a given temperature and pressure, reducing knock; so by burning the fuel charge faster, two flame fronts can decrease an engine's octane requirement. As the size of the combustion chamber determines the time to burn the fuel charge, dual ignition was especially important for the large-bore aircraft engines around World War II.|$|E
25|$|Single-cylinder engines were reintroduced in 1925 as 1926 models.

50|$|Many modern <b>magneto</b> <b>systems</b> (except {{for small}} engines) have removed the second (high voltage) coil from the magneto itself {{and placed it}} in an {{external}} coil assembly similar to the ignition coil described below.

50|$|In the 1930s, {{telephone}} {{sets were}} developed that combined the bell and induction coil with the desk set, obviating a separate ringer box. The rotary dial becoming commonplace in the 1930s {{in many areas}} enabled customer-dialed service, but some <b>magneto</b> <b>systems</b> remained even into the 1960s. After World-War II, the telephone networks saw rapid expansion and more efficient telephone sets, such as the model 500 telephone in the United States, were developed that permitted larger local networks centered around central offices. A breakthrough new technology was the introduction of Touch-Tone signaling using push-button telephones by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1963.|$|R
25|$|Rural areas, {{as well as}} the {{smallest}} towns, had manual service and signaling was accomplished with magneto telephones, which had a crank for the signaling generator. To alert the operator, or another subscriber on the same line, the subscriber turned the crank to generate ringing current. The switchboard responded by interrupting the circuit, which dropped a metal tab above the subscriber's line jack and sounded a buzzer. Dry cell batteries, normally two large N°. 6 cells in the subscriber's telephone, provided the direct current for the transmitter. Such <b>magneto</b> <b>systems</b> were in use in the US as late as 1983, as in the small town, Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine.|$|R

2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{spark ignition}} is that using a magneto. The engine spins a magnet inside a coil, or, {{in the earlier}} designs, a coil inside a fixed magnet, and also operates a contact breaker, interrupting the current and causing the voltage to be increased sufficiently to jump a small gap. The spark plugs are connected directly from the magneto output. Early magnetos had one coil, with the contact breaker (sparking plug) inside the combustion chamber. In about 1902, Bosch introduced a double-coil magneto, with a fixed sparking plug, and the contact breaker outside the cylinder. Magnetos are not used in modern cars, but because they generate their own electricity they are often found on small engines such as those found in mopeds, lawnmowers, snowblowers, chainsaws, etc. where a battery-based electrical system is not present for any combination of necessity, weight, cost, and reliability reasons. [...] They are also used on piston-engined aircraft engines. [...] Although an electrical supply is available, <b>magneto</b> <b>systems</b> are used mainly because of their higher reliability.|$|R

5000|$|Such {{systems are}} used for many {{internal}} combustion engines in other applications.
