5|$|The final {{catalyst}} {{for the expansion of}} the investigation was the Seattle General Strike, which began the day before the Senate passed Resolution 439. This confluence of events led <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> believe that the alleged German-Bolshevist link and Bolshevist threat to the United States were real.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E

5|$|In taking office, Morales {{emphasized}} nationalism, anti-imperialism, and anti-neoliberalism, although did {{not initially}} refer to his administration as socialist. In what was widely termed a populist act, he immediately reduced both his own presidential wage {{and that of}} his ministers by 57% to $1,875 a month, also urging <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> do the same. Morales gathered together a largely inexperienced cabinet made up of indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals, although over {{the first three years of}} government there was a rapid turnover in the cabinet as Morales replaced many of the indigenous members with trained middle-class leftist politicians. By 2012 only 3 of the 20 cabinet members identified as indigenous.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} on June 20, the State House was mobbed {{by as many}} as 400 {{soldiers}} demanding payment. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Alexander Hamilton, then a delegate from New York, persuaded the soldiers to allow Congress to meet later to address their concerns. The soldiers did allow the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> peacefully adjourn that afternoon. That evening, a small Congressional committee, headed by Hamilton, met in secret to draft a message to the Pennsylvania Council, asking them to protect Congress from the mutineers. The letter threatened that Congress would be forced to move elsewhere if the Council did not act.|$|E

25|$|For the 2000 and 2002 {{election}} cycles, {{she held}} the distinction of contributing the most among <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> other congressional campaigns, in part because {{she is in a}} safe district and does not need the campaign funds.|$|E
25|$|The {{franking}} privilege allows <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> send official mail to constituents at government expense. Though {{they are}} not permitted to send election materials, borderline material is often sent, especially in the run-up to an election by those in close races. Indeed, some academics consider free mailings as giving incumbents a big advantage over challengers.|$|E
25|$|The march {{failed to}} start on time because its leaders were meeting with <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> <b>To</b> the leaders' surprise, the {{assembled}} group began to march from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial without them.

25|$|President Franklin D. Roosevelt used Lawton {{to build}} support Fair Labor Standards Act in the United States Congress. Roosevelt {{instructed}} {{him to go to}} a hotel room, where Roosevelt would send various <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> visit.

25|$|The {{following}} month, {{however, the}} city commissioners again approached <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> {{find a way}} to have the appraisal ruling overturned. More alarming to cemetery lotholders was a new city street map, which failed to show the cemetery and instead showed extensive subdivisions on the cemetery property. In May, the city went even further and published a street extension map showing an extension of Albany Street NW through {{the northern part of the}} burial ground.|$|E

25|$|Rogers {{was one of}} {{the first}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> speak out against Adolf Hitler's {{treatment}} of Jews. The expulsion of Jews from Germany without proper papers caused a refugee crisis in 1938, and after the Evian Conference failed to lift immigration quotas in the 38 participating nations, Edith Rogers co-sponsored the Wagner-Rogers Bill with Senator Robert F. Wagner. Introduced to the Senate on February 9, 1939 and to the House on February 14, it would have allowed 20,000 German Jewish refugees under the age of 14 to settle in the United States.|$|E
25|$|After his conviction, Kamber {{worked as}} a {{lobbyist}} for the Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) of the AFL-CIO. Under Robert Georgine, also a Republican, Kamber rose quickly to become the department's chief lobbyist. Kamber's tenure at BCTD was marked by a significant drop in {{the political power of}} the AFL-CIO on Capitol Hill. In 1977, Kamber and the BCTD persuaded the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives to rush a common situs picketing bill onto the floor in the hopes of stampeding <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> approve the legislation. Instead, the tactic lead to a major defeat for labor.|$|E
25|$|Important {{structural}} changes included the direct election of senators by popular election {{according to the}} Seventeenth Amendment , ratified in April 8, 1913, with positive effects (senators more sensitive to public opinion) and negative effects (undermining the authority of state governments). Supreme Court decisions based on the Constitution's commerce clause expanded congressional power to regulate the economy. One effect of popular election of senators was to reduce {{the difference between the}} House and Senate in terms of their link to the electorate. Lame duck reforms according to the Twentieth Amendment ended the power of defeated and retiring <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> wield influence despite their lack of accountability.|$|E

25|$|The {{committee}} structure permits <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> study {{a particular}} subject intensely. It is neither expected nor {{possible that a}} member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress. As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects. Committees investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire Congress about choices and trade-offs. The choice of specialty {{may be influenced by}} the member's constituency, important regional issues, prior background and experience. Senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap. Some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation; for example, the House Ways and Means Committee has considerable influence over House affairs.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Justice {{decision}} to not prosecute Presser prompted <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> investigate {{the handling of}} the politically sensitive case. Some congressmen were concerned that Presser's close political ties to the Reagan administration had led to favorable treatment, while others wanted to know why so much time and so many resources had been expended when DOJ had no intention of prosecuting Presser. Additionally, many members of Congress had spent years telling voters that the Teamsters were corrupt, and now voters were demanding an answer as to why Presser was not being called to account. DOJ defended its actions by pointing to Presser's long-time role as a criminal informant, but members of Congress were unhappy that DOJ seemed willing tolerate corruption in the nation's largest labor movement. Senators William V. Roth, Jr. (R-Delaware) and Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) ordered the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) to look into {{the handling of the}} case, and Senator Joe Biden (D-Delaware) asked the Judiciary Committee to probe the matter. The PSI quickly asked the FBI, DOJ and DOL to turn over their files on the Presser probe.|$|E
25|$|When Gandhi was in prison, Patel {{was asked}} by <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> lead the satyagraha in Nagpur in 1923 against a law banning the raising of the Indian flag. He {{organised}} thousands of volunteers {{from all over the}} country to take part in processions of people hoisting the flag. Patel negotiated a settlement obtaining the release of all prisoners and allowing nationalists to hoist the flag in public. Later that year, Patel and his allies uncovered evidence suggesting that the police were in league with local dacoits in the Borsad taluka even as the government prepared to levy a major tax for fighting dacoits in the area. More than 6,000 villagers assembled to hear Patel speak in support of proposed agitation against the tax, which was deemed immoral and unnecessary. He organised hundreds of Congressmen, sent instructions, and received information from across the district. Every village in the taluka resisted payment of the tax, and through cohesion, also prevented the seizure of property and land. After a protracted struggle, the government withdrew the tax. Historians believe that one of Patel's key achievements was the building of cohesion and trust amongst the different castes and communities, which had been divided along socio-economic lines.|$|E
5000|$|THe same year, Hansen {{became the}} first <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> be convicted <b>of</b> violating a 1971 {{campaign}} finance law requiring disclosure of all financial contributions to his campaign.
