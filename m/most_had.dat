5|$|After the Belgian defeat, around 225,000 Belgian {{soldiers}} (around 30 {{percent of}} the total force mobilised in 1940) who had been made prisoners of war in 1940 were sent to prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority of those in captivity (145,000) were Flemish, and 80,000 were Walloons. <b>Most</b> <b>had</b> been reservists, rather than professional soldiers, before the outbreak of war and their detention created a large labour shortage in civilian occupations.|$|E
5|$|Important {{elements}} of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training. He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, {{from all parts of}} society, to get involved in activities that <b>most</b> <b>had</b> never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never matched the development and growth of Scouting.|$|E

5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (<b>most</b> <b>had</b> been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a certain area for a month before leaving, while the war, which <b>most</b> <b>had</b> initially expected to end quickly, had lasted for four years {{by the time the}} pandemic struck. This left little time for the disease to {{have a significant impact on}} the economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} in 1846 was 3,500. Brick buildings included a jail and court house, {{and a large}} barracks had also been built. London had a fire company, a theatre, a large Gothic church, nine other churches or chapels, and two market buildings. In 1844, a fire destroyed 150 buildings but <b>most</b> <b>had</b> been rebuilt by 1846. Connection with other communities was by road; stages ran daily.

5|$|A bailey, {{also called}} a ward, was a {{fortified}} enclosure. It {{was a common}} feature of castles, and <b>most</b> <b>had</b> at least one. The keep {{on top of the}} motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home {{of the rest of the}} lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of high status accommodation shifted from the keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the high status buildings– such as the lord's chambers and the chapel– from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. <b>Most</b> <b>had</b> only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants played well, {{the team}} {{experienced}} financial hardship {{during its first}} year. Player salaries were so low that <b>most</b> <b>had</b> to take additional jobs to support themselves. The team's brief practices, held at 4:30 p. m. each day to accommodate outside-work schedules, enabled little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925 and owner Tim Mara spent $25,000 {{of his own money}} during the season to keep the team going. The financial struggle continued until the 11th game of the season, when the visiting Red Grange and the Chicago Bears drew more than 73,000 fans (a pro-football record) and an additional 20,000 were turned away. This gave the Giants much-needed revenue, possibly altering the team's history. In the 19–7 Bears victory, Grange intercepted a pass intended for Bomar and returned it for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and Episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. <b>Most</b> <b>had</b> a centralised plan {{with two or three}} arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the Baroque extravagance in church building seen on the continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II. The Gothic windows may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the existing common framework of new churches.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th {{century the}} native Welsh princes built {{a number of}} stone castles. The size of these varied {{considerably}} from smaller fortifications, such as Dinas Emrys in Snowdonia, to more substantial castles like Deganwy Castle and the largest, Castell y Bere. Native Welsh castles typically maximised the defensive benefits of high, mountainous sites, often being built in an irregular shape to fit a rocky peak. <b>Most</b> <b>had</b> deep ditches {{cut out of the}} rock to protect the main castle. The Welsh castles were usually built with a relatively short keep, used as living accommodation for princes and nobility, and with distinctive rectangular watch-towers along the walls. In comparison to Norman castles the gatehouses were much weaker in design, with almost no use of portcullises or spiral staircases, and the stonework of the outer walls was also generally inferior to Norman built castles. The very last native Welsh castles, built in the 1260s, more closely resemble Norman designs; in the case of Dinas Brân including a round keep and Norman gatehouse defences.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. <b>Most</b> <b>had</b> no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E

5|$|In February 1931, de Hauteclocque {{went back}} to Saint-Cyr as an instructor, but wanted to return to active service. During the summer break in 1933, he flew south to Africa, where he {{reported}} to Général de brigade Henri Giraud on 11 July. Giraud sent him into the field as a liaison officer with a goum. He was awarded the croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August. The Commander in Chief in Morocco, Général de division Antoine Huré, felt that de Hauteclocque {{should not have been}} there, and held the award up for three years. Others felt differently, and de Hauteclocque was given early admission to the course for promotion to capitaine. He placed fourth in the class, and was promoted on 25 December 1934. Promotion was slow in the inter-war French Army, especially in the cavalry, and he was only the second in his Saint-Cyr class to reach that rank. <b>Most</b> <b>had</b> to wait until 1936. He was also made a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.|$|E
5|$|LucasArts {{released}} a remake with updated audiovisuals titled The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition in July 2009 for iPhone, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox 360 exclusively via digital distribution.

Likewise, Equc1 (Equus caballus allergen 1) is the protein product of a horse Mup gene that {{is found in the}} liver, sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. It is responsible for about 80% of the antibody response in patients who are chronically exposed to horse allergens.|$|E
