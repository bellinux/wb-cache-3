40|$|This article {{examines}} the concept of world unity {{from the time of}} enlightenment to the present age. It asserts that the enlightenment conception is responsible for the perversion of human nature since it elevates human reason over human emotion which has resulted into a narrow understanding {{of the world and the}} belief that science could guarantee peace. The paper debates the concepts of space and place in relation to westernization as a form of universalism. It shows how universalism is linked to space with no respect for diverse cultures according to geographical origins as the case is for localism which is rooted in place. It analyses the United States’ pursuit for <b>market</b> <b>unity,</b> a strategy which is propagated but with the ill intentions of maintaining her international superiority. The <b>market</b> <b>unity</b> project is indeed, an enemy of democracy and a threat to not only cultural diversity, but also to all life on earth. In this paper I therefore suggest that, contrary to the critics, difference and the horizontal structure of the Occupy Wall Street movement is advantageous. The fact that people are organizing in protests in spite of their diverse cultures is, of course, an act of solidarity and unity. By this they demonstrate their belief that a better world is possible and that valuing cultural diversity and difference is a prerequisite for coexistence and peace. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to defend difference and diversity against world unity or totality or sameness...|$|E

40|$|The 2003 {{reforms of}} the Common Agricultural policy of the European Union {{introduced}} decoupled income transfers as the most prominent policy instrument. However, member states were given substantial discretion over the degree and timing of the reform implementation. As a result, different implementation schemes coexist within the EU, keeping {{certain parts of the}} income support coupled to current production levels. This coexistence leads to distortions of production incentives, factor misallocations, and artificial trade flows. Here, we examine these effects in the beef sector where full decoupling was not obligatory for all member states. Based on a cost minimization framework, we derive a sector-specific trade model with heterogeneous firms and quality differences. The model is used {{to examine the effects of}} different implementation schemes on intra-European calf trade. Empirical results confirm that the expected distortions to trade flows occured, violating the fundamental CAP principle of <b>Market</b> <b>Unity...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{trend to}} {{centralise}} the competences in the Spanish State does {{not escape the}} field of environment nor the environmental assessment.

In practice, this entails a reduction in regional powers, an involution of political autonomy and in the decentralization of the Spanish State. The current basic state law 21 / 2013, of December 9, environmental assessment has led the involution. In this paper we analyse the consequences of this legislation in the autonomous powers on theenvironmental impact assessment of projects. For this we have studied the basic rule itself and the regional EIA regulations, focusing in those new aspects of the regional legislation regarding basic legislation. Finally, in conclusion, recommendations and proposals in relation to the experimental question are provided...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the {{historical}} development and the basic features of the CAP in the inauguration period. From the end of 1950 s {{to the middle of}} 1960 s the CAP was in fact created, though its operation came into force from 1 July in 1967. The border adjustment measures such as variable import levies and export refunds became the key institutional instrument of protection. Furthermore, assuming its framework of solid protection, income-orientated price policy was introduced. With this high price policy, the sufficient safeguard system of the Western Continental European agriculture was established. It was none other than the European rescue of agricultural policy. The CAP symbolized the extreme high level of European integration from the viewpoint of the creation of agricultural internal market (<b>market</b> <b>unity)</b> and common pricing mechanism. Thus, the CAP stood for a SACRED Cow of European integration. Due to the first common policy of EEC, agricultural exceptionalism was institutionalized and farmers came to become the objective of policy protection in contrast to the medium-sized and small producers in non-agricultural sector. 欧文抄録: p. 19...|$|E

The European Union (EU) has recognized the importance of incorporating energy security more systematically into foreign policy. It has committed itself to pursuing an energy security policy based on <b>market</b> interdependence, European <b>unity</b> and long-term governance improvements in producer states. In offering the first broad, global assessment of the foreign policy dimensions of EU energy security, this book considers how far these commitments have been implemented. Examining how the EU’s general approach to energy security has played out in the specific political contexts of different countries and regions, distinctive features of the book include: - a thorough analysis of current EU strategies towards energy security, assessing the EU as an international actor - a key focus on the governance structures of producer states including the Middle East; Russia, Central Asia and the Caspian, and Sub-Saharan Africa - a major addition to debates surrounding markets and geopolitics, informing both international relations and international political economy.

40|$|The {{potential}} harm {{to human}} health and the environment of compounds derived from nitrate is an issue that occasionally awakens media and public concern. Recent studies provide a new understanding of the role of nitrate and nitrite in our body and motivate revision of the long-held view that nitrate poses a health risk. Coincidently, national authorities are performing research, surveys and risk assessments to provide scientific support for the regulations laid down in the 1990 s setting limits on nitrate in lettuce and spinach. In addition to the health factor, the economic (<b>market</b> <b>unity)</b> and environmental (agricultural contamination) aspects of the issue are being considered in this legislative work. In order to obtain data of appropriate and comparable quality in this study, a standardised method was needed for analysing nitrate and nitrite in foodstuffs. The standardisation process comprised three stages: a) comparative evaluation of the performance of three liquid chromatography methods; b) internal validation of the selected ion chromatography method; and c) external validation across an international collaborative study. The validated analytical method is now a Nordic and European standard method. The standardised analytical method was then used in a European monitoring programme of nitrate levels in green leafy vegetables. Our participation involved obtaining data on nitrate in Swedish-produced lettuce and spinach over the past ten years (1995 - 2005). The satisfactory levels of nitrate found in Swedish lettuce and spinach are partly explained by the prevention measures taken by Swedish farmers to reduce the content of nitrate in vegetables. These ten years of Swedish data confirm that the European maximum limits are reasonable. Implementation and enforcement of the current regulation are advisable from an environmental point of view...|$|E

Naglasak stavlja na formiranje gradskog magistrata krajem XVII. stoljeća, nakon oslobođenja Slavonije, čime je uvelike određen okvir daljnjeg razvoja Osijeka. Osijek 2 ̆ 7 s legal {{position}} {{was one of}} the key factors {{in the development of the}} city in the Modern Age. It was largely determined with the establishment of the Habsburg reign after Turks had been banished towards the end of the 17 th century. At that time the city magistrate was founded, and the city instruction was passed, assigning Osijek to the category of the Imeprial Chamber 2 ̆ 7 s market towns. The Instruction, or more precisely two instructions, granted a superordinated position of the Chamber authority in all the important segments of Osijek 2 ̆ 7 s social life. This Regulation emerged from the soil of a legal tradition, so that it does not represent an exclusive document which would make Osijek stand out from its political surroundings. The instruction laid down the {{legal position}} of settlements of the western part of Monarchy and of the newly liberated areas. The next important moment in the legal history of Osijek was the foundation of the Upper Town and the Lower Town, which emerged on the basis of the former Osijek suburbs. The Upper Town thus largely inherited the legal tradition of the former Osijek, while the Lower Town followed a somewhat different path. After the establishemnt of the mentioned quarters, and after the establishment of independent city magistrates and their inclusion into the category of the Chamber <b>market</b> towns, the <b>unity</b> of Osijek was upset, which lasted all through the end of the 18 th century. Then, the city was reunited again, which marked the beginning of a new era in the history of Osijek...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the price transmission and market integration of Maize and Beans in the rural and urban markets of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. Average monthly prices (measured in naira per kilogram) of Maize and Cowpea in rural and urban markets {{were used in the}} analysis. The data was obtained from the quarterly publications of the Akwa Ibom State Agricultural Development Programme (AKADEP). The data covered the period; January 2005 to June 2013. The trend analysis showed that, prices of Maize and Beans in the rural and urban markets had exponential growth rates that were less than unity, which suggested a possible co-movement of these prices in the study area. Also, the Pearson correlation coefficient generated for the pair of rural and urban prices of Maize and Beans revealed significant linear symmetric relationships. The result implies the existence of symmetric market information flows between the rural and urban markets for Maize and Beans in the state. The Granger causality test revealed bi-directional relationships between the rural and urban price of Maize and Beans in the study area. The co-integration test revealed the presence of co-integration between the rural and urban prices of Maize and Beans. The coefficients of the price variables in the co-integration equations for Maize and Beans <b>markets</b> converged to <b>unity</b> or law of one price which implied perfect market integration in the long run. The results of the error correction model (ECM) also confirm the existence of the short run market integration between the rural and urban prices of Maize and Beans in the study area. In addition, it was discovered that, the rural price of Maize adjusted faster to the stable state in the long run than the urban price. Likewise, the urban price of Beans adjusted faster than its corresponding rural price. The index of market connection (IMC) supported the high short run market integration for prices of Maize and Beans in rural and urban markets. Based on the findings, it is recommended that, the Akwa Ibom State government should continue to provide marketing infrastructures and reduced externality costs in order to improve further the symmetric nature of information flow among Maize and Beans markets in the state. Also, individuals, trade unions, NGOs’ and government should established market information units and awareness programmes on mass media to facilitate efficient communication flows of Beans and Maize markets in the state...|$|R
40|$|The above thesis topic I chose for two reasons. The first {{reason was}} that I had as a {{secondary}} specialization in Business Valuation chosen course of study in this specialization. I met with the subject in Practical Business Valuation. In this course, I participated in valuation process Consumer Unity in Jindrichuv Hradec. Because at my residence located Consumer Unity in Nymburk, whose stores I visit from time to time, I wonder if {{it is appropriate to}} evaluate the company using the income approach (or under what conditions) and what is the value of the company. Therefore, the objective of this thesis I have provided to determine the <b>market</b> value of <b>unity,</b> consumer cooperative in Nymburk. The second reason why I chose the topic of "valuation" as a whole is the fact that my favorite literary genres include detective novels. With a little imagination {{it can be said that}} the search for business value is similar or even identical to the above literary genre. When first we see business, we know about him very little, but we suspect that it certainly has some value. In the case of murder, we see the body, but do not know the offender. Over time composing pieces together and connect us with each connection, and finally ideally we will see a clear picture and find out who is the perpetrator, even if the culprit was the victim. If we are looking for enterprise value, this is a similar case. Gradually, as we proceed through financial, strategic analysis, the value of generators, the financial plan to the final valuation, we find that the company is healthy, if it is a competitive, what is the prognosis for the future, when we are at the end of the quest unable to determine its value. Proper "thriller" should consist of five components. From the introduction plot, climax, and denouement of the conclusion. Therefore, the thesis is divided into five parts. The first part consists of basic information about the company, where he briefly introduce the valuated company. Followed by a financial analysis that tells us what threats or vice versa opportunities deriving from the financial statements of the company and answer the question of whether the company is financially able to continue to operate. Another part of the work is strategic analysis to assess the position on a particular market and answers the question of how they will develop sales and market share of the business in the future. Subsequently generators predict values and use them to create a financial plan that will serve as an important basis for the final valuation Unity, consumer cooperative in Nymburk. In my work I used the experience and information on the issue of consumer cooperatives and food retail Practical lessons in the subject of business valuation studies in developing team...|$|R
