60|$|The pretended {{desertion}} of {{the sergeant}} {{took place on}} the night of October 20th, and was attended with difficulties. He had to evade patrols of horse and foot, beside stationary guards and irregular scouting parties. Major Lee could render him no assistance other than to delay pursuit, should his departure be discovered. About eleven o'clock the sergeant took his cloak, valise, and orderly book, drew his horse from the picket, and <b>mounting,</b> <b>set</b> out on his hazardous course, while the major retired to rest. He had not been in bed half an hour, when Captain Carnes, officer of the day, hurrying into his quarters, gave word that one of the patrols had fallen in with a dragoon, who, on being challenged, put spurs to his horse, and escaped. Lee pretended to be annoyed by the intrusion, and to believe that the pretended dragoon was some countryman of the neighborhood. The captain was piqued; made a muster of the dragoons, and returned with word that the sergeant-major was missing, who had gone off with horse, baggage, arms, and orderly book.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, Western Electric {{issued the}} first Bell System {{telephone}} with a handset containing both the {{transmitter and receiver}} in the same unit. Previous telephones had been of the candlestick type which featured a stationary transmitter in the desktop set or the wall mount, and a hand-held receiver {{to be placed on}} the user's ear. This desktop unit was initially constructed by shortening the candlestick neck to about an inch in length and placing a handset cradle on the top. This was the A1 mount, which was replaced within 2 years by the B1 <b>mounting</b> <b>set,</b> which featured an integrated design in streamlined shape. It still had the same circular footprint of the candlestick, which proved too unstable when dialing numbers, and was henceforth replaced with a wider design using an oval footprint, the D1 mounting base in 1930.|$|E
50|$|Temporary {{exhibitions}} {{can bring}} together objects {{that might be}} dispersed amongst several collections, to reconstruct an original context such as an artist’s career or a patron's collection, or to propose connections - perhaps the result of recent research - which give new insights or {{a different way of}} understanding items in museum collections. The whole exhibition, usually with associated services - insurance, shipping, storage, conservation, <b>mounting,</b> <b>set</b> up, etc. - can then be loaned to one or more venues, to lengthen the life of the exhibition and to allow the widest possible audiences - regionally, nationally or internationally - to experience these objects and the stories they contain. Such collaborations can add interest to museums where displays of permanent collections might change only slowly, helping to provide fresh interpretations or more complete stories and attract new audiences. They also provide fresh ideas and breathing space for organisations which have exhibition spaces but lack permanent collections.|$|E

Several versions of TRG-specific bipods were produced that all lock into an attachment {{point in the}} aluminium bedding block {{at the end of}} the forestock. The latest bipod version is one of a few rifle bipods that lets the rifle swivel or [...] "hang" [...] just above its bore axis offering a more stable shooting position with large and heavy aiming optics mounted. It has a narrower leg angle due to complaints that the previous version interfered with some night vision systems mounted forward of the telescopic sight. Further versions of accessories are the ITRS tri-rail NV attachment point with an optional extended aluminium bedding block. This extended bedding block also can feature an optional STANAG 2324 Picatinny rail in the bottom of the block.|$|E
50|$|Every APR rifle is {{equipped}} with a MIL-STD-1913 rail on top of the upper receiver for mounting components to accommodate different types of optical or electro-optical sights, with the option to mount three extra rails on the stock for attaching tactical accessories. The rifle can be equipped with an optional folding front sight and an aperture-type rear sight. Iron sights cannot be mounted on integrally silenced APR models. Brügger & Thomet offers a proprietary TRS (Tactical Rifle Scope) telescopic sight for the APR. The TRS is a Schmidt & Bender PMII 3-12×50 LP scope with a proprietary stadiametric rangefinding reticle layout made exclusively for Brügger & Thomet. The TRS scope is meant to be mounted with a Brügger & Thomet <b>mounting</b> <b>set</b> consisting of two scope rings, where the front ring provides an adaptor for Simrad KN night sights. Those rings are attached to a Picatinny interface on the rifle's upper receiver. The scope and mount are clamped on the rifle's Picatinny rail by the tension of two levers, allowing the operator to quickly remove the scope in case of failure or while cleaning or during transit. Detaching and attaching the scope repeatedly will not affect the zero. APR rifles can be equipped with an anti-mirage band to suppress mirage caused by air heated by a warm barrel during extended training sessions.|$|E

In this essay I take stock of the troubled evolution of those discourses in Western environmental philosophy that seek to mount a critique of anthropocentrism or human chauvinism and defend biological diversity. Variously referred to as ecocentric or biocentric, these discourses {{have been subjected to}} a <b>mounting</b> <b>set</b> of ethical, philosophical and political critiques that have blunted their general appeal. I argue that these nonanthropocentric discourses may be rescued from these criticisms if we focus on nature advocacy as a democratic task, and link such advocacy (structurally and historically) with the social and environmental justice movements.

40|$|Areca nut {{has to be}} {{processed}} in dry condition by peeling the outer shell completely. Peeling of Areca nut is very difficult by hand. However it is being done manually by using a sharp knife with a production rate of 3 kg/hr. So {{it is essential to}} develop an agri-machine which will increase the production rate and safety to labourers. Presently there are few machines available but these machines are not suitable for variety of sizes of Areca nut which leads into the insufficient removal of outer shell of Areca nut. Therefore there is enough scope to develop a agri-machine suitable for variety of sizes of Areca nut which will overcome these problems. The present reserch work emphasizes on developing an Areca nut Dehusking agri-machine for three different sizes of Areca nut. The concept is to shear-off the husk of the dry Areca nut by shearing force. The features a Dehusking mechanism, and a power drive. The experiments were conducted by changing the blades, and selecting the best method. The first experiment were conducted by <b>mounting</b> <b>set</b> of two cutters separated by spacers for each size of Areca nut, then the set of two cutters were replaced by single cutters and the results of both the experiments were compared and concluded that the single cutters were more efficient than the set of two cutters in Dehusking the Areca nut...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Schattauer via [URL] To determine whether a lateral suture placed with bone anchors between quasi-isometric points in a cat is superior to a standard fabella-tibial suture, for the stabilization of cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) rupture compared to an intact stifle joint. Study design: Biomechanical cadaveric study. Methods: Six stifle joints with intact cruciate ligaments from three skeletally mature cats were placed in a loading <b>mounting</b> <b>set</b> and tested with axial loads of 20 N and 60 N at three different joint angles (75 °, 130 ° and 160 °). The procedure was repeated with a transected CrCL; a stabilized stifle joint after a combination of three lateral suture techniques (fabella-tibial suture technique [SFT]; femoro-tibial suture technique 1 [FTS- 1] and femoro-tibial suture technique 2 [FTS- 2]). Radiographic examination of the relative position of the tibia to the fixed femur was compared. Results: Stabilization of the stifle joint with lateral sutures had comparable stability to the intact specimens in the cranio-caudal direction (p = 0. 2) {{but not in the}} proximo-distal direction for the SFT (p = 0. 04) and FTS- 2 technique (p = 0. 03). There {{was no significant difference between}} the three stabilization techniques (p > 0. 05). Clinical significance: Lateral sutures placed with bone anchors at quasi-isometric points performed better than SFT and FTS- 2 in stabilizing the feline stifle after CrCL rupture in the proximo-distal plane. Biomechanical stability in the cranio-caudal plane after placement of a lateral suture across the feline stifle was similar to the intact CrCL.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{temporal}} and spatial characteristics of a laser microprobe plume were investigated using the spectroscopic methods of emission, absorption and fluorescence. The plume was produced by rapid vaporization of a small quantity (1 μg) of a solid sample using a focussed pulsed dye laser (110 MW/cm²). For absorption and fluorescence experiments, a wavelength calibrated narrow band tunable dye laser {{was used as the}} excitation source. All microprobe experiments were performed with a metal sample (Al or Zr) placed in a sample chamber with the pressure and composition of the sampling atmosphere controlled. Sample chamber pressures of 25 torr to 300 torr were used. The chemical composition of the sample chamber atmosphere was varied from pure argon to pure oxygen. Most spectroscopic observations were made on binary molecules formed by rapid reaction of the vaporized sample material with oxygen gas. For sample chamber atmospheres rich in oxygen, the rate of reaction was found to be significantly greater near the periphery of the plume than that observed for the central region. The results of these experiments indicate that the plume material forces the sampling atmosphere out of the region into which it expands. Transfer of the sampling atmosphere back into the region of the plume was observed to be radial in nature. Complete mixing of the plume material with the sampling atmosphere takes more than 100 μs. Significant quantities of sample oxide (A 10 and ZrO) were also observed in sampling atmospheres containing only trace levels of oxygen. These oxides were found to be at their peak concentration {{near the center of the}} plume, indicating the sample itself may be a significant source of oxygen. A unique method for accurate wavelength calibration of an etalon tuned dye laser, such as the one used in the laser microprobe experiments, is also reported. This method is based on an equation which relates the optical <b>mount</b> <b>setting</b> of an intracavity etalon to the lasing wavelength of a CMX- 4 tunable dye laser. The parameters of this equation were curve fitted to data obtained by using laser induced impedance change (LIIC) signals from hollow cathode lamps to accurately determine the lasing wavelengths corresponding to optical mount settings. The equation is capable of predicting either the proper optical <b>mount</b> <b>setting</b> for any lasing wavelength or the lasing wavelength corresponding to any optical <b>mount</b> <b>setting.</b> The maximum observed error in the computed lasing wavelength for a given optical <b>mount</b> <b>setting</b> is 0. 04 Å...|$|R
