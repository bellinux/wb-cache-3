During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the bicycle on female {{emancipation}} should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation {{in the lives of}} Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the New Woman of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States. Feminists and suffragists recognised its transformative power. Susan B. Anthony said, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood." [...] In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, wrote a book called How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle (described in Bicycling magazine as [...] "the greatest book ever written on learning to ride"), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named [...] "Gladys", for its [...] "gladdening effect" [...] on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, [...] "I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum." [...] Elizabeth Robins Pennell started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia, and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from A Canterbury Pilgrimage to Over the Alps on a Bicycle. In 1895 Annie Londonderry became the first woman to bicycle around the world.|$|E

[...] "You can trust <b>me.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> straight whether I can do anything.

6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to annoy you," [...] he said, [...] "but I must insist that to me the {{situation}} {{does not appear to}} be without some encouraging features. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> has happened to me since we parted." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do not ask <b>me</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it was," [...] I said. [...] "The {{knowledge}} {{would only}} perplex {{and be a}} burden to you. It is all the time like poison in my brain." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I want no thanks," [...] he answered, almost roughly. [...] "I want to {{know that}} I was {{justified}} in what I did.

6000|$|He {{could not}} help smiling at the earnest {{directness}} of her answer, {{though he did not}} like it.

6000|$|Then let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Russell said to me. 'Napoleon,' said he, 'has {{been too}} fin for the English Government. He made us {{acknowledge}} the Tuscan vote.

6000|$|He {{shook his}} head. [...] "So far as Christianity {{is defined by}} its creeds, I am not a Christian.

Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I believe.
