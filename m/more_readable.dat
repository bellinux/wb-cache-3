500|$|Since the 1980s it {{has become}} common to speak of Post-Boom writers, {{most of whom were}} born during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, such as Roberto Bolaño, the post Boom Spanish {{language}} writer who has made the greatest impact on world literature. It is difficult to clearly situate the Post-Boom as many of its writers were active {{before the end of the}} Boom. [...] Indeed, some writers, like Jose Donoso could be said to belong to both movements. [...] His novel The Obscene Bird of Night (El obsceno pájaro de la noche, 1970) is considered, as Philip Swanson notes, [...] "one of the classics of the Boom." [...] His later work, however, fits more comfortably into the post-Boom. [...] Manuel Puig and Severo Sarduy are considered writers whose works embody the transition from the Boom to the Post-Boom. It is important to note that this uneasiness in categorization is perpetuated by the fact that major writers of the Boom (Fuentes, García Márquez and Vargas Llosa) continued writing well after the end of the Boom. [...] The post-Boom is distinct from the Boom in various respects, most notably in the presence of female authors such as Isabel Allende, Luisa Valenzuela, Giannina Braschi, Cristina Peri Rossi, and Elena Poniatowska. [...] While Valenzuela and Poniatowska were both active writers during, and in Poniatowska's case even before, the Boom period, Allende is considered [...] "a product of the Boom." [...] Shaw also identifies Antonio Skármeta, Rosario Ferre and Gustavo Sainz as Post-Boom writers. [...] The Post-Boom writers challenge the perceived elitism of the Boom by using a simpler, <b>more</b> <b>readable</b> style and going back to realism.|$|E
500|$|Irene {{has never}} been the most admired of Johnson's works. [...] Even James Boswell found it wanting:Analysed into parts, it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments, fine imagery, and {{beautiful}} language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principle end of the drama. [...] Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnson not only had not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy, but that he had not the sensibility to perceive them. Johnson's friend Bennet Langton recorded the author's own later disenchantment with the piece:At another time, when one was reading his tragedy Irene to a company at a house in the country, he [...] left the room; and somebody having asked him the reason of this, he replied, [...] "Sir, I thought it had been better."' The early 20th century consensus of opinion was summed up by George Sampson in 1941: [...] "Of his early tragedy Irene [...] it is enough to say that its moral dialogues, its correctness of plan and its smoothness of verse do not suffice to give it any rank as drama." [...] T. S. Eliot suggested an explanation for the play's unpopularity and neglect:His verse has none of the dramatic qualities; it is correct, but correctness in such isolation becomes itself a fault. [...] The play would be <b>more</b> <b>readable</b> to-day, if he had written it in rhyme; the whole would be more easily declaimed, and the good things more easily remembered; it would lose none of its excellence of structure, thought, vocabulary and figures of speech.
