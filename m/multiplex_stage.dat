40|$|Dynamic time {{division}} multiplexing (DTDM) is a flexible network transport technique calmhie of handling both continuous and bursty traffic effectively. By employing three different multiplexing ar- chitectures in the network, DTDM permits graceful evolution of the existing circuit switching network into a flexible broadband packet communication network supporting integrated voice, data, and video traffic. The first <b>multiplexing</b> <b>stage</b> uses a packet assembler to multiplex different broadband services into a common DTDM-format serial bit stream. The second <b>multiplexing</b> <b>stage</b> uses a statistical packet mul- tiplexer to concentrate network traffic for more efficient use of trans- mission facilities. A novel architecture for a multiple-input multiple- output statistical packet multiplexer was designed so that the total traffic load of the multiplexer ran be evenly distributed among the output lines and the service priority of each input line can be rearranged dynamically. The third <b>multiplexing</b> <b>stage</b> uSes a synchronous {{time division}} multiplexer for high-speed point-to-point transparent transmission. The multiplexer uses a simple tributary synchronization scheme based on positive and negative block justification, which combines the concept of controlled-slip and bit-stuffing techniques while maintaining information integrity.

The ATM Passive Optical Networks (APONs) are promising in that respect presenting high reliability, robustness and upgradability. When TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) is employed a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is needed to effect bandwidth sharing. However known protocols increase the Cell Delay Variation (CDV) too much over that of an equivalent ordinary ATM <b>multiplexing</b> <b>stage</b> thus producing traffic which creates serious complications to connection acceptance and policing functions of ATM networks.

Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are usually used to read out TESs. Moreover, SQUIDs are used to build TDM by biasing sequentially the SQUIDs connected together—one for each TES.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the real time {{measurement}} of frame cell rate generated by frame-based video codecs. This measure can be utilized to carry out an adaptive renegotiation of the network resources allocated at call-set-up, or to feed a policer equipment. This approach is particularly effective in a multimedia environment, where source traffic characteristics are hardly predictable and may remarkably change during the call. The design guidelines of a Video Frame Measurement Device (VFMD) are described. In particular, {{we focus on the}} algorithms implementing the video frame synchronization and alignment, needed for recognize frame boundaries altered by the cell transit through a <b>multiplexing</b> <b>stage.</b> An example of application of VFMD as input to a parameter estimate procedure is discussed. Results based on a performance study show that by applying the VFMD, a reliable estimate of the video traffic parameters each for 10 -I 5 frame periods (i. e. 300 - 500 ms) can be obtained.

40|$|In {{the quest}} for a way to bring local loop costs down and make B-ISDN {{affordable}} to small traffic customers, the passive optical networks (PON's) in combination with ATM (APON's) have been investigated extensively. To achieve the required medium sharing on a time division multiplexing (TDMA) basis, an arbitration mechanism is required in the upstream direction. The resulting multiplexing and concentration, though it is the source of significant savings, it has been plagued by the penalty of high distortion of the traffic profiles at the exit of the PON. The preventive congestion control method of ATM is rather intolerant of such distortions in the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>stages.</b> Arbitration methods which are either semistatic or based on number of arrivals per reservation period, cause very high cell delay variation (CDV). The cell clustering introduced by the arbitration method cannot be distinguished from peak rate violations of the contract by the policing unit. The result is either unwarranted rejections of conforming cells or unacceptably low utilization. The scheme presented herewith maintains a CDV behavior comparable to that of a common centralized FIFO multiplexer. It relies on a meticulous recording of the arrival timing of cells enabling a subsequent allocation of slots which produces almost the same output (and CDV) as the centralized FIFO multiplexer. A compact coding of the timing information restricts bandwidth waste for control information to the size found in other similar protocols. The most important feature is that the scheme is amenable to easy hardware implementation and does not require any call related information...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the latest {{results of a}} continuing study of {{the properties of the}} complementary heterojunction fieldeffect transistor (CHFET) at 4 K. The electrical characteristics, including the gate leakage current and the subthreshold transconductance, and the input-referred noise voltage for a new lot of discrete CHFETs is presented and discussed. It is shown that the inclusion of a sidewall spacer on the gate substantially reduced the gate leakage current, as compared to a previous lot without the sidewall spacer. The input-referred noise is approximately the same order of magnitude as previous devices, on the order of 1 V//i at 10 Hz for subthreshold operation. The noise is relatively unaffected by changes in the bias current and drain voltage, but decreases with increasing device size, and is increased by the inclusion of dopants in the channel region.

40|$|The Available Bit Rate (ABR) {{service is}} being {{designed}} as a low-cost transport service over ATM networks, which will be using the bandwidth remaining available after servicing connections of another, high-priority class.

Thus, an adaptive shaping mechanism is necessary for the ABR connections at each <b>multiplexing</b> or switching <b>stage</b> for effective bandwidth enforcement and adjusting their traffic profiles according to the prevailing congestion conditions. In this paper, an adaptive shaping mechanism related with the ABR service is analyzed and modeled on the basis of effective rates defined for the multiplexed connections. The traffic shaper is used to enforce the contracted effective rate for the ABR class and to allocate peak rates to the high priority class (burst spacer). The traffic shaper system is presented as an implementation perspective and specific ideas concerning its hardware realization are given...|$|R
40|$|The {{wireless}} communications arena {{consists of a}} wide range of products and services, each with a specific target market and approach. Having characteristic advantages and disadvantages, all attempt to increase their market share through diversification and innovation. Ultra wideband (UWB) is a recent entry into the commercial short-range communications world, differentiated by its sparse spectral profile and low peak power emissions. Being unlicensed and capable of operating simultaneously with conventional communication systems, it has seen considerable attention by both industry and academia. This thesis explores diversification improvements available for UWB systems, explicitly through orthogonal user multiplexing schemes, channel equalization, and forward error correction. A review of this communication method is presented, considering its technical evolution and standardization. Multi-user sequencing is researched with regard to a time hopped UWB architecture. The successful adoption of UWB into commercial devices greatly depends upon the development of efficient user access mechanisms. A comparative analysis of varied time, frequency, and direct sequence hopping codes is presented in terms of their performance, diversity, and computational requirements. It is shown that for low user utilization levels, short periodicity deterministic codes attain a similar performance to randomly generated sequences. However, within a fully utilized system deterministic codes slightly out-perform short length random sequences. The application of multiplexing codes to UWB chip level interleaving is also examined. Interleaver performance is compared when designed through long length random codes versus design through deterministic hopping sequences, exemplifying similarities between the approaches. A unique approach to sequence analysis is introduced, developing a set of state probabilities for pulse separations generated by each multiplexing code. Providing insight into optimal code design procedures, this separation profile is employed in the closed-form derivation of intersymbol and multi-user interference expressions. These formulations adopt a transmitter-side equalization process, with comparisons against a receiver-side approach presented. Derivations are based upon an analysis of transmission overlaps, together with the probabilities of each overlap. A close alignment against a simulated UWB system is evident for varied system parameters, exemplifying numerous properties of each equalization measure. Despite diversification efforts to improve communication procedures, data errors are an unavoidable consequence of operation across a wireless medium. Forward error correction is researched within this dissertation for both binary and a non-binary encoding. Utilizing a transmitter-side equalization scheme, conventional binary turbo decoding is considered at the binary data level. Also, non-binary turbo decoding is applied to combine data encoding and user <b>multiplexing</b> <b>stages.</b> This latter method presents an innovative means of time hopping code generation. A comparative analysis of each technique against a simulated performance is given for both single- and multi-user scenarios, together with observations on the multi-user interference effects of signals employing forward error correction. A performance improvement for scarcely populated systems was evident, although a binary turbo scheme is shown to achieve optimal performance in high traffic systems. The mapping scheme required for non-binary encoding is evaluated in terms of random generation and design through deterministic coding schemes. Truncated orthogonal codes are shown to achieve a performance gain for higher turbo iteration levels, also having the advantage of simpler design. Wireless communications are inherently subject to numerous signal degradations. With its revolutionary and unlicensed communication approach, UWB has emerged as a formidable contender in the wireless arena. Having an array of error mitigation techniques, including orthogonal user multiplexing, channel equalization, and advanced error correction, it prevails as a high rate and low power consuming system for the modern world of telecommunications...|$|R

Many IoT electronics either will operate from stand-alone energy supply (e. g., battery) or be self-powered by harvesting from ambient energy sources or have both options. Harvesting sustainable energy from ambient environment plays significant role in extending the operation lifetime of these devices and hence, lower the maintenance cost of the system, which in turn help make them integral to simpler systems. Both for battery-powered and harvesting capable systems, efficient power delivery unit remains an essential component for maximizing energy efficiency. The goal of this research is to investigate the challenges of energy delivery for low power electronics considering both energy harvesting as well as battery-powered conditions and to address those challenges. Different challenges of energy harvesting from low voltage energy sources based on the limitations of the sources, the type of the regulator used and the pattern of the load demands have been investigated. Different aspects of the each challenges are further investigated to seek optimized solutions for both load specific and generalized applications.
