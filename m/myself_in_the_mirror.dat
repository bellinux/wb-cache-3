500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And would I {{be able to look at}} <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> happily? No. Is it time to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love." [...] The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.|$|E

He was quoted in 2002 as saying [...] "I wouldn't trade winning another game or two for my reputation as a person. [...] I've said from day one I'm going to do things the way I {{think they should be}} done. There were those who said, `If you don't cheat, you're pretty naive. You can't win that way.'

2500|$|The Japanese {{had their}} own files on Sukarno and the Japanese {{commander}} in Sumatra approached him with respect, wanting to use him to organise and pacify the Indonesians. Sukarno {{on the other hand}} wanted to use the Japanese to gain independence for Indonesia: [...] "The Lord be praised, God showed me the way; in that valley of the Ngarai I said: Yes, Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon...For the first time in all my life, I saw <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> of Asia." [...] In July 1942, Sukarno was sent back to Jakarta, where he re-united with other nationalist leaders recently released by the Japanese, including Mohammad Hatta. There, he met the Japanese commander General Hitoshi Imamura, who asked Sukarno and other nationalists to galvanise support from Indonesian populace to aid Japanese war effort.|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed {{me a sense of}} what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{released}} the album's first single [...] "This Is Music" [...] in May, and it reached No.35, their first single {{to reach the}} Top 40. It was followed by [...] "On Your Own" [...] in June which performed even better, reaching No.28. This single was particularly new for the Verve {{as it was a}} soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single [...] "History", which reached No.24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: [...] "I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because {{it could have been the}} greatest time of our lives, with [...] "History" [...] doing well, but I still think I can look <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees <b>in</b> High Fidelity. <b>The</b> scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene removed their clothes. At the musical cue, [...] "they stood naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. They chanted of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked at <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full-length <b>mirror.</b> Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1989 former Runaways {{lead singer}} Cherie Currie wrote of her {{experiences}} at the club, [...] "Marie likes Bowie, but she doesn't go all out-not {{as much as}} I do. I'm dressed up as wild as can be—I've practiced at Rodney’s. I am a glitter queen: satin pants, silver five-inch-high space boots, a glitter T-shirt, and make-up so bright it looks like I’m radioactive - When I'm done I admire <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cracked bathroom <b>mirror.</b> I look like an alien princess from a faraway planet. For a while-for tonight - I am no longer Cherrie Currie, the sweet little Valley Girl. I am the Cherie-thing; something weird and something wild. Iggy Pop, who had become a forlorn figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glam world, was often seen at the club. Kid Congo, later guitarist with The Cramps and Gun Club, remembered [...] "Iggy on the street outside the Disco, pulling his dress up and exposing himself, and Rodney crying because {{he thought he was}} going to be arrested." [...] Writer Nick Kent also recalled, [...] "I saw Iggy there many a time, stoned out of his gourd, lost to the world and to himself as well, staring at his face and form in those mirrored walls - staring at his reflection like Narcissus drugged out <b>in</b> teenage-disco-hell. <b>The</b> club had its dark side, however. In 1999 writer Lisa Fancher wrote how Joan Jett [...] "was walking up to Rodney’s one Friday night when she saw a dead body out front, an obvious OD, and nobody was paying any attention at all. The kids just kept walking into the club. Sweet was flooding out the door and everybody just kept on dancing..." ...|$|R

60|$|A wicked man! I {{had never}} beheld the {{handsome}} and fascinating Mr. Jennings, but I visualised him now; dark, like all villains, {{with a black}} moustache and snapping black eyes.

And I had judgment, and I {{would have had to}} pay for that mirror if I hadn't recollected to say it was Twichell who broke it.|$|E
