25|$|Many Blacks who {{had settled}} on {{property}} surrounding Hampton {{were forced to}} leave by various means. These included Johnson's aggressive restoration policy, Black Codes passed by the Virginia legislature, and with vigilante enforcement by returning Confederates. Union troops also forcefully evicted settlers, sometimes provoking violent standoffs; many Blacks came to trust the Freedmen's Bureau no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the Rebels. In 1866 Tidewater's refugee camps were still full, {{and many of their}} residents were sick and dying. Relations with Northern and Southern Whites had become violently hostile. The Whites (military occupiers and local residents) agreed on a plan to deport the freedpeople back to their counties of origin.|$|E
25|$|The {{old core}} of the empire was divided into three spheres of influence. Kangaba, the de facto capital of Manden {{since the time of}} the last emperor, became the capital of the {{northern}} sphere. The Joma area, governed from Siguiri, controlled the central region, which encompassed Niani. Hamana (or Amana), southwest of Joma, became the southern sphere, with its capital at Kouroussa in modern Guinea. Each ruler used the title of mansa, but their authority only extended as far as their own sphere of influence. Despite this disunity in the realm, the realm remained under Mandinka control into the mid-17th century. The three states warred with each other as much, if not <b>more,</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> against outsiders, but rivalries generally stopped when faced with invasion. This trend would continue into colonial times against Tukulor enemies from the west.|$|E

They were {{reluctant}} to arouse the Iroquois, whom they feared <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the British colonists and with whom they had made the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. New York merchants were opposed to attacking New France because it would interrupt the lucrative Indian fur trade, much of which came through New France. [...] The Iroquois maintained their neutrality throughout the conflict, despite Peter Schuyler's efforts to interest them in the war. (Schuyler was Albany's commissioner of Indians.) ...|$|E

500|$|In his memoirs, Grant {{reacted to}} {{criticism}} of his lack of entrenchments: [...] "Besides this, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> experience with the pick, shovel and axe. ... under all these circumstances I concluded that drill and discipline were worth more to our men than fortifications." [...] Lew Wallace's division was [...] downstream (north) from Pittsburg Landing, at Crump's Landing, a position intended to prevent the placement of Confederate river batteries, to protect the road connecting Crump's Landing to Bethel Station, Tennessee, and to guard the Union army's right flank. In addition, Wallace's troops could strike the railroad line connecting Bethel Station to Corinth, about [...] to the south.|$|E
500|$|Northcliffe's brother, Lord Rothermere, {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the war correspondents: [...] "They don't know the truth, they don't speak the truth, {{and we know that}} they don't". Stephen Badsey, a historian who specialises in World War I, has noted that their situation was not easy as they [...] "found themselves as minor players trapped in a complicated hierarchical structure dominated by politicians, generals and newspaper owners." [...] Beach Thomas, however, received particular opprobrium. Paul Fussell, the historian, describes him as [...] "notoriously fatuous" [...] during the war period. Peter Stothard, editor of The Times between 1992 and 2002, describes him as [...] "a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous Daily Mail war correspondent" [...] and believes that he may have been the inspiration for the character of William Boot in Evelyn Waugh's Scoop. John Simpson, a war correspondent, describes him as [...] "charming but unlovable" [...] and thinks that the troops despised Beach Thomas <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the other British war correspondents, even though all those journalists were playing a similar disinformation role. They considered his writing to be a trivialisation of the realities of war, jingoistic, pompous and particularly self-promoting, often giving the reader an impression that he was writing from the battlefield when in fact he was being fed information of dubious value by the authorities while based in their headquarters.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said after}} six episodes, he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] was the episode where the Parks and Recreation {{found the right}} tone for the series and Leslie Knope character. Sepinwall said all the {{characters}} were very likable, the jokes seemed natural and the awkwardness of the show was turned down enough to work properly. The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said while the first five episodes of the season had been disappointing, [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked an improvement in which [...] "the characters were more defined, their quirks and rhythms understood". Matt Fowler of IGN {{said he did not}} find the episode especially funny but that it {{did a good job of}} fleshing out the characters. He said Chris Pratt was especially funny, and that his band's song [...] "The Pit" [...] was stuck in his head after the episode. The A.V. Club writer Keith Phipps, who had mixed feelings about Parks and Recreation throughout the season, said [...] "Rock Show" [...] was very funny and restored his faith in the potential of the series. Phipps said he believed the show would become very popular in the second season, and that people would later claim to like the first season <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the first time they saw it. In October 2009, while reviewing the second season episode [...] "Sister City", A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said he believed Parks and Recreation showed a streak of vast improvement that started with [...] "Rock Show" [...] and continued into the second season.|$|E

2500|$|Yaroslav {{defeated}} Svyatopolk {{in their}} first battle, in 1016, and Svyatopolk fled to Poland. But Svyatopolk returned in 1018 with Polish troops furnished by his father-in-law, seized Kiev and pushed Yaroslav back into Novgorod. Yaroslav at last prevailed over Svyatopolk, and in 1019 firmly established his rule over Kiev. One of his first actions as a grand prince was to confer on the loyal Novgorodians (who had helped him to gain the Kievan throne), numerous freedoms and privileges. Thus, {{the foundation of the}} Novgorod Republic was laid. For their part, the Novgorodians respected Yaroslav <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> other Kievan princes; and the princely residence in their city, next to the marketplace (and where the veche often convened) was named Yaroslav's Court after him. [...] It probably was during this period that Yaroslav promulgated the first code of laws in the lands of the East Slavs, the Russkaya Pravda.|$|E
2500|$|Voyager1 {{was first}} of the two probes to {{encounter}} the Jupiter system in March 1979. On approach to Jupiter in late February and early March 1979, Voyager imaging scientists noticed that Io appeared distinct from the other Galilean satellites. Its surface was orange in color and marked by dark spots, which were initially interpreted as the sites of impact craters. Among the most intriguing features was a heart-shaped, dark ring [...] across that would later {{turn out to be}} the plume deposit of the volcano Pele. The data from the Ultraviolet Spectrometer(UVS) revealed a torus of plasma composed of sulfur ions at the orbit of Io, but tilted to match the equator of Jupiter's magnetic field. The Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP) detector encountered streams of sodium, sulfur, and oxygen ions prior to entering Jupiter's magnetosphere, material that the LECP science team suspected originated from Io. In the hours prior to Voyager 1s encounter with Io, the spacecraft acquired images for a global map with a resolution of at least [...] per pixel over the satellite's leading hemisphere (the side that faces the moon's direction of motion around Jupiter) down to less than [...] per pixel over portions of the sub-Jovian hemisphere (the [...] "near" [...] side of Io). The images returned during the approach revealed a strange, multi-colored landscape devoid of impact craters, unlike the other planetary surfaces imaged to that point such as the Moon, Mars, and Mercury. The dark spots in earlier images resembled volcanic calderas <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the impact craters seen on those other worlds. Stunned by the oddity of Io's surface, Voyager imaging scientist Laurence Soderblom at a pre-encounter press conference joked, [...] "this one we got all figured out... is covered with thin candy shells of anything from sulfates and sulfur and salts to all kinds of strange things." ...|$|E

40|$|Marxists claim capitalists {{unjustly}} exploit workers, {{and this}} exploitation {{is to show}} that workers ought to hold <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> This paper presents two accounts of exploitation. The Theft Account claims that capitalists steal some of the value to which workers are entitled. The Underpayment Account holds that capitalists are not entitled to pay workers as little as <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> even if the workers are not entitled to the full value they produce. This paper argues that only the Theft Account can explain why workers ought to hold <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> The Underpayment Account cannot yield this conclusion. The Theft Account is superior to the Underpayment Account insofar as exploitation is to be an injustice—a wrong that requires the exploited party to hold more...|$|R
