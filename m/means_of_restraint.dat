6000|$|Follows an interlude, for {{the study}} even of {{inaccurate}} history is indigestible to many. There was an elephant at Chitor, to take birds of passage up the hill, and she--she was fifty-one years old, and her name was Gerowlia--came to the dak-bungalow for the Englishman. Let not the word dak-bungalow deceive any man into believing that there is even moderate comfort at Chitor. Gerowlia waited in the sunshine, and chuckled to herself like a female pauper when she receives snuff. Her mahout {{said that he would}} go away for a drink of water. So he walked, and walked, and walked, till he disappeared on the stone-strewn plains, and the Englishman was left alone with Gerowlia, aged fifty-one. She had been tied by the chain on her near hind leg to a pillar of the verandah; but the string was coir, and more an emblem of authority than a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>restraint.</b> When she had thoroughly exhausted all the resources of the country within range of her trunk, she ate up the string and began to investigate the verandah. There was more coir string, and she ate it all, while the carpenter, who was repairing the dak-bungalow, cursed her and her ancestry from afar. About this time the Englishman was roused to a knowledge of the business, for Gerowlia, having exhausted the string, tried to come into the verandah. She had, most unwisely, been pampered with biscuits an hour before. The carpenter stood on an outcrop of rock, and said angrily: [...] "See what damage your hathi has done, Sahib." [...] "'Tisn't my hathi," [...] said the Sahib, plaintively. [...] "You ordered it," [...] quoth he, [...] "and it has been here ever so long, eating up everything." [...] He threw pieces of stone at Gerowlia, and went away. It is a terrible thing to be left alone with an unshackled elephant, even though she be a venerable spinster. Gerowlia moved round the dak-bungalow, blowing her nose in a nervous and undecided manner, and presently found some more string and thatch, which she ate. This was too much. The Englishman went out and spoke to her. She opened her mouth and salaamed; meaning thereby [...] "biscuits." [...] So long as she remained in this position she could do no harm.|$|E

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration in {{conjunction}} with the Universities Space Research Association sponsored the design of a Resistive Exercise Device (RED) for use on the Space Shuttle. The device must enable the astronauts to perform a number of exercises to prevent skeletal muscle atrophy and neuromuscular deconditioning in microgravity environments. The RED must fit the requirements for limited volume and weight and must provide a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> during exercise. The design team divided the functions of the device into three major groups: methods of supplying force, methods of adjusting force, and methods of transmitting the force to the user. After analyzing the three main functions of the RED and developing alternatives for each, the design team used a comparative decision process to choose the most feasible components for the overall design. The design team selected the constant force spring alternative for further embodiment. The device consists of an array of different sized constant force springs which can be pinned in different combinations to produce the required output forces. The force is transmitted by means of a shaft and gear system. The final report is divided into four sections. An introduction section discusses the sponsor background, problem background and requirements of the device. The second section covers the alternative designs for each of the main functions. The design solution and pertinent calculations comprises the third section. The final section contains design conclusions and recommendations including topics of future work...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the main {{issues of concern}} raised by human rights and other relevant international and national bodies in relation to incidences of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in the Australian context {{and the role of}} social work in responding to torture. The research primarily explores concerns relating to conditions of detention, and in some cases, the treatment of involuntarily detained persons, including prisoners, asylum seekers, trafficking victims and those held in specific medical facilities such as forensic psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes. Some of the key human rights issues raised include suspicious deaths in custody, conditions of confinement, the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> (both chemical and physical), strip-searching, isolation, the use of Tasers, increased powers of detention for intelligence organisations and physical assault. In addition, incidences of Non-State Actor Torture (NSAT) that occur in the Australian context are examined, and the responsibility States have in addressing and preventing torture that occurs in the domestic sphere is explored. Given the prevalence of these issues in the Australian context, the research consequently {{examines the}} extent of social work engagement and the role of social work in responding to torture in light of the ethical and human rights commitments of the social work profession. Finally, the thesis presents a suggested model to address torture and the underlying causes, which includes political activism, advocacy and consciousness raising activities. This includes a recommendation that a national organisation be established that documents instances of torture, independently investigates allegations of torture and can advocate for broader policy and institutional change.

40|$|Daniel Munoz-Rojas and Jean-Jacques Fresard's study “The Roots of Behaviour in War” (RBW Study), {{which came}} out in 2004, {{provided}} very useful insight into how compliance with international humanitarian law may be better ensured. In essence, it emphasized the role of “the law” and associated enforcement mechanisms in achieving optimal results. Emphasis on “persuasion” regarding the values underpinning the law was identified as having a possibly corrosive effect and was to be de-emphasized, if not avoided. Such conclusions raise serious questions. The study's reliance on neutral normativity of “the law” can be overstated. The issue may be less one of checking aberrant behaviour under the law and more one of ensuring that unnecessary harm is curtailed within the law. The assumptions made by the RBW Study concerning {{the efficacy of the}} law are too narrow in their avoidance of the moral and ethical questioning that can accompany legal interpretative approaches.

We also show that higher concentration among the competitive fringe lowers the profitability of merger as compared to cartel. We then discuss the impact of antitrust regulation against cartel in the absence and presence of merger regulations.

5000|$|A {{significant}} opposition amongst parents, {{businesses and}} universities regarding the education reforms had surfaced by the 1970s, {{in which they}} believed there was a decline in academic standards, a lack of focus in the curriculum, and lax discipline in schools. Combined with financially pressured school boards beginning to call for the abolition of grade 13 as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>restraint,</b> this resulted in the government reevaluating its secondary education system. The resulting document was the Ontario Schools: Intermediate and Senior (OS:IS), which had called for the formal elimination of grade 13, without formally eliminating the fifth year of secondary education. Acting upon {{the recommendations of the}} document, Ontario formally eliminated grade 13 in 1984, and introduced the Ontario Academic Credit system. The new system allowed for students to graduate from secondary schools in four years, while also maintaining the fifth year, known as OAC, which had courses catering for students planning to proceed with post-secondary education. Despite the fact that students were able to graduate from the secondary school system in four years, a fifth year of secondary education continued to persist in Ontario, with fewer than 15 percent of students exercising the option to graduate in four years, with reports that between 20 percent and 25 percent of students choose to repeat one or more OAC years.|$|R

Objective: To document the prevalence <b>of</b> physical <b>restraint</b> use, patient characteristics associated with physical restraint use, and nurses’ and doctors’ knowledge and perceptions towards the practice. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 572 patients, of whom 132 were physically restrained, was conducted in acute wards of a tertiary hospital. Data were collected on the 132 physically restrained patients. Fifty-nine doctors and 159 nurses completed a specially constructed questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were derived and expressed as numbers and percentages. Results: Prevalence <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> use was 23 % (132 / 572). The distribution in acute wards was: medical 54. 5 %; surgical 44. 7 %; maternity 0. 8 %; psychiatry none. <b>Mean</b> age (SD) <b>of</b> the restrained patients was 49 years (20. 5); 53. 8 % were male.
