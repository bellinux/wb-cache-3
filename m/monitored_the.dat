5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{left the}} African coast on July22 and crossed {{much of the}} Atlantic without significant development. While approaching the Leeward Islands on July28, the National Hurricane Center <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> system closely for any possible development, which did not occur at that time. Though by August2, convection began increasing, and as a result, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight later that day, while centered about 350miles (595km) southwest of Bermuda. On the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey. Due to initially strong wind shear, Harvey exhibited subtropical characteristics.|$|E

Three days after being selected for the Apollo 1 crew, he flew out to the North American Aviation Plant in Downey, California, to see it.|$|E
5|$|About 18 hours later, the {{depression}} was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} and given the name Dan. The cyclone moved westward at , and convection continued to mature. Outflow was good across most of the system, except the northwestern corner where it was restricted by interaction with a nearby typhoon. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> storm, assigning it with the local name Saling. The JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm on October 9; both agencies recognized it as a typhoon the next day after an eye became visible and outflow improved in the northwestern quadrant. Dan made landfall on the southeastern coast of Luzon in the Philippines, and its center tracked {{just south of the}} Ninoy Aquino International Airport.|$|E
5|$|After the {{northern}} circulation became the dominant center on October9, a deepening trough in the westerlies caused {{a decrease in}} synoptic pressures, resulting in Bess' forward motion greatly decreasing. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track, strong outflow developed, especially to the southwest of the circulation. The storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on October10 as it approached {{the northern}} Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> storm and assigned it with the local name Susang. Later that day, Bess made landfall in northern Luzon, roughly 95km (60mi) south of Escarpada Point, with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph). Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140km/h (85mph) before the system moved ashore. Inland, a barometric pressure of 976.9mbar (hPa; 28.85inHg) was recorded in Tuguegarao as the typhoon passed 55km (35mi) to the north.|$|E

5|$|Although the low {{initially}} exhibited features {{typical of}} a monsoon trough, surface observations suggested that surface pressures {{in the vicinity of}} the low began to fall on September4. Consequently, the TFCA was re-issued at 10:00UTC. Eight hours later, Dvorak intensity estimates for the storm reached T2.0/, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system into a tropical depression, although post-storm analysis from the agency indicated that the system attained tropical depression status at 00:00UTC on September4 and tropical storm intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 06:00UTC on September5, the JMA followed suit and classified Gerald as a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> storm and assigned it with the local name Neneng. The JTWC initially expected Gerald to re-curve east of the Philippines; however, the storm's circulation remained quite shallow and embedded within the monsoon trough, causing Gerald to meander. The JMA upgraded Gerald into severe tropical storm during the evening hours of September5.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} weekend of sale, {{more than one million}} units were sold. Soon after {{the first weekend}}, Ashok Kumar, a {{technology}} analyst for a financial firm predicted that Apple would sell 35 million iPad 2s in 2011. Investment banking firm, Piper Jaffray <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> initial sales of the iPad 2 and reported that 70% of all iPad 2 sales were to first-time iPad buyers with 49% of buyers owning a PC compared to the initial buyers of the original iPad where only 26% of buyers owned a PC. 12,000 units were sold on auction site eBay in its first two weeks of release. When the iPhone 4S was released, rumors about the third generation iPad caused a decline in iPad 2 sales. Official figures released {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2011 indicate that Apple sold 11.4 million iPads in the third quarter, a 166% increase from the third quarter of 2010.|$|E
5|$|During the season, {{tropical}} cyclones were officially {{monitored by}} the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWC) in Nadi, Fiji, Wellington, New Zealand and Brisbane, Australia. Throughout the season the United States Navy also <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> basin and issued unofficial warnings, through its Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC). Tropical cyclones that were located between the Equator and 25S were monitored by TCWC Nadi while any that were located {{to the south of}} 25S were monitored by TCWC Wellington. During the season the JTWC issued warnings on any tropical cyclone that was located between 160°E and 180° while the NPMOC issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between 180° and the American coast. TCWC Nadi, Wellington and Brisbane all used the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measured windspeeds over a 10-minute period, while the JTWC and the NPMOC measured sustained windspeeds over a 1-minute period.|$|E

5|$|Even though {{earthquake}} swarms can be dangerous, {{scientists are}} able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the earthquake swarm in 2007, {{a group of scientists}} investigated the possibility that a volcanic eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the United States Geological Survey, the University of Washington, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of California and a 2004 earthquake swarm at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Following the system's {{classification}} as {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression maintained a west-southwesterly track {{in response to}} a subtropical ridge to the north. On July12, it is estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Gordon by the JTWC. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> storm and assigned it with the local name Goring. During the afternoon of July13, Gordon briefly turned southwestward as it attained typhoon status before returning to a more westerly track later that day.|$|E
5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened in}} 1943. He made it a {{condition}} of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> radioactive fallout from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with Geiger counters. The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E

5|$|In late August 1977, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} noted south of Pohnpei. By September 1, a weak surface low accompanied by organized convection developed within the disturbance. Situated {{to the south of}} a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough, conditions were favorable for further organization and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. Tracking steadily west-northwestward in response to a well-developed subtropical ridge extending from the International Dateline to China, the system was soon classified a tropical depression early on September 2. Hours later, a weather reconnaissance mission into the depression revealed winds of 75 km/h (45 mph), prompting the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Babe. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> storm and assigned it with the local name Miling.|$|E
5|$|It {{is listed}} in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which means it is not {{considered}} threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely <b>monitored.</b> <b>The</b> animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found {{in a number of}} protected areas of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. The IUCN lists it as a species of least concern, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor.|$|E

Maeser believed that this system was flawed, however, because it focused on developing efficiency and disregarded individuality. Maeser argued that the teacher have more personal interactions with students. He implemented his monitorial organization so that each student would be responsible for something or someone else. Students were forced to look outside themselves, creating responsibility and organization.|$|E
