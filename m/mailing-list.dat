2500|$|In April 2010, Sanger wrote {{a letter}} to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, {{outlining}} his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law. Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted [...] "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the PROTECT Act of 2003. That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law. Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, saying that Wikipedia did not have [...] "material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it." [...] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation <b>mailing-list</b> that this action was [...] "in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted". Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyse how design and use are mediated in Open Source Software (OSS) design. Focusing on the Python community, our study examines a “pushed-by-users ” design proposal through the discussions occurring in two mailing lists: one, user-oriented and the other, developer-oriented. To characterize the links between users and developers, we investigate the activities and references (knowledge sharing) performed by the contributors to these two <b>mailing-lists.</b> We found that the participation of users remains local to their communities. However, several key participants act as boundary spanners between the user and the developer communities. This emerging role is characterized by cross-participation in parallel same-topic discussions in both <b>mailing-lists,</b> cohesion between cross-participants, the occupation of a central position in the social network linking users and developers, as well as active, distinctive and adapted contributions. The user championing the proposal acts as a key boundary spanner coordinating the process and using explicit linking strategies. We argue that OSS design may be considered as a form of “role emerging design”, i. e. design organised and pushed through emerging roles and through a balance between thes...|$|R

40|$|Part 1 : Open Source Visualization and ReportingInternational audienceDue {{to their}} lack of {{physical}} interaction, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) participants form impressions of their teammates largely based on sociotechnical mechanisms including: code commits, code reviews, <b>mailing-lists,</b> and bug comments. These mechanisms may have different effects on peer impression formation. This paper describes a social network analysis of the WikiMedia project to determine which type of interaction has the most favorable characteristics for impressions formation. The results suggest that due to lower centralization, high interactivity, and high degree of interactions between participants, the code review interactions have the most favorable characteristics to support impression formation among FOSS participants...|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} to think of email as a {{one-to-one}} communication medium, but at the ISP level, many email flows are <b>mailing-lists</b> (one-to-many) or forwarded traffic (many-toone). Some anti-spam systems have foundered on misapprehensions as to the nature and importance of these flows. However, although understanding has grown, there are no quantitative studies in the literature as to {{the relative importance of}} these different types of email flow. This brief study is a snapshot of the types of email that can be distinguished amongst the 331 million items that arrived at a medium-sized ISP in March 2007, and is intended to provoke the publication of further data, to better illuminate the relative importance of different types of email...|$|R

40|$|Information and {{knowledge}} are actually well and easily distributed thanks to electronic journals, news, <b>mailing-lists</b> and forums. It is however {{more difficult to}} deploy algorithmic and programming collaboration: the heterogeneity of the programming languages and the operating systems used by researchers constitutes a major problem {{to the design of}} a common testing platform. Current solutions exist to develop collaborative work. Generally, these solutions impose specific programming languages and/or operating systems to developers. Some others specific rules have to be respected. These heavy constrains slow down the usage of collaborative programming platforms. The OpenWatermark project proposes a modern architecture for cooperative programming exchanges that takes all these aspects into account. Developers work with their favorite programming languages and operating systems as long as the OpenWatermark platform supports them. In this paper, we present the OpenWatermark platform (www. openwatermark. org) and its application to the benchmarking of image watermarking algorithms. Anglai...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} reveals some of {{the findings}} from a fieldwork on the configuration of human resource systems within subsidiaries of multinational companies in Indonesia. The research combines case studies at three subsidiaries of multinational companies and one state institution, internet-based participant observations on exchanges of HR ideas and information {{in a number of}} <b>mailing-lists</b> of Indonesian HR professionals, and interviews and documentary study on the recent changes in the Indonesian IR system. This presentation mostly covers the first two methods. The research discovers the phenomenon of similarities (and differences) of HR systems across the organisations and points out mimesis a mechanism that has brought about the phenomenon. It further reveals that social identity of the organisations play a part in the mimetic behaviour of the actors. In addition to that, it also shows that such phenomenon is linked to the interconnectivity of the HR actors within and across companies and also with other relevant actors. 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Motivation - This {{research}} aims at investigating emerging {{roles and}} forms of participation fostering design-use mediation during the Open Source Software design process Research approach - We compare online interactions for a successful "pushed-by-users" design process with unsuccessful previous proposals. The methodology developed, articulate structural analyses of the discussions (organization of discussions, participation) to actions to the code and documentation made by participants to the project. We focus on the useroriented and the developer-oriented <b>mailing-lists</b> of the Python project. Findings/Design - We find that key-participants, the cross-participants, foster the design process and act as boundary spanners between the users and the developers' communities. Research limitations/Implications - These findings can be reinforced developing software to automate the structural analysis of discussions and actions to the code and documentation. Further analyses, supported by these tools, {{will be necessary to}} generalise our results. Originality/Value - The analysis of participation among the three interaction spaces of OSS design (discussion, documentation and implementation) is the main originality of this work compared to other OSS research that mainly analyse one or two spaces. Take away message - Beside the idealistic picture that users may intervene freely in the process, OSS design is boost and framed by some key-participants and specific rules and there can be barriers to users' participatio...|$|R
