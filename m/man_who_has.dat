40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women <b>who</b> are HIV-positive in the United States, and to compare HIV prevalence rates between <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women exclusively. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports referencing HIV prevalence and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women. We searched PubMed and Ovid PsycINFO for peer-reviewed, U. S. -based articles reporting on HIV prevalence among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women. We conducted event rate, effect size, moderation and sensitivity analyses. Results: We estimate that 1. 0 % of U. S. males are bisexually-behaving, and that 121, 800 bisexually-behaving men are HIV-positive. Men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women are less than half {{as likely to be}} HIV-positive as <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only (16. 9 % vs. 33. 3 %; OR = 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 31, 0. 54), but more than five times as likely to be HIV-positive as <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women exclusively (18. 3 % vs. 3. 5 %; OR = 5. 71, 95 % CI: 3. 47, 9. 39). They are less likely to engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse than <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only (15. 9 % vs. 35. 0 %; OR = 0. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 28, 0. 46). Men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women in samples with high racial/ethnic minority proportions had significantly higher HIV prevalence than their counterparts in low racial/ethnic minority samples. Conclusions: This represents the first meta-analysis of HIV prevalence in the U. S. between <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only. Data collection, research, and HIV prevention and care delivery specifically tailored to <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women are necessary to better quantify and ameliorate this population's HIV burden. © 2014 Friedman et al...|$|R

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with men's views about condom use when having anal intercourse. Background Internationally, health promotion campaigns use behavioural change strategies to support <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to always use condoms when having anal sex with other men. The health promotion message given {{to this group}} is consistent and explicitly stated that ‘use a condom every time for anal sex regardless of relationship status’. Design Qualitative analysis of data from a cohort of New Zealand <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men.</b> Methods A total of 960 useable questionnaires were completed: 571 online and 389 in hard copy. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic data analytic process. Results Three themes relating to condom use in <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> were identified. These are as follows: ‘Safer sex is good sex’, ‘Condom use is good but …’ and ‘I use condoms sometimes’. Conclusions The range of responses towards condom use for anal sex in <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> in our sample reveal this as a complex public health issue, with not all <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> willing to consistently use condoms. Relevance to clinical practice It is important that nurses do not assume that all <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> are willing to use condoms for anal sex, and should create opportunities for <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to raise any concerns {{about the use of}} condoms. In this way, nurses can assist in providing information that may help <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to make decisions that will minimise risk of contracting infections associated with sexual activity...|$|R
2500|$|Some other {{cultures}} {{do not recognize}} a homosexual/heterosexual/bisexual distinction. It is common to distinguish a person's sexuality according to their sexual role (active/passive; insertive/penetrated). In this distinction, the passive role is typically associated with femininity or inferiority, while the active role is typically associated with masculinity or superiority. For example, an investigation of a small Brazilian fishing village revealed three sexual categories for men: <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex only with men (consistently in a passive role), <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex only with women, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women and men (consistently in an active role). [...] While <b>men</b> <b>who</b> consistently occupied the passive role were recognized as a distinct group by locals, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with only women, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women and men, were not differentiated. Little is known about same-sex attracted females, or sexual behavior between females in these cultures.|$|R

This study assessed a sample of 253 <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to determine if African-American (n = 79) and white (n = 174) men report different rates of HIV risk behaviors and differ in characteristics indicative of risk.

Multivariate analyses of covariance, controlling for group differences in age, education, and income, revealed that African-American <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> were less open about their sexual orientation, scored lower in HIV risk behavior knowledge, had more female sexual partners, and more frequently used cocaine in association with sex relative to white <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men.</b> Human immunodeficiency virus prevention programs tailored to the needs and risk issues of African-American <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> are needed...|$|R

5|$|Ray's {{last three}} films, made after his {{recovery}} and with medical strictures in place, were shot mostly indoors, {{and have a}} distinctive style. They have more dialogue than his earlier films and are often regarded as inferior to his earlier body of work. The first, Ganashatru (An Enemy of the People) is an adaptation of the famous Ibsen play, and considered the weakest of the three. Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree). In it, an old <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> lived a life of honesty, comes to learn of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill. Ray's last film, Agantuk (The Stranger), is lighter in mood but not in theme. When a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. This provokes far-ranging questions in the film about civilisation.|$|E

The Man ventures outside the office building he lives in, which is surrounded by a desert wasteland. A group of men are shown surviving in the wasteland. They hold a man, 'The Dwarf' (Maurice Lamy), captive, and force him to retrieve water for them. The <b>Man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been observing the survivors, makes his way to their camp, stabs their leader, 'The Captain' (Fritz Wepper) and retrieves a car battery.

He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now be free of the inquisitiveness and self-indulgence that drew him into many of his earlier misadventures.
