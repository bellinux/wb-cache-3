50|$|Requiring {{that two}} embeddings be isotopic is a {{stronger}} requirement than {{that they be}} homotopic.

Any homotopy from f to the identity would have to exchange the endpoints, which would mean {{that they would have}} to 'pass through' each other. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>f</b> has changed the orientation of the interval and g has not, which is impossible under an isotopy.

50|$|The {{operator}} I − Kf is a Fredholm {{operator of}} index zero. It has zero kernel {{and is therefore}} invertible. In fact an element in the kernel would consist {{of a pair of}} holomorphic functions on D and Dc which have smooth boundary values on the circle related by f. Since the holomorphic function on Dc vanishes at ∞, the positive powers of this pair also provide solutions, which are linearly independent, contradicting the fact that I − Kf is a Fredholm operator. The above equation therefore has a unique solution F which is smooth and from which f± can be reconstructed by reversing the steps above. Indeed, by looking at the equation satisfied by the logarithm of the derivative of F, it follows that F has nowhere vanishing derivative on the unit circle. <b>Moreover</b> <b>F</b> is one-to-one on the circle since if it assumes the value a at different points z1 and z2 then the logarithm of R(z) = (F(z) − a)/(z - z1)(z − z2) would satisfy an integral equation known to have no non-zero solutions. Given these properties on the unit circle, the required properties of f± then follow from the argument principle.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUltrafast laser pulses {{have become}} a {{promising}} tool for microsurgery of the eye. Due to the low energy threshold, side effects are limited to the micrometer range This precision {{enables the use of}} ultrashort laser pulses in a broad field of medical applications. Especially, the interaction process based on nonlinear absorption offers the opportunity to process transparent tissue not only on top of a surface but three dimensionally inside the bulk. This mechanism is used in refractive eye surgery, where fs pulses create flaps into the corneal tissue to remodel the curvature of the eye and to improve visual acuity. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>fs</b> pulses could be used to influence the biomechanics of the crystalline lens of the eye and improve accommodation on eyes who suffer from presbyopia...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the entropy increment and the viscosity dissipation in turbulent boundary-layer is systematically investigated. Through theoretical analysis and direct numerical simulation (DNS), an entropy function fs is proposed to distinguish the turbulent boundary-layer from the external flow. This approach is proved to be reliable after comparing its performance in the following complex flows, namely, low-speed airfoil flows with different wall temperature, supersonic cavity-ramp flow dominated by the combination of free-shear layer, larger recirculation and shocks, and the hypersonic flow past an aeroplane configuration. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>fs</b> is deduced {{from the point of}} energy, independent of any particular turbulent quantities. That is, this entropy concept could be utilized by other engineering applications related with turbulent boundary-layer, such as turbulence modelling transition prediction and engineering thermal protection...|$|R
