6000|$|After {{the lecture}} was over, the {{audience}} approached to examine us, taking {{a great many}} amiable liberties with our persons, and otherwise showing that we were deemed curiosities worthy of their study. The king's cousin, too, was not neglectful of us, but he had it announced to the assembly that we were entirely welcome to Leaphigh; and that, out of respect to Dr. Reasono, we were all promoted to the dignity of [...] "honorary monikins," [...] for the entire period of our stay in the country. He also caused it to be proclaimed that, if the boys annoyed us in the streets, they should have their tails curled with birch curling-irons. As for the Doctor himself, it was proclaimed that, {{in addition to his}} former title of F. U. D. G. E., he was now perferred* to be even <b>M.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>R.</b> E., and that he was also raised to the dignity of an H. O. A. X., the very highest honor to which any savant of Leaphigh could attain. [*sic] ...|$|E
60|$|Dr. Reasono had {{accordingly}} {{taken his}} {{departure from the}} capital for the mountains, where he instructed his wards in a practical commentary of {{the ups and downs}} of life, by exposing them on the verges of precipices and in the delights of the most fertile valleys (which, as he justly observed, was the greater danger of the two), leading them over flinty paths, hungry and cold, in order to try their tempers; and setting up establishments with the most awkward peasants for servants, to ascertain the depth of Chatterissa's philosophy; with a variety of similar ingenious devices, that will readily suggest themselves to all who have any matrimonial experience, whether they live in palaces or cottages. When this part of the trial was successfully terminated (the result having shown that the gentle Chatterissa was of proof, so far as mere temper was concerned), the whole party were ordered off to the barrier of ice, which divides the monikin from the human region, with a view to ascertain whether the warmth of their attachment was of a nature likely to resist the freezing collisions of the world. Here, unfortunately, (for the truth must be said), an unlucky desire of Dr. Reasono, who was already F. U. D. G. E., but who had a devouring ambition to become also <b>M.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>R.</b> E., led him into the extreme imprudence of pushing through an opening, where he had formerly discovered an island, on an ancient expedition of the same sort; and on which island he thought he saw a rock, that formed a stratum of what he believed to be a portion of the forty thousand square miles that were discomposed by the great eruption of the earth's boiler. The philosopher foresaw a thousand interesting results that were dependent on the ascertaining of this important fact; for all the learning of Leaphigh having been exhausted, some five hundred years before, in establishing the greatest distance to which any fragment had been thrown on that memorable occasion, great attention had latterly been given to the discovery of the least distance any fragment had been hurled. Perhaps I ought to speak tenderly of the consequences of a learned zeal, but it was entirely owing to this indiscretion that the whole party fell into the hands of certain mariners who were sealing on the northern shores of this very island, (friends and neighbors, as it afterwards appeared, of Captain Poke), who remorselessly seized upon the travellers, and sold them to a homeward-bound India-man, which they afterwards fell in with near the island of St. Helena--St. Helena! the tomb of him who is a model to all posterity, for the moderation of his desires, the simplicity of his character, a deep veneration for truth, profound reverence for justice, unwavering faith, and a clear appreciation of all the nobler virtues.|$|E

The main reason behind this choice is a personal interest in technical-scientific translation, especially in medical translation. Furthermore, this translation has been personally requested {{by one of the}} authors of the book, Dr. Mauro Fornari, in order to export the new and functional osteopathic method to assess the patient, that is discussed in this book. The dissertation consists of four chapters. Chapter one illustrates an analysis of specialized languages from a stylistic, textual, lexical and morphosyntactic point of view. Chapter two contains an analysis of the main features of medical language, both in Italian and English. Chapter three is focused on corpus linguistics and the use of corpora in specialized translation, it includes a brief introduction to the Osteopathic practice, and contains the translation of chapters 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 of Osteopatia come Medicina di Terreno. And finally, chapter four contains an analysis of the problems found during the translation process, and a proposal for their resolution...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{municipal}} affairs in Saudi Arabia have gone {{through a number of}} administrative and organizational reforms ranging from the establishment of a new Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs (<b>M.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>R.</b> A.) in 1975 to the creation of municipal branches in the city of Ar-Riyadh. The main intention, however, has been the introduction of municipal decentralization. ^ Though one cannot ignore the fact that such endeavors have, to some extent, helped the central ministry and the municipalities to lessen some of their administrative work load, their outcomes did not match their original goals. The major findings of this research confirm that a gap still persists between the municipal ordinance and its application {{on the one hand and}} the municipal practice on the other. The findings also include the existence of strong, unique and sometimes conflicting needs and justifications for both centralization and decentralization. Therefore, attempts to decentralize the municipal system have been seriously hampered by the existence of a high degree of municipal fiscal dependence, the lack of effective public participation, and the indiscriminate application of standard municipal policies, regulations, and building codes to the different regions in the country. ^ Focusing on both the <b>M.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>R.</b> A. and the Ar-Riyadh Municipality, and considering the unique conditions of Saudi Arabia, this study aimed to develop a middle range alternative that could incorporate the best element of the existing centralized municipal planning system and the attempted decentralized one. Unless the need for both centralization and decentralization is recognized and adopted in one strategy with careful design and consideration of hierarchical municipal goals and their incremental implementation, the municipalities will continue swinging between the two concepts and the gaps between municipal vision and reality will keep widening. ^ The study concludes by proposing a number of municipal organizational and procedural reforms. Included are rethinking municipal ordinances, regulations, and building codes, proliferating the Idea of Ar-Riyadh High Commission, creating a public participation unit in <b>M.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>R.</b> A., creating municipal majlis Ash-Shura, and Creating municipal think tanks. ...|$|R
