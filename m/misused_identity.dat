A chain is a collaboration of {{a great number of}} autonomous organisations and professionals to tackle a dominant chain problem. In many chains identity fraud is an aspect of the dominant chain problem. Identity fraud is using some-body else's identity with malicious intent to acquire goods or rights that one is not entitled to. Traces inherently point to the victim, the culprit remaining hidden behind the <b>misused</b> <b>identity.</b> Therefore, only prevention can effectively reduce identity fraud by deterring a fraudster or getting him caught red-handed. Prevention in a chain process can be achieved by simultaneous multifactor identity verifications (token, PIN, transaction code, etc.), because an identity fraudster is unable to manipulate them all consistently at the same time. Multifactor identity verification in a closed interactive communication loop also produces meta-data (for example, the result of a calculation or a telephone number) {{that can be used for}} consistency checking, as well...|$|E

To identifying or confirming {{the identity of}} an individual employee their name and signature is not enough, because any one can <b>misuse</b> other's <b>identity</b> so these type of problem occur in today. To overcome this problem we can use fingerprint recognition by which we can easily recognize any person, because human fingerprints are unique to each person and {{can be regarded as}} some sort of signature, certifying the person's identity. In this paper we propose a method for fingerprint matching based on minutiae matching. In addition, this paper describes all the records of employee and introduces verification of fingerprints without any biometric device...|$|R

This issue is heightened by the growing sophistication of business transactions using payment cards, causing its policing to be increasingly difficult. Both public and private sector organizations are required by law to comply with industry standards for information technology security and these standards normally mandate the creation of security policies and audit trails for these enterprises, especially from key systems holding sensitive information. Enterprise architects have traditionally defined security policy and relied upon technical controls to secure enterprise systems against cyber threats and misuse. However, within ever-more complex transactional information systems it is difficult to achieve compliance and analyze security policy rules without the ability to capture and model the complexity of security at a business level. Using a simple financial trading case study as an illustration, we propose a semantic approach to security policy reasoning using conceptual graphs. This approach provides ontology that enables enterprise architects to capture the semantics of fraudulent transactions through security policy rules...|$|R

These methods have already been used for hundreds of years for the identification of people and for various solutions of security. Today, these biometric methods are improved and connected with the modern information technology. The advantage of biometric methods is based on the identification of the basic essence of a man. Therefore, they are characterized by a high degree of protection against misuse and to following <b>misuse</b> of <b>identity</b> in comparison to a simple function of identification chip or another identification medium. The theoretical part consists of a description of a professional terminology primarily of a description of the biometrical authentication methods. Further on, there is an implementation of analysis of available solutions of biometrical systems in the environment of the Czech market. The choice of the biometrical system for the application in the practical part of this project has been made based on this information. Own project of authentication people at primary school with a help of used biometrical methods is proposed in practical part. And this method will be tested on available devices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recently, some crimes {{have been}} {{committed}} {{through the use of}} office uniforms. Criminals misusing office uniforms currently target the general public, but companies and offices may suffer significant losses once criminals begin to target them. For instance, imagine a criminal obtaining the staff uniform of an airline company. They could convincingly deceive on-duty staff in order to enter an airport building and commit a serious crime. Consequently, we are proposing a system to satisfy the following requirements. (1) It will be possible to prevent incidents where office uniforms are misused by criminals. (2) Employees can judge for themselves whether the person wearing the uniform is a real employee or not. (3) It will be possible to quickly determine whether any unauthorized person wearing an office uniform has mingled with real employees in the office.

This paper reviews {{the manner in}} which transnational electronic crimes involving <b>misuse</b> of <b>identity</b> take place, and considers various legislative, technological and risk-management responses available to deal with them. It is concluded that although technology will provide some of the solutions, these need to be supported by a simple and effective legal regime to ensure that instances of abuse can be prosecuted and that individual privacy is safeguarded. Rather than relying totally on the deterrent effects of criminal prosecution and punishment, those who travel through cyberspace need to be made aware of the risks they face and how best to protect themselves. The Nature of Cross-border Identity-related Crime Throughout history people have sought to disguise their true identities for nefarious purposes. Outlaws invariably used masks to cover their faces while pirates on the high seas sometimes flew the flag of another innocent ship in order to approach their victim without alerting them to their true identity and purpose. Murderers have used aliases and planted false evidence in order to commit crimes and incriminate innocent people-sometimes leading to wrongful arrest of those whom they have implicated-and tragically, sometimes resulting in the execution of innocent people. More recently we have seen an escalation in such acts of deception, and particularly those involving cross-border activities. The alleged terrorists who destroyed the World Trade Centre were said to have used other people's names when undertaking their pilot training and when boarding the aircraft prior t...|$|R
40|$|This book chapter was {{originally}} written {{for a conference}} on privacy and security at Stanford Law School held in March 2004. The chapter argues that abuses of personal information are caused by the failure to regulate the way companies manage personal information. Despite taking elaborate technological measures to protect their data systems, companies readily disseminate the personal information they have collected {{to a host of}} other entities and sometimes even to anyone willing to pay a small fee. Companies provide access to their record systems over the phone to anybody in possession of a few easy-to-find pieces of personal information such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, and mothers 2 ̆ 7 maiden names. Reforming this problematic state of affairs requires a rethinking of the way the law comprehends the abuse of personal information. The law fails to focus on the causes of information abuses; instead, it becomes involved when information <b>misuses</b> such as <b>identity</b> theft actually occur, not earlier on in the process. If the law addressed information leaks and insecurity, it would more effectively curtail abuses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a decision}} of the Hungarian Constitutional Court issued in December 2016, in which the judges refer to the country’s constitutional identityto justify the government’s refusal to apply the EU’s refugee relocation scheme in Hungary. The <b>misuse</b> of constitutional <b>identity,</b> the paper argues cannot be derived from the previous jurisprudence of the Court. Right {{before and after the}} EU accession of the country the Court followed a mild approach of limited EU law primacy approach, which did not change immediately after Viktor Orbán’s government introduced an illiberal constitutional system and packed the Constitutional Court after 2010. The reason for change has been the government’s anti-migration policy, and the Court was instrumental to justify the government’s desire to exclude refugees from Hungary and to evade its obligations under European law. The paper concludes that this abuse of constitutional identity for merely nationalistic political purposes discredits every genuine and legitimate reference to national constitutional identity claims, and strengthens the calls for an end of constitutional pluralism in the EU altogether...|$|R
40|$|Internet banking {{has become}} popular for wired and {{wireless}} users. However, the existing Internet banking systems {{still have some}} serious security issues such as fraud and <b>identity</b> <b>misuse.</b> Since Internet banking users {{want to be able}} to do their banking anytime anywhere and banking employees need to perform and share their financial tasks, it is difficult to find a secure Internet banking architecture which can provide early fraud detection and prevent external and internal attacks on transactions. Previous research for Internet banking fraud detection and prevention has limitations including the employment of weak cryptographic operations or long term shared keys and public keys. Currently, there is no secure architecture that facilitates fraud detection and prevention in Internet banking system with efficient record tracing mechanism. Preventing external fraudsters and detecting internal fraud attacks remain a challenge for the protection of financial transactions in Internet banking system. This thesis proposes a secure Internet banking architecture and a new Internet banking protocol for fraud detection and prevention with efficient record tracing. The architecture mainly consists of detection and prevention engines which work with the proposed protocol. The detection and prevention engines are supported by our proposed dynamic key and group key schemes to facilitate fraud detection and prevention. This allows the employment of advanced biometric measures and smart cards to reduce <b>identity</b> <b>misuse.</b> The dynamic key generation scheme is proposed to generate unique sequence of dynamic keys that will be used only once to strengthen users’ authentication and identification for external Internet banking users. The group key management scheme is proposed to enforce strong access control, policy management, and record tracing for internal bank employees. The proposed Internet banking protocol applies the dynamic key and group key schemes to perform authentication verification for individuals and groups of users and secure communications between the engaged parties. The architecture can also be used to assess other security architectures, and thus makes a valuable contribution to the field of Internet banking systems security. Security analysis and evaluation is presented in this thesis to evaluate the security of the proposed Internet banking architecture. The evaluations show that using dynamic key and group key schemes with our proposed architecture and protocol can offer strong authentication for individuals and groups of users. This evaluation indicates that the security architecture is balanced with the two fraud prevention and detection engines. It also shows that the security architecture overcomes the security issues and limitations of the existing fraud prevention and detection measures as well as secure financial transactions in Internet banking system. It also satisfies the security goals including authentication, authorization, record tracing, and it facilitates fraud prevention and detection in Internet banking system. The architecture is also adaptable to any new biometric and smart card technologies...|$|R
40|$|Mobile agent {{technology}} is a paradigm where a program can move autonomously in the different executable environment of a network. The program is the mobile agent, that can move its code, suspend and resume the execution in the new environment. The use of a mobile agent provides numerous benefits over the traditional paradigm like client-server. It reduces the network traffic, connection time and bandwidth consumption by the moving agent between the client and server. However, the security issue of the mobile agent makes difficult to acquire the benefits. The HTML 5 -based mobile agent framework was developed in Tampere University of Technology (TUT). The core of this thesis is to secure the mobile agent framework. The security threats to the mobile agent and agent platform are classified to design and implement a secure framework. These threats are the agent attacking platform, platform attacking agent, agent attacking agent and agent system attacked by external entities. This thesis focuses first two threats and provides a solution to protect mobile agent framework against them. The solution uses a signing method that involves salting and hashing of source address to generate signature. Furthermore, the RSA encryption using the static private key of an agent origin server to create a signature. The signature moves along with the agent and {{it is used to}} verify the agent source address using a static public key. This verification ensures that particular agent comes from the legitimate source and it is trusted as a non-malicious in the current platform. This solution overcomes the security issues like unauthorized access to the data, changing the agent and platform code, the <b>misuse</b> of others <b>identity,</b> eavesdropping and altering the important information, the excessive use of the resources etc. Also, the implementation helps to minimize the problems in agent mobility, agent and platform communication and identification of agents...|$|R
40|$|Several {{factors are}} driving the {{transition}} from paper-based health records to electronic health record systems. In the United States, the adoption rate of electronic health record systems significantly increased after "Meaningful Use" incentive program was started in 2009. While increased use of electronic health record systems could improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare services, it {{can also lead to}} a number of security and privacy issues, such as identity theft and healthcare fraud. Such incidents could have negative impact on trustworthiness of electronic health record technology itself and thereby could limit its benefits. In this dissertation, we tackle three challenges that we believe are important to improve the security and privacy in electronic health record systems. Our approach is based on an analysis of real-world incidents, namely theft and <b>misuse</b> of patient <b>identity,</b> unauthorized usage and update of electronic health records, and threats from insiders in healthcare organizations. Our contributions include design and development of a user-centric monitoring agent system that works on behalf of a patient (i. e., an end user) and securely monitors usage of the patient's identity credentials as well as access to her electronic health records. Such a monitoring agent can enhance patient's awareness and control and improve accountability for health records even in a distributed, multi-domain environment, which is typical in an e-healthcare setting. This will reduce the risk and loss caused by misuse of stolen data. In addition to the solution from a patient's perspective, we also propose a secure system architecture {{that can be used in}} healthcare organizations to enable robust auditing and management over client devices. This helps us further enhance patients' confidence in secure use of their health data. PhDCommittee Chair: Mustaque Ahamad; Committee Member: Douglas M.

40|$|We are {{the middle}} of a global {{identity}} crisis. New notions of identity are made possible in the online world where people eagerly share their personal data and leave ‘digital footprints'. Multiple, partial identities emerge distributed across cyberspace divorced from the physical person. The representation of personal characteristics in data sets, together with developing technologies and systems for identity management, in turn change how we are identified. Trustworthy means of electronic identification is now a key issue for business, governments and individuals in the fight against online identity crime. Yet, along with the increasing economic value of digital identity, there are also risks of <b>identity</b> <b>misuse</b> by organisations that mine large data sets for commercial purposes and in some cases by governments. Data proliferation and the non-transparency of processing practices make it impossible for the individual to track and police their use. Potential risks encompass not only threats to our privacy, but also knowledge-engineering that can falsify digital profiles attributed to us with harmful consequences. This panel session will address some of the big challenges around identity in the digital age and what they mean for policy and law (its regulation and protection). Questions for discussion include: What does identity mean today? What types of legal solutions are fit for purpose to protect modern identity interests? What rights, obligations and responsibilities should be associated with our digital identities? Should identity management be regulated and who should be held liable and for what? What should be the role of private and public sectors in identity assurance schemes? What are the global drivers of identity policies? How can due process be ensured where automated technologies affect the rights and concerns of citizens? How can individuals be more empowered to control their identity data and give informed consent to its use? How are biometrics and location tracking devices used in body surveillance changing the identity landscape...|$|R
40|$|To support {{emerging}} online {{activities within}} the digital information infrastructure, such as commerce, healthcare, entertainment and scientific collaboration, {{it is increasingly}} important to verify and protect the digital identity of the individuals involved. Identity management systems manage the digital identity life cycle of individuals which includes issuance, usage and revocation of digital identifiers. ^ Identity management systems have improved the management of identity information and user convenience; however they do not provide specific solutions to address protection of identity from threats such as identity theft and privacy violation. One major shortcoming of current approaches {{is the lack of}} strong verification techniques for issuance and usage of digital identifiers. In the absence of verification mechanisms, digital identifiers can be <b>misused</b> to commit <b>identity</b> theft. Another shortcoming is the inability of individuals to disclose minimal data while satisfying strong identity verification requirements. The extraneous data collected can potentially be aggregated or used in a manner that would lead to violation of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s privacy. Finally, current identity management systems do not consider biometric and history-based identifiers. Such identifiers are increasingly becoming an integral part of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s identity. Such types of identity data also need to be used with other digital identifiers and protected against misuse. ^ In this thesis we introduce a number of techniques that address the above problems. Our approach is based on the concept of privacy preserving multi-factor identity verification. The technique consists of verifying multiple identifier claims of an individual, without revealing extraneous identity information. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that we employ identity protection and verification techniques in all stages of the identity life cycle. We also enhance our approach with the use of biometric and history-based identifiers. In particular we provide the following key contributions: (1) A new cryptographic primitive referred to as aggregate proof of knowledge to achieve privacy preserving multi-factor verification. This primitive uses aggregate signatures on commitments that are then used for aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPK) protocols. Our cryptographic scheme is better in terms of the performance, flexibility and storage requirements than existing efficient ZKPK techniques that may be used to prove, under zero-knowledge, the knowledge of multiple secrets. (2) Algorithms to generate biometric keys reliably from an individual 2 ̆ 7 s biometric images. These keys are used to create biometric commitments that are subsequently used to perform multi-factor identity verification using ZKPK. Several factors, including various traditional identity attributes, can thus be used in conjunction with one or more biometrics of the individual. We also ensure security and privacy of the biometric data and show how the biometric key is not revealed even if all the data, including cryptographic secrets, stored at the client machine are compromised. (3) A series of protocols for the establishment and management of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s transaction history-based identifiers encoded as receipts from e-commerce transactions. These receipt protocols satisfy the security and privacy requirements related to the management of the electronic receipts. We also demonstrate how the users receipt protocols can be employed in the context of mobile phones. In particular we provide techniques to manage the portable identity information on such devices, and use them at physical locations of the service providers. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a digital}} world, users’ Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is {{normally}} managed {{with a system}} called an Identity Management System (IMS). There are many types of IMSs. There are situations when two or more IMSs need {{to communicate with each}} other (such as when a service provider needs to obtain some identity information about a user from a trusted identity provider). There could be interoperability issues when communicating parties use different types of IMS. To facilitate interoperability between different IMSs, an Identity Meta System (IMetS) is normally used. An IMetS can, at least theoretically, join various types of IMSs to make them interoperable and give users the illusion that they are interacting with just one IMS. However, due to the complexity of an IMS, attempting to join various types of IMSs is a technically challenging task, let alone assessing how well an IMetS manages to integrate these IMSs. The first contribution of this thesis is the development of a generic IMS model called the Layered Identity Infrastructure Model (LIIM). Using this model, we develop a set of properties that an ideal IMetS should provide. This idealized form is then used as a benchmark to evaluate existing IMetSs. Different types of IMS provide varying levels of privacy protection support. Unfortunately, as observed by Jøsang et al (2007), there is insufficient privacy protection in many of the existing IMSs. In this thesis, we study and extend a type of privacy enhancing technology known as an Anonymous Credential System (ACS). In particular, we extend the ACS which is built on the cryptographic primitives proposed by Camenisch, Lysyanskaya, and Shoup. We call this system the Camenisch, Lysyanskaya, Shoup - Anonymous Credential System (CLS-ACS). The goal of CLS-ACS is to let users be as anonymous as possible. Unfortunately, CLS-ACS has problems, including (1) the concentration of power to a single entity - known as the Anonymity Revocation Manager (ARM) - who, if malicious, can trivially reveal a user’s PII (resulting in an illegal revocation of the user’s anonymity), and (2) poor performance due to the resource-intensive cryptographic operations required. The second and third contributions of this thesis are the proposal of two protocols that reduce the trust dependencies on the ARM during users’ anonymity revocation. Both protocols distribute trust from the ARM to a set of n referees (n > 1), resulting in a significant reduction of the probability of an anonymity revocation being performed illegally. The first protocol, called the User Centric Anonymity Revocation Protocol (UCARP), allows a user’s anonymity to be revoked in a user-centric manner (that is, the user is aware that his/her anonymity is about to be revoked). The second protocol, called the Anonymity Revocation Protocol with Re-encryption (ARPR), allows a user’s anonymity to be revoked by a service provider in an accountable manner (that is, there is a clear mechanism to determine which entity who can eventually learn - and possibly <b>misuse</b> - the <b>identity</b> of the user). The fourth contribution of this thesis is the proposal of a protocol called the Private Information Escrow bound to Multiple Conditions Protocol (PIEMCP). This protocol is designed to address the performance issue of CLS-ACS by applying the CLS-ACS in a federated single sign-on (FSSO) environment. Our analysis shows that PIEMCP can both reduce the amount of expensive modular exponentiation operations required and lower the risk of illegal revocation of users’ anonymity. Finally, the protocols proposed in this thesis are complex and need to be formally evaluated to ensure that their required security properties are satisfied. In this thesis, we use Coloured Petri nets (CPNs) and its corresponding state space analysis techniques. All of the protocols proposed in this thesis have been formally modeled and verified using these formal techniques. Therefore, the fifth contribution of this thesis is a demonstration of the applicability of CPN and its corresponding analysis techniques in modeling and verifying privacy enhancing protocols. To our knowledge, this is the first time that CPN has been comprehensively applied to model and verify privacy enhancing protocols. From our experience, we also propose several CPN modeling approaches, including complex cryptographic primitives (such as zero-knowledge proof protocol) modeling, attack parameterization, and others. The proposed approaches can be applied to other security protocols, not just privacy enhancing protocols...|$|R
