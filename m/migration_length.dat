40|$|It {{has been}} shown that many of the {{phenomena}} related to the formation of "tails" in the low-concentration region of ion-implanted impurity distribution are due to the anomalous diffusion of nonequilibrium impurity interstitials. These phenomena include boron implantation in preamorphized silicon, a "hot" implantation of indium ions, annealing of ion-implanted layers et cetera. In particular, to verify this microscopic mechanism, a simulation of boron redistribution during low-temperature annealing of ion-implanted layers has been carried out under different conditions of transient enhanced diffusion suppression. Due to the good agreement with the experimental data, the values of the average <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> of nonequilibrium impurity interstitials have been obtained. It {{has been shown}} that for boron implanted into a silicon layer preamorphized by germanium ions the average <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> of impurity interstitials at the annealing temperature of 800 Celsius degrees be reduced from 11 nm to approximately 6 nm due to additional implantation of nitrogen. The further shortening of the average <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> is observed if the processing temperature is reduced to 750 Celsius degrees. It is also found that for implantation of BF 2 ions into silicon crystal, the value of the average <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> of boron interstitials is equal to 7. 2 nm for thermal treatment at a temperature of 800 Celsius degrees.

40|$|B {{diffusion}} in crystalline Ge is investigated under equilibrium and non-equilibrium {{conditions in}} a large temperature range (200 - 800 degrees C), in order to discriminate the role of self-interstitials (Is) and the energy barriers involved in the microscopic mechanism of B migration. To this aim, we copiously furnished Is by 200 or 300 key H+ irradiation, and performed a direct comparison with B diffusion in thermal conditions at the same temperature (T). The diffused profiles of B were simulated assuming the kick-out model, and the extracted parameters (<b>migration</b> <b>length,</b> lambda, and formation rate of mobile B, g) indicated that the B diffusion is always mediated by Is showing different features at low and high T regimes. For T lower than 600 degrees C the thermal generation of Is is negligible and the only barrier to g (measured {{to be similar to}} 0. 1 eV) is due to the Is migration and B mobile formation. At T higher than 600 degrees C, the thermal generation of Is starts to overcome the Is supply from the irradiation, and the activation energy of g increases to 3. 0 - 3. 5 eV. The <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> in the low-T regime has the largest value (similar to 20 nm), while it decreases down to 1 - 2 nm by increasing T, showing a negative activation energy of similar to- 0. 64 eV, compatible with a dissociation process which stops the diffusion event. In this regard, we observed that the mobile B <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> depends only on T, regardless of the point defects concentration. These results and the energy barriers measurements contribute to a further comprehension of the B diffusion and point defects in crystalline Ge. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{movement}} of heterogeneously skilled workers between distinct labor markets, both internally and internationally, is intrinsically {{linked to the}} global flow of capital and goods as this flow of factors determines the returns to labor in an economy. This dissertation seeks to explore and quantify those links. The first chapter explores a specific migration restriction policy, temporary workers 2 ̆ 7 permits, and its feasibility. Taking into account the savings behavior of workers who migrate temporarily, a model derives the optimal <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> {{from the point of}} view of the host country, and the possible <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> that could pass a majority vote. The second essay shows that the relationship between the flow of goods and labor is dependent on the investment structure of an economy. Specifically, the impact of trade on skill migration from developing to developed countries depends on how capital adjusts in the sending economy relative to the receiving one. The third essay looks at the impact of reduced trade restrictions on the internal migration of workers between the tradable and nontradable sector in light of persistent unemployment in an open economy. Results show that the effect of trade on the size of the informal nontradable sector could be magnified or might disappear depending on the level of labor market regulations. ...|$|E

Intraperitoneal mesenchymal cells (PMC) play supportive roles in metastasis formation on the peritoneum. In this study, we found that PMC, when co-cultuerd with human gastric cancer cells, MKN 45, enhanced the proliferation of MKN 45 when cultured at low, but not high, cellular density. Also, PMC suppressed apoptotic cell death of MKN 45 only under low density culture conditions. Time-lapse videoanalysis clearly demonstrated that PMC randomly migrated more vigorously than did MKN 45, and strongly enhanced the migration behavior of co-cultured MKN 45. In fact, the majority of MKN 45 migrated together in direct physical contact with PMC, and the sum of <b>migration</b> <b>lengths</b> from original position of co-cultured MKN 45 for 48 hours was approximately 10 times longer than that of MKN 45 cultured alone. Our data suggest that enhanced migration can increase the chance of direct contact or positional proximity among sparcely distributed MKN 45, which may bring survival advantages to tumor cells. This {{may be one of the}} important mechanisms of peritoneal metastasis, since only {{a small number of}} tumor cells are considered to be disseminated in the early step of metastasis formation on the peritoneum...|$|R

The fractions of eigen abundance fit a geometric series as do the eigenvalues of the integral transform which kernel is a generalized coherent state. The “asymmetric generalized coherent state” models the measured data, where the profiles of mRNA abundance levels of most genes as well as the distribution of the peaks of these profiles fit asymmetric Gaussians. We hypothesize that the asymmetry in the distribution of the peaks of the profiles is due to two competing evolutionary forces.

The fertile isotope of Thorium (Th- 232) {{can be converted to}} fissile isotope U- 233 by neutron capture during the operation of a suitable nuclear reactor such as High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR). However, the fertile Thorium needs a fissile supporter to start and maintain the conversion process such as U- 235 or Pu- 239. This report presents the results of a study that analyzed the thorium utilization in a prismatic HTGR, namely Modular High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (MHTGR) that was designed by General Atomics (GA).

As part of the transmutation analysis efforts within the Fuel Cycle Research and Development (FCR&D) campaign, a need was identified for detailed discharge isotopics from HTRs {{for use in the}} VISION code. A conventional HTR using enriched uranium in UCO fuel was modeled having discharge burnup of 120 GWd/MTiHM. Also, a deep burn HTR (DB-HTR) was modeled burning transuranic (TRU) -only TRU-O 2 fuel to a discharge burnup of 648 GWd/MTiHM. For each of these cases, unit cell depletion calculations were performed with SCALE/TRITON. Unit cells were used to perform this analysis using SCALE 6. 1. Because of the long mean free paths (and <b>migration</b> <b>lengths)</b> of neutrons in HTRs, using a unit cell to represent a whole core can be non-trivial. The sizes of these cells were first set by using Serpent calculations to match a spectral index between unit cell and whole core domains. In the case of the DB-HTR, the unit cell which was arrived at in this way conserved the ratio of fuel to moderator found in a single block of fuel. In the conventional HTR case, a larger moderator-to-fuel ratio than that of a single block was needed to simulate the whole core spectrum. Discharge isotopics (for 500 nuclides) and one-group cross-sections (for 1022 nuclides) were delivered to the transmutation analysis team. This report provides documentation for these calculations.

40|$|Modeling of the {{phosphorus}} radiation-enhanced diffusion in {{the course}} of implantation of high-energy protons into an elevated-temperature silicon substrate and during its treatment in a hydrogen-containing plasma with addition of a diffusant has been carried out. It follows from the results obtained that the radiation-enhanced diffusion occurs by means of formation, migration, and dissociation of "impurity atom [...] silicon self-interstitial" pairs being in a local thermodynamic equilibrium with substitutionally dissolved impurity atoms and nonequilibrium point defects generated due to external irradiation. The resulting value of the average <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> of nonequilibrium silicon self-interstitials decreases from 0. 19 micrometer for proton energy of 140 keV to 0. 09 and 0. 08 micrometer for energies of 110 and 80 keV, respectively. The decrease of the average <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> with the proton energy can be due to the interaction of silicon self-interstitials with the vacancies generated at the surface or with the defects formed in the phosphorus implanted region. Based on the pair diffusion mechanism, a theoretical investigation of the form of impurity profiles that can be created in thin silicon layers due to the radiation-enhanced diffusion was carried out. It is shown that depletion of the uniformly doped silicon layer occurs during plasma treatment except for the silicon [...] insulator interface where a narrow region with a high impurity concentration is formed. The results of calculations give a clear evidence in favor of further investigation of various doping processes based on the radiation-enhanced diffusion, especially the processes of plasma doping, to develop a cheap method for the formation of strictly assigned impurity distributions in the local semiconductor domains.

Similarly, the average base diameters decrease due to the limited In <b>migration</b> <b>length</b> with increasing AsH 3 partial pressure. In addition, considering the kinetics of MOCVD growth, the initial formation of QDs is not in the thermal equilibrium; thus, increasing coverage also leads to the development of small QDs into energetically favorable large-sized QDs.
