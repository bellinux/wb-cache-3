40|$|This study {{investigated}} resiliency using the Resiliency Scale of Children and Adolescents (RSCA; Prince-Embury, 2007) grounded in three factors (i. e., Sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery,</b> Sense <b>of</b> relatedness, and Emotional reactivity) {{in a sample}} of 599 Lebanese adolescents. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the relationships between resiliency factors, the Big Five personality traits and Hope. We also explored gender differences in the key study variables. As a secondary aim, we compared differences in resiliency scores of the present Lebanese sample and a comparative US sample of adolescents (taken from Prince-Embury 2 ̆ 6 Steer, 2010). Emotional stability correlated negatively with Emotional reactivity, and positively with Sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery.</b> Openness to experience also correlated positively with Sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> and Sense <b>of</b> relatedness. Global hope correlated positively with Sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> and Sense <b>of</b> relatedness. Females scored higher on Emotional reactivity (marginally) and Sense of relatedness than males did. Lastly, Lebanese adolescents scored higher on Sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> and Sense <b>of</b> relatedness, and lower on Emotional reactivity than US adolescents. Finally, the relevance of the findings on resiliency in adolescents and the role of psychologist and education professionals are discussed, along with implications and recommendations for future research...|$|R
40|$|Current {{literature}} is inconsistent {{about the role}} <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> in the relation between perceived ethnic discrimination and depression. While on the one hand, higher levels <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> are theorized to buffer against the impact of perceived ethnic discrimination, on the other hand, ethnic discrimination is thought to lower one’s level <b>of</b> <b>mastery,</b> explaining negative health outcomes. Using structural equation modeling, this study examined both roles <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> in the relation between perceived ethnic discrimination and depression in a large multi-ethnic sample of immigrant adults in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it was explored whether the role <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> was dependent upon {{the severity of the}} discrimination perceived. As was expected, perceptions of ethnic discrimination were positively related to depression symptomatology. This relation was both mediated and moderated by <b>mastery,</b> regardless <b>of</b> the level of discrimination one perceived. Implications for the counseling practice are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Alexander Wynne, {{author of}} The Origin of Buddhist Meditation, observes that formless {{meditation}} and elemental meditation might have {{originated in the}} Upanishadic tradition. The earliest reference to meditation is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, {{one of the oldest}} Upanishads. Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies (prana). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (nadis) are also described in the Upanishad. Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> body and senses.|$|E
30|$|The sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery,</b> {{which is}} {{conceptualized}} as a coping mechanism to reduce stress, was proposed by Pearlin and Schooler (Pearlin and Schooler 1978). According to Pearlin, mastery is a self-belief, {{a conviction that}} {{people are able to}} control the important circumstances currently impinging on their life (Pearlin 2010). That sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> is a protective resource with a stress-moderating capacity that has been repeatedly tested since the Sense <b>of</b> <b>Mastery</b> Scale (SOMS) was developed by Pearlin et al. in the 1970 s (Pearlin and Bierman 2013). The sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> also tends to develop from a background of successful attainment of socially prized goals, and therefore is related to advantageous socio-economic status (Pearlin et al. 2007).|$|R

5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E

5|$|Gregory {{was also}} one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an {{institution}} was inherently sinful.

Although aspects of the slave system had been criticized by Stoics such as Seneca, this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world.|$|E

Attempting to combine Michelangelo's <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E

5|$|After swiftly {{recovering}} from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy.

The Samnites were a people just as martial and as rich as the Romans and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The First Samnite War of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the Battle of Mount Gaurus in 342 BC and the Battle of Suessula in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.|$|E

The pharaohs Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor, Ahmose I, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypt's borders and attempting to gain <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> the Near East.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To assess if {{older people}} {{with higher levels}} of social capital {{experience}} higher levels <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> than those with lower levels of social capital and to assess whether this association is stronger for retired older people than for older workers. Methods: The data originates from a general population mental health survey conducted among 2610 older people (50 years of age or older) in Finland in 2011. The response rate was 57. 1 %. The association between sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery,</b> measured by Pearlin’s Sense <b>of</b> <b>Mastery</b> Scale, and social capital, measured by social networks, organisational activities, trust, and sense of belonging, were tested by logistic regression analyses. Results: The results showed that older workers experienced greater sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> than retired older people. Trust and neighbourhood belonging were positively associated with sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery.</b> Conclusions: Inequalities in mental wellbeing between older people included in or excluded from the workforce are a public health challenge. Our findings imply that social capital needs to be prioritised as a means for enhancing mental health. More attention should be paid to promote mental wellbeing in retired older people...|$|R
