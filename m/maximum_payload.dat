A Block 4 upgrade is reportedly being examined, which may increase power by up to 26 percent, producing close to 10,000hp, and improve fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|Its major {{components}} were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which {{was bigger than}} the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643km (115–400 miles) and carry a <b>maximum</b> <b>payload</b> (to low orbit) of 24,400kg (54,000lb).

This paper makes {{a study of}} the <b>maximum</b> {{watermarking}} <b>payload</b> of spatial domain image under the conditions of invisibility, in another word, the <b>maximum</b> embedding <b>payload.</b> Different area has the different payload capacity. For example, the payload of high roughness and perceptual invisibility areas is higher than the area of low roughness and visual sensitive areas. This article does not do further research of this aspect; it is the deficiency of this article and also further research directions of ours, which is closer to the practical applications.|$|R
30|$|Generally speaking, {{improving}} the embedding intensity {{can increase the}} resistance capacity and robustness of smoothing, slightly recompression, Gaussian low-pass filtering, and LSB steganlysis attacks. However, the robustness of sharpen; geometric transform attacks cannot be strengthened. Therefore, robustness is not wholly decided by embedding intensity. This article is only an embedding payload reference to the watermarking researchers. According to this purpose, we do the research of the upper limit of embedding payload. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide payload reference for watermarking researchers. To achieve this purpose, this paper studies the <b>maximum</b> <b>payloads</b> under different intensities.|$|R
5000|$|Maximum monthly payload: This is {{the amount}} of data that an Internet {{connection}} would be able to carry in a hypothetical setting assuming no bottlenecks external to the ISP. In the example Antel 20Mbs fiber connection (see Uruguay above), the <b>maximum</b> monthly <b>payload</b> in that hypothetical setting would be reached by running the connection at 20Mbs for the first 150 GB, and at 2Mbs {{for the rest of the}} month. Thus the <b>maximum</b> monthly <b>payload</b> of that connection is 60,000 seconds * 2.5 MB/s + 2,532,000 seconds * 0.25 MB/s = 783 GB (about the size of a large laptop disk drive in 2013.) ...|$|R
25|$|Compliance - this is {{a measure}} of the amount in angle or {{distance}} that a robot axis will move when a force is applied to it. Because of compliance when a robot goes to a position carrying its <b>maximum</b> <b>payload</b> it will be at a position slightly lower than when it is carrying no payload. Compliance can also be responsible for overshoot when carrying high payloads in which case acceleration would need to be reduced.|$|E
25|$|The 747-400F (Freighter) is an all freight {{version of}} the 747-400. While using the updated systems and wing design of the {{passenger}} versions, it features the original short upper deck found on the classic 747s to reduce weight. The 747-400F has a maximum takeoff weight of 875,000 pounds (396,890 kg) and a <b>maximum</b> <b>payload</b> of 274,100 pounds (124,330 kg). The −400F can be easily distinguished from the passenger −400 by its shorter upper-deck hump and lack of windows along the main deck.|$|E
25|$|The Tu-154S is an all-cargo or {{freighter}} {{version of}} the Tu-154B, using a strengthened floor, and adding a forward cargo door {{on the port side}} of the fuselage. The airplane could carry nine Soviet PAV-3 pallets. <b>Maximum</b> <b>payload</b> – 20,000 kg (44,092 lb). There were plans for 20 aircraft, but only nine were converted; two from Tu-154 models and seven from Tu-154B models.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that future space missions, such as those {{involving}} spacecraft and structural assemblies {{to be used in}} geosynchronous orbits, will require ultralightweight composite structures to achieve <b>maximum</b> <b>payloads.</b> Of equal importance is the requirement to provide designs that are cost-competitive with metal designs. For space structures that must resist buckling, graphite-epoxy materials offer an attractive potential for providing lightweight, low-cost structural components that will meet future space mission requirements. A description is presented of a program which was conducted to evaluate the merits of graphite-epoxy cylindrical shells and to continue the development of a design data base for ultralightweight structures. An objective of the program was to design, fabricate, and test a corrugated graphite-epoxy cylinder 10 ft in diameter and 10 ft long...|$|R

Conventional cargo aircraft cannot cruise at optimum altitude on commercial airroutes because of their lower cruising speed and are often assigned to lower altitude by ATC.), in-flight aerial refuelling and forward looking infrared systems.|$|E
25|$|Each launch system {{incorporates}} three rails, i.e. {{one system}} carries three missiles. This allows a single aircraft to carry {{large numbers of}} missiles; for example, a Typhoon could carry up to six launch systems, one each on six individual pylons, which gives a <b>maximum</b> <b>payload</b> of eighteen Brimstone missiles, {{in addition to a}} useful air-to-air payload. The missile is carried by the Tornado GR4 in RAF service. In February 2014 the National Audit Office warned of a possible capability gap under existing plans to fit Brimstone to Typhoon in 2021, two years after the Tornado retired; in June 2014 the MoD announced a study to accelerate this to 2018 and look at a common launcher that could also launch SPEAR Cap 3. MBDA have fired test rounds from an MQ-9 Reaper and are studying the use of Brimstone on attack helicopters and from surface launchers. Both the US and France have expressed interest in buying it for their aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Natural food {{products}} are often variable {{in shape and}} easily bruised, making them difficult to handle for a robot. In this paper, a novel robot gripper that utilizes {{the effects of a}} magnetorheological (MR) fluid is described and evaluated. In the gripping process pouches filled with MR fluid are molded around the product’s contours. Through the activation of an electromagnet in the gripper arm, a large increase in the MR fluids yield stress confines the product in the mould produced by the gripper surfaces, allowing it to be lifted. Mounted on a six axis KUKA robot products such as apples, carrots, strawberries, broccolis and grapes have been handled without bruising or denting and without the tool changes that would typically be needed. The paper presents data regarding the forces exerted on products during gripping as well as data on <b>maximum</b> <b>payloads</b> and graspable product shapes...|$|R
25|$|Configured with 85 seats, {{the cabin}} was spacious and {{well-appointed}} with comfortable seats widely spaced, giving plenty of legroom, {{but due to}} the low cabin floor and wide diameter, there was much unusable space which limited baggage and cargo volume. The inefficient use of cabin volume contributed greatly to the low payload/TOW ratio which was much {{lower than that of}} the contemporary Ilyushin Il-18, but which was still higher than the Tupolev Tu-104. A later production version, the An-10A, addressed some of the efficiency concerns by increasing the number of seats from 85 to 89 and 100 (in the two versions of the An-10A), then to 117–118 and finally 132 through reducing seat pitch and changing the cabin layout. Powered by Ivchenko AI-20K engines the An-10A demonstrated superior performance and an increased <b>maximum</b> <b>payload</b> of 14.5 Tonnes (31,970lb). The auxiliary endplate fins eventually gave way to improved splayed ventral fins under the rear fuselage. The directional stability was now acceptable and the new ventral fins also improved longitudinal stability at high g and on landing approach, as well as delaying the onset of Mach buffet to M0.702. Due to being sited in an area of flow separation, the new ventral fins also caused unpleasant vibrations. Following results of flight tests and at least two fatal crashes, an effective tailplane deicing system was retrofitted to all remaining aircraft.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study of the}} environmental control and life support subsystems (EC/LSS) necessary for an earth orbital spacecraft to conduct biological experiments is presented. The primary spacecraft models available for conducting these biological experiments are the space shuttle and modular space station. The experiments would be housed in a separate module that would be contained in either the shuttle payload bay or attached to the modular space station. This module would be manned only for experiment-related tasks, and would contain a separate EC/LSS for the crew and animals. Metabolic data were tabulated on various animals that are considered useful for a typical experiment program. The minimum payload for the 30 -day space shuttle module was found to require about {{the equivalent of a}} one-man EC/LSS; however, the selected two-man shuttle assemblies will give a growth and contingency factor of about 50 percent.
