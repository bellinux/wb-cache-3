40|$|Interferon Regulatory Factor- 2 (IRF- 2) {{belongs to}} IRF family, was {{identified}} as a mammalian transcription factor involved in Interferon beta (IFNβ) gene regulation. Besides that IRF- 2 is involved in immunomodulation, hematopoietic differentiation, cell cycle regulation and oncogenesis. We have done <b>molecular</b> <b>sub-cloning</b> and expression of recombinant murine IRF- 2 as GST (Glutathione-S-Transferase) - IRF- 2 fusion protein in E. coli/XL- 1 blue cells. Recombinant IRF- 2 with GST moiety at N-terminus expressed as GST-IRF- 2 (~ 66 kd) in E. coli along with different low molecular mass degradation products revealed approximately 30, 42, 60 and 62 kd by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, respectively. We further confirm that degradation takes place at C-terminus of the fusion protein not at N-terminus as anti-GST antibody was detecting all bands in the immunoblot. The recombinant IRF- 2 was biologically active along with their degradation products in terms of their DNA binding activity as assessed by Electrophoretically Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). We observed three different molecular mass DNA/protein complexes (1 - 3) with Virus Response Element (VRE) derived from human Interferon IFNβ gene and five different molecular mass complexes (1 - 5) with IRF-E motif (GAAAGT) 4 in EMSA gel. GST only expressed from empty vector did not bind to these DNA elements. To confirm that the binding is specific, all complexes were competed out completely when challenged with 100 -X fold molar excess of IRF-E oligo under cold competition. It means degradation products along with full-length protein are able to interact with VREβ as well as IRF-E motif. This means degradation products may regulate the target gene (s) activation/repression via interacting with VRE/IRF-E...|$|E
30|$|AviPure {{with two}} domain repeats was {{designed}} based on Staphylococcus aureus M 0464 SpA B domain (accession number: KT 377029) with some modification at the N, linker and C-terminal and the codon optimized sequence for expression in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) was synthesized by Eurofingenomics (Erlangen, Germany) (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). <b>Molecular</b> <b>sub-cloning</b> of AviPure into pET 28 a (+) was performed. Oligonucleotide primers, Avi-Fw ACT AGC TAG CGG ATC CCT GGC GGA TAA TAA ATT TAA C containing BamHI restriction site and Avi-Rv GAA TTC TGA AGC TTC CTT AGT GGC AAT GGC AAT G containing HindIII restriction site (underlined bases indicate BamHI and HindIII sites, respectively) also synthesized by Eurofingenomics (Erlangen, Germany) {{were used to}} extract the AviPure gene, while restriction enzymes BamHI-HF and HindIII-HF were purchased from New England Biolab (NEB, USA). The expression vector pET 28 a (+) was from Novagen (San Diego, CA, USA). AviPure PCR amplification was done using the Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, USA) consisted of 36 cycles of 94  °C for 30  s, 60  °C for 40  s and 72  °C for 2  min, and followed by a final extension step at 72  °C for 5  min, producing PCR gene product of about 407  bp. Plasmid pET 28 a (+) and PCR products were purified using NucleoSpin® Plasmid extraction and NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey–Nagel GmbH and Co. KG, Düren, Germany). The pET 28 a (+) and amplified AviPure gene product were individually digested (BamHI-HF and HindIII-HF) and ligated to obtain pAV 01 with the N-terminal hexa-histidine tag that facilitate easy purification via Ni–NTA resin. The obtained expression vector was initially amplified in E. coli TOP 10 cells and the correctness of the sequence was verified by analytical restriction digest and DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany). The plasmid pAV 01 was later isolated and subsequently transformed into E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) cells to obtain the E. coli BL 21 (DE 3):pAV 01 for target protein expression.|$|E
