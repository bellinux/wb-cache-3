5|$|The {{next most}} common type, acinar cell {{carcinoma}} of the pancreas, arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers. Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.|$|E
5|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, {{short-term}} {{exposure to}} platinum salts <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and long-term exposure <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> both respiratory and skin allergies. The current OSHA standard is 2micrograms {{per cubic meter}} of air averaged over an 8-hour work shift. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) for platinum as 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.|$|E

5|$|Experimental in situ {{conversion}} {{processes and}} {{carbon capture and storage}} technologies may reduce {{some of these}} concerns in the future, {{but at the same time}} they <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> other problems, including groundwater pollution.|$|E

50|$|Cutis laxa <b>may</b> be <b>caused</b> by {{mutations}} in the genes: ELN, ATP6V0A2,ATP7A, FBLN4, FBLN5, and PYCR1. A related neurocutaneous syndrome <b>may</b> be <b>caused</b> by {{mutations in}} the gene ALDH18A1 (P5CS).|$|R
50|$|Xerophthalmia is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which the eye fails to produce tears. It <b>may</b> be <b>caused</b> by vitamin A deficiency, which is sometimes used to describe that condition, although there <b>may</b> be <b>causes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Interactions between {{galaxies are}} {{relatively}} frequent, {{and they can}} {{play an important role in}} galactic evolution. Near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> some exchange of gas and dust.|$|E

50|$|Pollution <b>may</b> also <b>cause</b> {{extinction}} debt {{by reducing}} a species' birth rate or increasing its death rate {{so that its}} population slowly declines. Extinction debts <b>may</b> be <b>caused</b> by invasive species or by climate change.|$|R
50|$|Overheating <b>may</b> be <b>caused</b> {{from any}} {{accidental}} {{fault of the}} circuit (such as short-circuit or spark-gap), or <b>may</b> be <b>caused</b> from a wrong design or manufacture (such as {{the lack of a}} proper heat dissipation system).|$|R
5|$|People or objects {{contaminated}} with CS gas can cause secondary exposure to others, including healthcare professionals and police. In addition, repeated exposure <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> sensitisation.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{important}} variables {{that needs to be}} accounted is an uncertainty. Uncertainty, often referred to as epistemic uncertainty, arises due to lack of knowledge or incomplete information.

5|$|The {{poly-drug use}} of {{powerful}} depressant drugs poses {{the highest level}} of health concerns due to {{a significant increase in the}} likelihood of experiencing an overdose, which <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> fatal respiratory depression.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> crepitus.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} breed traits which <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> concern as health issues. They include skull {{issues such as}} an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A {{complication}} from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where {{two or more of}} the dog's toes are fused together, may seem to be a health issue but this breed trait is not a cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> {{a range of}} serious {{coincidental}} complications that include cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic pulmonary edema. These conditions must be adequately treated and stabilised {{as part of the}} core care for these patients.|$|E
