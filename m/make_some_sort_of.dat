The Lisbon Treaty makes an institutional-political effort for integration of the European foreign policy capacities, followed by installation of the President of the European Council and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy institutions. This Treaty also constitutes the single legal personality of the EU which differs for the EU on the international political scene in relation to others. With {{the integration of the}} EU’s foreign policy capacities and the fusion of the (former) three pillars, the Lisbon Treaty <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> rationalization of the institutions in terms of providing efficient and simplified decision-making, suitable for implementing a coherent foreign policy. Thus, considering the prerogatives and credentials of aforementioned institutions, regarding their contribution to the international political identity of the EU and its decision-making, we conclude that the Lisbon Treaty does not represent a finalité politique of the EU integration process, but just a step towards its achievement...|$|R

It was shot in 15 weeks, ending in April 1963, after which Kubrick spent eight months editing it. Peter Sellers again agreed to work with Kubrick, and ended up playing three different roles in the film. Upon release, the film stirred up much controversy and mixed opinions. The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther worried that it was a [...] "discredit and even contempt for our whole defense establishment... the most shattering sick joke I've ever come across", [...] while Robert Brustein of Out of This World in a February 1970 article called it a [...] "juvenalian satire".
