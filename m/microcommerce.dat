Examples of such content are web pages, newspaper articles, and even individual plays of computer games. We focus on two particular digital cash protocols, namely Compaq's Millicent and IBM's Micropayments. For each of these two protocols, we present a formal specification using the Abstract Protocol notation, and then discuss how an adversary can attack the protocol using message forgery, modification, and replay. We then use three concepts of convergence theory, namely closure, convergence, and protection, to show that each protocol is secure against these attacks. Finally, we formally specify and verify the Secure Sockets Layer protocol, {{which can be used}} to provide privacy for these digital cash protocols...|$|E
40|$|As online {{businesses}} {{keep growing}} and Web services become pervasive, {{there is an}} increasing demand for micropayment protocols that facilitate <b>microcommerce,</b> namely selling content and services for small amounts of money (possibly less than one cent per transaction), which cannot be handled efficiently by credit cards due to substantial per transaction fee and delay. In this paper, we investigate the security of micropayment protocols that support low-value transactions. We focus on one type of such protocols {{that are based on}} hash chains. We present a formal specification of a typical hash chain based micropayment protocol using Abstract Protocol notation, and discuss how an adversary can attack this protocol using message loss, modification, and replay. We use convergence theory to show that this protocol is secure against these attacks. The specification and verification techniques used in this paper can be applied to other micropayment protocols as well...|$|E
