For this purpose an evaluation by means of equation of compression, evaluation by stress relaxation, evaluation by force-distance diagram and evaluation by differential scanning calorimetry is accomplished. The equation of compression developed by department of pharmaceutical technology describes the process of compression by parameters of three phases: phase before compression, phase elastic and plastic deformation. The test of stress relaxation was performed at compression force of 5, 10 and 15 kN. During the evaluation of a force-distance record phase of compression and relaxation of tablet was examined from energetic point of view at compression force of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 kN.

Paracetamol is an often-used <b>medicinal</b> <b>substance</b> from the group of analgetics-antipyretics. This thesis evaluates the influence of paracetamol contained in pharmaceuticals Paralen 500 tbl. and Panadol tbl., and of the paracetamol analytical standard on the environment. Three ecotoxicological tests and representatives of three trophic-level organisms were selected: a multi-generational test with the protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis Ehr., a rapid screening test RapidtoxkitTM with the crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus Packard and an inhibition test of the germination of Sinapis alba L. seeds. The highest tested concentration of paracetamol was 2341, 67 mg/l. The tests evaluated the inhibition of the protozoan's growth; the inhibition of the crustacean's food intake, and the inhibition of seed germination in higher plants.

40|$|Background and aims: Medicinal {{plants are}} a {{valuable}} resource for flavonoids extraction. Prosopis fracta {{is one of the}} plants with medicinal properties. Prosopis fracta was found in abundance in southern regions in Iran. Coersetin is <b>medicinal</b> <b>substance</b> found in the fruit of this plant. Quercetin is used in treatment of cancer and viral infections. This study was conducted to determine the Quercetin flavonoid in Prosopis fracta samples in different regions of Khuzestan. Methods: The Prosopis fracta fruit collected from different regions of Khuzestan (Susangerd, Ahvaz, Abadan, Mollasani, Behbahan and Ramhormoz). The beads were isolated from the fruit. Shell and the flesh were dried in an Oven. The dried materials were mixed and flavonoids extracted with a suitable solvent. The extract was injected into the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. Then, the compound, Quercetin quantity and standard peak in each sample have been determined. Results: Based on the results, the Susangerd samples (0. 0033 mg/ml) and Abadan (0. 0008 mg/ml) have maximum and minimum levels of Quercetin flavonoid, respectively. Conclusions: Quercetin flavonoid extracted from Prosopis farcta fruits of Susangerd is richer than other regions of Khuzestan province. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Prosopis fracta fruit grown in Susangerd for extraction of the Quercetin flavonoid...|$|E
