An experiment was carried out at postgraduate research area of Department of Agronomy, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad during autumn 2011 to evaluate the effect of row spacing under reduced irrigation conditions on growth, yield and oil content of sunflower. The experiment was laid-out in RCBD with split plot arrangement having three replications. The size of plot for this experiment was 3 m x 5 m. This experiment was comprised of two row spacing (60 cm and 75 cm apart) and four irrigation levels (full irrigation, irrigation missed {{at the beginning of}} stem elongation, irrigation missed at beginning of flowering, irrigation missed at achene development). Uniform management practices were carried out. Data were taken by standard procedures used for sunflower growth and yield procedures. Statistical analysis was done by ANOVA technique. Treatments’ means were compared using Least Significant Difference test at 5 % probability level. The results had shown significant results regarding the yield and yield components of sunflower. Different row spacing and irrigation levels affect almost all the parameters significantly. Various row spacing had significant effect in case of yield components. The maximum results were obtained in case of 75 cm row spacing <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> 1000 -achene weight (47. 2 g), achene yield (2. 97 t ha - 1) and biological yield (10. 02 t ha - 1).

Design and Methods: Injections of 3000 IU recombinant, human FSH (rhFSH) were followed by single-blinded injections of placebo, 1000 and 2000 IU rhFSH spaced by at least 28 days between injections. Results: After injection of 3000 IU rhFSH, inhibin B values were significantly elevated above baseline for 24, 96 and 120 h (maximal increase after 96 h, <b>mean</b> ^ S. <b>E.</b> M. 303 ^ 18 pg=ml). Injection of 2000 IU rhFSH led to {{a significant increase in}} inhibin B (<b>maximum</b> <b>mean</b> ^ S. <b>E.</b> M. 318 ^ 20 pg=ml) from 24 to 120 h. Injection of 1000 IU rhFSH led to a significant increase in inhibin B after 96 h (<b>maximum</b> <b>mean</b> ^ S. <b>E.</b> M. 300 ^ 16 pg=ml). The inhibin B areas under the curve after injection of 2000 and 3000 IU rhFSH were significantly higher than those following the placebo and 1000 IU rhFSH. In the 12 fertile men investigated, at baseline a strong diurnal rhythm of inhibin B parallel to that of testosterone was observed. Conclusions: Serum inhibin B can be considered only a partial pharmacodynamic parameter of FSH in vivo, since the integrity of the spermatogenic process appears to be a second fundamental component in the regulation of its secretion from the testis.

The present study proposes {{a method for}} computation of area mean gravity anomalies in ellipsoidal approximation ('ellipsoidal area means') by applying a simple ellipsoidal correction to area means in spherical approximation. Ellipsoidal area means offer better consistency with GGM quasi/geoid heights. The method is numerically validated with ellipsoidal area mean gravity derived from very fine grids of gravity point values in ellipsoidal approximation. Signal strengths of (i) the ellipsoidal effect (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> difference ellipsoidal vs. spherical approximation), (ii) the area <b>mean</b> effect (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> difference area <b>mean</b> vs. point gravity) and (iii) the ellipsoidal area <b>mean</b> effect (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> differences between ellipsoidal area means and point gravity in spherical approximation) are investigated in test areas in New Zealand and the Himalaya mountains. The impact of both the area mean and the ellipsoidal effect on quasigeoid heights is {{in the order of}} several centimetres.

Here we show that any significant time variation in the population mean renders the sample correlogram (and related spectral estimates) inconsistent and that, in particular, smooth time variation in the <b>mean</b> – <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> a weak trend, either stochastic or deterministic – also induces apparent long memory in a time series. This source of apparent long memory may be at least as common in practice as is structural breaks. Because the impact of such trending behavior is concentrated at very low frequencies, it – and the consequent apparent long memory – can be eliminated by either highpass filtering or by detrending. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness in this regard of nonlinear detrending via penalized-spline nonparametric regression; its effectiveness at eliminating apparent long memory is illustrated using generated data. Finally, a time-varying mean can be of economic interest in its own right. This suggests that isolating out and separately examining both a local <b>mean</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> a nonlinear trend or the realization of a stochastic trend) and deviations from it is preferable as a modeling strategy to simply estimating a fractionally integrated model.
