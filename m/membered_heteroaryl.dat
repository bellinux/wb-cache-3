40|$|Asymmetric {{reduction}} of the heteroaryl prochiral ketones to corresponding chiral alcohols by Daucus carota was studied. The study highlights selective bio{{reduction of}} different substituted heteroaryl ketones (1 a - 1 j) to their respective chiral alcohols (2 a - 2 j) using plant dehydrogenase enzymes present in Daucus carota in good yields (60 % - 95 %) and enantioselectivity (76 % - 99 %) with S-form configuration. The results obtained confirm that the membrane bound dehydrogenase enzyme has broad substrate specificity and selectivity in catalyzing both six and five <b>membered</b> <b>heteroaryl</b> methyl ketones. The present methodology demonstrates promising and alternative green route in the synthesis secondary chiral alcohols of biologically importance in a simple, inexpensive and eco-friendly process...|$|E
