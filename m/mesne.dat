25|$|The heerlijkheden {{came into}} being {{as a result of}} the feudal system, in {{particular}} the sovereign's delegated judicial prerogative. The crown, as lord paramount, granted the right to govern and to exercise judicial authority to a crown vassal, often a confidante or as a reward for military service or political support. The crown vassal—e.g. a count (graaf) or duke (hertog)—thus exercised all or part of the sovereign's royal authority. In turn the crown vassal granted rights to the <b>mesne</b> lords of the heerlijkheden.|$|E
25|$|Under the feudal system, a manorial lord {{typically}} {{was himself}} the vassal of a higher-ranking tenant-in-chief, usually a highborn noble, {{who was in}} turn the crown vassal of the king or emperor. However, sometimes there was no <b>mesne</b> tenancy (tussenliggende heerschappij), {{as was the case}} with knight's fees held in capite (rijksonmiddellijke heerlijkheid). The heerlijkheid was ruled directly by a count (graaf), a viscount (burggraaf) or a baron (baron). Also, it was not uncommon for the lord to be ecclesiastical, e.g. a prince-bishop (prins-bisschop) or prince-abbot (vorst-abt).|$|E

[...] In other words, the court held that the Catawba's claim would only be time-barred as to defendants who were able to demonstrate adverse possession, without tacking except by inheritance. [...] Thus, the court would look for a continuous ten-year period of possession for each defendant land-owner for the period between July 12, 1962 (the date of termination) and October 28, 1980 (the filing of the complaint). [...] Further, the court rejected the defendant's other affirmative defense that the claim was not recorded in South Carolina's Registry of <b>Mesne</b> Conveyances and challenge to the jurisdiction of the court.

In 1361 Robert de Goldthorpe, who was also known as Robert Robertson (his father's name was Robert), married Esabell de Shepley and, as a result inherited part of the manor and estates of Shepley.

6000|$|However, {{before we}} pass {{from this point}} {{concerning}} possession, {{it will be a}} relaxation of the mind, not wholly foreign to our purpose, to take a short review of the extraordinary policy which has been held with regard to religion in that kingdom, from the time our ancestors took possession of it. The most able antiquaries are of opinion, and Archbishop Usher, whom I reckon amongst the first of them, has, I think, shown, that a religion not very remote from the present Protestant persuasion was that of the Irish before the union of that kingdom to the crown of England. If this was not directly the fact, this at least seems very probable, that Papal authority was much lower in Ireland than in other countries. This union was made under the authority of an arbitrary grant of Pope Adrian, in order that the Church of Ireland should be reduced to the same servitude with those that were nearer to his see. It is not very wonderful that an ambitious monarch should make use of any pretence in his way to so considerable an object. What is extraordinary is, that for a very long time, even quite down to the Reformation, and in their most solemn acts, the kings of England founded their title wholly on this grant: they called for obedience from the people of Ireland, not on principles of subjection, but as vassals and <b>mesne</b> lords between them and the Popes; and they omitted no measure of force or policy to establish that Papal authority, with all the distinguishing articles of religion connected with it, and to make it take deep root {{in the minds of the}} people. Not to crowd instances unnecessary, I shall select two, one of which is in print, the other on record,--the one a treaty, the other an act of Parliament. The first is the submission of the Irish chiefs to Richard the Second, mentioned by Sir John Davies. In this pact they bind themselves for the future to preserve peace and allegiance to the kings of England, under certain pecuniary penalties. But what is remarkable, these fines were all covenanted to be paid into the Apostolical Chamber, supposing the Pope as the superior power, whose peace was broken and whose majesty was violated in disobeying his governor. By this time, so far as regarded England, the kings had extremely abridged the Papal power in many material particulars: they had passed the Statute of Provisors, the Statute of Præmunire,--and, indeed, struck out of the Papal authority all things, at least, that seemed to infringe on their temporal independence. In Ireland, however, their proceeding was directly the reverse: there they thought it expedient to exalt it at least as high as ever: for, so late as the reign of Edward the Fourth, the following short, but very explicit, act of Parliament was passed:-- ...|$|E

The Victorian Gothic grade II* listed St Michaels and All Angels parish church was completed in 1878 next to Swinley Hall which has not survived. In 1881 the parish of Swinley (which included Whitley) was formed at St Micheals {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Rector of Wigan Parish. Under the Local Government Act 1888 in 1889 the County Borough of Wigan was formed replacing the Municipal Borough of Wigan and incorporating all the lands of Wigan and from 1904 Pemberton Parishs which had formerly been outside the towns municipal boundaries. In 1974 the County Borough of Wigan was dissolved and the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan was formed within the county of Greater Manchester.|$|R

50|$|Below {{the king}} in the feudal pyramid was a tenant-in-chief (generally {{in the form}} of a baron or knight) who was a vassal of the king, and holding from him in turn was a <b>mesne</b> tenant (generally a knight, {{sometimes}} a baron, including tenants-in-chief in their capacity as holders of other fiefs) who held when sub-enfeoffed by the tenant-in-chief.

50|$|Elections to the Wigan council {{were held}} on Thursday, 5 May 1994, with {{one third of}} the seats up for {{election}}. Prior to the election, Labour had defended their seats in two by-elections for Abram and Hindley. The election suffered from a mixture of a poor contesting rate and low voter turnout. The number of candidates contesting was just 50, the lowest since 1975, with four wards going unopposed, and Lib Dems back to fighting a half of the seats, and the Conservatives less than two-thirds. The only other opposition standing were three Independent Labour candidates, one of which was the previous - but since deselected - Labour incumbent for the seat being fought in Worsley <b>Mesnes.</b> Voter turnout rose from the previous election's nadir, but at 30.4%, still well below average.|$|R

50|$|<b>Mesne</b> profits {{commonly}} occur where {{a landlord}} has obtained {{an order from}} a court to evict a tenant, or where an individual sues to eject a bona fide landowner to whom title to land was improperly conveyed. The <b>mesne</b> profit represents the value (living rent-free, profits earned from the land, etc.) the ejected tenant received from the property between the time the court ordered the eviction and {{the time when the}} tenant actually left the property. <b>Mesne</b> profits must be drawn from the land itself, rather than improvements on it. For example, <b>mesne</b> profits may accrue from growing crops on land but would not generally accrue from a factory built on the land (unless there were damage to the land or improvements to the land itself such as the removal of stone from a field).|$|E

50|$|Elections to the Wigan council {{were held}} on Thursday, 7 May 1987, with {{one third of}} the council up for {{election}}. Previous to the election there had been two by-elections held, resulting in a Labour gain of the seat being fought in Swinley from the Conservatives and Labour retaining one of their Hindley Green seats. Participation for this election increased substantially from the previous year's lows. Only one ward went unopposed (Leigh Central) as Labour reliably provided a full-slate of candidates, the Alliance all but Atherton and the Conservatives up from 16 to 18, by way of fielding candidates in the Labour strongholds of Abram and Worsley <b>Mesnes</b> this time around. An Independent Labour candidate also fought and won Hindley, with an Independent victory last seen in 1976, and Independent representation in 1980, when that same victor failed to survive the re-warding.|$|R
50|$|Elections {{were held}} on Thursday, 4 May 1995, with {{one third of}} the seats set for re-{{election}}, with an extra vacancy in Leigh East. Ahead of this election Labour had gained the seat being fought in Beech Hill from the Liberal Democrats, and defended a seat in Worsley <b>Mesnes</b> in by-elections. The major parties marginally increased their number of candidates upon last year's totals, whereas the number of Independent Labour candidates fighting returned to just the incumbent in Hindley. Having been the only party opposing Labour in Atherton, the Independent Labour absence there meant that went uncontested this time round, alongside two of last year's unopposed wards, Ince and Leigh Central. In total unopposed wards were reduced from the previous year's four to three. Turnout fell to 26.4%, the second lowest in the council's history, only surpassing the 1992 nadir.|$|R

The sinking soon ran into difficulties due to the high volumes of water encountered in the first 150 yd. and progress was halted for four to five months after the sinking pumps had been overwhelmed. In order to deal with the large feeders of water now encountered, four 18in. diameter pumps were then installed in the No. 1 shaft and sinking at the No.2 shaft was discontinued. The subsequent impact of the pumping was considerable, with wells and springs over a wide area drying up and the water disappearing from the Mansfield quarries almost 3 miles away.|$|R
