First, feminist scholars should adopt a more expansive definition <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> than that which informs current rhetoric of technol-ogy research. Second, feminist scholars should ask research questions different from those being asked by current rhetoric <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> researchers. Third, feminist scholars should move beyond the design and development phases <b>of</b> <b>technology,</b> which most <b>of</b> the current research on the rhetoric <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> emphasizes...|$|R
