40|$|Mercury and organomercurial {{resistance}} {{determined by}} genes on ten Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasmids and one Pseudomonas putida plasmid {{have been studied}} {{with regard to the}} range of substrates and the range of inducers. The plasmidless strains were sensitive to growth inhibition by Hg 2 + and did not volatilize Hg 0 from Hg 2 +. A strain with plasmid RP 1 (which does not confer resistance to Hg 2 +) similarly did not volatilize mercury. All 10 plasmids determine mercury resistance by way of an inducible enzyme system. Hg 2 + was reduced to Hg 0, which is insoluble in water and rapidly volatilizes from the growth medium. Plasmids pMG 1, pMG 2, R 26, R 933, R 93 - 1, and pVS 1 in P. aeruginosa and MER in P. putida conferred resistance to and the ability to volatilize mercury from Hg 2 +, but strains with these plasmids were sensitive to and could not volatilize mercury from the organomercurials methylmercury, ethylmercury, phenylmercury, and thimerosal. These plasmids, in addition, conferred resistance to the organomercurials <b>merbromin,</b> p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and fluorescein mercuric acetate. The other plasmids, FP 2, R 38, R 3108, and pVS 2, determined resistance to and decomposition of a range of organomercurials, including methylmercury, ethylmercury, phenylmercury, and thimerosal.

In all cases, organomercurial decomposition and mercury volatilization were induced by exposure to Hg 2 + or organomercurials. The plasmids differed in the relative efficacy of inducers. Hg 2 + resistance with strains that are organomercurial sensitive appeared to be induced preferentially by Hg 2 + and only poorly by organomercurials to which the cells are sensitive. However, the organomercurials p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, <b>merbromin,</b> and fluorescein mercuric acetate were strong gratuitous inducers but not substrates for the Hg 2 + volatilization system.

40|$|Human {{carbonic}} anhydrase II (CA II), a zinc metalloenzyme, was screened against 960 structurally diverse, biologically active small molecules. The assay monitored CA II esterase activity {{against the}} substrate 4 -nitrophenyl acetate in a format allowing high-throughput screening. The assay {{proved to be}} robust and reproducible with a hit rate of ∼ 2 %. Potential hits were further characterized by determining their IC 50 and Kd values and tested for nonspecific, promiscuous inhibition. Three known sulfonamide CA inhibitors were identified: acetazolamide, methazolamide, and celecoxib. Other hits were also found, including diuretics and antibiotics not previously identified as CA inhibitors, for example, furosemide and halazone. These results confirm that many sulfonamide drugs have CA inhibitory properties but also that not all sulfonamides are CA inhibitors. Thus many, but not all, sulfonamide drugs appear to interact with CA II and may target other CA isozymes. The screen also yielded several novel classes of nonsulfonamide inhibitors, including <b>merbromin,</b> thioxolone, and tannic acid. Although these compounds may function by some nonspecific mechanism (<b>merbromin</b> and tannic acid), at least 1 (thiox-olone) appears to represent a genuine CA inhibitor.

40|$|Phosphorus is an {{essential}} plant macronutrient which profoundly affects the yield and quality of wheat starch. In this study, scanning electron microscopy showed that P fertilizer amount (0, 46, and 92 kg P ha− 1) had no {{significant effect on the}} shape of starch granules in wheat (cv. Xindong 20) grain. However, confocal laser scanning microscopy with 3 -(4 -carboxybenzoyl) quinoline- 2 -carboxaldehyde and methanolic <b>merbromin</b> stains indicated that P amount influenced the microstructure of the starch granules. Starch granules from the 46 kg P ha− 1 treatment released significantly more reducing sugars than those from the 0 and 92 kg P ha− 1 treatments during digestion with alpha-amylase and amyloglucosidase digestion. Phosphorus application (especially the 46 kg P ha− 1 treatments) significantly increased the relative expression of genes related to starch synthesis (especially during early to mid-grain filling) and starch degradation (especially during mid- and late grain filling). Phosphorus application also increased the transcript abundance of amylase genes at the periphery of the endosperm. We propose that P application, especially the 46 kg P ha− 1 treatment, enhanced channels in wheat starch granules. These channels facilitated the transport of substances required for starch biosynthesis, thus increasing starch accumulation in wheat endosperm.

40|$|The {{frequency}} {{of resistance to}} Hg 2 + in 1980 to 1981 collections from Barnes Hospital, St. Louis, Mo., was only 2 % for Staphylococcus aureus and 9 % for Escherichia coli. The {{frequency of}} Hg 2 + resistance in E. coli isolates from Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, was 57 % during 1972 to 1977 and decreased to 29 % in 1979 to 1982; for S. aureus the frequency of Hg 2 + resistance dropped from 36 % in 1972 to 1977 to 10 % in 1979 to 1982. Frequencies of resistances to cadmium (S. aureus) and arsenic (S. aureus and E. coli) remained approximately constant during this time. The decrease in frequency of mercurial resistance is attributed to the termination {{of the use of}} organomercurials (largely phenylmercury and thimerosal) in hospital liquid detergents and disinfectants. It is proposed that selection for mercurial resistance occurred within the hospital setting when there was widespread use of mercurials. The resistance patterns and phage types for each of four new mercurial-resistant S. aureus isolates from St. Louis were distinct, indicating that no single type of "hospital staph" predominates. Furthermore, resistance to thimerosal, <b>merbromin,</b> and methylmercury and the ability to volatilize 14 C from [14 C]methylmercury were found with the new isolates and never with previously known mercurial resistance plasmids in S. aureus...|$|E
40|$|Plants have {{to survive}} in an {{environment}} where they are constantly under attack {{from a wide range of}} pathogens, and they utilise sophisticated, multi-layered defence mechanisms to resist infection. The Arabidopsis thaliana protein Enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS 1), together with its signalling partners, Phytoalexin deficient 4 (PAD 4) and Senescence associated gene 101 (SAG 101), constitutes a central regulatory hub in plant immunity. EDS 1 is essential for basal defence and for effector-triggered immune responses mediated via TIR-NB-LRR (Toll-Interleukin 1 receptor-Nucleotide Binding site-Leucine Rich Repeat) receptors. EDS 1 -dependent signalling can be divided into two branches: a salicylic acid (SA) -dependent branch and a SA-independent branch. Flavin-dependent mono-oxygenase 1 (FMO 1) is a marker gene for the EDS 1 -dependent, SA-independent signalling pathway. FMO 1 is dependent on EDS 1 and PAD 4, and plays a crucial role in basal defence and TIR-NB-LRR-mediated immune responses. However, the mechanistic details of FMO 1 signalling and other components involved modulation of EDS 1 -dependent, SA-independent defence signalling are unknown. I aimed at identifying some of these unknown components, using a chemical biology approach and screening for selective compounds that can be used as tools in applications complementing genetic approaches. The advantage of this method lies in its potential to circumvent problems generally encountered in genetic approaches, such as redundancy of gene function, lethality of mutants and pleiotropic effects. I developed a bi-directional screening procedure for chemicals activating or inhibiting FMO 1 accumulation, using a transgenic A. thaliana line expressing a YFP-tagged FMO 1 protein under control of the native FMO 1 promoter in a fmo 1 - 1 mutant background. Three compounds selectively activating FMO 1 expression were identified after screening and verification, from amongst a library of 1488 compounds. The selected chemicals; <b>merbromin,</b> monensin sodium salt, and thaxtomin A, could induce expression of FMO 1, independent of SA accumulation, thus confirming the SA-independent nature of FMO 1 defence regulation. All three chemicals were extensively tested for their role in modulation of plant immune responses. <b>Merbromin</b> leads to the upregulation of several defence genes known to be linked to FMO 1, such as EDS 1, PAD 4 and Isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS 1). However, it does not induce accumulation of SA and expression of Pathogenesis related 1 (PR 1), suggesting that it causes perturbations at several points in the FMO 1 -related signalling pathway. Monensin sodium salt also leads to an increase in expression of EDS 1, PAD 4, ICS 1 and PR 1, along with SA accumulation. Monensin sodium salt activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which could play a role in induction of FMO 1 expression. Thaxtomin A was the most specific modulator of FMO 1 signalling, and does not affect early defence responses such as MAPK activation and production of reactive oxygen species. It causes SA accumulation and enhances expression of EDS 1, PAD 4, ICS 1, and PR 1. Thaxtomin A-induced FMO 1 expression is dependent on EDS 1 and PAD 4. I found thaxtomin A to be a specific activator of PAD 4 expression, with enhanced PAD 4 mRNA accumulation, independent of EDS 1. There are also indications that PAD 4 may have an EDS 1 -independent role in thaxtomin A-induced FMO 1 upregulation. However, the presence of both, EDS 1 and PAD 4, is essential for maximum upregulation of FMO 1 by thaxtomin A. Identification of the molecular target of thaxtomin A may lead to unknown components involved in EDS 1 -dependent, SA-independent signalling and greater mechanistic knowledge of the signalling pathway. ...|$|E
40|$|Penicillinase {{plasmids}} of Staphylococcus aureus often contain genes conferring {{resistance to}} inorganic mercury (Hg 2 +) and the organomercurial phenylmercury acetate. The mechanism of resistance {{was found to}} be the enzymatic hydrolysis of the organomercurial phenylmercury to benzene plus inorganic ionic mercury, which was then enzymatically reduced to metallic mercury (Hg 0). The Hg 0 was rapidly volatilized from the medium into the atmosphere. After the mercurial was degraded and the mercury was volatilized, the resistant cells were able to grow. These plasmids also conferred the ability to volatilize mercury from thimerosal, although the plasmid-bearing strains were equally as thimerosal sensitive as the S. aureus without plasmids. None of the plasmids conferred the ability to volatilize mercury from several other organomercurials, however: methylmercury, ethylmercury, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, <b>merbromin,</b> and fluorescein mercuric acetate. (Organomercurial resistance-conferring plasmids of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that we have been studying confer the ability to degrade two or three of these organomercurials.) Although mercury was not volatilized from p-hydroxymercuribenzoate or fluorescein mercuric acetate, the plasmid-bearing strains were resistant to these organomercurials. The ability to volatilize mercury from Hg 2 + and phenylmercury was inducible. The range of inducers included Hg 2 +, phenylmercury, and several organomercurials that were not substrates for the degradation system. Mercury-sensitive mutants have been isolated from the parental plasmids pI 258 and pII 147. Thirty-one such mercury-sensitive strains fall into three classes: (i) mercury-sensitive strains totally devoid of the phenylmercury hydrolase and Hg 2 + reductase activities; (ii) mutants with normal hydrolase levels and no detectable reductase; and (iii) mutants with essentially normal hydrolase levels and low and variable (5 to 25 %) levels of reductase activities. The mercury-sensitive strains were also sensitive to phenylmercury, including those with the potential for hydrolase activity...|$|E
