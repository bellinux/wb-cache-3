Therefore, immersion of a bone graft in a bisphosphonate solution before implantation may protect it from resorption. We implanted frozen cancellous; bone allografts; into bilateral bone chambers for 6 weeks in 10 rats. One graft in each pair had been immersed in an alendronate solution (1 mg/mL) for 10 minutes, and then rinsed in saline. Controls underwent the same treatment with saline only. Results were evaluated with histomorphometry. Control grafts were almost entirely resorbed, but alendronate-treated grafts seemed intact.

Several substitutes and techniques are available for the functional restoration of the vertebral column. Vascularized bone transfers, autografts, allografts or xenografts have been used, as well as metal or ceramic implants. All of these bear potential advantages and drawbacks in terms of associated morbidity of graft harvesting, disease transmission, mechanical failure, implant incorporation and overall long-term clinical outcome. In the present paper we report our experience with the use of freeze-dried, gamma-irradiated, cortical allograft for the reconstruction of large, anterior segmental defects of the spine, involving at least one vertebral body with its two adjacent discs. Cortical allografts were used in 67 cases operated for a variety of conditions. No case of disease transmission, infection or long-term <b>mechanical</b> <b>graft</b> failure occurred in our entire series, with a mean follow-up of 31 months.

40|$|Synthetic {{vascular}} grafts {{are useful}} to bypass diseased arteries. The long-term failure of synthetic grafts is {{primarily due to}} intimal hyperplasia at the anastomotic sites. The accelerated intimal hyperplasia may stem from a compliance mismatch between the host artery and the graft since commercially available synthetic conduits are much stiffer than an artery. The objective of this thesis is to design a method for fabricating a vascular graft that mechanically matches the patients native artery over the expected physiologic range of pressures. The creation of an optimized <b>mechanical</b> <b>graft</b> will hopefully lead to an improvement in patency rates. The mechanical equivalency between the graft and the host artery is defined locally by several criteria including the diameter upon inflation, the elasticity at mean pressure, and axial force. A single parameter mathematical for a thin-walled tube is used to describe of the final mechanical behavior of a synthetic graft. For the general problem, the objective would be to fabricate a mechanics-matching vascular graft for each host artery. Typically, fabrication parameters are set initially and {{the properties of the}} fabricated graft are measured. However, by modeling the entire fabrication process and final mechanical properties, it is possible to invert the situation and let the typical output mechanical values be used to define the fabrication parameters. The resultant fabricated graft will then be mechanically matching. As a proof-of-concept, several prototype synthetic grafts were manufactured and characterized by a single Invariant to match a canine artery. The resultant graft equaled the diameter upon inflation, the elasticity at mean pressure, and axial force of the native canine artery within 6 %. An alternative to making an individual graft for each artery is also presented. A surgeon may choose the best graft from a set of pre-manufactured grafts, using a computer program algorithm for best fit using two parameters in a neighborhood. The design optimization problem was solved for both canine carotid and human coronary arteries. In conclusion, the overall process of design, fabrication and selection of a mechanics matching synthetic vascular graft is shown to be reliable and robust. M. S. Committee Chair: David N.
