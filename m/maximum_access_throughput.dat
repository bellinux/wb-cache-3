There are many parameters that influence {{the performance of the}} network; network latency, target token rotation time, token holding time, frame size and <b>maximum</b> <b>access</b> delay. The <b>maximum</b> <b>access</b> delay, the time between successive transmission opportunities, is bounded for both synchronous and asynchronous traffic.

40|$|Many {{distributed}} storage systems achieve {{high data}} <b>access</b> <b>throughput</b> via partitioning and replication, each system {{with its own}} advantages and tradeoffs. In order to achieve high scalability, however, today’s systems generally reduce transactional support, disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions. Calvin is a practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer that uses a deterministic ordering guarantee to significantly reduce the normally prohibitive contention costs associated with distributed transactions. Unlike previous deterministic database system prototypes, Calvin supports disk-based storage, scales near-linearly on a cluster of commodity machines, and has no single point of failure. By replicating transaction inputs rather than effects, Calvin is also able to support multiple consistency levels—including Paxosbased strong consistency across geographically distant replicas—at no cost to transactional throughput...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{describe}} and evaluate novel memory designs for multi-port on-chip and off-chip use in advanced computer architectures. We focus on combining multi-porting and evaluating the performance over {{a range of}} design parameters. Multi-porting is essential for caches and shared-data systems, especially multi-core System-on-chips (SOC). It can significantly increase the memory <b>access</b> <b>throughput.</b> We evaluate FinFET voltage-mode multi-port SRAM cells using different metrics including leakage current, static noise margin and read/write performance. Simulation results show that single-ended multi-port FinFET SRAMs with isolated read ports offer improved read stability and flexibility over classical double-ended structures {{at the expense of}} write performance. By increasing the size of the access transistors, we show that the single-ended multi-port structures can achieve equivalent write performance to the classical double-ended multi-port structure for 9...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a novel CSMA/CA-based reservation scheme that improves the multiple <b>access</b> <b>throughput</b> of wireless ad-hoc networks using switched beam antennas. First, we show the performance {{limitations of the}} omni-directional and directional reservation paradigms investigated in the literature. This is done via emphasizing the trade-off between minimizing the number of control/data packet collisions and minimizing the number of neighbors that back-off unnecessarily. Next, we propose a novel concept that balances this trade-off via sending reservation messages, that carry information about the intended direction of transmission, on all unblocked beams. The innovation in this approach is to send directional information to as many neighbors as possible {{in order to better}} assist them in deciding whether to transmit or refrain from transmission on a specific beam. Finally, the algorithm is examined via simulations and compared to the omni-directional and directional reservation approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{well known}} problem among most random access {{protocols}} in wireless networks {{is that the}} throughput drops rapidly in heavy load. To cope with this problem, one has to control to the load offered to a network. Unlike the traditional backoff policy in Ethernet where backoff occurs after collision, {{in this paper we}} propose various control schemes based on the new idea of resampling, where carrier sensing ability is used to determine whether a backoff command should be issued or not. We show from various experiments that our schemes are capable of controlling the offer load to the optimal offer load. As a result, the throughputs of these schemes are kept close to the network capacity in heavy load.

40|$|Multiport {{memories}} are extensively used in modern system designs {{because of the}} performance advantages they offer. The increased memory <b>access</b> <b>throughput</b> could lead to significantly faster sched-ules in behavioral synthesis. However, they also have an associ-ated area and energy penalty. We describe a technique for mapping data accesses to multiport memories during behavioral synthesis that results in significantly better energy characteristics than an un-optimized multiport design. The technique consists of an initial colouring of the array access nodes in the data flow graph based on spatial locality, followed by attempts to consecutively access mem-ory locations with the same colour on the same port. Our experi-ments on several applications indicate {{a significant reduction in}} ad-dress bus switching activity, leading to an overall energy reduction over an unoptimized design, while still maintaining a performance advantage over a single-port solution. 1...|$|R

Networking protocols for communication between nodes in the system are also carefully selected and implemented to ensure scalability.
