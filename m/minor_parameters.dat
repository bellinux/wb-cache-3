5000|$|The {{linguistic}} {{components of}} American Sign Language (ASL) {{can be broken}} down into four parts; the hand configuration, place of articulation, movement and other <b>minor</b> <b>parameters.</b> Hand configuration is determined by the shape of the hand, fingers and thumbs and is specific to the sign that is being used. It allows the signer to articulate what they are wanting to communicate by extending, flexing, bending or spreading the digits; the position of the thumb to the fingers; or the curvature of the hand. However, there are not an infinite amount of possible hand configurations, there are 19 classes of hand configuration primes as listed by the Dictionary of American Sign Language. Place of articulation is the particular location that the sign is being performed known as the [...] "signing place". The [...] "signing place" [...] can be the whole face or a particular part of it, the eyes, nose, cheek, ear, neck, trunk, any part of the arm, or the neutral area in front of the signers head and body. Movement is the most complex as {{it can be difficult to}} analyze. Movement is restricted to directional, rotations of the wrist, local movements of the hand and interactions of the hands. These movements can occur singularly, in sequence, or simultaneously. <b>Minor</b> <b>parameters</b> in ASL include contacting region, orientation and hand arrangement. They are subclasses of hand configuration. Performance errors resulting in ungrammatical signs can result due to processes that change the hand configuration, place, movement or other parameter of the sign. These processes can be anticipation, preservation, or metathesis. Anticipation is caused when some characteristic of the next sign is incorporated into the sign that is presently being performed. Preservation is the opposite of anticipation where some characteristic of the preceding sign is carried over into the performance of the next sign. Metathesis occurs when two characteristics of adjacent signs are combined into one in the performance of both signs. Each of these errors will result in an incorrect sign being performed. This could result in either a different sign being performed instead of the intended one, or nonexistent signs which forms are possible and those which forms are not possible due to the structural rules. These are the main types of performance errors in sign language however on the rare occasion there is also the possibility of errors in the order of the signs performed resulting in a different meaning than what the signer intended.|$|E

This dissertation {{consists of three}} main sections which report the procedures used to develop the semivolatile aerosol dichotomous sampler (SADS) and their results. The first section describes the theoretical background of SADS and the validation of its performance using numerical simulations and experimental data. SADS was proposed as an alternative method to overcome {{some of the problems}} of existing personal sampling methods such as evaporative loss during filter sampling. The main difference between virtual impactors and the SADS was the inverted flow ratio between the major and the minor flow. Sampling in the SADS settings gave a lower cutsize in both numerical simulations and experimental results. The second section reports the results of an optimization procedure for SADS and experimental confirmation with the optimized sampler. Using numerical modeling, the relationships between four major design and operating parameters significantly affecting the performance of the SADS and four performance parameters were expressed in polynomial equations. Utilizing an optimization procedure, values for the major parameters giving the best performance were determined and used as the base model for optimizing <b>minor</b> <b>parameters.</b> Five <b>minor</b> <b>parameters</b> were then investigated for their possible contribution to better performance of the SADS. Experimental tests confirmed that the performance of the new sampler was improved although not as much as expected from the numerical simulation. In the third section, the sampling performance of SADS was compared with existing vapor and particle sampling methods. Seven different test fluids were used to generate test droplets and the concentrations and composition in each phase were evaluated using gas chromatography. Combined vapor and particle concentrations for each test aerosol were not statistically different from one another as a function of test method. However, the particle concentrations estimated using the SADS were statistically higher than those from the other methods. In the tests of a chemical mixture and oil mists, a similar pattern of vapor/particle concentration ratio to the individual compounds was observed. SADS worked better than a filtration method and measured higher particle concentrations than other methods...|$|E

As an instrument for study, one model of aircraft was chosen for which extensive flight test and drop test data were available.

The lengths of impulsive intervals are piecewise constant and as a result, the security of the system is further improved. Moreover, with the given parameters of the chaotic system and the impulsive control law, an estimate of the synchronization time is derived. The proposed cryptosystem is shown to be very sensitive to parameter mismatch and hence the security of the chaotic secure communication system is greatly enhanced.

NASA has championed {{the development of the}} Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) software defined radio (SDR) standard and the application of SDR technology to reduce the costs and risks of using SDRs for space missions, and has developed an on-orbit testbed to validate these capabilities. The Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Testbed (previously known as the Communications, Navigation, and Networking reConfigurable Testbed (CoNNeCT)) is advancing SDR, on-board networking, and navigation technologies by conducting space experiments aboard the International Space Station. During its first year(s) on-orbit, the SCaN Testbed has achieved considerable accomplishments to better understand SDRs and their applications. The SDR platforms and software waveforms on each SDR have over 1500 hours of operation and are performing as designed. The Ka-band SDR on the SCaN Testbed is NASAs first space Ka-band transceiver and is NASA's first Ka-band mission using the Space Network. This has provided exciting opportunities to operate at Ka-band and assist with on-orbit tests of NASA newest Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS). During its first year, SCaN Testbed completed its first on-orbit SDR reconfigurations. SDR reconfigurations occur when implementing new waveforms on an SDR. SDR reconfigurations allow a radio to change <b>minor</b> <b>parameters,</b> such as data rate, or complete functionality. New waveforms which provide new capability and are reusable across different missions provide long term value for reconfigurable platforms such as SDRs. The STRS Standard provides guidelines for new waveform development by third parties. Waveform development by organizations other than the platform provider offers NASA the ability to develop waveforms itself and reduce its dependence and costs on the platform developer. Each of these new waveforms requires a waveform build environment for the particular SDR, helps assess the usefulness of the platform provider documentation, and exercises the objectives of STRS Standard and the SCaN Testbed. There is considerable interest in conducting experiments using the SCaN Testbed from NASA, academia, commercial companies, and other space agencies. There are approximately 25 experiments or activities supported by the project underway or in development, with more proposals ready, as time and funding allow, and new experiment solicitations available. NASA continues development of new waveforms and applications in communications, networking, and navigation, the first university experimenters are beginning waveform development, which will support the next generation of communications engineers, and international interest is beginning with space agency partners from European Space Agency (ESA) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). This paper will provide an overview of the SCaN Testbed and discuss its recent accomplishments and experiment activities. Its recent successes in Ka-band operations, reception of the newest GPS signals, SDR reconfigurations, and STRS demonstration in space when combined with the future experiment portfolio have positioned the SCaN Testbed to enable future space communications and navigation capabilities for exploration and science...|$|E

We localize the exact point where the distribution of irreducibles experiences this phase transition from a discrete limit to a central limit distribution and subsequently put our result into the context of quantifying the effect of sparsification of the folding of these respective mfe-structures. We show that the sparsification of realistic mfe-structures leads to a constant time and space reduction and that the sparsifcation of the folding of structures with modified parameters leads to a linear time and space reduction. We furthermore identify the limit distribution at the phase transition as a Rayleigh distribution. Comment: 34 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Self-weight and sustained load of 1 kPa are applied {{on top of}} the beams at the age of 14 days to simulate construction conditions. Creep tests on cylinders conducted with sustained loading commenced at the ages of 14 days and 28 days. The results from creep tests on GPC show higher creep in the specimens loaded at 14 days than those loaded at 28 days. Predictions of beam deflections are performed by using RCM, EMM and AEMM with input parameters of properties of GPC from experimental data, including elastic modulus, modulus of rupture, creep and shrinkage. These property tests show that GPC can achieve sufficient strength for structural designs, but both compressive strength and flexural tensile strength are affected by drying, which causes differential drying shrinkage and microcracking at the drying surfaces. The predicted deflections by these analysis methods are compared with the experimental results from beams, and show that RCM gives the worse performance of the three methods.

40|$|Understanding how {{proteins}} mutate {{is critical}} to solving a host of biological problems. Mutations occur when an amino acid is substituted for another in a protein sequence. The set of likelihoods for amino acid substitutions is stored in a matrix and input to alignment algorithms. The quality of the resulting alignment is {{used to assess the}} similarity of two or more sequences and can vary according to assumptions modeled by the substitution matrix. Substitution strategies with <b>minor</b> <b>parameter</b> variations are often grouped together in families. For example, the BLOSUM and PAM matrix families are commonly used because they provide a standard, predefined way of modeling substitutions. However, researchers often do not know if a given matrix family or any individual matrix within a family is the most suitable. Furthermore, predefined matrix families may inaccurately reflect a particular hypothesis that a researcher wishes to model or otherwise result in unsatisfactory alignments. In these cases, the ability to compare the effects of one or more custom matrices may be needed. This laborious process is often performed manually because the ability to simultaneously load multiple matrices and then compare their effects on alignments is not readily available in current software tools. This paper presents SubVis, an interactive R package for loading and applying multiple substitution matrices to pairwise alignments. Users can simultaneously explore alignments resulting from multiple predefined and custom substitution matrices. SubVis utilizes several of the alignment functions found in R, a common language among protein scientists. Functions are tied together with the Shiny platform which allows the modification of input parameters.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to enhance the economic performance of a batch transesterification reactor producing biodiesel by implementing advanced, model based control strategies. To achieve this goal, a dynamic model of the batch reactor system is first developed by considering reaction kinetics, mass balances and heat balances. The possible plant-model mismatch due to inaccurate or uncertain model parameter values can adversely affect model based control strategies. Therefore, an evolutionary algorithm to estimate the uncertain parameters is proposed. It is shown {{that the system is}} not observable with the available measurements, and hence a closed loop model predictive control cannot be implemented on a real system. Therefore, the productivity of the reactor is increased by first solving an open-loop optimal control problem. The objective function for this purpose optimizes the concentration of biodiesel, the batch time and the heating and cooling rates to the reactor. Subsequently, a closed-loop nonlinear model predictive control strategy is presented in order to take disturbances and model uncertainties into account. The controller, designed with a reduced model, tracks an offline determined set-point reactor temperature trajectory by manipulating the heating and cooling mass flows to the reactor. Several operational scenarios are simulated and the results are discussed in view of a real application. With the proposed optimization and control strategy and no parameter mismatch, a revenue of 2. 76 $ min(- 1) can be achieved from the batch reactor. Even with a <b>minor</b> <b>parameter</b> mismatch, the revenue is still 2. 01 $ min(- 1). While these values are comparable to those reported in the literature, this work also accounts for the cost of energy. Moreover, this approach results in a control strategy that can be implemented on a real system with limited online measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{response}} of wave energy converters an accurate representation of the wave climate resource is crucial. This paper gives an overview of wave resource modeling techniques as well as detailing a methodology for estimating the naturally available and technically recoverable resource in a given location. The methodology {{was developed by the}} EPRI and uses a modified Gamma spectrum that interoperates hindcast sea state parameter data produced by NOAA's Wave watch III. This Gamma spectrum is dependent on the calibration of two variables relating to the spectral width parameter and the spectral peakedness <b>parameter.</b> <b>Minor</b> changes were implemented by the author to increase accuracy in formulating wave length. Overall this methodology describes how to asses a given geographic area's wave resource for wave power density and total annual wave energy flux...|$|R
40|$|The craniofacial {{growth of}} 17 {{children}} born small for gestational age (SGA), {{who had received}} high-dose growth hormone (GH) treatment, was studied during the post-treatment phase. The preceding GH treatment consisted of a daily s. c. dose of either 0. 2 or 0. 3 IU/kg for 2 years. The group consisted of 9 girls and 8 boys with a mean (range) age of 6. 9 yr (4 - 10 years) {{at the start of}} the post-treatment period, a mean (SD) bone age of 6. 3 (2. 1) years, and a mean (SD) height for chronological age of - 1. 0 (0. 6) SDS. During the post-treatment period of 2 years, a catch-down effect was found for all linear craniofacial measurements in both treatment groups, even for the components that had not presented accelerated growth during GH treatment. Major growth vectors, such as the posterior total face height (S-Go) and the overall length of the mandible (Art-Pog), showed a low growth velocity, while <b>minor</b> growth <b>parameters</b> remained almost unchanged during this period. The angular measurements showed no significant changes during this period. It can be concluded that craniofacial growth in short SGA children showed, after a period of GH-induced acceleration, a catch-down period when GH administration is stopped. Despite this low post-treatment growth velocity, the craniofacial linear measurements in lateral aspect, remained larger than in untreated children. status: publishe...|$|R
