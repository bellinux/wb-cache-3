5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, <b>monism</b> {{does not accept}} any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, <b>monism</b> is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of <b>monism</b> in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic <b>monism</b> asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of <b>monism,</b> idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide variety of}} {{philosophical}} positions propounded in the Upanishads, commentators since Adi Shankara have usually followed him in seeing idealist <b>monism</b> as the dominant force.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as <b>monism</b> implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if <b>monism</b> is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} objectivation links the {{positioning}} and active {{role of the}} scientist {{in the construction of}} knowledge with the non-transparency of the object as a condition and limit of knowledge.

40|$|The {{received}} {{view is that}} absolutes lead to <b>monisms.</b> However, {{this paper}} argues just the opposite: there is prevalent philosophical tradition in which absolutes demand a pluralistic world of experience. We will explore this tradition starting with ancient Jewish philosophy. We will move through the 17 th century rationalists and conclude by investigating how modern philosophies of language and science adopt a concept of absolutes that are only expressed in a pluralistic world...|$|R

5|$|Born as Vasudeva in Pajaka {{village near}} Udupi in 1238, he learnt the Vedas and Upanishads under his guru Achyutapreksha. He was {{initiated}} into sanyasa (asceticism) {{after which he}} earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha). Later, he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel India. He successfully debated with many scholars and philosophers during this time and won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first notable disciple. Unlike Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) who preached Advaita philosophy (<b>monism)</b> and Ramanujacharya who propounded Vishishtadvaita philosophy (qualified <b>monism),</b> Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (dualism).|$|E
5|$|The Shaiva Puranas, {{particularly}} the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the {{various aspects of}} Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (Tirtha) associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider soul within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, dvaita), are the foundational texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (<b>monism,</b> advaita), and that Shiva is the soul, the perfection and truth within each living being. In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty four <b>monism</b> Agama texts.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{ethics in}} school education nowadays. It starts from visions of thinkers like Kant and Stuart Mill on ethical action which are discussed {{on the basis}} of the argumentative model pro - posed by Chaïm Perelman, who criticizes the conceptions that de - fend the unitary character of truth (<b>monisms).</b> This critical vision approximates it from inquisitive speeches of the traditional model of education, which disregards the student as subject of dialogue. Ethics is thought, therefore, in a view of pedagogical work attitude which, instead of prescribing what is “right” or “fair”, favours the problematization of thinking and acting. This one occurs through the confrontation between arguments that discuss values and forms of conduct, thereby contributing to avoid dogmatic and discrimina - tory attitudes in the school environmen...|$|R

Nosso primeiro esforço é definir estes termos do léxico filosófico, atentando para a sua generalidade.

5000|$|Heliade Rădulescu proposes, against <b>monisms</b> and dualisms of all kind, a {{trinitarian}} philosophy. He {{affirms that}} all philosophical concepts come in dualities, {{which can be}} classified in two categories: sympathetic (or parallel) and antipathetic. A sympathetic duality is formed by two [...] "positive" [...] terms, which indicate an existence: time / space; spirit / matter; right / duty etc. An antipathetic duality contains a positive and a negative term: life / death; movement / inertia; good / evil etc. Now, each sympathetic duality produces a third term, through which the dualism is overcome. Here are some examples: spirit / matter / universe; form / substance / body; progress / conservation / perfectibility; spiritual man / physical man / moral man. Beginning from here, Heliade Rădulescu develops a kind of cosmology, by means of naïve although ingenious geometrical considerations. He means thus to offer a metaphysical explanation of progress and then, armed with this metaphysics, to fight the liberalism. For his final purpose is to offer an argument {{in support of his}} political position, called [...] "progressive conservatism". To those who reply that this is an inconsistent position, he answers that the duality progress / conservation is not antipathetic, but sympathetic, and that only a progressive conservatism is perfectible.|$|R
5|$|A {{wide range}} of {{theological}} and philosophical ideas are presented through Krishna in Hindu texts. Ramanuja, a Hindu theologian whose works were influential in Bhakti movement, presented him in terms of qualified <b>monism</b> (Vishishtadvaita). Madhvacharya, a Hindu philosopher whose works led to the founding of Haridasa sect of Vaishnavism, presented Krishna {{in the framework of}} dualism (Dvaita). Jiva Goswami, a saint from Gaudiya Vaishnava school, described Krishna theology in terms of Bhakti yoga and Achintya Bheda Abheda. Krishna theology is presented in a pure <b>monism</b> (advaita, called shuddhadvaita) framework by Vallabha Acharya, who was the founder of Pushti sect of vaishnavism. Madhusudana Sarasvati, an India philospher, presented Krishna theology in nondualism-monism framework (Advaita Vedanta), while Adi Shankara, who is credited for unifying and establishing the main currents of thought in Hinduism, mentioned Krishna in his early eighth-century discussions on Panchayatana puja.|$|E

5|$|Although Maitreyi {{of ancient}} India, {{described}} as an Advaita philosopher, {{is said to be}} a wife of the sage Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in the time of Janaka, the Hindu epic Mahabharata states Sulabha Maitreyi is a young beauty who never marries. In the latter, Maitreyi explains Advaita philosophy (<b>monism)</b> to Janaka and is described as a lifelong ascetic. She is called as a brahmavadini (a female expounder of the Veda) in ancient Sanskrit literature. Maitreyi and Yajnavalkya are estimated to have lived around the 8th century BCE.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 104 - 107). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The theory of evolution, as articulated by Charles Darwin, {{is one of the most}} successful paradigms at work within the natural sciences. The importance of this theory is not, however, restricted to the scientific realm alone. For philosophy, the most important ramification of scientific evolutionary theory is that the world is no longer best understood as being static - a position that has been held historically due to the influence of Plato and Aristotle - but is rather best understood as being changing and in process. The Classical American philosophers William James and John Dewey recognized the importance of Darwin's work for philosophy; therefore, their work is examined in an effort to achieve clarity regarding the interactions between evolutionary theory and philosophy. What is found is that for both James and Dewey, philosophy begins with 'radical empiricism', the uniqueness present in any individual's particular experiences. Further, the experiences had by an individual constitute what is real. A philosophy thus grounded finds the universe to be pluralistic, without recourse to a priori <b>monisms</b> or dualisms. What is seen, then, is that both James and Dewey agree with Darwin that the world is best understood as being in process in addition to more carefully delineating the philosophical ramifications of such a position. The final question that is to be asked is this: How is one to form warranted beliefs within such a pluralistic universe? On Dewey's account, beliefs may be formed through a process of inquiry modeled after scientific methods of inquiry. Nevertheless, we humans often find ourselves in situations which do not logically direct our choice of beliefs. James is used to assist in this dilemma, specifically his argument that this type of decision must be made according to the 'passional nature' of the individual. Ultimately, what will be shown is that warranted beliefs must be chosen according to how they impact the continued experiences of the individual. But here one must proceed with caution, for just as beliefs might open up beneficial possibilities that were not available before, they might also eradicate possibilities, restricting the individual's ability to live well...|$|R
5|$|<b>Monism</b> is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world {{can be thought of as}} either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous <b>monism</b> and functionalism.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral <b>monism,</b> as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s.

Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and <b>monism.</b> Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
40|$|Este artigo discute o trabalho com a ética na escola (ensinos {{fundamental}} e médio) a partir de uma crítica ao modelo de racionalidade demonstrativa, predominante desde o advento da modernidade. Como alternativa, apresenta outro modelo, a racionalidade argumentativa, discutida com base nas abordagens feitas por Chaïm Perelman, Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca e Michel Meyer. Os dois primeiros autores formularam uma teoria da argumentação cujo objetivo é subsidiar os raciocínios próprios das ciências humanas e sociais, áreas do conhecimento nas quais procedimentos típicos da racionalidade demonstrativa, como a dedução e o cálculo, não se aplicam. Já Meyer salienta a natureza problematizadora da racionalidade argumentativa, situando a retórica como meio de negociar as distâncias existentes entre os indivíduos a propósito de determinadas questões. Esse quadro teórico é complementado pela filosofia do pluralismo, apontada por Perelman como contraponto às visões de mundo alicerçadas sobre concepções unitárias da verdade, denominadas monismos. Nos marcos desses referenciais, a concepção ética universalista de Immanuel Kant e o relativismo proposto pela ética da estética defendida por Michel Maffesoli são discutidos. Em um segundo tópico, a ética na educação escolar é problematizada tendo em vista a seguinte questão: como formar o caráter do aluno sem recair em algum tipo de doutrinação? Na medida em que ética e moral dizem respeito a essa questão, discutimos como os dois termos vêm sendo compreendidos e propomos tomá-los como instâncias intercambiáveis. As conclusões que apresentamos com base nessas discussões não objetivam solucionar os problemas inerentes aos hábitos e às atitudes dos discentes, mas colocam-se como contribuições para a reflexão dos docentes acerca de suas práticas pedagógicas. This article {{discusses the}} work on ethics in school (primary and secondary education) with basis on {{a critique of the}} model of demonstrative rationality, prevalent since the advent of modernity. Alternatively, it presents another model, the argumentative rationality one, which is discussed with basis on the approaches taken by Chaïm Perelman, Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca and Michel Meyer. The first two authors have formulated a theory of argumentation whose goal is to support the typical reasoning of human and social sciences, knowledge areas in which typical procedures of demonstrative rationality, such as deduction and calculation do not apply. Meyer stresses the problematizing nature of argumentative rationality, placing the rhetoric as a means of negotiating the distance between individuals in regard to certain issues. This theoretical framework is complemented by the philosophy of pluralism appointed by Perelman as a counterpoint to the worldviews grounded on unitary conceptions of truth, called <b>monisms.</b> In this theoretical framework, I discuss the universalistic ethical concept of Kant and the relativism proposed by the ethics of aesthetics defended by Maffesoli. In a second topic, ethics in school education is problematized in view of the question: how can one shape the character of the student without falling into some sort of indoctrination? To the extent that ethics and morality relate to this question, I discuss how the two terms have been understood and I propose to regard them as interchangeable instances. The conclusions I present based on these discussions aim not to solve the problems inherent in the habits and attitudes of students, but to contribute to teachers' reflection about their teaching practices...|$|R
5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{interpretation}} of the Upanishad is a qualified <b>monism.</b> Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to be teaching a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the dweller in all things, yet also distinct and beyond all things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls {{to be of the}} same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively they are distinct.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and <b>monism</b> {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|The Sautrāntika school held {{a form of}} phenomenalism {{that saw}} the world as imperceptible. It held that {{external}} objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its internalist stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism. Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects {{as anything other than}} mental entities. Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, neutral <b>monism</b> and realist phenomenology.|$|E
5|$|Yoga and Vedanta are the {{two largest}} {{surviving}} schools of Hindu traditions. They share many thematic principles, concepts and belief in self/soul, but diverge in degree, style {{and some of their}} methods. Epistemologically, Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways. Yoga disputes the <b>monism</b> of Advaita Vedanta. Yoga school believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity; Advaita Vedanta, in contrast, believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything, everyone and the Universal Self. They both hold that the free conscience is aloof yet transcendent, liberated and self-aware. Further, Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good, ultimate freedom and jivanmukti.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) {{are one and}} the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to <b>monism)</b> or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E
