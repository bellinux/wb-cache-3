40|$|ABSTRACT In {{a series}} of experiments, various {{chemotherapeutic}} agents administered in feed were evaluated for their efficacy against experimental Pasteurella anatipestifer (PA) infection in White Pekin ducklings. The feeding of medicated diets was started 3 days prior to challenge and continued throughout each experiment. Novobiocin and lincomycin, when fed at adequate concen-trations, were the most effective medicaments tested. Mortality in treated groups was 0 - 18 % compared with 45 - 92 % <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls.</b> Sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim, sulfaquinoxaline, and lincomycin-spectinomycin were moderately effective. Drugs that were not effective included chlortetracycline, tylosin-sulfamethazine, fosfomycin, furazolidone, nihydrazone, penicillin, bacitracin, and erythromycin. Six antibiotics were tested parenterally against experimental PA infection in another series of experiments. A single dose of an antibiotic was injected subcutaneously 5 to 6 hr after infection except in one experiment in which treatment was delayed until 24 hr after infection. When given 5 to 6 hr after infection, lincomycin-spectinomycin, penicillin-streptomycin, penicillin, oxytetra-cycline, and spectinomycin significantly reduced mortality. Gentamicin tested under the same conditions was ineffective. Drugs injected 24 hr after infection were not effective...|$|E

At 24 h after silica injection, silica-treated and -untreated mice were challenged intravenously with varying doses of live yeast cells of Histoplasma capsulatum. All mice receiving silica died when challenged with 5 X 10 (5) yeast cells of Histoplasma sp. compared with no deaths in PVNO-pretreated animals and 10 % <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> not receiving PVNO or silica. When animals were given 2. 5 X 10 (5) yeast cells (a sublethal dose), the protective effect of PVNO was seen by a reduction in splenomegaly and viable Histoplasma sp. present in the spleen. Furthermore, PVNO alone showed a significant protective effect (P less than 0. 05) against a lethal challenge with Histoplasma sp. Prior treatment with PVNO also protected mouse peritoneal macrophages from the cytotoxic effects of silica particles in vitro.

40|$|Bacterial {{pneumonia}} is {{an increasing}} complication of HIV infection and inversely correlates with the CD 4 � lymphocyte count. Interleukin (IL) - 17 is a cytokine produced principally by CD 4 � T cells, which induces granulopoiesis via granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production and induces CXC chemokines. We hypothesized that IL- 17 receptor (IL- 17 R) signaling is critical for G-CSF and CXC chemokine production and lung host defenses. To test this, we used a model of Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection in mice genetically deficient in IL- 17 R or in mice overexpressing a soluble IL- 17 R. IL- 17 R–deficient mice were exquisitely sensitive to intranasal K. pneumoniae with 100 % mortality after 48 h compared with only 40 % <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls.</b> IL- 17 R knockout (KO) mice displayed a significant delay in neutrophil recruitment into the alveolar space, and had greater dissemination of K. pneumoniae compared with control mice. This defect {{was associated with a}} significant reduction in steady-state levels of G-CSF and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 2 mRNA and protein in the lung in response to the K. pneumoniae challenge in IL- 17 R KO mice. Thus, IL- 17 R signaling is critical for optimal production of G-CSF and MIP- 2 and local control of pulmonary K. pneumoniae infection. These data support impaired IL- 17 R signaling as a potential mechanism by which deficiency of CD 4 lymphocytes predisposes to bacterial pneumonia.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the in vitro and in vivo, histopathological, anti-parasitic and hematopathological effects of the essential oil of Lippia origanoides on Colossoma macropomum. Essential oil concentrations of 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mg·L- 1 were tested in vitro against monogenoideans (Anacanthorus spathulatus, Notozothecium janauachensis and Mymarothecium boegeri) from the gills of C. macropomum. Concentrations of 320 and 160 mg·L- 1 were 100 % effective against these parasites within 20 and 60 min of exposure, respectively. The 80 mg·L- 1 concentration was approximately 80 % effective with 3 h of exposure, reaching 100 % with 6 h of exposure. The 40 mg·L- 1 concentration was also 100 % effective with 6 h of exposure. The other concentrations were only weakly effective in vitro. Parasite <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> (water or water + alcohol) began after 3 h, with 100 % mortality after 8 h. In vivo tests, in which fry of C. macropomum were placed in baths with 20 mg·L- 1 of the essential oil for 60 min, and 40 mg·L- 1 for 30 min, {{did not lead to}} reductions in parasite abundances. In addition, the essential oil had an anaesthetic effect on fish, increased total protein levels, increased monocyte and neutrophil numbers, and reduced haematocrit. Slight to moderate and severe damage was observed in the gills of C. macropomum fingerling immediately after exposure to the essential oil, and 24 h after the treatments were applied, with no difference between treatments. Histological changes observed in the gills after exposure to concentrations of 20 and 40 mg·L- 1 of L. origanoides essential oil were: hyperplasia and fusion of the lamellar epithelium, capillary dilation, displacement of the lamellar epithelium, and lamellar aneurism and epithelial rupturing with haemorrhaging. Oedema, mucous and chloride cell proliferation, lamellar hypertrophy, congestion and necrosis were less frequently observed. It can be concluded that the essential oil of L. origanoides was dose-dependent in vitro effect against monogenoidean parasites of C. macropomum. Unfortunately, the low concentrations tolerated by the fish in the vivo assay (20 and 40 mg·L- 1) was not effective. Statement of relevance: The manuscript represents original research on use of the essential oil of Lippia origanoides against ectoparasites of Colossoma macropomum, an important finfish of Amazon region. This manuscript includes treatment in vitro against monogenoideans, and in vivo against protozoans and monogenoideans.

40|$|Independent studies {{report that}} stroke {{incidence}} in younger ages is increasing. Consequences after stroke include disability, cognitive dysfunction {{and the risk}} of stroke recurrence and coronary events. There are still many gaps of knowledge regarding post-stroke outcomes. Therefore the aim of the present thesis was to describe long-term prognosis in young and middle-aged ischemic stroke sufferers and to identify predictors of mortality and recurrent vascular events. The studies were based on the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS), with 1, 090 consecutive adult patients and 600 controls, all younger than 70 years. All participants were very well characterized at baseline with respect to vascular risk factors, life- style and socioeconomic factors. Patients were classified according to etiologic subtype, i. e. large vessel disease (LVD), small vessel disease (SVD), cardioembolic stroke (CE), cryptogenic stroke, other determined stroke and undetermined stroke. Stroke severity was assessed. Two years after index stroke surviving patients were contacted for a structured telephone interview, with questions about recurrent vascular events and assessment of functional outcome. After 7 years patients participated in a follow-up visit to a study physician and a study nurse, and were tested with the Barrow Neurological Institute Screen for Higher Cerebral Functions (BNIS). Data on mortality and recurrent vascular were collected through national registers and medical records for both cases and controls. First, we investigated 2 -year outcomes in patients. We showed that stroke severity, the subtype of LVD, and hypertension were independent predictors of the composite outcome (death and/or recurrent vascular events). With regards to functional outcome, stroke severity was also an independent predictor of dependency. Next, we investigated very long-term outcomes. After 12 -year follow-up stroke incidence was 10 times higher in cases compared to controls, whereas the incidence of coronary events was only twofold higher in cases. Both diabetes and smoking were independent predictors of the composite outcome (recurrent vascular events), and diabetes also independently predicted both mortality and coronary events. Living alone was a strong and independent predictor of mortality, and also predicted stroke recurrence. There was an interaction between living alone and gender, with highest mortality among males living alone. Living alone also showed association to <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls.</b> An increased risk of coronary events was found among physically inactive patients. A personal history of stroke predicted the composite outcome and stroke recurrence, whereas a personal history of coronary heart disease showed association to all outcomes except stroke recurrence. Patients with the subtype of LVD and CE stroke had an increased mortality rate, and LVD also showed an increased incidence of the composite outcome. Stroke severity was associated with all outcomes except coronary events. We found the BNIS to be a promising screening instrument for cognitive dysfunction after ischemic stroke, and our results indicate that a large proportion of younger stroke patients may have cognitive dysfunction many years after stroke. In conclusion, young and middle-aged ischemic stroke patients face a high and sustained risk of mortality and recurrent vascular events many years after stroke. In addition to classical vascular risk factors stroke subtype and stroke severity influence outcome events. Moreover, emerging modifiable lifestyle factors such as living alone and physical activity have an impact on mortality and the rate of recurrent vascular events, and some of these effects vary by endpoint. Thus, further studies are needed to develop more patient-tailored secondary prevention measures in order to improve long-term outcomes after ischemic stroke...|$|E
30|$|Three of {{the studies}} {{presented}} in this review used intravital microscopy to assess the microcirculation, two demonstrating an improvement with fluid administration [61, 63] and one an improvement with hydroxyl-ethyl starch but not saline administration [62]. Only one study used laser speckle microcirculatory imaging [52] and showed no improvement following fluid administration. Three studies presented in this review used laser Doppler imaging and showed improved microcirculatory reactivity with fluid administration [64, 65, 67]. Microcirculatory assessment by sidestream dark-field imaging presented in this review exhibited heterogeneous effects in different tissues in one study [68], but no improvement in another [51]. Comparisons of different microcirculatory imaging techniques {{have been reported in}} literature [41, 74 – 76]. Investigators who conducted a comparative study on cochlear blood flow concluded that intravital microscopic measurements were more sensitive than laser Doppler measurements [77]. However, comparing the microcirculatory results attained with different methods is a significant challenge. We considered some of these, including videomicroscopic techniques, whilst offering direct visualization of the microcirculation, the tissue contact element is largely uncontrolled and may cause pressure-induced artefacts. On the other hand, laser techniques are susceptible to motion artefacts, so that combining techniques might enhance the accuracy of microcirculatory assessments [76]. Only one study presented in this review used a combination of techniques to assess the microcirculation (i.e., laser Doppler flowmetry and sidestream dark-field imaging) and reported persistent acidosis, microcirculatory and mitochondrial dysfunction despite resuscitation with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) fluid [15]. Routine microcirculation assessment is rarely performed owing to heterogeneity of microvascular beds in different organs and complexity of assessment techniques. There was significant heterogeneity in the type and volume of resuscitation fluids used in the studies presented in this review. Clinically, substantial controversy still surrounds the choice of fluid for resuscitation. The Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study in adults similarly failed to identify any significant difference in the sepsis sub-group of patients [78], despite a lower unadjusted relative risk of death for albumin versus saline compared with non-septic patients [79]. The Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch Trial (CHEST) revealed an increased rate of renal replacement therapy and adverse events (pruritus, rash) in intensive care unit patients resuscitated using colloid (6 % hydroxyethyl starch, HES) compared to crystalloid (0.9 % saline), with {{no significant difference in the}} 90 -day mortality between the two groups [80]. For paediatric sepsis, the evidence base for fluid resuscitation upon definitive choices of fluids for resuscitation in severe infection and shock remains very weak [81], with most studies providing low quality of evidence or focusing on malaria and dengue. The FEAST trial documented a 45 % relative (95 % confidence interval, CI 13 – 86 %) increase in 48 -h mortality compared to control, with no significant difference between the saline and albumin bolus arms [57]. A subsequent systematic review formally assessing the evidence for bolus fluid resuscitation included 13 studies which met the inclusion criteria (4 general shock, 4 malaria, 4 dengue and 1 severe malnutrition). None were conducted in high-income countries and the only study to include a control arm (i.e. no fluid bolus arm; FEAST trial), found at 48  h a lower <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> compared to those receiving saline or colloid boluses (relative risk for sepsis 0.69, 95 % CI 0.54 – 0.89 and for malaria 0.64, 95 % CI 0.46 – 0.91, respectively) [82]. Similarly, other studies have reported higher rates of morbidity and mortality with positive fluid balance in septic shock [83 – 89] and one retrospective pilot study reported good prognosis in patients who achieved a negative fluid balance within the first 3  days of septic shock [90]. Previous research showing transient pulmonary arterial hypertension that was induced by transfusion with donor blood, which had been stored for 35 – 42  days, is suggestive of a two-hit hypothesis that can be extrapolated to sepsis (first-hit) and volume resuscitation (second-hit) [91].|$|E

We also examined midgut tissues by EM, quantitated heme in fecal samples, and characterized feeding-induced protein expression in midgut, fat body, and ovary tissues of COPI-deficient mosquitoes. We found that COPI defects disrupt epithelial cell membrane integrity, stimulate premature blood meal excretion, and block induced expression of several midgut protease genes. To study the role of COPI transport in ovarian development, we injected γCOPI dsRNA after blood feeding and found that, although blood digestion was normal, follicles in these mosquitoes were significantly smaller by 48 h postinjection and lacked eggshell proteins. Together, these data show that COPI functions are critical to mosquito blood digestion and egg maturation, a finding that could also apply to other blood-feeding arthropod vectors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Extensive {{blood loss}} in total hip surgery {{is well known}} and is {{associated}} with a high transfusion rate of allogeneic blood. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the effects of intraoperative tranexamic acid on post-operative bleeding and need for allogeneic transfusion during hip fracture surgery. We investigated 67 patients undergoing hip fracture surgery in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. 32 patients received tranexamic acid (TA) given in a bolus dose of 15 mg/kg before surgical incision. The remaining, 35 patients were allocated as control group. Postoperative bleeding, transfusions, complications, and hospital stay were recorded. The intraoperative bleeding was significantly lower in the TA group (652 ± 228 ml vs. 1108 ± 372 ml, P < 0. 003). Post operative drainage was lower in TA group (296 ± 85 ml vs. 375 ± 110 ml, P < 0. 195). There were no differences in coagulation parameters. The rates of transfused patients <b>in</b> TA and <b>control</b> groups were 37 % and 57 %. In TA group, hospital stay was 4. 3 ± 1. 6 days (vs. 5. 8 ± 1. 5 days <b>in</b> <b>control</b> group; P < 0. 05). There is one <b>in</b> hospital <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> group. We conclude that tranexamic acid significantly reduces blood loss during hip fracture surgery...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that, in {{unmanaged}} units, MPB-caused mortality alters forest fuel profiles (summarized in Jenkins et al. 2012, but see Simard et al. 2011). Our mediation analysis illustrates that CF loading after the outbreak was significantly lower <b>in</b> thin+burn than <b>control</b> despite high MPB-caused tree <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> units, and FWD loading was lower in thin+burn units because of the high MPB-caused tree mortality. Additionally, MPB-caused tree mortality inflated differences between thinned and <b>control</b> units <b>in</b> FWD and CWD pools, but reduced existing differences in the CF pool. These linked fuel loadings demonstrate that MPB caused fuel transfer from overstory to surface pools, and that although MPB-caused tree mortality partially masked or diminished differences between thinned and unthinned canopies, unthinned canopy fuels translocated to the ground inflated surface fuel loading beyond thinned treatments. The nature of these differences is also manifested in the divergence of assigned fire behavior fuel models by treatments. FFE-FVS assigned slash group fire behavior fuel models (“medium logging slash” and “heavy logging slash”) to characterize unthinned surface fuel profiles, which is expected to make potential fire behavior more volatile, increasing soil heating and belowground severity.|$|R
40|$|Human infections due to {{free-living}} amebas of {{the genus}} Acathamoeba have been reported sporadically, occasionally in individuals with underlying diseases. To determine if such infections may be considered opportunistic, groups of laboratory mice were pretreated with either methylprednisolone or tetracycline and inoculated intranasally with 1. 075 times 10 (4) Acanthamoeba castellanii isolated from a natural fresh water well. Results were compared with controls receiving either drug or amebas alone and with controls receiving saline injections with and without amebas. The mortality rate for those animals receiving methylprednisolone and amebas (50 %) {{was found to be}} greater than the <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> ameba <b>controls</b> (10 %) (P equal 0. 074). Similarly, the mortality rate for animals receiving tetracycline and amebas (60 %) was higher than the <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> the ameba <b>controls</b> (10 %) (P equal 0. 0286). Precise mechanisms for the increased mortality were unknown but were suspected to be due to the capacity of either corticosteroids or tetracycline to suppress host defenses, particularly those depending on neutrophils. The findings suggest a potentially pathogenic role for naturally occurring Acanthamoeba sp in humans with depressed host immunity...|$|R
40|$|Standardized {{ecotoxicological}} tests still {{constitute the}} fundamental tools when doing risk-assessment of aquatic contaminants. These protocols are managed towards minimal <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> the <b>controls,</b> {{which is not}} representative for natural systems where mortality is often high. This methodological bias, generated from assays where <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> the <b>control</b> group is systematically disregarded, {{makes it difficult to}} measure therapeutic effects of pharmaceutical contaminants leading to lower mortality. This is of concern considering that such effects on exposed organisms still may have substantial ecological consequences. In this paper, we illustrate this conceptual problem by presenting empirical data for how the therapeutic effect of Oxazepam-a common contaminant of surface waters-lower mortality rates among exposed Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) from wild populations, at two different life stages. We found that fry hatched from roe that had been exposed to dilute concentrations (1. 1 +/- 0. 3 mu g l(- 1)) of Oxazepam for 24 h 3 - 6 days prior to hatching showed lower mortality rates and increased activity 30 days after hatching. Similar effects, i. e. increased activity and lower mortality rates were also observed for 2 -year old perch exposed to dilute Oxazepam concentrations (1. 2 +/- 0. 4 mu g l(- 1)). We conclude that therapeutic effects from pharmaceutical contaminants need to be considered in risk assessment assays to avoid that important ecological effects from aquatic contaminants are systematically missed...|$|R
40|$|The guava weevil Conotrach­elus psidii Marshall {{is a major}} pest {{affecting}} guava cultiva­tion in Santander, Colombia; {{it causes}} serious losses in the quality and the volume of fruit produced. Biological control is a viable option for pest management; entomo­pathogenic nematodes (EPNs), particularly, have shown good results (63 - 90 % <b>mortality)</b> <b>in</b> <b>controlling</b> fourth in­star larvae of the guava weevil. In this study we evaluated the effect of seven species of EPNs isolated in Colom­bia: Steinernema websteri JCL 006, Steinernema sp. 1 JCL 024, Steinernema sp. 2 JCL 007, Steinernema sp. 3 JCL 027, S. co­lombiense SNI 0198, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora HNI 0100 and Heterorhabditis sp. SL 0708 on fourth instar larvae of the guava weevil in laboratory conditions, and measured the production and the displacement of the most viru­lent. Heterorhabditis sp. SL 0708 induced mortality of 85 %, Steinernema sp. 1 JCL 024 75 % and S. colombiense SNI 0198 55 %, the other species of EPNs, less than 25 % mortality. Increased production of JI by weevil larva was recorded in Heterorhabditis sp. SL 0708, which also showed greater recognition capability when the host was C. psidii...|$|R
