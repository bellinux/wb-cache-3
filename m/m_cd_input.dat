40|$|Although current {{assessments}} of agricultural management practices on soil organic C (SOC) dynamics are usually conducted without any explicit consideration of limits to soil C storage, {{it has been}} hypothesized that the SOC pool has an upper, or saturation limit with respect to <b>C</b> <b>input</b> levels at steady state. Agricultural management practices that increase <b>C</b> <b>input</b> levels over time produce a new equilibrium soil C content. However, multiple <b>C</b> <b>input</b> level treatments that produce no increase in SOC stocks at equilibrium show that soils have become saturated with respect to <b>C</b> <b>inputs.</b> SOC storage of added <b>C</b> <b>input</b> {{is a function of}} how far a soil is from saturation level (saturation deficit) as well as <b>C</b> <b>input</b> level. We tested experimentally if C saturation deficit and varying <b>C</b> <b>input</b> levels influenced soil C stabilization of added C- 13 in soils varying in SOC content and physiochemical characteristics. We incubated for 2. 5 years soil samples from seven agricultural sites that were closer to (i. e., A-horizon) or further from (i. e., C-horizon) their C saturation limit. At the initiation of the incubations, samples received low or high <b>C</b> <b>input</b> levels of 13 C-labeled wheat straw. We also tested the effect of Ca addition and residue quality on a subset of these soils. We hypothesized that the proportion of C stabilized would be greater in samples with larger C Saturation deficits (i. e., the C- versus A-horizon samples) and that the relative stabilization efficiency (i. e., Delta SCC/Delta <b>C</b> <b>input)</b> would decrease as <b>C</b> <b>input</b> level increased. We found that C saturation deficit influenced the stabilization of added residue at six out of the seven sites and C addition level affected the stabilization of added residue in four sites, corroborating both hypotheses. Increasing Ca availability or decreasing residue quality had no effect on the stabilization of added residue. The amount of new C stabilized was significantly related to C saturation deficit, supporting the hypothesis that C saturation influenced C stabilization at all our sites. Our results suggest that soils with low C contents and degraded lands may have the greatest potential and efficiency to store added C because they are further from their saturation level.

According {{to the concept}} of SOC saturation, the ability of SOC to increase with <b>C</b> <b>input</b> decreases as SOC increases and approaches a SOC saturation level. In a 12 -year experiment, six semi-arid cropping systems characterized by different rates of <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to soil were compared for ability to sequester SOC, SOC saturation level, and the time necessary to reach the SOC saturation level. SOC stocks, soil aggregate sizes, and <b>C</b> <b>inputs</b> were measured in durum wheat monocropping with (Ws) and without (W) return of aboveground residue to the soil and in the following cropping systems without return of aboveground residue to soil: durum wheat/fallow (Wfall), durum wheat/berseem clover, durum wheat/barley/faba bean, and durum wheat/Hedysarum coronarium. The C sequestration rate and SOC content were lowest in Wfall plots but did not differ among the other cropping systems. The C sequestration rate ranged from 0. 47 MgC ha- 1 y- 1 in Ws plots to 0. 66 MgCha- 1 y- 1 in W plots but was negative (- 0. 06 MgCha- 1 y- 1) in Wfall plots.

However, some soils show little or no increase in steady-state SOC stock with increasing <b>C</b> <b>input</b> levels suggesting that SOC can become saturated with respect to <b>C</b> <b>input.</b> We used long-term field experiment data to assess alternative hypotheses of soil carbon storage by three simple models: a linear model (no saturation), a one-pool whole-soil C saturation model, and a two-pool mixed model with C saturation of a single C pool, but not the whole soil. The one-pool C saturation model best fit the combined data from 14 sites, four individual sites were best-fit with the linear model, and no sites were best fit by the mixed model. These results indicate that existing agricultural field experiments generally have too small a range in <b>C</b> <b>input</b> levels to show saturation behavior, and verify the accepted linear relationship between soil <b>C</b> and <b>C</b> <b>input</b> used to model SOM dynamics. However, all sites combined and the site with the widest range in <b>C</b> <b>input</b> levels were best fit with the C-saturation model. Nevertheless, the same site produced distinct effective stabilization capacity curves rather than an absolute C saturation level.

40|$|The soil carbon (C) pool {{is one of}} {{the largest}} pools of C in the {{terrestrial}} environment. Soil management strategies to increase soil C are of interest globally to reduce atmospheric CO₂ concentrations which are contributing to climate change. Changes in land use and land management can result in gains, or losses of soil C, and consequently change in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. Increasing the <b>C</b> <b>inputs</b> to soil by either increasing plant root mass has been suggested as one method to increase soil C. In New Zealand, pastoral agriculture is dominated by the use of perennial ryegrass and white clover pastures which are typically shallow rooting species. The use of more diverse pastures including additional species such as lucerne, chicory and plantain, may increase root mass or rooting depth. However, there is limited data on root mass and <b>C</b> <b>inputs</b> from roots to soil under ryegrass-clover pasture systems and no data on more diverse pasture swards in New Zealand pasture systems. The objective of this research was to investigate whether more diverse pasture swards had greater root mass and <b>C</b> <b>inputs</b> to soil compared to ryegrassclover and whether diverse pastures offered scope to increase soil C. Root mass was measured under a moderately diverse and a ryegrass-clover pasture in an existing plant diversity trial at a research dairy farm (Scott Farm, DairyNZ) containing 6 replicate paddocks of each pasture type. Soil cores were collected seasonally over one year to 300 mm depth and divided into three 100 mm depth sections (0 – 100, 100 – 200, 200 – 300 mm) and root mass measured after soil was washed off. There was greater root mass (0 – 300 mm) under the moderately diverse pasture (5320 - 9350 kg ha⁻¹) compared to the ryegrass-clover pasture (3810 - 5700 kg ha⁻¹) for all seasons. Additionally, there was greater root mass lower in the soil profile (100 – 200, 200 – 300 mm) in the moderately diverse pasture. The increased root mass in the moderately diverse pasture resulted in an estimated additional <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to soil of about 1203 kg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ (0 – 300 mm) but this estimate did not include contributions from root exudates. Root trait measurements of individual plant species also demonstrated a greater diversity of root traits (specific root length, surface area, and diameter) in the moderately diverse pasture, which may be important for the <b>C</b> <b>input</b> and <b>C</b> stabilisation processes in soil. Root turnover and <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to soil was measured on three replicate paddocks each of moderately diverse and ryegrass-clover pastures, also at Scott Farm. An isotope (¹³CO₂) pulse labelling method was used whereby clear chambers (1 m²) were placed over pasture and ¹³CO₂ taken up following photosynthesis. Labelling was carried out once weekly for a period of five weeks, giving a total of 5 labelling events. Soil cores were collected at regular intervals following isotope labelling for up to 138 days and δ 13 C measured in the roots (0 – 100, 100 – 200 mm depth) and soil (0 – 100 mm depth) to calculate root turnover and <b>C</b> <b>input.</b> There was no difference in root turnover rates between the moderately diverse (298 days) and ryegrass-clover (260 days) pastures, with a combined root turnover rate of 276 days for both pastures. However, large variability in data meant that the ability to detect differences between pasture swards was low. The average <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to soil for both pastures was 58 kg C ha⁻¹ d⁻¹ over an 88 day period which was greater than other reported studies in New Zealand. A likely cause of this high <b>C</b> <b>input</b> from roots to soil was the severe drought conditions during the study that may have increased root death and <b>C</b> <b>inputs</b> from roots to soil. While previous work determined similar root turnover and <b>C</b> <b>inputs</b> under both conventional and moderately diverse pastures, a final experiment focussed on whether pasture renewal of a ryegrass-clover pasture could result in increased root turnover, and therefore, greater <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to soil. Root turnover and <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to soil under ryegrass-clover pasture with and without pasture renewal was measured using an isotope pulse labelling method. Pastures (paired plots in 3 replicate paddocks) were labelled with ¹³CO₂ daily for five days within clear chambers (1 m²) before one replicate in each pair was sprayed with herbicide and seed direct drilled. Soil cores were collected (0 – 100, 100 – 200 mm depths) at regular intervals over a 89 day period following isotope labelling and root turnover and <b>C</b> <b>input</b> measured by following the decline in ¹³C in extracted roots. Following herbicide application, there was an initial rapid increase in root turnover (17 days) followed by a more similar turnover (524 days) compared to the unsprayed treatment (585 days). The increased root turnover following the use of herbicide resulted in increased <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to the soil in the sprayed treatment (3238 kg C ha⁻¹) compared to the unsprayed ryegrass-clover treatment (1726 kg C ha⁻¹). This suggested that during pasture renewal there is a large <b>input</b> of <b>C.</b> However, the proportion of this C that is stabilised in soil requires further investigation. This research demonstrated there is potential to increase soil C by using more diverse pastures through increased root mass and rooting depth. This work also provided the first measurements of root mass and <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to soil under moderately diverse pastures in New Zealand and adds to the limited information on the root mass, root turnover and <b>C</b> <b>input</b> under ryegrass-clover pasture systems. Furthermore, this work provided the first measurements of root turnover and <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to soil during a pasture renewal event involving herbicide. The data from this research will contribute better information for use in modelling and increase the knowledge and understanding of soil C under grazed pasture systems in New Zealand. Further research on investigating the root dynamics under more diverse pastures with respect to root traits such as diameter, surface area and specific root length within these pastures and how these traits influence the root turnover and <b>C</b> <b>input</b> to soil would be beneficial. Improving the understanding on the quantity of C that is stabilised and the C stabilisation processes in these pasture systems is also important in order to achieve meaningful reductions in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} study is presented of the room-temperature absorption, natural and magnetic circulation-dichroism (<b>c.</b> d. and <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d.) spectra of cytochrome c oxidase {{and a number}} of its derivatives in the wavelength range 700 - 1900 nm. The spectra of the reduced enzyme show a strong negative c. d. band peaking at 1100 nm arising from low-spin ferrous haem a and a positive <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. peak at 780 nm assigned to high-spin ferrous haem a 3. Addition of cyanide ion doubles the intensity of the low-spin ferrous haem c. d. band and abolishes reduced carbonmonoxy derivative the haem a 32 +-CO group shows no <b>c.</b> d. or <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. bands at wavelengths longer than 700 nm. A comparison of the <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. spectra of the oxidized and cyanide-bound oxidized forms enables bands characteristic of the high-spin ferric form of haem a 33 + to be identified between 700 and 1300 nm. At wavelengths longer than 1300 nm a broad positive <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. spectrum, peaking at 1600 nm, is observed. By comparison with the <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. spectrum of an extracted haem a-bis-imidazole complex this <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. peak is assigned to one low-spin ferric haem, namely haem a 3 +. On binding of cyanide to the oxidized form of the enzyme a new, weak, <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. signal appears, which is assigned to the low-spin ferric haem a 33 +-CN species. A reductive titration, with sodium dithionite, of the cyanide-bound form of the enzyme leads to a partially reduced state in which low-spin haem a 2 + is detected by means of an intense negative c. d. peak at 1100 nm and low-spin ferric haem a 33 +-CN gives a sharp positive <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. peak at 1550 nm. The <b>c.</b> d. and <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. characteristics of the 830 nm absorption band in oxidized cytochrome c oxidase are not typical of type 1 blue cupric centres...|$|R

(magnetic-circular-dichroism) {{spectrum}} {{recorded at}} low {{temperature in the}} range 450 - 900 nm is reported for oxidized resting mammalian cytochrome <b>c</b> oxidase. <b>M.</b> <b>c.</b> d. magnetization curves determined at different wavelengths reveal the presence of two paramagnetic species. Curves at 576, 613 and 640 nm fit well to those expected for an x,y-polarized haem transition with g values of 3. 03, 2. 21 and 1. 45, i. e. cytochrome a 3 +. The <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. features at 515, 785 and 817 nm magnetize as a S = 1 / 2 paramagnet with average g values close to 2, and simulated <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. magnetization curves obtained by using the observed g values of CuA 2 +, i. e. 2. 18, 2. 03 and 1. 99, fit well to the experimental observations. The form of the <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. magnetization curve at 466 nm is curious, {{but it can be}} explained if CuA 2 + and cytochrome a 3 + contribute with oppositely signed bands at this wavelength. By comparing the <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. spectrum of the enzyme with that of extracted haem a-bisimidazole complex it has been possible to deconvolute the <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. spectrum of CuA 2 +, which shows transitions throughout the spectral region from 450 to 950 nm. The <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. -spectral properties of CuA 2 + were compared with those of a well-defined type I blue copper centre in azurin isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The absolute intensities of the <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. signals at equal fields and temperatures for CuA 2 + are 10 - 20 -fold greater than those for azurin. The optical spectrum of CuA 2 + strongly suggests an assignment as a d 9 ion rather than Cu(I) bound to a thiyl radical...|$|R

40|$|Strategies for {{mitigating}} soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) losses in intensively managed agricultural systems typically draw from traditional concepts of {{soil organic matter}} formation, and thus emphasize increasing <b>C</b> <b>inputs,</b> especially from slowly decomposing crop residues, and reducing soil disturbance. However these approaches are often ineffective and do not adequately reflect current views of SOC cycling, which stress the important contributions of microbial biomass (MB) inputs to SOC. We examined microbial physiology as an alternate mechanism of SOC accumulation under organic (ORG) compared to conventional (CT) agricultural management practices, where ORG is accumulating C despite fewer total <b>C</b> <b>inputs</b> and greater soil tillage. We hypothesized that microbial communities in ORG have higher growth rates (MGR) and C use efficiencies (CUE) and that this relates to greater MB production and ultimately higher retention of new <b>C</b> <b>inputs.</b> We show that ORG had 50...|$|R
