50|$|Philippines: During World War II, American missionaries {{inquired about}} <b>MCC</b> <b>training.</b> In the 1950s enthusiasm was unprecedented. The Philippines boasted more {{participation}} {{than any other}} nation. C. M. Sorenson directed the Philippine MCC program in the 1950s. Dick visited in 1953. When Dick sought memoirs and information about MCC history in 1983 {{in preparation for the}} MCC's 50th anniversary, he was surprised to learn the program was still active in the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|With the {{reactivation}} of the MCC, its proven {{success for}} American Adventists, and promotion by American missionaries serving internationally, interest grew {{in establishing the}} MCC in many countries around the world. During World War II, <b>MCC</b> <b>training</b> was initiated independently in a few locations, but in 1951 the General Conference purposefully began promoting the MCC program throughout {{the world through the}} newly established International Commission for Medical Cadet Service. Everett Dick was invited to Canada in 1951 to assist with creating a training program for officers. In 1953, 1955, and 1957 he traveled to the Far East to establish and supervise corps. He also visited the Caribbean and Lebanon. In each country where the MCC was adopted, relationships were established with the local military and the curriculum adapted to the standards of that country. The MCC was most popular in countries ruled by military governments or under immediate threat of conflict. It was not popular in Europe and was established with reluctance in Japan.|$|E

40|$|Worldview {{has been}} {{identified}} as an important construct across disciplines and within the Counseling Psychology field, particularly in the ethical guidelines mandated by governing associations and in the pursuit of developing multicultural counseling competence (MCC). The limited <b>MCC</b> skills <b>training</b> literature has prompted the development of a training protocol to increase counselor capacity to assess client worldview and to decrease the risk for stereotyping clients according to identified culture group in a rigid and superficial manner. The present study tests the Intentional Worldview Questioning protocol as a training tool for increasing MCC, with a pretest posttest with wait list control group design (n = 25). Analyses of results indicate lack of effect of IWQ training on counselor self-reports of MCC, including a measure of skill. Limitations of the study include small sample size, limitations of measurement, and possible effects of pretesting. Future directions are recommended. ...|$|R
50|$|A good cricketer, Naidu {{founded the}} Madras United Club (MUC) to {{accommodate}} Indian {{players in the}} then Madras Presidency. Until his time, cricket in the area was predominantly an Englishman's game, was dominated by them and was represented by their exclusive, European-members only preserve, the Madras Cricket Club (<b>MCC).</b> He <b>trained</b> those Indian players and when necessary he provided the necessary attire and equipment for promising individuals. He also arranged regular fixtures for them against the MCC, from which evolved the annual Presidency Match. This match was first played in 1908, shortly after his death but {{as a consequence of}} negotiations between him and the MCC's Henry King and P. W. Partridge. Subsequently, it was played annually from 1915 to 1952 and was commonly known as the Pongal Match because it was played during the harvest festival week. It was very popular before the introduction of Test cricket and became the Presidency’s biggest fixture until the Ranji Trophy competition was started in the 1930s.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this descriptive, {{correlational}} study was to evaluate dairy farmers? adoption characteristics and use of a Milk Collection Center (MCC) in the Western province of Rwanda. A snowball sampling method was used to identify participants (N = 53). Farmers answered a research instrument related to their use and perception of the MCC and potential price points for educational services including, artificial insemination training, mastitis treatments, vaccinations at the <b>MCC,</b> <b>training</b> in milking techniques, on-site veterinarian services, and milk quality testing. The study showed that Rwandan dairy farmers had agreeable attitudes toward the Gisenyi MCC and were influenced by distance to MCC, access to credit, and low cost of technologies. No significant relationships existed between farmers? adopter categories (early vs. late) and their overall attitude toward the MCC. However, relationships existed between individual adopter characteristics and overall attitude toward the MCC. Farmers {{were willing to pay}} for certain educational services, such as artificial insemination training and mastitis treatments. Vaccinations at the MCC and artificial insemination training were farmers? highest valued services. Positive relationships existed between price points and importance of educational services. The MCCs must appeal to their target client, the dairy farmer, and listen to their wants and needs to be successful and have an impact. By drawing attention to the positive attributes of the MCC, participation increases amongst the farmers wouldbenefit the MCC and the Rwandan dairy market, in addition to helping dairy farmers have a more stable market to sell their product and receive the assistance needed...|$|E
40|$|Future space {{missions}} will {{be significantly}} longer than current shuttle missions and new systems {{will be more}} complex than current systems. Increasing communication delays between crews and Earth-based support means that astronauts {{need to be prepared}} to handle the unexpected on their own. As crews become more autonomous, their potential span of control and required expertise must grow to match their autonomy. It is not possible to train for every eventuality ahead of time on the ground, or to maintain trained skills across long intervals of disuse. To adequately prepare NASA personnel for these challenges, new training approaches, methodologies, and tools are required. This research project aims at developing these training capabilities. By researching established training principles, examining future needs, and by using current practices in space flight training as test beds, both in Flight Controller and Crew Medical domains, this research project is mitigating program risks and generating templates and requirements to meet future training needs. Training efforts in Fiscal Year 08 (FY 08) strongly focused on crew medical training, but also began exploring how Space Flight Resource Management training for Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) Flight Controllers could be integrated with systems training for optimal Mission Control Center (<b>MCC)</b> operations. The <b>Training</b> Task addresses Program risks that lie at the intersection of the following three risks identified by the Project: (1) Risk associated with poor task design (2) Risk of error due to inadequate information (3) Risk associated with reduced safety and efficiency due to poor human factors desig...|$|R
40|$|The prompt {{identification}} of chemical molecules with potential effects on liver may help in drug discovery and in raising {{the levels of}} protection for human health. Besides in vitro approaches, computational methods in toxicology are drawing attention. We built a structure-activity relationship (SAR) model for evaluating hepatotoxicity. After compiling a data set of 950 compounds {{using data from the}} literature, we randomly split it into training (80 %) and test sets (20 %). We also compiled an external validation set (101 compounds) for evaluating the performance of the model. To extract structural alerts (SAs) related to hepatotoxicity and non-hepatotoxicity we used SARpy, a statistical application that automatically identifies and extracts chemical fragments related to a specific activity. We also applied the chemical grouping approach for manually identifying other SAs. We calculated accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and Matthews correlation coefficient (<b>MCC)</b> on the <b>training,</b> test and external validation sets. Considering the complexity of the endpoint, the model performed well. In the training, test and external validation sets the accuracy was respectively 81 %, 63 % and 68 %, specificity 89 %, 33 % and 33 %, sensitivity 93 %, 88 % and 80 % and MCC 0. 63, 0. 27 and 0. 13. Since it is preferable to overestimate hepatotoxicity rather than not to recognize unsafe compounds, the model’s architecture followed a conservative approach. As it was built using human data, it might be applied without any need for extrapolation from other species. This model will be freely available in the VEGA platform...|$|R

He continued to head MCC’s conciliation work, including <b>training</b> <b>MCC</b> workers {{prior to their}} international assignments. During {{this time he was}} consulting in a number of conflicts, in the Basque region of Spain, Colombia, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland among others. After an exhausting trip Lederach began talking to Mennonite opinion-leaders and conflict workers including Hizkias Assefa, Kraybill, and others about systematically educating people to do the kind of work he was doing.A pair of retired educators, James and Marian Payne (both EMU alumni), stepped forward when they learned of the hope of a center devoted to peace education at EMU. They guaranteed the funds necessary to support CJP for its first year of existence, plus made CJP the beneficiary of their estate. The Paynes made an initial donation of $25,000 (by 2007, their donations totaled more than $500,000.)CJP began in the fall of the 1994-95 academic year with two masters-level students: Jonathan Bartsch, an American who had studied and worked in the Middle East for almost three years and who spoke Arabic, and Jim Hershberger, an American who had spent eight years with Mennonite Central Committee in war-torn Nicaragua and was fluent in Spanish. They started their studies a year before accreditation of the program was granted. They were joined in the spring semester of 1995 by Moe Kyaw Tun, who had been involved with the resistance movement in Myanmar (Burma) before fleeing to Thailand. In establishing CJP, its founders said they sought to build on the lessons learned by MCC and other Mennonites in the peace arena. Five recurring characteristics of these lessons referenced by scholars are: ...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) We {{study the}} search for the best {{ensemble}} combinations from the wide variety of heterogeneous base classifiers. The number of possible ways to create the ensemble with a large number of base classifiers is exponential to the base classifiers pool size. To search for the best combinations from that wide search space is not suitable for exhaustive search because of it's exponential growth with the ensemble size. Hence, we employed a genetic algorithm to find the best ensemble combinations from a pool of heterogeneous base classifiers. The classification decisions of base classifiers are combined using the popular majority vote approach. We used random sub-sampling for balancing the class distributions in the class-imbalanced datasets. The empirical result on benchmarking and real-world datasets apparently outperformed the performances of base classifiers and other state-of-the-art ensemble methods. Afterwards, we evaluated the performance of an ensemble of classifiers combination search in a weighted voting approach using the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to find if employing weights could increase the generalisation performances of ensembles. The weights optimised by DE also outperformed both of the base classifiers and other ensembles for benchmarking and real-world biological datasets. Finally, we extend the majority voting-based ensemble of classifiers combination search with multi-objective settings. The search space is spread over the all possible ensemble combinations created with 29 heterogeneous base classifiers and the selection of feature subset from six feature selection methods as wrapper approach. The optimisation of two objectives, the maximisation of <b>training</b> <b>MCC</b> scores and maximisation of the diversity among base classifiers, with NSGA-II, a popular multi-objective genetic algorithm, is used for simultaneously finding the best feature set and the ensemble combinations. We analyse the Pareto front of solutions obtained by NSGA-II for their generalisation performances. Datasets taken from UCI machine learning repository and NIPS 2003 feature selection challenges have been used to investigate the performance of proposed method. The experimental outcomes suggest that the proposed multiobjective-based NSGA-II found the better feature set and the best ensemble combination that produces better generalisation performances in compared to other ensemble of classifiers methods...|$|R
40|$|Accidents and {{incidents}} {{show that}} high workload-induced stress and poor teamwork skills lead to performance decrements and errors. Research on teamwork shows that effective teams {{are able to}} adapt to stressful situations, and to reduce workload by using successful strategies for communication and decision making, and through dynamic redistribution of tasks among team members. Furthermore, superior teams are able to recognize {{signs and symptoms of}} workload-induced stress early, and to adapt their coordination and communication strategies to the high workload, or stress conditions. Mission Control Center (MCC) teams often face demanding situations in which they must operate as an effective team to solve problems with crew and vehicle during onorbit operations. To be successful as a team, flight controllers (FCers) must learn effective teamwork strategies. Such strategies are the focus of Space Flight Resource Management (SFRM) training. SFRM training in MOD has been structured to include some classroom presentations of basic concepts and case studies, with the assumption that skill development happens in mission simulation. Integrated mission simulations do provide excellent opportunities for FCers to practice teamwork, but also require extensive technical knowledge of vehicle systems, mission operations, and crew actions. Such technical knowledge requires lengthy training. When SFRM training is relegated to integrated simulations, FCers can only practice SFRM after they have already mastered the technical knowledge necessary for these simulations. Given the centrality of teamwork to the success of <b>MCC,</b> holding SFRM <b>training</b> till late in the flow is inefficient. But to be able to train SFRM earlier in the flow, the training cannot rely on extensive mission-specific technical knowledge. Hence, the need for a generic SFRM training framework that would allow FCers to develop basic teamwork skills which are mission relevant, but without the required mission knowledge. Work on SFRM training has been conducted in collaboration with the Expedition Vehicle Division at the Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) and with United Space Alliance (USA) which provides training to Flight Controllers. The space flight resource management training work is part of the Human Factors in Training Directed Research Project (DRP) of the Space Human Factors Engineering (SHFE) Project under the Space Human Factors and Habitability (SHFH) Element of the Human Research Program (HRP). Human factors researchers at the Ames Research Center have been investigating team work and distributed decision making processes to develop a generic SFRM training framework for flight controllers. The work proposed for FY 10 continues to build on this strong collaboration with MOD and the USA Training Group as well as previous research in relevant domains such as aviation. In FY 10, the work focuses on documenting and analyzing problem solving strategies and decision making processes used in MCC by experienced FCers...|$|R
