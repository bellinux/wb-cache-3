Also in order to solve the frost and de-frost problem in heat pump outdoor unit, we developed a new <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> condenser whichÂ changed the corrugate fin to the flat fin in 2012. To apply to a heat pump indoor unit, we developed the new type <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> evaporator in 2013, whichÂ constructed <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> tube perpendicularly and header horizontally with flat fin.

40|$|Metallic <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> {{have the}} {{advantage}} of high thermal conductivity to strength ratio. The recent advances in the manufacturing processes, has increased the feasibility of realizing metallic <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> with close dimensional control. Presently, various types of micro manufacturing processes are available for the realization of the metallic <b>micro</b> <b>channels.</b> However it is not practical to manufacture any dimensional feature with sharp corner. Depending on the choice of the manufacturing process, the corners get rounded to varying degree. When compared with the dimensions of <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> the magnitude of the corner radius is considerable. In this paper an attempt has been made to study numerically the effect of corner radius on the performance of the <b>micro</b> <b>channels.</b> Commercially available computational fluid dynamics software ANSYS CFX was used for the simulation of <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> performance. The thermal & fluid flow performance of the <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> was simulated by varying the corner radius from 50 microns to 200 microns.

The results {{of a series of}} limited push-out specimens were presented and discussed. The push-out tests comprise of <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors</b> in different types of concrete. Reinforcement was included in some specimens, as well. The results showed that using reinforcements in concrete slab, enhances the ductility and shear capacity of the composite system and using channels embedded in unconfined normal concrete, has a brittle performance. The channel shear capacity is less in the lightweight aggregate concrete, compared to the normal ones. Adequate ductility was reported for the <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors</b> in most of the concrete types. In addition, it was verified that the <b>channel</b> <b>connector</b> presents a very rigid behavior, during the primary phase of loading.

A three-dimensional finite-volume method is employed to simultaneously solve the governing equations for continuity, momentum and energy conservation, and the non-conformal mesh technique is applied. In the numerical computations, a constant heat flux {{is used as a}} boundary condition of the top wall of chip and the flow is assumed to be laminar and fully developed. Compared with the straight parallel and traditional fractal-link <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> networks, the detailed temperature and pressure distributions of the Y-fractal-link <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> networks are presented. Furthermore, the optimization of this new structure is discussed with some important parameters, such as the number of branching levels, the bifurcation angle and the number of branches at each level.

40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an experimental investigation involving the testing of push-out specimens with <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors.</b> The test program involved the testing of 78 push-out specimens and was aimed at the development of new equations for <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors</b> embedded in solid concrete slabs and slabs with wide ribbed metal deck oriented parallel to the beam. The test specimens were designed to study the effect of a number of parameters on the shear capacity of <b>channel</b> shear <b>connectors.</b> Six series of push-out specimens were tested in two phases. The primary difference between the two phases was the height of the <b>channel</b> <b>connector.</b> Other test parameters included the compressive strength of concrete, the length and the web thickness of the channel. Three different types of failure mechanisms were observed. In specimens with higher strength concrete, failure was caused by the fracture of the channel near the fillet with the channel web acting like a cantilever beam. Crushing-splitting of concrete was the observed mode of failure in specimens with solid slabs when lower strength concrete was used. In most of the specimens with metal deck slabs, a concrete shear plane type of failure was observed. In the specimens involving this type of failure, the <b>channel</b> <b>connector</b> remained intact and the concrete contained within the flute in front of channel web sheared off along the interface. The load carrying capacity of a <b>channel</b> <b>connector</b> increased almost linearly with the increase in channel length. On average, the increase was about 39 % when the channel length was increased from 50 mm to 100 mm. There was a further increase of 24 % when the channel length was increased from 100 mm to 150 mm. The influence of web thickness of <b>channel</b> <b>connector</b> was significant when the failure occurred due to channel web fracture but was minimal for a concrete crushing-splitting type of failure. The specimens with solid concrete slabs carried higher load compared to those with metal deck slabs. The increase in load capacity was 33 % for specimens with 150 mm long channels but only 12 % for those with 50 mm long <b>channel</b> <b>connectors.</b> This investigation resulted {{in the development of a}} new equation for predicting the shear strength of <b>channel</b> <b>connectors</b> embedded in solid concrete slabs. The proposed equation provides much better correlation to test results than those obtained using the current CSA equation. The results of specimens with metal deck slabs were used to develop a new equation for predicting the shear capacity of <b>channel</b> <b>connectors</b> embedded in slabs with metal deck oriented parallel to the beam. The values predicted by the proposed equation were in good agreement with the observed test values...|$|R

40|$|Most {{heterogeneously}} catalyzed gas-liquid {{reactions in}} <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> are chemically/kinetically limited {{because of the}} high gas-liquid and liquid-solid mass transfer rates that can be achieved. This motivates the design of systems with a larger surface area, which can be expected to offer higher reaction rates per unit volume of reactor. This increase in surface area can be realized by using structured <b>micro</b> <b>channels.</b> In this work, rectangular <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> containing round pillars of 3 µm in diameter and 50 µm in height are studied. The flow regimes, gas hold-up, and pressure drop are determined for pillar pitches of 7, 12, 17, and 27 µm. Flow maps are presented and compared with flow maps of rectangular and round <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> without pillars. The Armand correlation predicts the gas hold-up in the pillared <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> within 3 % error. Three models are derived which give the single-phase and the two-phase pressure drop {{as a function of the}} gas and liquid superficial velocities and the pillar pitches. For a pillar pitch of 27 µm, the Darcy-Brinkman equation predicts the single-phase pressure drop within 2 % error. For pillar pitches of 7, 12, and 17 µm, the Blake-Kozeny equation predicts the single-phase pressure drop within 20 %. The two-phase pressure drop model predicts the experimental data within 30 % error for channels containing pillars with a pitch of 17 µm, whereas the Lockhart-Martinelli correlation is proven to be non-applicable for the system used in this work.
