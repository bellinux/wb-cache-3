The effect of hydrogel amendment to the upper sand soil layer on water infiltration into the lower un-amended sand layer, irrigation frequency, water use efficiency and biomass production of Agrostis stolonifera was investigated. The upper 25 cm sand layer in three identical buckets was amended at 0. 4 %, 0. 2 % and a control (no hydrogel) while the lower 25 cm sand layer separated from the upper layer by a wire mesh in the same buckets was un-amended. Agrostis stolonifera seeds were sown in each bucket and adequately irrigated using a hand sprayer. Potential <b>meter</b> <b>electrodes</b> were inserted at three random positions in each of the buckets and subsequent irrigations were done when a pressure of 600 bars was recorded in any of the three treatments. Data were collected on irrigation frequency, water content in the lower layer, water use efficiency and biomass production of Agrostis stolonifera. The mean {{water potential}} in the lower 25 cm layer un-amended sand was significantly more negative in the 0. 4 % hydrogel than in the control. More water content (10 %) was recorded in the lower layer under the control bucket than in either the 0. 2 % and 0. 4 % hydrogel amended buckets. The frequency of irrigation was three-fold in the control compared to the 0. 4 % hydrogel amended sand. The hydrogel amended sand significantly increased the shoot and root biomass of Agrostis stolonifera by 2. 2 and 4 times respectively compared to the control. The 0. 4 % hydrogel amendment in sand increased the water use efficiency of grass eight fold with respect to the control. The hydrogel stimulated development of a dense root network and root aggregation that increased contact of the roots with moisture thus improving water use efficiency of hydrogel amended soil. The results suggest that hydrogels can improve sandy soil properties for plant growth by absorbing and keeping water longer in the soil matrix thus reducing watering frequency...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{three sections}} of work. The {{first section of}} this work is principally aimed at producing resistance and capacitance type meter species correction data for a commercially popular species of Tasmanian Eaucalypt, Eaucalyptus delegatensis. The resistance type meter correction data obtained deviate from those values given in the Australian Standard. Differences in resistance <b>meter</b> <b>electrode</b> placement {{are assumed to be}} the cause of the deviations. Regression trendlines obtained for the capacitance-type moisture meters were shown to have a lesser degree of accuracy than those for the resistance-type moisture meters due to the effects of density. The practice of measuring the average moisture content at a depth of 115 th of the thickness of a board using insulated probes in conjunction with resistance-type moisture meters was reinforced. The second part of this project involved work on a solar kiln situated at Kelly's Timber - Dunally. The purpose of the work was to try and improve the drying efficiency of the kiln and monitor it's progress throughout the drying process. Three drying trials were performed. A full schedule was provided for one of the trials where green sawn timber was fully dried to EMC. The success of the schedule was tainted by the poor quality of the timber before the drying process began. Air flow was improved throughout the kiln by the use of appropriate baffling and racking of the timber as recommended by the author. The temperature distribution and humidity control inside the kiln was found to be satisfactory. The final section of this research involved improving the drying efficiency of three Tasmanian industrial timber drying kilns.

40|$|International audienceSoil depth is an {{important}} property for estimating crop production potential and soil water availability. Direct estimates of soil depth from destructive boreholes and pits are too costly for being extended to large areas. Geophysical methods are often cited as possible alternative. However their ability to provide reliable estimations of soil depth {{are known to be}} highly dependent on local site characteristics. Therefore combining geophysical methods based on different physical parameters generally enhances the probability to obtain a better prediction. This study, partly supported by the FP 7 -Digisoil project, examine the ability of the Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) method combined with classical high resolution Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) one to predict soil depths in a 500 m ranged Mediterranean hillslope (Southern France) with increasing soil depths along the slope. SASW was performed from data measured in the field with classical seismic equipment (impulse source and geophones along a profile). In the same place, 8 transects of ERT (Wenner-Schlumberger array, 1 <b>meter</b> <b>electrode</b> spaced) were measured in wet conditions and in dry one. In order to calibrate geophysical measurements, observations of 130 boreholes (4 meters deep) were made to determine the soil depths, defined here as the occurrence depth of an heterogeneous marine Miocene uncemented sandstone with centimetrical laminations. Firstly ERT and SASW sections were analysed separately. This showed that each geophysical method was not sufficient to predict soil depth along the whole hillslope (lower part with calcaric Cambisol / upper part with calcisol). SASW predicted well soil depth in {{the lower part of the}} hillslope (with calcaric Cambisol) whereas data from ERT were disrupted by shallow permanent groundwater. Conversely, soil depth was well predicted with ERT in the upper part of the hillslope whereas a high variability of SASW data near the topsoil provided difficulties in soil depth prediction. Significant differences in bedrock hardness along the slope explained a part of this high variability. From these results, it was possible to define a new estimator of soil depth that is a weighted mean of the estimations given by each methods, the weights being defined as varying along the slope so that more importance is given to ERT estimates in the upper part of the hillslope and more importance is given to SASW in the lower part. This study shows the interest of such a fuzzy logic based sensor combination to estimate soil properties when the uncertainty of prediction are variable between locations and geophysical methods...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{continued}} evidence of environmental harm from elemental chlorine bleaching, the nation's paper industry continues {{to search for}} cost effective alternative bleaching. A practical and cost effective bleaching alternative is chlorine dioxide manufactured entirely from sodium chlorate. Sodium chlorate is produced by the electrolysis of brine in an undivided cell with steel plate cathodes and dimensionally stable anodes. Although the overpotential at the anode is only 50 mV, the cathodic overpotential is 940 mV. Thus, nearly one volt of electricity is wasted in driving hydrogen evolution at the cathode. Auburn University's Center for Microfibrous Materials Manufacturing has demonstrated that high performance, three dimensional, microfibrous electrodes can improve the performance of capacitors, batteries, hybrid power cells, and electrolysis electrodes {{in a variety of}} applications. The goal of this research was to apply this technology to a chlorate cell's cathode and reduce the overpotential between 200 and 400 mV. An economic analysis of the industry has shown that for every 100 mV reduction in overpotential, $ 100 per square <b>meter</b> of <b>electrode</b> can be saved annually. Due to their enhanced surface area over plates, corrosion of microfibrous electrodes is a major issue in this research. Samples based on chromium protection (i. e. stainless steel) have proved unfeasible for chlorate application. However, samples based on stainless steel and nickel show dramatic performance improvements over industry status quo in chlor-alkali application. Building microfibrous electrodes on a titanium base protected with a silver coating alleviates the corrosion problem and provides 100 mV or more of overpotential reduction. Further reduction is realized by impregnating silver-titanium microfibrous mesh with a PVDF binder and dispersed platinum on activated carbon. The resulting electrodes are mechanically sound, active towards hydrogen evolution, and hold promise for practical industry use...|$|R

40|$|In {{coal-fired}} power plants, the coal is pulverised and pneumatically conveyed to the burners. It {{is essential to}} measure and control pulverised fuel (PF) to improve combustion efficiency, reduce pollution and lower operating costs. Unlike single-phase flow, where flow density is {{generally considered to be}} uniform, air–solids two-phase flow in pneumatic conveying systems can undergo inhomogeneous concentration distributions across a given pipe cross-sectional area, especially around bends and bifurcators or trifurcators. The “roping” flow regime is an extreme example of inhomogeneous solids distribution, where highly concentrated solids form a column-like (rope-like) flow. For such complex flow regimes, solids concentration or solids mass flow meters will give different outputs when inhomogeneous flow occurs at locations where these meters are installed if they are sensitive to the flow patterns. This problem can be solved in two ways. The first and simplest approach is to restrict the meter's installation to locations where solids are relatively uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area of the pipe. Alternatively, it can be solved by using a meter having uniform spatial sensitivity, so that the measurement would not be affected by the flow regimes. Because the installation locations of PF meters must suit other requirements, such as accessibility for the convenience of maintenance, it is ideal if the meters have uniform spatial sensitivities. Electrostatic mass-flow meters are typically used to give a measure of the fuel mass flow rate. One design employs ring-shaped electrodes which have non-uniform sensitivity, resulting in variations in meter output for the same flow stream passing through the sensing volume at the different radii relative to the meter's central line. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the spatial sensitivity of the electrostatic <b>meter</b> with ring-shaped <b>electrodes</b> in the time and frequency domains. One goal of the study is to improve its performance and to achieve uniform sensitivity.

A description is given of practical rapid methods {{of determining the}} oxidizable sulfur and change of soil reaction of these soils. Recommended experimental procedures are as follows: A weighed quantity of soil (about 1 - 2 g) is mixed with 10 ml of 30 % H 2 O 2, adjusting the pH to 6. 0 - 6. 5 with N/ 10 NaOH and removing the sulfuric acid when contained with Ba (OH) 2, and heated for about 1 hour on water bath. After cooling, the contents are filled up to 100 ml and filtered. Soil pH value is determined in this soil suspension {{by means of the}} pH <b>meter</b> and glass <b>electrode.</b> Titrable acidity is determined by titrating 50 ml of this filtrate with N/ 10 NaOH and the result is given in terms of ml N/ 10 NaOH per 100 g soil. Active oxidizable sulfur is calculated from sulfuric acid equivalent to titrable acidity and given in terms of S mg per 100 g soil. Easily oxidizable sulfur is determined from the difference between the water soluble sulfate of the H 2 O 2 -treated soil and that of original soil and given in terms of S mg per 100 g soil. Sulfate is determined volumetrically by Benzidine sulfate method. The reliability of this method was examined with sea muds collected from sea bottom, saline pond soils, transported soils derived from sea muds and saline polder soils. The data obtained showed that saline pond soils and some of polder soils contained appreciable amounts of easily oxidizable sulfur and the pH values of these soils became extremely acid after oxidation with H 2 O 2 and easily oxidizable sulfur of fresh soils amounted to over 80 % of total sulfur determined from the difference between the sulfate content of the aqua regia extract and that of the water extract of the soils. (See Table 1 and 2) A considerable difference was frequently found between active oxidizable sulfur and easily oxidizable sulfur and it was shown that the relative amounts of oxidizable sulfur and easily soluble base compounds determine titrable acidity, active oxidizable sulfur and soil pH value of H 2 O 2 -treated soil.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the behaviour {{of electromagnetic}} flowmeters {{in which the}} flowrate of a suitably conducting liquid is measured {{by means of the}} e. m. f. induced between two electrodes by the motion in a magnetic field. The distortion of the field by the induced currents is assumed negligible, thus excluding the more highly conducting liquid metals, but the method is well-known to be suitable for certain liquid metals, water-based liquids and blood. Attention is concentrated entirely on the flowmetering device itself and not on any associated electronics. The idea of the contribution of each element of fluid moving with velocity v in a magnetic field B to the total electrode e. m. f. is first put on a sound mathematical basis by the introduction of a weight vector W = B∧∇G where ∇G is a vector entirely determined by the flowmeter and electrode geometry. The contribution is W. v per unit volume. The ultimate aim of the flowmeter designer is to make the <b>meter</b> sensitivity (the <b>electrode</b> e. m. f. divided by the flowrate) entirely independent of the flow pattern, i. e. of v. The behaviour of a flowmeter is specified entirely by W and the necessary condition on W to achieve this sensitivity independence (an ideal meter) is found to be curl W= 0. It is shown that there is no magnetic field that will achieve this if point electrodes are used. The condition on W weakens progressively as more assumptions are made about the flow pattern and weight functions suitable for different types of velocity profile are defined. The effects of different types of electrode are also discussed. This basic theory is then applied, first to a class of ideal uniform field flowmeters with transverse line <b>electrodes.</b> These <b>meters</b> can, moreover, be used as valves and flowmeters simultaneously. Their performance has been experimentally checked. Secondly the theory of long flowmeters (in which all quantities are assumed invariant in the flow direction) is exhaustively discussed. Thirdly the practically important case of circular meters with non-conducting walls, point electrodes and short magnetic fields is examined. In view of the difficulty of manufacturing a magnetic field that may be mathematically desirable, this problem is by-passed by first choosing a technologically simple method of producding magnetic fields for these meters using coils specified by certain parameters and then analysing the relevant weight-function in terms of these parameters. Design tables for the case of rectilinear axisymmetric flow are presented (one specimen), and experimental tests described which check the performance of designs produced from these tables. A different method of producing the magnetic field is suggested which saves power consumption and enables the field to be more accurately designed, but to which the tables mentioned above still apply. Finally some outstanding problems are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The Mahour {{exploration}} {{area is a}} polymetallic system containing copper, zinc and silver. The mineralization {{can be seen in}} {{two forms}} of veins and disseminations. This area is structurally within the Lut block, west of Deh-salm Village. Recent exploration work and studies carried out by geologists on this volcanic-plutonic area of Lut demonstate its importance indicating new reserves of copper, gold, and lead and zinc. Several articles have been published on the Mahour deposit in recent years, including work on fluid inclusions (Mirzaei et al., 2012 a; Mirzaei et al., 2012 b). The present report aims at completion of previous studies on Mahour. During the course of this research, the IP/RS geophysical methods were used to locate the extent and depth of sulfide veins in order to locate drill sites. The IP/RS method has been used extensively worldwide in locating sulfide mineralization at deposits such as Olympic Dam in Australia (Esdale et al., 1987), Hishikari epithermal gold deposit in Kagoshima, Japan (Okada, 1995) and Cadia-Ridgeway copper and gold deposit in New South Wales, Australia (Rutley et al., 2001). Materials and Methods 1. Determination of mineralogy of ore and alteration by examination of 70 thin sections and 45 polished sections. 2. Compilation of geological and mineralization maps of the studied area at a scale of 1 : 1000. 3. Geological, alteration, mineralization and trace element geochemical studies of 6 drill holes. 4. IP/RS measurements for 2585 points on a rectangular grid with profile intervals of 50 <b>meters</b> and <b>electrode</b> intervals of 20 meters. 5. Interpretation of IP/RS results. Discussion The Mahour area is covered by a volcanic sequence of basalt, andesite, dacite, rhyolite and pyro-clastics. During the Late Eocene through Early Oligocene this volcanic complex was intruded by several diorite and quartz-diorite bodies, which were responsible for mineralization of the area. Mineralized veins hosted by dacite show NNE trends with 85 t 0 90 ° dips, and which are accompanied by argillic, silicic, quartz-sericite-pyrite and propylitic alteration zones. The primary minerals include pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite, and quartz along with supergene minerals such as malachite, atacamite, azurite and goethite. High anomalies of copper (up to 103062 ppm), zinc (up to 213520 ppm) and silver (up to 1988 ppm) are present in the studied area. The IP/RS surveys were carried out on profiles perpendicular to the veins. The chargeability levels reached 40 msce, indicating the presence of sulfide minerals in the area. Two especially anomalous resistivity zones, high and low, were detected within the deposit. The high resistivity zone, up to 350 ohm. m, occurs along geophysical profiles in association with less-crushed zones, whereas the low anomaly zone is related to highly crushed zones. The geophysical anomalies agree with drilling results indicating zones of highest mineralization. Results Generally, the chargeability surveys have clearly revealed two anomalous zones: one in the northeast and the other in the southwest of the studied area. Six holes have been drilled through these anomalous zones and geochemical samples taken at intervals of 1 meter in each hole. Most of the anomalies are associated with quartz-sericite-pyrite, silicification and chloritic alteration as well as the intense distribution of secondary iron oxides. Geochemical results from the drill holes show the highest anomalies as follows: GBH- 1, 78 - 92 m, 246 - 281 m GBH- 3 20 - 40 m and 133 - 152 m GBH- 7 20 - 32 m and 57 - 65 m PB- 1 85 - 94 m. and 133 - 140 m PD- 1. 50 - 55 m, 298 - 301 m and 360 - 365 m PA- 1 48 - 57 m, 152 - 161 m and 212 - 218 m References Esdale, D.
