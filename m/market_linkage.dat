40|$|This paper {{examines}} equity <b>market</b> <b>linkages</b> in the Pacific Basin (PB) {{region and}} their relations to other mature markets and also assesses {{the response of}} these markets to major global events. Results from weekly data for market pairs and for {{the region as a}} whole consistently suggest that markets in the PB region are internally interdependent and exhibit significant external relations mainly with the US (rather than Japan). The presence of potent <b>market</b> <b>linkages</b> seems inconsistent with market efficiency provided that implied trading rules yield risk-adjusted excess returns. However, the results further indicate that PB <b>market</b> <b>linkages,</b> both internally within the region and externally with the US, have endured considerable weaknesses particularly since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. Such recent weakening of equity <b>market</b> <b>linkages</b> may have strengthened diversification benefits available to US investors from investing in the PB region. We also obtain evidence indicating that three main factors significantly explain the differing degrees of <b>market</b> <b>linkages</b> across countries in the PB region; namely, exchange-rate volatility, equity market volatility and money-market interlink.

40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} {{study on the}} effect of culture on stock <b>market</b> <b>linkages.</b> With data on 25 national stock markets, a quantile regression model is used to estimate the determinants of <b>market</b> <b>linkages</b> using culture variable/s such as language, religion and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions while controlling for distance, economic and legal variables. Further, we test whether these effects hold across regions and if changes are detected during periods of market crisis. We also test if market liquidity, an indicator of market efficiency, diminishes the impact of culture on <b>market</b> <b>linkages.</b> The main conclusion is that culture preferences shape investor choices, which affects integration between stock markets. The equity markets with similar cultural traits tend to increase market linkages; however, we observe differences across regions. Furthermore, liquidity and economic uncertainty fail {{to have an impact on}} the significance of culture variable/s as determinants of <b>market</b> <b>linkages.</b> Griffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} multinational trade accords {{on the degree of}} stock <b>market</b> <b>linkage</b> using NAFTA as a case study. Besides liberalizing trade among the U.

If successful, this could lessen the appeal of asset diversification across the North American region and promote a higher degree of market efficiency. We assess the possible impact of NAFTA on <b>market</b> <b>linkage</b> using cross-correlations, multivariate price cointegrating systems, speed of convergence, and generalized variance decompositions of unexpected stock returns. The evidence proves robust and consistently indicates intensified equity <b>market</b> <b>linkage</b> since the NAFTA accord. The results also suggest that interdependent goods markets in the region are a primary reason behind the stronger equity <b>market</b> <b>linkage</b> observed in the post-NAFTA period.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the stock <b>market</b> <b>linkages</b> between the United States and three Greater China Economic Area stock markets — China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, {{before and after}} the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Daily stock market indices from January 1995 to December 2000 are used for the analysis. Results from Granger causality test indicate increased feedback relationships between the markets in the post-crisis period. We also find, from the principal component analysis, fewer common factors affecting stock returns after the crisis, suggesting more harmonious market co-movements after the financial crisis. Additionally, results from a variance decomposition analysis suggest that stock markets are more responsive to foreign shocks after the crisis. This further strengthens the evidence that stock markets become more interrelated after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. <b>Market</b> <b>linkages,</b> international diversification, <b>market</b> integration, JEL Classification: G 10, JEL Classification: G 15...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test the <b>market</b> <b>linkage</b> and the {{strength}} of the linkage between the identity-preserved (IP) non-genetically modified organism (non-GMO) and non-IP conventional soybean futures markets at the Tokyo Grain Exchange (TGE) when effects from structural breaks are considered. Design/methodology/approach – The Johansen method is used for testing the <b>market</b> <b>linkage</b> and the law of one price (LOP) test is performed to find out the strength of the linkage. The Bai-Perron test is conducted on the price series to identify the structural breaks. After the breaks are statistically determined by the Bai-Perron test the Johansen tests are conducted for every break period. Findings – <b>Market</b> <b>linkage</b> exists between the non-GMO and conventional soybean futures markets but the LOP test suggests that the two markets are not fully linked and the relative price of the two soybeans is not constant. The breaks identified in the study affected the market linkage; the price relationship is lost during the break periods. Practical implications – The results of this study help explain the value of other new markets where the product traded is a close substitute for an existing market. Originality/value – This is the first study to apply the market integration theory to an IP market. The TGE non-GMO soybean contract is the first market price series with sufficient information to appropriately model a price integration linkage for an IP market. The result is valuable in the future when more markets for IP commodities are developed. Agriculture, Food crops, Futures markets, Genetic modification, Japan...|$|E

40|$|International bond <b>market</b> <b>linkages</b> are {{examined}} using monthly bond yield data and total return indices on government bonds with {{ten years to}} maturity. The bond yield data covers a nineteen-year period from January 1990 to July 2008, while the bond total return index data covers a nine-year period from August 2000 to July 2008. The international bond markets {{included in the study}} are Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The examination of international bond <b>market</b> <b>linkages</b> across these <b>markets</b> has important implications for the formulation of effective portfolio diversification strategies. The empirical analysis is carried out in three phases: the preliminary analysis, the principal component analysis (PCA), and the cointegration analysis. For each analysis and for each set of data the full sample period is first analysed and subsequently a five-year rolling window approach is implemented. Accordingly, this makes it possible to capture the time-varying nature of international bond <b>market</b> <b>linkages.</b> The preliminary analysis examines the bond market trends over the sample period, provides descriptive statistics, and reports the correlation coefficients between the selected bond markets. The PCA investigates the interrelationships among the bond markets according to their common sources of movement and identifies which markets tend to move together. The cointegration analysis is carried out using the Johansen cointegration procedure and investigates whether there is long-run comovement between South Africa and the selected bond markets. Where cointegration is found, Vector Error-Correction Models (VECMs) are estimated in order to examine the long-run equilibrium relationships in addition to their short-run adjustments over time. The empirical analysis results were robust, and overall integration between SA and the selected major bond markets remained weak and sporadic. In addition, the results showed that even after accounting for exchange rate differentials, international bond market diversification remained beneficial for a South African investor; and since international bond <b>market</b> <b>linkages</b> remained weak with no observable trend, international bond market diversification will remain beneficial {{for some time to come}} for a South African investor. ...|$|R
