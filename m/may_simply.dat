5|$|The {{meaning of}} the rhyme is not certain. It <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> relate to the many {{difficulties}} experienced in bridging the River Thames, {{but a number of}} alternative theories have been put forward.|$|E
5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E

5|$|In the Decembers of 1916 and 1917, German overtures to the British for truces were {{recorded}} without any success. In some French sectors, singing and {{an exchange of}} thrown gifts was occasionally recorded, though these <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> have reflected a seasonal extension of the live-and-let-live approach common in the trenches.|$|E
5|$|Others {{are less}} sure: the Olmec-style sculptures <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> imply a common {{iconography}} of {{power on the}} Pacific and Gulf coasts. In any case, Takalik Abaj was certainly a place of importance for Olmecs. The Olmec-style sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Middle Preclassic. Except for Monuments1 and 64, the majority were not found in their original locations.|$|E
5|$|The codex, {{although}} displaying Mixtec stylistic features, {{is judged}} to be Maya (if genuine) based upon the use of bark paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices {{and because of the}} presence of Maya day signs and numbering. The Mixtec interpretation of the iconography <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> be due to incomplete knowledge of highland Maya iconography during the Postclassic period.|$|E

5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E
5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation {{that there may have}} been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E

5|$|Ecgbert {{was the son}} of Eata, who was {{descended from}} the founder of the kingdom of Bernicia. His brother Eadberht was king of Northumbria from 737 to 758. Ecgbert went to Rome with another brother, and was ordained deacon while still there. Ecgbert has been claimed to have been a student of Bede, who much later visited with Ecgbert in 733 at York, but this {{statement}} <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> mean that Ecgbert was a student of Bede's writings, and not that he was formally taught by him.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} how England was settled with Anglo-Saxon people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making {{the country a}} land of villages. Estate boundaries from this period survive in features such as sunken lanes and banks. The Scandinavian conquest of much of England from the late 9th century added more villages, though many with Scandinavian placename elements such as -by ('village') <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> have been renamed Saxon settlements.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of {{symptoms such as}} anxiety <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, {{in the absence of}} the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes snakes have {{enlarged}} scales, either {{single or}} paired, under the tail; these are called subcaudals or urosteges. These subcaudals may be smooth or keeled as in Bitis arietans somalica. The {{end of the}} tail <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> taper into a tip (as {{in the case of}} most snakes), it may form a spine (as in Acanthophis), end in a bony spur (as in Lachesis), a rattle (as in Crotalus), or a rudder as seen in many sea snakes.|$|E
5|$|A louse's color {{varies from}} pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, {{it may become}} {{considerably}} darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond {{is very difficult to}} sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly {{established}} autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before {{the establishment of the}} Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.|$|E
5|$|He {{appears to}} have {{believed}} himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted {{to him that he}} was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic. This involves mimicry of a resource that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (in fact, {{it has been suggested that}} females of some species have evolved mimicry as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but <b>may</b> <b>simply</b> stay still and allow prey to come to it.|$|E
