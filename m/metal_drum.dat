25|$|Similarly, most hand drum {{percussion}} {{cannot be}} played easily or suitably with drum sticks without risking {{damage to the}} head and to the bearing edge, which is not protected by a <b>metal</b> <b>drum</b> rim, like a snare or tom. For use in a drum kit, they may be fitted with a <b>metal</b> <b>drum</b> head and played with care, or played by hand.|$|E

25|$|The {{percussion}} {{section of}} the band has been using Pearl percussion for several years. In 2014, {{a decision was made}} to experiment with <b>metal</b> <b>drum</b> carriers. Drum carriers had been used {{for a number of years}} by tenor drum players, however the bass drums and snares continued to use cloth sling harnesses. Through a large amount of experimentation, metal carriers made their debut midway through the 2014 season for halftime and parade use only. The snares and basses are still carried by traditional sling for pregame, due to the visuals done with the drums that add to the excitement of the Ramp entrance.|$|E
25|$|The zoetrope {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as its predecessor, the phenakistoscope, but is more convenient and allows the animation to be viewed by several people at the same time. Instead of being radially arrayed on a disc, the sequence of pictures depicting phases of motion is on a paper strip. For viewing, this is placed against the inner surface of {{the lower part of}} an open-topped <b>metal</b> <b>drum,</b> the upper part of which is provided with a vertical viewing slit across from each picture. The drum, on a spindle base, is spun. The faster the drum is spun, the smoother the animation appears.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for medium active wastes in the nuclear {{industry}} {{to be treated with}} ion exchange or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a ferric hydroxide floc to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a <b>metal</b> <b>drum</b> before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of fly ash, or blast furnace slag, and Portland cement, instead of normal concrete (made with Portland cement, gravel and sand).|$|E

500|$|The {{essence of}} metal {{drumming}} {{is creating a}} loud, constant beat for the band using the [...] "trifecta of speed, power, and precision". Metal drumming [...] "requires an exceptional amount of endurance", and drummers have to develop [...] "considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity... to play the intricate patterns" [...] used in metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it {{with the other hand}} (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The <b>metal</b> <b>drum</b> setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. Black metal, death metal and some [...] "mainstream metal" [...] bands [...] "all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats".|$|E
2500|$|The {{speed symbol}} {{is made up}} of a single letter or an A with one number. [...] It {{indicates}} the maximum speed at which the tire can carry a load corresponding to its Load Index.

There is a large Brunswick [...] "crowned-B" [...] (their 1950s logo) {{on the front of the}} deck shield of the Model A, [...] "A-2" [...] on the A-2 deck shield front, and [...] "JetBack" [...] on the JetBack deck shield front, unless these markings have been removed or covered by the bowling center proprietor.|$|E
