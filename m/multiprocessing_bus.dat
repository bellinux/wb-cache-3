40|$|This thesis {{documents}} the design details, development, and field testing of an advanced power system harmonic monitor. It begins by reviewing present harmonic standards and harmonic monitoring equipment. It {{then goes on}} to describe the design and field use of the first generation harmonic monitor. From the field use a number of problems with this monitor are identified leading to the second generation harmonic monitor known as CHART II. The acronym CHART means Continuous Harmonic Analysis in Real-Time. The design of the monitor including the data acquisition and computer processing equipment, as well as the display system, is such that it can acquire multiple channels of power system signals from remote locations. It can compute the harmonics of these signals continuously on a cycle-by-cycle basis, and store only the harmonics of interest. Harmonic computation is performed in real-time, with results displayed as they occur. Acquired data can be accurately time stamped for comparison with data from other monitoring sites, enabling simultaneous measurement at remote locations. The key areas of technology involved in implementing such an instrumentation system are: data acquisition from power system equipment, digital fibre optics, real-time digital signal processing, high speed <b>multiprocessing</b> <b>bus</b> systems, real-time multitasking operating systems, global positioning satellite systems, and computer networking. The application of digital signal processing to power system harmonic measurement is covered, and a field trial with the CHART II monitor is documented...|$|E

The PCI bus {{is connected to the}} server's <b>multiprocessing</b> system <b>bus</b> through the custom-designed bridge chip. The EISA bus supports eight general-purpose EISA/ISA connectors, providing connections to plug-in, industry-standard options. Data rate isolation, disconnected transaction, and data buffer management techniques were used to ensure bus efficienc...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a formal technique called test model-checking for debugging claimed conformance to formal memory models by realistic memory systems and multiprocessor machines. Test model-checking is an embedding of a formal testing method called Archtest in the modelchecking framework. In this paper, we describe our technique and illustrate it {{on the problem of}} checking sequential consistency of (a model of) the HP PA 8000 symmetric <b>multiprocessing</b> (SMP) <b>bus</b> called Runway. Our experiments show that test model-checking is an effective method for use in the typically iterative design cycle of complex memory systems to quickly detect ordering violations and pinpoint their cause. 1 Introduction The fundamentally important problem [AG 96] of verifying whether a given memory system conforms to a formal memory model appears in a number of contexts, including CPU design [Col 92, GK 94], I/O bus design [Cor 97], and even in multi-threaded language design [GJS 96]. As the semantics of memory orde [...] ...|$|R
