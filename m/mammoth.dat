5|$|Apart {{from its}} larger size and more {{primitive}} molars, the Columbian <b>mammoth</b> also {{differed from the}} woolly <b>mammoth</b> by its more downturned mandibular symphysis; the dental alveoli (tooth sockets) of the tusks were directed more laterally away from the midline. Its tail was intermediate in length between that of modern elephants and the woolly <b>mammoth.</b> Since no Columbian <b>mammoth</b> soft tissue has been found, much less is known about its appearance {{than that of the}} woolly <b>mammoth.</b> It lived in warmer habitats than the woolly <b>mammoth,</b> and probably lacked many of the adaptations seen in that species. Hair thought to be that of the Columbian <b>mammoth</b> has been discovered in Bechan Cave in Utah, where <b>mammoth</b> dung has also been found. Some of this hair is coarse, and identical to that known to belong to woolly mammoths; however, since this location is so far south it is unlikely to be woolly <b>mammoth</b> hair. The distribution and density of fur on the living animal is unknown, but it was probably less dense than that of the woolly <b>mammoth</b> due to the warmer habitat.|$|E

25|$|There is {{speculation}} as to {{what caused}} this variation within the three chronospecies. Variations in environment, climate change, and migration surely played roles in the evolutionary process of the <b>mammoths.</b> Take M. primigenius for example: Woolly <b>mammoths</b> lived in opened grassland biomes. The cool steppe-tundra of the Northern Hemisphere was the ideal place for <b>mammoths</b> to thrive because of the resources it supplied. With occasional warmings during the ice age, climate would change the landscape, and resources available to the <b>mammoths</b> altered accordingly.|$|R

5|$|The woolly <b>mammoth</b> (Mammuthus primigenius) is an {{extinct species}} of <b>mammoth</b> that lived during the Pleistocene epoch, {{and was one}} of the last in a line of <b>mammoth</b> species, {{beginning}} with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly <b>mammoth</b> diverged from the steppe <b>mammoth</b> about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. <b>Mammoth</b> remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The <b>mammoth</b> was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.|$|E

5|$|Modern humans coexisted with woolly mammoths {{during the}} Upper Palaeolithic {{period when the}} humans entered Europe from Africa between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Prior to this, Neanderthals had coexisted with mammoths during the Middle Palaeolithic, and already {{utilised}} <b>mammoth</b> bones for tool making and building materials. Woolly mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the <b>mammoth</b> in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. William Buckland published his discovery of the Red Lady of Paviland skeleton in 1823, which {{was found in a}} cave alongside woolly <b>mammoth</b> bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, Édouard Lartet found an engraving of a woolly <b>mammoth</b> on a piece of <b>mammoth</b> ivory in the Abri de la Madeleine cave in Dordogne, France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.|$|E
5|$|The Columbian <b>mammoth</b> shared its habitat {{with other}} now-extinct Pleistocene mammals (such as Glyptodon, Smilodon, ground sloths, Camelops and the American mastodon), horses and buffalos.

5|$|The {{first known}} {{members of the}} genus Mammuthus are the African species M. subplanifrons from the Pliocene, and M. africanavus from the Pleistocene. The former {{is thought to be}} the {{ancestor}} of later forms. Mammoths entered Europe around 3 million years ago. The earliest European <b>mammoth</b> has been named M. rumanus; it spread across Europe and China. Only its molars are known, which show that it had 8–10 enamel ridges. A population evolved 12–14 ridges, splitting off from and replacing the earlier type, becoming M. meridionalis about 2–1.7 million years ago. In turn, this species was replaced by the steppe <b>mammoth</b> (M. trogontherii) with 18–20 ridges, which evolved in eastern Asia around 1 million years ago. The Columbian <b>mammoth</b> evolved from a population of M. trogontherii that had crossed the Bering Strait and entered North America about 1.5 million years ago; it retained a similar number of molar ridges. Mammoths derived from M. trogontherii evolved molars with 26 ridges 400,000 years ago in Siberia and became the woolly <b>mammoth.</b> Woolly mammoths entered North America about 100,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Columbian <b>mammoth</b> {{is thought}} to have been about 80 years. The lifespan of a mammal is related to its size; Columbian mammoths are larger than modern elephants, which have a lifespan of about 60 years. The age of a <b>mammoth</b> can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section. However, ring-counting does not account for a mammoth's early years; early growth is represented in tusk tips, which are usually worn away. In the remainder of the tusk each major line represents a year, with weekly and daily lines found in between. Dark bands correspond to summer, making it possible to determine the season in which a <b>mammoth</b> died. Tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult, such as during illness or when a male <b>mammoth</b> was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten).|$|E
5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly <b>mammoth</b> carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly <b>mammoth</b> would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E

5|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly <b>mammoth</b> carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen <b>mammoth.</b> Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the <b>mammoth,</b> including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete <b>mammoth</b> recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18kg (40lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed {{were the ones that}} Shumachov had sold. Adams brought it to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of <b>mammoth</b> tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, a new {{interchange}} {{was built}} between NY134 and the Taconic State Parkway {{as part of}} the construction of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center.
