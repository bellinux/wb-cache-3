5|$|The {{first few}} (1–3 in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Ndhir) {{cardinal}} numerals have native Berber and borrowed Arabic forms. All higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic, {{consistent with the}} linguistic universals that the numbers 1–3 are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be retained, and that a borrowed number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed. The retention of one is also motivated {{by the fact that}} Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.|$|E

5|$|Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, {{one more}} than the {{extremely}} stable configuration of the noble gas neon. Because of this and its low first ionization energy of 495.8 kJ/mol, the sodium atom is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge. This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (4562 kJ/mol), because the 10th electron {{is closer to the}} nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na+ cation.|$|E
5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or in {{clusters}} {{on the underside}} of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in Tasmania showed that it is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be found in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.|$|E
5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> respond than others, and {{this might be}} because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{propagating}} intense optical pulses on plane weakly nonlinear dielectric surfaces is considered. It is {{pointed out that}} bright solitons can exist only if the group dispersion is negative. Since, {{in the absence of}} dampinq, group dispersion is positive for surface plasmon-polaritons it is concluded that collision-induced 'bend-back' is required for solitons to exist. Propagation under normal dispersion conditions is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> leading <b>to</b> flat-topped, frequency broadened and positively chirped pulses {{that could be used for}} pulse compression...|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} a number of aquatic {{activities}} to enjoy on Malta as well as Gozo and Comino. Northern Malta {{is home to the}} country's beach resorts and holiday areas, with the beaches most popular with holiday-makers being Mellieha Bay, Ghajn Tuffieha and Golden Bay. These beaches are large {{enough to be able to}} house cafes, restaurants and kiosks, but small enough to be crowded rarely. Malta's northwest is home to the island's quietest beaches, and it is on these that the main island's neighbouring two are nearest. Gozo and Comino are also popular beach spots for holiday-makers, although these are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be quieter, rockier and more suitable for snorkelling. The Mediterranean Sea surrounding Malta is popular for diving - while shallow dips may be attractive to beginning divers, more experienced divers may be able to dive deeper to find historical artifacts from World War II or earlier.|$|E
5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E
25|$|A Gallup poll {{released}} on March 11, 2011, showed that nationwide, Americans {{were more likely}} to give unions a negative word or phrase when describing them (38%) than a positive word or phrase (34%). 17% were neutral and 12% didn't know. Republicans were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> say a negative term (58%) than Democrats (19%).

25|$|The term crioulo was {{primarily}} {{used in the}} early 19th century, and meant Brazilian-born and black.

As compared to their African-born counterparts, manumission for long-term good behavior or obedience upon the owner’s death was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely.</b> Thus, unpaid manumission was a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> path <b>to</b> freedom for Brazilian-born slaves than for Africans, as well as manumission in general. Mulattoes also had a higher incidence of manumission, most likely because of the likelihood that they were the children of a slave and an owner.|$|R

25|$|Most research, such as {{studies done}} by UNICEF, {{suggests}} that boys are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than girls <b>to</b> be trafficked {{for the purposes}} of begging; experts presume this is because there is a greater female presence in trafficking {{for the purposes of}} sexual exploitation.

30|$|Logic {{suggests}} that university degrees {{are not as}} valuable in the labour market for those who without expansion of the university sector {{would not have been}} admitted to university.
