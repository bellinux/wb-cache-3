40|$|<b>Miloxacin,</b> a {{synthetic}} antibacterial agent structurally related to oxolinic acid, has {{a broad spectrum}} of activity in vitro against gram-negative bacteria and considerable activity in vivo against infections with these bacteria. These observations led to studies on the absorption and excretion of <b>miloxacin</b> in mice, rats, and dogs after administration of a single oral dose. Studies on oxolinic acid have been included for comparison. Peak serum levels of <b>miloxacin,</b> attained 1 h after administration of 20, 50, and 100 mg/kg to rats and dogs, were approximately 20, 40, and 60 micrograms/ml, respectively. Peak levels in mice receiving the same dose were 15, 60, and 80 micrograms/ml at 0. 5 h. Peak serum levels of oxolinic acid were attained 0. 5 to 1 h later than the above times at comparable doses and were one-half to one-fourth those of <b>miloxacin.</b> Urinary recovery of <b>miloxacin</b> at the above doses ranged from 3. 2 to 6. 5 % during the 24 -h posttreatment period. Recoveries of oxolinic acid were one-half to one-fifth those of <b>miloxacin.</b> At a 50 -mg/kg dose, rats excreted 4. 6 % of the <b>miloxacin</b> in bile in the 20 -h posttreatment period...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemotherapeutic}} {{properties of}} <b>miloxacin</b> (5, 8 -dihydro- 5 -methoxy- 8 -oxo- 2 H- 1, 3 -dioxolo-[4, 5 -g]quinoline- 7 -carboxylic acid) have been {{compared with those}} of oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. The in vitro activities of <b>miloxacin</b> (minimum inhibitory concentrations) against a variety of gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus, were comparable to those of oxolinic acid and 8 to 16 times greater than those of nalidixic acid. <b>Miloxacin</b> was more active than oxolinic acid against some anaerobes and less active against staphylococci. <b>Miloxacin</b> exhibited significant activities when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or Serratia marcescens. Its efficacy was comparable to that of oxolinic acid and two to four times greater than that of nalidixic acid. <b>Miloxacin</b> was less active against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and inactive at the maximum test doses against a Streptococcus pyogenes infection...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} and reliable high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay for <b>miloxacin</b> and its two principal metabolites, 5, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxo- 2 H- 1, 3 -dioxolo[4, 5 -g]quinoline- 7 -carboxylic acid (M- 1) and 1, 4 -dihydro- 1, 6 -dimethoxy- 7 -hydroxy- 4 -oxoquinoline- 3 -carboxylic acid (M- 2), in human serum and urine was developed. A strong anion-exchange Zipax SAX column using a mobile phase of 0. 01 M citric acid solution containing 0. 03 M sodium nitrate with pH 5. 0 {{was used to}} achieve separation of the three compounds. The retention times of <b>miloxacin,</b> M- 1, and M- 2 were 3. 8, 9. 3, and 5. 9 min, respectively. Serum and urine concentrations of these compounds as low as 10 ng/ml were measured. When results from the HPLC assay were compared with those from the microbiological assay of serum and urine samples from human subjects receiving <b>miloxacin</b> orally, the correlation coefficients were 0. 94 for the serum and 0. 99 for the urine. The HPLC assay method presents {{an alternative to the}} microbiological assay and permits future pharmacokinetic investigations of <b>miloxacin...</b>|$|E
