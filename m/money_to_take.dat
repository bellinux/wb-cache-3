5|$|Jason pays Number 18's pimp enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{her out of}} the brothel for a weekend. Before {{he arrives}} to take her away, however, Mama finds and confiscates the money Jason has {{previously}} paid Number 18, and correctly guesses that he does not intend to bring her back. When Jason arrives to collect Number 18, Mama tells him she is dead and offers a refund. Believing Number 18 is still alive, Jason becomes violent. Mama mocks him, saying the Western culture he is part of is hedonistic and responsible for people in the Third World being sexually trafficked. Jason stops short of hurting Mama and leaves to report to Marta. Through her connections, Marta discovers that Number 18 is alive. Marta tries to save Number 18, posing as a lawyer protecting Number 18's rights. The pimp forces Marta off with a gun. When Jason makes another attempt to rescue Number 18, the pimp kills her. Number 18 joins the chorus of dead child prostitutes who have been watching over and commenting on events throughout the play.|$|E

25|$|Two {{years later}} March had {{returned}} to Mobile and found employment in a local law office. By 1913, he had saved enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a high school course at Valparaiso University in Indiana, which allowed him to enroll at the University of Alabama to study law. He thrived as a student but lacked the necessary tuition to complete his law degree. In the fall of 1916, he moved to New York. There {{he lived in a}} small boarding house in Brooklyn, found work as a clerk in the Manhattan law firm of Nevins, Brett and Kellog, and attended plays.|$|E
25|$|Barrett {{was deeply}} {{involved}} {{in every aspect of}} the Industrial School's program. She personally managed the parole system by which girls who demonstrated sufficient responsibility were placed in carefully selected foster homes. These girls also were given jobs and were supported by follow-up services such as ministerial guidance, a newsletter called The Booster and personal letters. The school operated on an honor system and did not use corporal punishment. A special feature of Barrett's work was that each resident had their own bank account, so that upon discharge each resident had some <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> with them.|$|E
25|$|Determined to {{join the}} Latter Day Saints in Ohio, Lyman found {{temporary}} employment on the farm of Thomas Lackey, who had bought Harris's farm.

After working for two weeks, Lyman earned enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a ship from Buffalo, New York, to Cleveland, Ohio. From Cleveland, Lyman walked the 45 miles to Hiram, where he was told Smith and his family were living. When Lyman met John Johnson, the owner of the house where Smith was living, he discovered that Johnson was the father of the missionary who had baptized him just weeks before. Johnson invited Lyman to live at his house and work on his farm. Lyman did so from June 5 until August 1832. Lyman met Smith on July 1 when Smith returned to Hiram from Missouri.|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 18, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with advertising theaters known in Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and Pennsylvania. The only known trade publication review is by The Moving Picture World {{and it is a}} positive one. The reviewer states, [...] "A clear presentation of the visions of a child who {{wanted to go to the}} city. The vision is, perhaps, a bit more beatific than the actual city, but it unquestionably represents the imagined city of those who have never seen it. The awakening was rude, but happily the vision becomes real when the father appears with sufficient <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the dreamer to the city for which she has longed. The acting and mechanical work on this picture are both of excellent quality." [...] Another minor review of theater productions in the Arkansas City Daily Traveler said it was a good production.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to economist Kaplan, {{the author and}} polemecist Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone Magazine paints a less favorable portrait of Romney's business career (Taibbi also disparages Romney as “self-righteously anal, thin-lipped, [...] Whitest Kids U Know”). [...] According to Taibbi, {{toward the middle of}} his career at Bain Capital, Romney moved away from helping startups, and moved toward leveraged buyouts which involved borrowing <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over established companies in order to extract as much value as possible from those targeted companies. [...] Taibbi calls this “financial piracy”, while acknowledging that Romney’s leveraged buyouts were not hostile takeovers, and also conceding that some of Bain’s work was not [...] "evil" [...] (such as Bain's successful turnaround of Experian). [...] Taibbi blames the U.S. tax code for making leveraged buyouts possible by allowing companies like Bain to deduct interest on debt they use to acquire targets, and also by allowing individuals like Romney to pay much less than the ordinary tax rate on income. [...] However, the Wall Street Journal reports that Romney likely did not participate in the latter tax rate reductions.|$|E

He was {{considered}} a Turkish citizen because his parents were immigrants, but they had {{lived and worked in}} Germany for years. He was a legal German resident and married a Turkish woman in Germany. In October 2001 Kurnaz at age 19 traveled from Germany to Pakistan, hoping to study at the Mansura Center (which turned him down); he spent the next two months as a tablighi, a Muslim pilgrim sojourning from mosque to mosque. In December 2001, while Kurnaz was on a bus to the airport to return to Germany, Pakistani police at a checkpoint detained him. After questioning him for a few days, they [...] turned him over to American soldiers.
