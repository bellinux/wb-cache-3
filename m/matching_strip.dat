40|$|AbstractDue to {{very high}} {{piezoelectric}} properties of PMN-PT crystals they may significantly improve performance of air-coupled ultrasonic transducers. For these purpose vibrations of PMN-PT rectangular plates and strips were investigated. An air-coupled ultrasonic transducer and array consisting of 8 single piezoelectric strips were designed. Operation of the transducer was simulated by the {{finite element method}} using ANSYS Mechanical APDL Product Launcher software. Spatial distributions of displacements inside piezoelectric elements and <b>matching</b> <b>strip</b> were obtained. Experimental investigations were {{carried out by the}} laser Doppler vibrometer Polytec OFV- 5000 and the Bruel&Kjaer microphone 4138 with the measurement amplifier NEXUS WH 3219. It was found that performance of the ultrasonic transducer with PMN– 32 PT crystals was a few times better than of a PZT based ultrasonic transducer...|$|E
40|$|For {{improvement}} of the efficiency of air-coupled ultrasonic transducers PMN- 32 %PT piezoelectric crystals which possess very high piezoelectric properties may be used. The electromechanical coupling factor of such crystals for all main vibration modes such as the thickness extension and transverse extension modes is more than 0. 9. Operation of ultrasonic transducers with such piezoelectric elements in transmitting and receiving modes is rather different. Therefore, for transmission and reception of ultrasonic signals, separate piezoelectric elements with different dimensions must be used. The objective {{of this research was}} development of novel air-coupled ultrasonic receivers with PMN- 32 %PT strip-like piezoelectric elements vibrating in a transverse-extension mode with electromechanically controlled operation and suitable for applications in ultrasonic arrays. Performance of piezoelectric receivers made of the PMN- 32 %PT strip-like elements vibrating in this mode may be efficiently controlled by selecting geometry of the electrodes covering side surfaces of the piezoelectric element. It is equivalent to introduction of electromechanical damping which does not require any additional backing element. For this purpose; we have proposed the continuous electrodes to divide into two pairs of electrodes. The one pair is used to pick up the electric signal; another one is exploited for electromechanical damping. Two types of electrodes may be used—rectangular or non-rectangular—with a gap between them directed at some angle, usually 45 °. The frequency bandwidth is wider (up to 9 kHz) in the case of non-rectangular electrodes. The strip-like acoustic matching element bonded to the tip of the PMN- 32 %PT crystal may significantly enhance the performance of the ultrasonic receiver. It was proposed to use for this purpose AIREX T 10. 110 rigid polymer foam, the acoustic impedance of which is close to the optimal value necessary for matching with air. It was found that {{in order to get a}} wide bandwidth the length of the <b>matching</b> <b>strip</b> should be selected not a quarter wavelength λ/ 4 at the antiresonance frequency but at lower frequency. It allowed achieving the frequency bandwidth (14 – 18) % with respect to the central frequency at − 3 dB level...|$|E

40|$|SYMPOSIUM Objectives: The {{proper use}} of many types of self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) meters {{requires}} calibration to <b>match</b> <b>strip</b> code. Studies have demonstrated the occurrence and impact on insulin dose of coding errors with SMBG meters. This paper reflects additional analyses performed with data from Raine et al.

Methods: Five sets of glucose meters were used. Two sets of meters were autocoded and therefore could not be miscoded, and three sets required manual coding. Two of each set of manually coded meters were deliberately miscoded, and one from each set was properly coded. Subjects (n = 116) had finger stick blood glucose obtained at fasting, {{as well as at}} 1 and 2 hours after a fixed meal (Boost®; Novartis Medical Nutrition U. S., Basel, Switzerland).

40|$|An L-shaped {{dual-band}} multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) rectangular dielectric resonator antenna (RDRA) {{for long}} term evolution (LTE) applications is proposed. The presented antenna can transmit and receive information independently using fundamental TE 111 and higher order TE 121 modes of the DRA. TE 111 degenerate mode covers LTE band 2 (1. 85 – 1. 99 GHz), 3 (1. 71 – 1. 88 GHz), and 9 (1. 7499 – 1. 7849 GHz) at fr = 1. 8 GHz whereas TE 121 covers LTE band 7 (2. 5 – 2. 69 GHz) at fr = 2. 6 GHz, respectively. An efficient design method {{has been used to}} reduce mutual coupling between ports by changing the effective permittivity values of DRA by introducing a cylindrical air-gap at an optimal position in the dielectric resonator. This air-gap along with <b>matching</b> <b>strips</b> at the corners of the dielectric resonator keeps the isolation at a value more than 17 dB at both the bands. The diversity performance has also been evaluated by calculating the envelope correlation coefficient, diversity gain, and mean effective gain of the proposed design.

40|$|Background and purpose: The bladder urothelium is {{now known}} to have active properties. Our aim was to {{investigate}} the contractile properties of the urinary mucosa in response to the tachykinin neurokinin A (NKA) and carbachol. Experimental approach: Discrete concentration–response curves for carbachol and NKA were obtained in <b>matched</b> <b>strips</b> of porcine detrusor, mucosa and intact bladder, suspended in organ baths. The effects of inhibitors and tachykinin receptor antagonists were studied on NKA-mediated contractions in mucosal strips. Intact sections of bladder and experimental strips were processed for histology and immunohistochemistry. Key results: All types of strips contracted to both carbachol and NKA. Mucosal responses to NKA (pD 2 7. 2) were higher than those in intact strips and were inhibited by the NK 2 receptor antagonist SR 48968 (pKB 9. 85) but not the NK 1 receptor antagonist SR 140333, tetrodotoxin or indomethacin. Immunostaining for smooth muscle actin and vimentin occurred under the urothelium and on blood vessels. Desmin immunostaining and histological studies showed only sparse smooth muscle to be present in the mucosal strips. Removal of smooth muscle remnants from mucosal strips did not alter the responses to NKA. Conclusions and implications: This study has shown both functional and histological evidence for contractile properties of the mucosa, distinct from the detrusor. Mucosal contractions to NKA appear to be directly mediated via NK 2 receptors. The main cell type mediating mucosal contractions is suggested to be suburothelial myofibroblasts. Mucosal contractions may be important in vivo for matching the luminal surface area to bladder volume...|$|R
