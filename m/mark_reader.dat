6000|$|... [68] Christian, after {{feeling the}} burden of sin, {{entering}} by Christ the gate, taught by the Holy Spirit lessons of high concern in the Bible or House of the Interpreter; after losing his burden by faith in his crucified Saviour, his sins pardoned, clothed with his Lord's righteousness, marked by a godly profession, he becomes fit for church-fellowship; is invited by Bishop Gifford, the porter; and, {{with the consent of}} the inmates, he enters the house called Beautiful. <b>Mark,</b> <b>reader,</b> not as essential to salvation; it is {{by the side of the}} road, not across it; all that was essential had taken place before. Faithful did not enter. Here is no compulsion either to enter or pay: that would have converted it into the house of arrogance or persecution. It is upon the Hill Difficulty, requiring personal, willing efforts to scramble up; and holy zeal and courage to bear the taunts of the world and the growling frowns of the lions. Here he has new lessons to learn of Discretion, Piety, Prudence, and Charity, to bear with his fellow-members, and they with him; and here he is armed for his journey. Many are the blessed enjoyments of church-fellowship. [...] "Esther was had to the house of the women to be purified, and so came to the king. God also hath appointed that those who come into His royal presence should first go to the house of the women, the church." [...] (See Bunyan's Greatness of the Soul, vol. 1, p. 145). Every soul must be fitted for the royal presence, usually in church fellowship: but these lovely maidens sometimes wait on and instruct those who never enter the house Beautiful; who belong to the church universal, but not to any local body of Christians. John directs his Revelations to the seven churches in Asia; Paul, his epistles to the churches in Galatia, or to the church at Corinth-all distinct bodies of Christians; James to the 12 tribes; and Peter to the strangers, and [...] "to them that have obtained like precious faith," [...] of all churches-(ED).|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} for the automatic correction of open {{exercises in the}} area of technical science. The task is not solvable in general, and thus we restrict ourselves to exercises whose solutions are represented through data structures that can be automatically analyzed. Example of such data structures are: undirected and directed graphs; finite state automata; truth tables, programmable logic arrays (PLAs), and Boolean functions; and stacks, trees and lists. Restricting the task to such data-structures has the added advantage that the answers can be encoded through web-forms or through cheaper paper-forms to be read through optical <b>mark</b> <b>readers.</b> This allows the delivery of such exercises both as a self-assessment tool through the web and as formal exams...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of binding affinities {{has been a}} central goal of computational chemistry for decades, yet remains elusive. Despite good progress, the required accuracy {{for use in a}} drug-discovery context has not been consistently achieved for drug-like molecules. Here, we perform absolute free energy calculations based on a thermodynamic cycle for a set of diverse inhibitors binding to bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD 4) and demonstrate that a mean absolute error of 0. 6 kcal mol − 1 can be achieved. We also show a similar level of accuracy (1. 0 kcal mol − 1) can be achieved in pseudo prospective approach. Bromodomains are epigenetic <b>mark</b> <b>readers</b> that recognize acetylation motifs and regulate gene transcription, and are currently being investigated as therapeutic targets for cancer and inflammation.

40|$|The Department of Clinical Microbiology at St Thomas' Hospital {{has been}} {{producing}} bacteriological {{reports on a}} computer {{for more than three}} years and is now producing some 2300 reports per week. The system is operated entirely by laboratory staff without special training, and involves the use of optical <b>mark</b> <b>reader</b> (OMR) forms as worksheets, automatic validation and release of most reports, the use of local terminals, and scrutiny of reports by pathologists using a visual display unit. The OMR worksheet records not only the final result but also most of the tests and observations made on the samples; it is the only working document used by technicians. One specialist clinic submits its laboratory requests on an OMR form, which is subsequently used to record the results.

40|$|Effective verification, {{analysis}} {{and management of}} medical research data in remote sites create a unique challenge {{for members of the}} research community. The recent use of microcomputer hardware and software has eliminated many data management problems, {{but it is difficult to}} implement this technology at remote sites with small staffs who have little familiarity with computers. An automated data management system, which utilizes a portable microcomputer, a small optical <b>mark</b> <b>reader</b> and commercially available software, eliminates many data entry and verification problems by allowing direct data entry from full page forms into the microcomputer without keyboard entry. The elimination of manual data entry allows the local staff to be more productive and spend more time on quality control of the data. This system has been successfully used in clinical trials conducted in Argentina and the Peoples Republic of China and shows great promise as an effective data management tool at field-study and remote epidemiological research sites...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{evidence from}} {{a study of the}} government’s capital modernisation programme to support the installation of e-registration systems in secondary schools in England with the highest levels of unauthorised absence provided they did not already have an e-registration system other than one based on an optical <b>mark</b> <b>reader.</b> These are electronic systems that enable schools to take the register twice daily, as a minimum, to meet legal requirements. In practice, and especially over the course of this 3 -year project, additional facilities increased substantially, e. g. to include lesson monitoring and means to alert parents by text message. Hence, this was and continues to be a rapidly evolving field: in the near future it may be expected that greater use will be made of biometric data, for example. A total budget of £ 11. 25 million was made available to fund systems in 538 schools, starting from 2002. The evaluation took place over the period April 2002 to December 2005...|$|E

40|$|Background The aim {{of using}} distracters in multiple-choice {{questions}} (MCQs) is to distract those who don't know {{the correct answer}} of the question. The MCQs must be designed {{in a way that}} the students who have reached the pre-determined educational objectives, have a better chance in finding the correc 1 answer than those who have not. Therefore, a question has an appropriate efficacy when more /ow-grade students are attracted to the distracters than high-grade students. Purpose Considering the important role of distracters in differentiating between low and high-grade students, this research studies the distracters in the multiple-choice tests (MCTs) given in Mashad Medical School in the first semester of 1001 - 2002. Method In this descriptive study, the data of 21 MCTs performed in one semester were collected and recorded by Optical <b>Mark</b> <b>Reader</b> (OMR). From 128 - 1 questions, 6 - 12 MCQ ques 1 io 11 s were sampled randomly, and the numbers of low and high-grade students choosing the distracters were compared and analyzed using SPSS software.

40|$|The {{development}} of the teaching evaluation has been a longitudinal action research approach. Step-by-step measures and strategies were taken by the Medical Education Unit (MEU) {{to improve the quality}} of teaching and validate the evaluation documentation. These measures formed part of the accreditation of the medical curriculum. The main objectives of the teaching evaluation are to provide a forum for students to provide feedback on the quality of the teaching provided within the School of Medicine and enable tutors to receive feedback on their performance. Evaluation also provides a medium for tutors to identify areas of need regarding their Continuing Professional Development (CPD). In 2007, the MEU looked at all aspects of course evaluation and student experiences by using Pendleton&# 039;s feedback tool and a Likert-scale. In 2009, evaluation questionnaires were created in Optical <b>Mark</b> <b>Reader</b> (OMR) format through Form and Label Integrated Printing System (FLIPS) software. In 2011, standard operating procedures were created for disseminating the feedback to staff. To conclude, this presentation will focus on the {{development of}} the teaching evaluation and the measures taken by the MEU {{to improve the quality of}} the evaluation process that has made a positive impact on the School...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} acquiring on-job performance evaluation marks for enlisted personnel is deficient in two important respects: (1) the scales do not adequately differentiate among actual levels of ratee performance, and (2) the manual forms and procedures do not per-mit timely processing {{and application of}} the data for important indi-vidual personnel actions (e. g., advancement, assignment, and quality retention). In 1968 the Navy began its transition from a manual to an auto-mated system, starting with {{the development and implementation}} of an Optical <b>Mark</b> <b>Reader</b> (OMR) document for the top three enlisted Pay Grades, E- 7 / 8 / 9. This report describes the development of new marking scales for two other Pay Grade groups, 5 - 6 and 1 - 4. Although automated processing equipment was used, the primary thrust of the project was on substantive, rather than hardware, considerations. The purpose was to reduce inflation of marks and to achieve greater differentiation of levels of performance among ratees by designing new formats tailored to the specific pay grade groups. B. Approach Alternative marking scales and coding procedures for each pay grade group were experimentally administered to a fleet sample.
