50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{specialized}} beacon used in aviation {{in conjunction with}} an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine distance to the runway. Marker beacons transmit on the dedicated frequency of 75 MHz. This type of beacon is slowly being phased-out and most new ILS installations have no <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R

50|$|On some installations, <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> {{operating}} at a carrier frequency of 75 MHz are provided. When the transmission from a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is received it activates an indicator on the pilot's instrument panel and {{the tone of}} the beacon is audible to the pilot. The distance from the runway at which this indication should be received is published in the documentation for that approach, together with the height at which the aircraft should be if correctly established on the ILS. This provides a check on the correct function of the glide slope. In modern ILS installations, a DME is installed, co-located with the ILS, to augment or replace <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b> A DME continuously displays the aircraft's distance to the runway.|$|R

50|$|Flight 128 {{departed}} Los Angeles at 17:37 Eastern Standard Time {{and operated}} to Cincinnati without incident. The flight was initially scheduled {{to make an}} Instrument Landing System approach to Greater Cincinnati Airport's runway 18. The outer <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> for runway 18 was operational, but the middle <b>marker</b> <b>beacon,</b> glide slope, and runway approach lights were inoperative. Under these conditions, proper procedure would be to maintain the minimum approach altitude of 1,290 feet {{above mean sea level}} until the pilots made visual contact with the runway.|$|R
50|$|The AN/MRN-3 was a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> set {{used by the}} Army Air Force {{during and}} after World War II, it was {{standardized}} 23 October 1943, and replaced SCR-241.|$|R

50|$|The DME/N or DME/P is an {{integral}} part of the MLS and is installed at all MLS facilities unless a waiver is obtained. This occurs infrequently and only at outlying, low density airports where <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> or compass locators are already in place.|$|R
5000|$|The LOM is {{becoming}} less important now that GPS navigation {{is well established}} in the aviation community. [...] Some countries, such as Canada, have abandoned <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> completely, replacing the outer marker with a non-directional beacon (NDB); and, more recently, with GPS fixes.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>system</b> {{requires}} three <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> sets, one to {{be located}} in the airport runway boundary, one at approximately one mile from the approach end of the runway, and one 4.5 miles from the approach end of the runway, all on the center line of the runway to be used. The equipment transmits a vertical pattern to be received by the RC-43, RC-193, or AN/ARN-8, AN/ARN-12. A signal, amplitude modulated at 1,300 cycles per second, may be keyed at two dashes per second, six dots per second, or may be unkeyed. The <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> transmitter projects a vertical fan-shaped pattern to a height of approximately 3,000 feet. The transmitter is placed so that the longer horizontal axis is perpendicular to the line of approach.|$|R

50|$|The term {{fan marker}} {{refers to the}} older type of beacons used mostly for {{en-route}} navigation. Fan-type <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> were sometimes part of a non-precision approach and are identified by a flashing white light and a repeating dot-dash-dot signal. Recent editions of the FAA's AIM publication no longer mention fan markers.|$|R
25|$|Radio {{aeronautical}} navigation aids (Navaids) {{use other}} frequencies. Non-directional beacons (NDB)s operate on low frequency and medium frequency bands between 190–415kHz and 510–535kHz. The Instrument landing system (ILS) glide path operates in the UHF frequency range of 329.3–335.0MHz with <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> at 75 MHZ. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) also uses UHF from 962–1150MHz.|$|R
40|$|A {{low-cost}} collision {{hazard warning}} system suitable for implementation in both general and commercial aviation is presented. Laser <b>beacon</b> <b>systems</b> are used as sources of accurate relative position information that are not dependent on communication between aircraft or with the ground. The <b>beacon</b> <b>system</b> consists of a rotating low-power laser beacon, detector arrays with special optics for wide angle acceptance and filtering of solar background light, microprocessors for proximity and relative trajectory computation, and pilot displays of potential hazards.

5000|$|A {{back course}} marker (BC) {{normally}} indicates the ILS back course {{final approach fix}} where approach descent is commenced. Its is identified by pairs of morse-code [...] "dots" [...] at 3000 Hz (95 pairs per minute), which will trigger the white light on a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> indicator, but with a different audio rhythm from an inner marker or en route marker.|$|R
5000|$|NDBs {{are most}} {{commonly}} used as markers or [...] "locators" [...] for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach or standard approach. NDBs may designate the starting area for an ILS approach or a path to follow for a standard terminal arrival procedure, or STAR. In the United States, an NDB is often combined with the outer <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> in the ILS approach (called a locator outer marker, or LOM); in Canada, low-powered NDBs have replaced <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> entirely. Marker beacons on ILS approaches are now being phased out worldwide with DME ranges used instead to delineate the different segments of the approach. German Navy U-boats during World War II were equipped with a Telefunken Spez 2113S homing beacon. This transmitter could operate on 100 kHz to 1500 kHz with a power of 150 W. It was used to send the submarine's location to other submarines or aircraft, which were equipped with DF receivers and loop antennas.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft use DME to {{determine}} their distance from a land-based transponder by sending and receiving pulse pairs - two pulses of fixed duration and separation. The ground stations are typically collocated with VORs or ILS systems. A low-power DME can be collocated with an ILS glide slope antenna installation where it provides an accurate distance to touchdown function, similar to that otherwise provided by ILS <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, markers were used {{extensively}} along airways {{to provide an}} indication of an aircraft's specific position along the route, but from the 1960s they have become increasingly limited to ILS approach installations. They are now very gradually being phased out of service, especially in more developed parts of the world, as GPS and other technologies have made <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> increasingly obsolete.|$|R

50|$|In the 10th century, {{during the}} Arab-Byzantine wars, the Byzantine Empire used a <b>beacon</b> <b>system</b> to {{transmit}} {{messages from the}} border with the Abbasid Caliphate, across Anatolia to the imperial palace in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. It was devised by Leo the Mathematician for Emperor Theophilos, but either abolished or radically curtailed by Theophilos' son and successor, Michael III. Beacons were later used in Greece as well, while the surviving parts of the <b>beacon</b> <b>system</b> in Anatolia {{seem to have been}} reactivated in the 12th century by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{traveling}} {{in the vicinity of}} an accident scenario, for example, are simultaneously queried by the in-vehicle police intelligent <b>beacon</b> <b>system</b> computer which repeatedly updates and processes all dynamic passing vehicle data received, identifying and classifying all passing vehicles in real-time - for example, an aural visual command instruction is sent to all the in-vehicle emergency warning <b>beacon</b> <b>system</b> computers as a reminder that no rubbernecking, for example, or viewing of the accident is permitted and vehicles are instructed to safely maintain a given speed limit. Ease of managing, operating, and reducing traffic congestion of the transportation system is therefore achieved.|$|R
