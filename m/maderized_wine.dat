2500|$|Heat damaged {{wines are}} often casually {{referred}} to as cooked, which suggests how heat can affect a wine. They are also known as <b>maderized</b> <b>wine,</b> from Madeira wine, which is intentionally exposed to heat. [...] The ideal storage temperature for wine is generally accepted to be 13°C (55°F). Wines that are stored at temperatures greatly higher than this will experience an increased aging rate. Wines exposed to extreme temperatures will thermally expand, and may even push up between the cork and bottle and leak from the top. When opening a bottle of wine, if a trace of wine is visible {{along the length of}} the cork, the cork is partially pushed out of the bottle, or wine is visible on the top of the cork while it is still in the bottle, it has most likely been heat damaged. Heat damaged wines often become oxidized, and red wines may take on a brick color.|$|E
