5|$|In Pittsburgh, Leonard Betts (Paul McCrane), an EMT paramedic, is decapitated {{when his}} {{ambulance}} collides with a truck. Later, at the morgue, his headless body leaves its cold chamber, knocks out the attendant, steals his clothes, and escapes. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) visit the morgue, where they find Betts's {{head in a}} <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> dumpster. Scully attempts a cranial examination, but the head's eyes and mouth both suddenly open when she begins the procedure. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to Betts's apartment, where he finds the attendant's discarded clothes. When Mulder leaves, Betts—who has regrown his head—rises out of his iodine-filled bathtub.|$|E

The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust, causing problems with radiation protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, {{and one of the}} worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{residential}} development continued {{to expand in}} the watershed of Darby Creek. The automobile replaced railroads as the dominant form of transportation, and it allowed workers to live farther from their places of employment. As a result, the population of Springfield Township more than doubled between 1950 and 1960. The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve was established in 1955 after the Gulf Oil Corporation donated a diked impoundment on the creek to the City of Philadelphia. Local resident Jean Diehl started a grassroots campaign to preserve the marsh in 1969, and Two Studies of Tinicum Marsh was published the following year which demonstrated the ecological importance of the marsh. The Folcroft Landfill and the Clearview Landfill operated along the creek between the 1950s and the 1970s before closing in the mid 1970s. The former is {{on the west bank}} of the creek and the latter is on the east bank. They supposedly accepted municipal waste, demolition waste, and <b>medical</b> <b>waste.</b> A number of businesses operated at the site of the Clearview Landfill after its closing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne of the {{fundamental}} conditions of being healthy is a healthy environment. <b>Medical</b> <b>wastes,</b> {{from the moment they}} are produced to the moment they are finally removed in the waste cycle, are directly or indirectly interacted with the environment and humans.

25|$|When first {{carried out}} in 1987, the {{original}} US EPA inventory of dioxin sources revealed that incineration represented more than 80% of known dioxin sources. As a result, US EPA implemented new emissions requirements. These regulations succeeded in reducing dioxin stack emissions from incinerators. Incineration of municipal solid waste, <b>medical</b> <b>waste,</b> sewage sludge, and hazardous waste together now produce less than 3% of all dioxin emissions. Since 1987, however, backyard barrel burning has showed almost no decrease, {{and is now the}} largest source of dioxin emissions, producing about one third of the total output.|$|E

25|$|Disposal methods vary {{by country}} and locale, but common methods of {{disposal}} are either by truck service or, in the United States, by disposal of sharps through the mail. Truck service involves trained personnel collecting sharps waste, and often <b>medical</b> <b>waste,</b> {{at the point}} of generation and hauling it away by truck to a destruction facility. Similarly, the mail-back sharps disposal method allows generators to ship sharps waste to the disposal facility directly through the U.S. mail in specially designed and approved shipping containers. Mail-back sharps disposal allows waste generators to dispose of smaller amounts of sharps more economically than if they were to hire out a truck service.|$|E

Simple wastewater treatment systems can be set up by volunteers to protect drinking water from contamination. Garbage disposal could include pits for normal waste and incineration for <b>medical</b> <b>waste.</b> However, the most important subject in sanitation is the education of the local population, so that proper waste and water treatment can continue once MSF has left the area.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:This paper {{introduces}} {{a kind of}} removable pyrolytic furnace for the <b>medical</b> <b>wastes</b> based on the combined methods of thermal decomposition and combustion. Use the environmental protection design to minimize the pollution and the secondary pollution. Due to many infectious <b>medical</b> <b>wastes</b> cannot be transported, and must be solved locally, so infectious waste thermal decomposition furnace emerges as the time requires. Based on the thermal decomposition principle to decompose the organic, before combustion, the garbage should be carbonized first, so the original structures of polymer can be destructed, and be transformed into low molecular compounds. Heat it by heating resistance after gasification so it can continues to burn, this can decompose the dioxin and prevent the synthetic of dioxin at the largest degree. Its differential to other equipments is that it using the electric energy, the thermal decomposition furnace is internal of the incinerator in structure, which plays the effect of energy saving, so it is energy conservation and environmental protection. It is easy to install and convenient to use...|$|R
40|$|Incineration is {{a common}} method to treat <b>medical</b> <b>wastes.</b> Whereas {{pathogens}} and environmentally problematic organic compounds are destroyed, toxic heavy metals cannot be ruined. In this study heavy metal concentrations of two types of <b>medical</b> <b>wastes</b> were analyzed. Four different blister pack layers (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinyl chloride/polyvinylidiene chloride with pigment (PVC/PVdCp), polyvinyl chloride/polyvinylidiene chloride transparent (PVC/PVdCt) and polyethylene (PE)) and blister pack as a unit, and three types of medical gloves (latex powdered and powder-free medical gloves, nitrile powder-free medical gloves and vinyl powdered and powder-free medical gloves) were digested using high pressure digestion methods. Different acid mixtures were used to digest the samples. Heavy metal concentrations were analyzed by the inductively coupled plasma – optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). As, Fe, Na, P, Sn, Sr and Zn were detected in blister pack and different blister pack layers. Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, Sr and Zn were detected in three different types of medical gloves.
