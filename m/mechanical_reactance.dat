40|$|The {{mammalian}} cochlea {{depends on}} an amplification process for its sensitivity and frequency-resolving capability. Outer hair cells {{are responsible for}} providing this amplification. It is usually assumed that the membrane–potential-driven somatic shape changes of these cells are {{the basis of the}} amplifying process. It is of interest to see whether <b>mechanical</b> <b>reactance</b> changes of the cells might accompany their changes in cell shape. We now show that the cylindrical outer hair cells change their axial stiffness as their membrane potential is altered. Cell stiffness was determined by optoelectronically measuring the amplitude of motion of a flexible vibrating fiber as it was loaded by the isolated cell. Voltage commands to the cell were delivered in a tight–seal whole–cell configuration. Cell stiffness was decreased by depolarization and increased by hyperpolarization...|$|E
40|$|A thermoacoustic cooler {{prototype}} {{was investigated}} experimentally. Using modeling tools based on linear thermoacoustic theory, {{the system was}} designed to provide 140 W of cooling across a 22 “C temperature lift. Operation using a 55 % helium-argon mixture at a mean pressure of 20 bars and a frequency near 180 Hz was targeted. The prototype used a “moving magnet ” electro-mechanical actuator. Leaf springs were used to tune the mechanical driver system. The driver resonance frequency in-vacuo was about 154 Hz. The overall system resonance frequency, at which {{the sum of the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>reactance</b> and the acoustical reactance vanishes, was about 174 Hz. During initial tests, acoustic power inputs near 50 W were achieved, with an electro-acoustic transduction efficiency of 55 %. In comparison, the theoretical maximum efficiency was 65 %. A measured cooling capacity near 65 W was achieved for a temperature lift of 6. 5 “C. The acoustic pressure amplitudes were near 3 % of the mean pressure in the stack region, and the heat rejected to a secondary fluid was measured to exceed 120 W. While the acoustic power level nearly reached the target value for the desired cooling load, the cooling power was well below the expected value, and the target temperature lifts were not achieved. This was partly attributed to “nuisance ” loads that were deemed significant for “large” temperature lifts in the gas. Several measurements were performed to determine the cause of the discrepancies in pressures, temperatures, and cooling power between measured and predicted values. The possible influences of steady streaming flows, nuisance heat loads, gas mixture in-homogeneity and stack and heat exchanger performance were investigated...|$|E
