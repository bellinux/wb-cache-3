5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some <b>methodological</b> <b>concerns</b> with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E

2500|$|Debarati Guha-Sapir, {{director}} of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels, was quoted in an interview for Nature.com saying that Burnham's team have published [...] "inflated" [...] numbers that [...] "discredit" [...] the process of estimating death [...] counts. [...] "Why are they doing this?" [...] she asks. [...] "It's because of the elections.". However, another interviewer a week later paints a more measured picture of her criticisms: [...] "She has some <b>methodological</b> <b>concerns</b> about the paper, {{including the use of}} local people — who might have opposed the occupation — as interviewers. She also points out that the result does not fit with any she has recorded in 15 years of studying conflict zones. Even in Darfur, where armed groups have wiped out whole villages, she says that researchers have not recorded the 500 [...] violent deaths per day that the Johns Hopkins team estimates are occurring in Iraq. But overall Guha-Sapir says the paper contains the best data yet on the mortality rate in Iraq." [...] A subsequent article co-authored by Guha-Sapir and Olivier Degomme for CRED reviews the Lancet data in detail. It concludes that The Lancet overestimated deaths and that the war-related death toll was most likely to be around 125,000 for the period covered by the Lancet study, reaching its conclusions by correcting errors in the 2006 Lancet estimate and triangulating with data from IBC and ILCS.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} language and translation in social science research {{with a focus on}} methodological issues. So far, these have received relatively little attention in publications on social science methodologies as well as in lively language-related debates in human geography journals of recent years. The lack of <b>methodological</b> <b>concern</b> is surprising, as {{there seems to be an}} increasing interest in international and comparative research and practice. However, the literature suggests that in order to draw out the political implications of translation, which are otherwise glossed over, it needs to go beyond transferring text from source language to target language as a seamless reproduction of the original. Like this, it becomes an issue of <b>methodological</b> <b>concern.</b> I therefore suggest approaching translation as a productive open-ended process that pays close attention to specificities of contexts and concepts and makes cultural difference visible throughout the research process. This approach aims at decentring taken-for-granted assumptions about the clarity of meaning in the source as well as in the target language. In reviewing the existing literature on issues of language, power and translation this paper builds on my experiences of doing a PhD as a foreign student in England...|$|R
