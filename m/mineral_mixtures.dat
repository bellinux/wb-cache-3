40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted to investigate the potential influence of selected inorganic compounds on sintering and agglomeration of a model <b>mineral</b> <b>mixture.</b> The <b>minerals</b> and inorganic compounds were chosen based on the constituents found in coal. The study simulated ash formation processes in the temperature range of 500 °C to 1000 DC. The <b>mineral</b> <b>mixture</b> consisted of kaolinite, quartz, pyrite, siderite, calcite, Ti 02 and magnesite in a fIxed ratio. The mixture was doped with 4 % (by weight) of each trace or minor element species. Different analytical methods were employed to investigate the extent of sintering and agglomeration and to identify the possible interactions between the species. Compressive strength measurements, TG/DTA, SEMIEDS and XRD analysis were {{used to evaluate the}} interactions in oxidizing and inert atmospheres. The influence of the compounds on the reducing-atmosphere ash fusion temperatures of the <b>mineral</b> <b>mixture</b> was also investigated. The results indicated that NaCl, Na 2 C 03, Ge 02, Mn 20 3, NbS 2, srCo 3 and PbS increased sintering in the <b>mineral</b> <b>mixture</b> in the oxidizing atmosphere. Sintering was increased by enhancing sulfation of limestone, and/or by affecting the characteristics of the aluminosilicate phases. Na 2 C 03, Ge 02 and Mn 20 3 increased sintering of the <b>mineral</b> <b>mixture</b> in the inert atmosphere by affecting the characteristics of the alurninosilicate phases. MOS 2 and PbMo 04 decreased sintering of the <b>mineral</b> <b>mixture</b> in the oxidizing atmosphere, while CU 2 S, CuS, PbS and NaCI decreased sintering in the inert atmosphere. The results obtained in oxidizing and inert atmospheres indicated that the oxidation numbers of the cations and the anions associated with the different compounds affected the potential of the additives to influence sintering and agglomeration of the <b>mineral</b> <b>mixture.</b> The influence of the inorganic compounds on the <b>mineral</b> <b>mixture</b> at different ashing temperatures was investigated with the ash fusion temperature test. The results indicated that the ash fusion temperatures were decreased by the addition of GeS and PbC 03 at an ashing temperature of 500 °C, decreased by SrC 03 at an ashing temperature of 815 °C, and increased by cr 03 at an ashing temperature of 500 °C. The results confirm that the addition of trace element compounds can result in the formation of species with lower melting points, and that the ashing temperature has an influence on the ash fusion temperatures.

40|$|Abstract—The {{behavior}} of <b>mineral</b> <b>mixtures</b> can be {{significantly different from}} the {{behavior of}} the individual components of the mixture due to differences between the mechanical and chemical properties of the individual minerals, and their ensuing effects on interparticle interactions and fabric formation. This study examines mixtures of kaolinite and calcium carbonate at different mass fractions using sedimentation, viscosity, and liquid-limit tests. These macroscale tests represent a wide range of solid-volume fractions and strain levels, with emphasis on high water-content conditions to magnify the effects of electrical forces. The results demonstrate that interparticle interactions depend on mineral surface-fluid effects, particle geometry, relative particle size, and solids content. With small solids contents, the kaolinite/calcium carbonate mixture behavior is a function of electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged mineral particles that promote flocculation; however, with large solids contents, the specific surface area of the minerals is the controlling factor. These results are relevant to many natural soil environments and to the possible development of engineered <b>mineral</b> <b>mixtures</b> for industrial applications...|$|E

Chemical interactions responsible for the trends in the compressive strength results were investigated with simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), as well as X-ray diffraction. The {{results indicated that the}} formation of anhydrite (CaSO 4) was responsible for increased mechanical strength in the <b>mineral</b> <b>mixture</b> pellets heated in air at temperatures higher that 400 °C. CaSO 4 formed from the reaction of the decomposition products of pyrite and calcite (SOx and CaO).

40|$|Mid-infrared {{reflectance}} spectra {{were measured}} (using an interferometer spectrometer with a 4 /cm resolution) {{of a number}} of <b>mineral</b> <b>mixtures</b> (including quartz-microcline, quartz-hornblende, microcline-albite, microcline-hornblende, albite-hornblende, and albite-augite mixtures containing different proportions of the components, each in the 75 - 250 micron size range), and the spectra were compared with those of single components. It is shown that the mid-infrared reflectance spectra of particulate mixtures of these minerals combine linearly by volume within a very small error, as long as particles are much larger than the wavelength...|$|E
