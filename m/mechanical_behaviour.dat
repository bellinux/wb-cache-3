Superficially, {{it seems to be}} a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E

25|$|Inverse {{dynamics}} is {{an inverse}} problem. It commonly refers to either inverse rigid body dynamics or inverse structural dynamics. Inverse rigid-body dynamics {{is a method}} for computing forces and/or moments of force (torques) based on the kinematics (motion) of a body and the body's inertial properties (mass and moment of inertia). Typically it uses link-segment models to represent the <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> of interconnected segments, such as the limbs of humans, animals or robots, where given the kinematics of the various parts, inverse dynamics derives the minimum forces and moments responsible for the individual movements. In practice, inverse dynamics computes these internal moments and forces from measurements of the motion of limbs and external forces such as ground reaction forces, under a special set of assumptions.|$|E

60|$|If {{the motion}} of the {{carriage}} is now changed into a non-uniform motion, as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes, then the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful jerk forwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> is {{different from that of the}} case previously considered, and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving carriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in uniform motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the general principle of relatvity. But in what follows we shall soon see that this conclusion cannot be maintained.|$|E

Samples of two material batches were selected: one just stays near the upper limit of tolerance and the other has mean properties.

Optical metallography after T 3 and T 10 thermal treatments and differential thermal analysis provide the grain size and precipitation characteristics of each material batch, which explain their different <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The industrial rod studied is usually forged in two operations: a first forging process, then a T 10 thermal treatment followed by a second forging step.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviours</b> of adhesively bonded joints are studied {{with the help}} of double lap shear (DLS) coupon tests {{conducted}} at different extension rates and temperatures. The joint specimens are made from dual-phase steel coupons bonded with epoxy resin. Tests are also carried out to ascertain the behaviours of these component materials. It has been found that at a high temperature, the adhesive joint exhibits a greater degree of strain rate sensitivity with a perceptible fall in the joint strength. However, at a low temperature, the joint strength remains comparable to that at room temperature. A new semi-analytical solution procedure is developed considering material nonlinearity to predict <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviours</b> of adhesively bonded DLS joints. The joint behaviours using the semi-analytical approach are predicted separately using the Von Mises (VM) and Raghava yield criteria. It has been found here that the application of the Raghava criterion yields good correlation with test load–extension behaviours for most temperatures and extension rates considered; on the other hand, the VM condition gives rise to perceptibly softer joint behaviour when compared to test data at a high temperature...|$|R

Basic <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviours</b> of cement-based materials and influences of saturation degree on such behaviours are first recalled.
