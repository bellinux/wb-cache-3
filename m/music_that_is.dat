5|$|In March 1997, a soundtrack album titled Songs in the Key of Springfield was {{released}} that included {{many of the}} musical numbers from the series' first years (1990–96). The album featured {{much of the work}} of The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen, who has co-written, arranged, produced, and conducted almost all <b>music</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> used on the show. This compilation of songs did not match the success of the previous Simpsons album, but peaked at number 103 in the United States and number 18 in the United Kingdom, where it was certified silver with more than 60,000 units sold. Following the popularity of The Simpsons Sing the Blues, The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks wanted to produce a follow-up album, also with original music not previously featured in the series. The cast members recorded this second studio album based on The Simpsons, named The Yellow Album and scheduled for release in 1993, but Groening was against it; as a result, it was not released until November 1998. It was poorly received by critics and did not chart.|$|E

5|$|The blues is a {{genre of}} African American folk <b>music</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{the basis for}} much of modern American popular music. Blues {{can be seen as}} part of a {{continuum}} of musical styles like country, jazz, ragtime, and gospel; though each genre evolved into distinct forms, their origins were often indistinct. Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest blues music was primarily call and response vocal music, without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure. Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers, turning them into passionate solo songs. When mixed with the Christian spiritual songs of African American churches and revival meetings, blues became the basis of gospel music. Modern gospel began in African American churches in the 1920s, in the form of worshipers proclaiming their faith in an improvised, often musical manner (testifying). Composers like Thomas A. Dorsey composed gospel works that used elements of blues and jazz in traditional hymns and spiritual songs.|$|E

However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances.|$|E

25|$|Unblack metal (or Christian black metal) is a {{genre of}} heavy metal <b>music</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> stylistically {{close to the}} sound of black metal, but whose artists are either {{directly}} against the Satanism prevalent in black metal, or promote Christianity in their lyrics and imagery.

It is also suggested that Christianity contradicts black metal's dark nature and the individualistic and misanthropic ideals of many bands.|$|E
