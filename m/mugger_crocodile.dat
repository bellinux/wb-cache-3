5|$|American {{alligators}} {{have been}} documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means {{they are among the}} first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodile,</b> is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E

5|$|Kerala's fauna are {{notable for}} their {{diversity}} and {{high rates of}} endemism: it includes 118 species of mammals (1 endemic), 500 species of birds, 189 species of freshwater fish, 173 species of reptiles (10 of them endemic), and 151 species of amphibians (36 endemic). These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, salinisation, and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number {{among the more than}} 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus rattan palm, and aromatic vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides. Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests. Reptiles include the king cobra, viper, python, and <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodile.</b> Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great hornbill, Kerala laughingthrush, darter and southern hill myna. In the lakes, wetlands, and waterways, fish such as kadu; stinging catfish and choottachi; orange chromide—Etroplus maculatus are found.|$|E
25|$|Some {{reptiles}} are predators too, {{including two}} species of crocodiles, the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) and <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus palustris), {{as well as the}} gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and the water monitor lizards (Varanus salvator), all of which hunt on both land and water. Sharks and the Gangetic dolphins (Platanista gangetica) roam the waterways.|$|E
25|$|The larger {{species of}} {{crocodiles}} are very dangerous to humans, {{mainly because of}} their ability to strike before the person can react. The saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile are the most dangerous, killing hundreds of people each year in parts of Southeast Asia and Africa. The <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodile</b> and American crocodile are also dangerous to humans.|$|E

40|$|During {{thirty years}} of {{observation}} from 1984 sighting of <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (Crocodylus palustris) have increased more than 12 -times from 33 and their spatial distribution have expanded to the entire river in National Chambal Gharial Sanctuary (NCS). In this period sighting of gharial has increased less than two-fold from 605. Reducing water level in upper reaches of Chambal and certain or several other critical changes in the habitat prior to 2008 - 09 may have triggered and intensified ecological and behavioural changes. As a result, from 2011 onwards sighting of <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in the stretch of river downstream of Rajghat have surpassed sightings in {{upper reaches of the}} river. The programme on conservation of gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) in river Chambal, now over 35 years, warrants review and fresh planning because of intensified human dimensions and threat from the fast-growing population of <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodiles...</b>|$|R

25|$|The reptile fauna {{recorded}} {{from the}} park is 47 and six of them are endemic. Sri Lankan krait, Boulenger's keelback, Sri Lankan flying snake, painted-lip lizard, Wiegmann's agama, and Bahir's fan-throated lizard are the endemic species. The coastal line of the park is visited by the all five globally endangered sea turtles (leatherback turtle, olive ridley, loggerhead sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, and green turtle) that visit Sri Lanka. The two breeding crocodile species of Sri Lanka, <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodile</b> and saltwater crocodile, inhabit the park. The Indian cobra and Russell's viper are among the other reptiles.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the smaller}} mammals, {{porcupine}} and hare are common, but the pangolin is rare.

25|$|The {{saltwater}} crocodile {{is one of}} the three crocodilians found in India, the other two being the more regionally widespread, smaller <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodile</b> and the narrow-snouted, fish-eating gharial. Apart from the eastern coast of India, the {{saltwater crocodile}} is extremely rare on the Indian subcontinent. A large population is present within the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary of Odisha and they are known to be present in smaller numbers throughout the Indian and Bangladeshi portions of the Sundarbans. The saltwater crocodile also persists in bordering Bangladesh as does the mugger and gharial. Populations are also present within the mangrove forests and other coastal areas of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India. Saltwater crocodiles were once present throughout most of the island of Sri Lanka, but remain mostly within protected areas such as Yala National Park, which also has a large population of mugger crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sections}} of the Ganges River are home to the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and <b>mugger</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus palustris), and the delta {{is home to the}} saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). Among the numerous aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles in the Ganges basin are the northern river terrapin (Batagur baska; only in the lowermost section of the basin), three-striped roofed turtle (B. dhongoka), red-crowned roofed turtle (B. kachuga), black pond turtle (Geoclemys hamiltonii), Brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurjii), Indian black turtle (Melanochelys trijuga), Indian eyed turtle (Morenia petersi), brown roofed turtle (Pangshura smithii), Indian roofed turtle (Pangshura tecta), Indian tent turtle (Pangshura tentoria), Indian flapshell turtle (Lissemys punctata), Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle (Chitra indica), Indian softshell turtle (Nilssonia gangetica), Indian peacock softshell turtle (N. hurum) and Cantor's giant softshell turtle (Pelochelys cantorii; only in the lowermost section of Ganges basin).
