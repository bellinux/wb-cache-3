40|$|Abstract Background Although {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} clinicians consider life expectancy before screening older women for breast cancer, many older women with limited life expectancies are screened. We aimed to identify factors important to mammography screening decisions among women aged 80 and older compared to women aged 65 – 79. Methods Telephone surveys of 107 women aged 80 + and 93 women aged 65 – 79 {{randomly selected from}} one academic primary care practice {{who were able to}} communicate in English (60 % response rate). The survey addressed the following factors in regards to older women's mammography screening decisions: perceived importance of a history of breast disease, family history of breast cancer, doctor's recommendations, habit, reassurance, previous experience, <b>mailed</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>cards,</b> family/friend's recommendations or experience with breast cancer, age, health, and media. The survey also assessed older women's preferred role in decision making around mammography screening. Results Of the 200 women, 65. 5 % were non-Hispanic white and 82. 8 % were in good to excellent health. Most (81. 3 %) had undergone mammography in the past 2 years. Regardless of age, older women ranked doctor's recommendations as the most important factor influencing their decision to get screened. Habit and reassurance were the next two highly ranked factors influencing older women to get screened. Among women who did not get screened, women aged 80 and older ranked age and doctor's counseling as the most influential factors and women aged 65 – 79 ranked a previous negative experience with mammography as the most important factor. There {{were no significant differences in}} preferred role in decision-making around mammography screening by age, however, most women in both age groups preferred to make the final decision on their own (46. 6 % of women aged 80 + and 50. 5 % of women aged 65 – 79). Conclusion While a doctor's recommendation is the most important factor influencing elderly women's mammography screening decisions, habit and reassurance also strongly influence decision-making. Interventions aimed at improving clinician counseling about mammography, which include discussions around habit and reassurance, may result in better decision-making. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{screening}} {{rates are}} low in many areas and cost-effective interventions to promote CRC screening are needed. Recently in a randomized controlled trial, a <b>mailed</b> educational <b>reminder</b> increased CRC screening rates by 16. 2 % among U. S. Veterans. The aim of our study {{was to assess the}} costs and cost-effectiveness of a <b>mailed</b> educational <b>reminder</b> on fecal occult blood test (FOBT) adherence. Methods In a blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 769 patients were randomly assigned to the usual care group (FOBT alone, n = 382) or the intervention group (FOBT plus a <b>mailed</b> <b>reminder,</b> n = 387). Ten days after picking up the FOBT cards, a 1 -page reminder with information related to CRC screening was mailed to the intervention group. Primary outcome was number of returned FOBT cards after 6 months. The costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the intervention were assessed and calculated respectively. Sensitivity analyses were based on varying costs of labor and supplies. Results At 6 months after card distribution, 64. 6 % patients in the intervention group returned FOBT cards compared with 48. 4 % in the control group (P < 0. 001). The total cost of the intervention was $ 962 or $ 2. 49 per patient, and the ICER was $ 15 per additional person screened for CRC. Sensitivity analysis based on a 10 % cost variation was $ 13. 50 to $ 16. 50 per additional patient screened for CRC. Conclusions A simple <b>mailed</b> educational <b>reminder</b> increases FOBT <b>card</b> return rate at a cost many health care systems can afford. Compared to other patient-directed interventions (telephone, letters from physicians, <b>mailed</b> <b>reminders)</b> for CRC screening, our intervention was more effective and cost-effective...|$|R

Risk factors {{for not being}} up to date (UTD) include {{ethnicity}} and lower socioeconomic status. <b>Reminder</b> <b>cards</b> increase immunization rates in urban settings. Their effect in poor, Latino, and rural children is unknown. Background: Language-appropriate <b>reminder</b> <b>cards</b> were sent to active patients not UTD listing the vaccines missing; the card served as the physician order for the vaccine. Missed opportunities were ad-dressed through discussion with staff and posters in patient care rooms. UTD rates before and after intervention were measured. Results: Dual-purpose reminder/order cards increased the rate of UTD from 61. 3 % to 73. 4 %; chil-dren living near the clinic, patients who speak only Spanish, and Latinos overall showed preferential effectiveness. Children eligible {{to participate in the}} Vaccines for Children program had similar in-creases in UTD rates but had lower baseline and final UTD rates than did children not eligible for the Vaccines for Children program. The rate of missed opportunities did not change. The number of chil-dren to whom <b>reminder</b> <b>cards</b> needed to be sent for them to become fully immunized is 8 (number needed to treat).

Patients from two intervention sites were given the low-literacy, diabetes <b>reminder</b> <b>card.</b> Two-hundred-nineteen patients (87 %) showed the card to their provider, and 209 charts were reviewed. American Diabetes Association guidelines had been met 37 %, 71 %, and 41 % for foot exam, and urine and lipid tests, respectively, at the time the card was given to the patients. Of the patients who needed a foot exam, urine test, and lipid panel that day (based on ADA guidelines), 48 %, 67 %, and 35 % received them, respectively (card effect). In the third (nonintervention) site, charts of 218 patients were reviewed. Guidelines met were 95 %, 89 %, and 45 % for foot exam, urine and lipid tests, respectively. Interestingly, standardized progress notes containing the first two (but not the third) process measures were used at this site.

Methods: The present study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. The subjects consisted of 123 patients with hypertension at the clinical-educational center of Sayyed-Al Shohada, Urmia, who met the study criteria. Selected based on the convenience method, the samples were randomly divided into three groups: the SMS group, the reminder-cards group, and the control group. The subjects in the SMS group were sent 6 text messages a week for three months, and {{the subjects in the}} reminder-cards group were trained in how and in what order to use their cards.

40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} were to {{evaluate}} the missed appointments rate in a consultation of gastroenterology of a general hospital situated in the south part of the country, to evaluate financial consequences and to evaluate preventive strategies. During this study, the missed appointments rate was 19. 4 %. The risk to have a missed appointment is higher for patients that come {{for the first time in}} the hospital, coming for a visit, having an appointment in the afternoon, having less than 26 years and that have taken an appointment a long time ago. The loss of income in gastro-enterology was 77 Euro and 32 Euro outside gastro-enterology for a loss of income of 109. 20 Euro by patient. The estimated loss of income for 711 patients that have missed their appointment is 71, 984 Euro. Two preventive strategies of reminders were tested: the telephone <b>reminder</b> and the <b>mail</b> <b>reminder.</b> The non-attendance rate was lower for patients with a <b>mail</b> <b>reminder.</b> The percentage of deferred or cancelled appointments is higher for patients with a telephone reminder. The low cost of a <b>reminder</b> (telephone or <b>mail)</b> should stimulate the hospital direction to develop a system of reminders to limit the non-attendance rate, at least for patients with a higher risk of non-attendance.

40|$|Although tetanus is now rare, {{vaccination}} {{is currently}} recommended {{for the entire}} population. Most elderly North Americans have never received tetanus vaccination. We evaluated the expected cost-effectiveness of using <b>mailed</b> <b>reminders</b> from family physicians to increase primary tetanus vaccination coverage among elderly Canadians. We estimated that over 10 years the program would prevent five cases of tetanus and one death from tetanus, resulting in a gain of 13 life-years. There would be 16, 700 adverse reactions to tetanus toxoid, 17 % in people already immune to tetanus. The net cost of the program (in 1984 Canadian dollars) would be $ 1. 9 million per case of tetanus prevented, $ 7. 1 million per death prevented and $ 810, 000 per life-year gained. These high cost-effectiveness ratios are largely attributable to the very low risk of tetanus, even among nonimmune elderly people. Tetanus toxoid and physicians' services for vaccination would account for 86 % of the program costs. Because the <b>mailed</b> <b>reminders</b> {{would be responsible for}} only 13 % of the program costs, other possible programs to increase primary tetanus vaccination coverage could not be expected to have substantially lower cost-effectiveness ratios. We conclude that efforts to increase primary tetanus vaccination coverage among elderly Canadians would be a questionable use of health care resources...|$|R

We have evaluated if these summaries, together with in-patient pharmaceutical counselling backed up with a simple medicine <b>reminder</b> <b>card,</b> may help with the delivery of seamless pharmaceutical care. METHODS: Elderly patients prescribed more than four items discharged to their own home received the standard discharge policy including a recently introduced MIDS and medicine <b>reminder</b> <b>card.</b> Each patient's GP was sent a copy on discharge. Pre-discharge a pharmacist counselled study patients about their medicines and compliance. A research pharmacist visited patients in their home approximately 2 - 3 weeks and at 3 months post-discharge to determine their drug knowledge, compliance, home medicine stocks and any healthcare related events. RESULTS: Forty-three study and 40 control patients completed both visits. Their mean (s. d.) ages were 80. 2 (5, 7) and 81. 1 (5, 8) years and they were prescribed 7. 1 (1. 8) and 7. 1 (2. 3) items, respectively. At visit 1 knowledge (P < 0. 01) and compliance (P < 0. 001) was better in the study group. At visit 2 compliance had improved in the study group (P < 0. 001). Unplanned visits to the GP and readmission to hospital amongst the study group were 19 and 5, respectively, which were both significantly less (P < 0. 05) than 27 and 13 in the control group. At visit 2 for the study group the 24 unplanned GP visits and three re-admissions were significantly (P < 0. 05) less than the respective 32 and 15 in the control group.

DESIGN: Randomised trial, practices receiving feedback only in one group and practices receiving feedback plus <b>reminder</b> <b>cards</b> in the other group. SETTING: 18 general practices in Leicestershire. SUBJECTS: Random samples of patients who had been taking a benzodiazepine anxiolytic or hypnotic drug for four weeks or longer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Entries in medical records indicating compliance with five criteria of care: assessment of suitability for withdrawal; being told about dependency; withdrawal being recommended; withdrawal or continuing medication; and a consultation with the general practitioner in the past year. Data were collected before and after feedback or feedback plus reminders. RESULTS: Of a total population of 125, 846 registered with the 18 practices, 2409 (1. 9 %) had been taking a benzodiazepine for four weeks or longer. Of the 742 in the first samples, 543 (73. 2 %) were women, the mean (SD) age was 68. 7 (14. 9) years, {{and they had been}} taking a benzodiazepine for 10. 1 (6. 7) years. The number of patients whose care complied with the criteria rose after the interventions to implement change. The increase was greater in practices receiving feedback plus reminders for only two of the five criteria "told about dependency" increasing from 52 (11. 1 %) to 118 (25. 8 %) in the feedback only group, and from 27 (10. 5 %) to 184 (43. 0 %) in the feedback plus reminders group; odds ratio (OR) 1. 46 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 32 to 5. 21); and "consulted in the past year" increasing from 434 (93. 1 %) to 411 (95. 8 %) in the feedback only group and 255 (96. 6 %) to 400 (99. 8 %) in the feedback plus reminders group, OR (95 % CI) 13. 5 (2. 01 to 330. 3).

DESIGN: Cohort analysis and randomized clinical trial. SUBJECTS: A total of 256 consecutive adults attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic from October 1992 to July 1993 who were seronegative for hepatitis B virus and agreed to receive hepatitis B vaccination. SETTING: Hamilton, Ont. INTERVENTION: Subjects were followed up for 4 months. Those who did not return for the second dose of vaccine by 6 weeks after the first (2 weeks overdue) were randomly assigned to the enhanced intervention group (telephone and <b>mail</b> <b>reminders)</b> or the regular intervention group (<b>mail</b> <b>reminder</b> only). Subjects were considered noncompliant if they did not return for the second dose by 4 months after the first. RESULTS: The risk of not returning for the second dose of vaccine within 4 months after the first was strongly and linearly associated with level of education (p = 0. 004). The noncompliance rate among those with less than a grade 10 education was 50 %, grade 10 - 13 education 34 %, some college education 15 % and some university education 9 %. In the randomized controlled trial the enhanced intervention group had twice the compliance rate of the regular intervention group (48 % v. 25 %; p = 0. 008).

40|$|SummaryObjectiveAsthma is {{the most}} common chronic disease in children. Previous studies {{described}} significant variations in acute asthma management in children. This study was conducted to examine whether asthma management in the pediatric emergency department (ED) was improved through the use of an evidence-based acute asthma care guideline <b>reminder</b> <b>card.</b> MethodsThe Pediatric Acute Asthma Management Guideline (PAMG) was introduced to the ED of a pediatric tertiary care hospital in Ontario, Canada. Medical charts of 278 retrospective ED visits (January–December 2002) and 154 prospective visits (July 2003 –June 2004) were reviewed to assess changes in acute asthma management such as medication treatment, asthma education, and discharge planning. Logistic and linear regressions were used to determine the effect of PAMG on asthma management in the ED. The propensity score method was used to adjust for confounding. ResultsDuring the implementation of PAMG, patients who visited the ED were more likely to receive oral corticosteroids (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] =  2. 26, 95 % CI: 1. 63 – 3. 14, p <  0. 0001) and oxygen saturation reassessment before ED discharge (AOR =  2. 02, 95 % CI: 1. 45 – 2. 82, p <  0. 0001). They also received 0. 23 (95 % CI: 0. 03 – 0. 44, p =  0. 0283) more doses of bronchodilator in the first hour of ED stay.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{quality of}} {{epilepsy}} care {{has often been}} noted to be poor and fragmentary. Most people with epilepsy are solely {{under the care of}} their general practitioner (GP). Many patients report medication side-effects and poor seizure control. Most GPs accept responsibility for epilepsy care; however, many report problems with knowledge of epilepsy and nearly all support guidance on epilepsy management. AIM: To determine whether a GP-completed prompt and <b>reminder</b> <b>card</b> is effective in improving the quality of epilepsy care when used opportunistically. DESIGN OF STUDY: Primary care-based pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial. SETTING: People with active epilepsy (n = 1275) from 82 practices. METHOD: Practices were randomly categorised as 'control', 'doctor-held card' (card in patient records), or 'patient-held card' practices. RESULTS: Compared with control practices, recording of seizure frequency was significantly increased in doctor-held card practices (57. 4 % versus 42. 8 %, P = 0. 003) but not in patient-held card practices (44. 6 % versus 42. 8 %). No differences were found in the proportion of seizure-free patients (doctor-held card [56. 0 %] versus control [51. 5 %]; patient-held card [58. 1 %] versus control [51. 5 %]) or in the proportion on monotherapy. Patients in both intervention groups reported more medication-related side-effects and patients in doctor-held card practices were less satisfied with information provision about epilepsy. Participating GPs found the card useful. The doctor-held card was retrieved and completed more often than the patient-held card. CONCLUSIONS: A doctor-held prompt and <b>reminder</b> <b>card</b> is effective in improving the recording of key clinical information for people with epilepsy, is felt to be useful by GPs, and is completed more often than a patient-held card. However it does not improve outcomes and may result in less patient-centred care...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} prenotification, ink color, and return {{deadline}} on sincerity {{and rates of}} response to mailed questionnaires concerning desirable characteristics of teachers were investigated in Thailand. Questionnaires were mailed to 800 public secondary school teachers in Bangkok. Some teachers received prenotification of the survey by mail, while others did not. The 100 -item questionnaires were printed in blue, black, green, or red ink. For some questionnaires, a response rate was specified; others asked for return as soon as possible. The first mailing included a cover letter, the questionnaire, and a stamped self-addressed retury envelope. The first follow-up was a <b>reminder</b> <b>card.</b> The second follow-up included a cover letter, a second copy of the questionnaire, and a stamped self-addressed return envelope. The first follow-up was sent 4 weeks after ne initial mailing, and th...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Determine the {{feasibility}} and {{outcome of a}} pilot program to increase farm workers 2 ̆ 7 use of hearing protection when performing activities with high noise exposure. Design: The study was a quasi-experimental study. Sample: Eight intervention farmers and 17 comparison farmers participated in the study. Measures: Before and after the intervention, farmers complted a survey to identify their frequency of use of hearing protection and their beliefs about hearing loss and use of hearing protection. Intervention: The intervention consisted of noise assessments, educational sessions, <b>mailed</b> <b>reminders</b> with brochures, and placement of hearing protection on the farm. Results: The intervention was effective in increasing the use of hearing prtection 1 and 2 months after {{the implementation of the}} program. Conclusion: Hearing loss is a serious problem with farmers, and yet many farmers neglect to protect their hearing with the use of protection. The pilot study findings indicate that efforts to increase the use of hearing protection by farmers can be effective...|$|R
40|$|Health care {{information}} {{technology can be}} a means to improve quality and efficiency in the primary care setting. However, merely applying technology without addressing how it fits into provider workflow and existing systems is unlikely to achieve improvement goals. Improving quality of primary care, such as cancer screening rates, requires addressing barriers at system, provider, and patient levels. The authors report the development, implementation, and preliminary use of a new breast cancer screening outreach program in a large multicenter primary care network. This installation paired population-based surveillance with customized information delivery based on a validated model linking patients to providers and practices. In the first six months, 86 % of physicians and all case managers voluntarily participated in the program. Providers intervened in 83 % of the mammogram-overdue population by initiating <b>mailed</b> <b>reminders</b> or deferring contact. Overall, 63 % of patients were successfully contacted. Systematic population-based efforts are promising tools to improve preventative care...|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis is {{characterized}} by reduction of bone mass and compromised bone strength, resulting in an increased fracture risk. Since a reduction of bone mass {{has been shown to}} be predictive of future fracture risk, prevention strategies target screening those patients at risk for decreased bone mass by using bone mineral density (BMD) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Current national guidelines recommend that all women 65 years and older undergo BMD testing using central DXA every two years. Despite these recommendations, women age 65 years and older still do not participate in this screening. Greater rates of osteoporosis screening could be achieved by identifying an efficient, effective way for healthcare providers and patients to schedule DXA scans. The purpose of this EBP project was to determine if a <b>mailed</b> patient <b>reminder</b> would increases BMD screening rates in women at risk for osteoporosis, as compared to the previous practice of provider recommendation during a scheduled visit. The Stetler Model was used to guide the EBP project, and Kotter and Cohen’s eight steps for successful change provided support for the behavioral change. The population of focus consisted of female Medicare recipient’s age 65 years and older who were active patients within a Midwestern community care clinic in the fall of 2013. Overall, the <b>mailed</b> <b>reminder</b> for osteoporosis screening demonstrated effectiveness in improving BMD screening rates. At the end of the 12 -week project, the percentage of female Medicare recipients who were up to date in their BMD screening increased from 17. 07...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a study of Utah’s urban/community forestry programs. A detailed questionnaire was sent to persons identified as community forestry contacts in every incorporated town and city in the state (n= 237) in the summer of 2002. Responses were received from 138 or 58 % of these communities representing 62 % of Utah’s population. This rate was achieved through an initial <b>mailing,</b> a <b>reminder</b> postcard, a repeated complete <b>mailing,</b> and a <b>reminder</b> phone call. Respondents answered questions on forestry program support, budget, management authority and practices, strengths and weaknesses, and training and information needs. They also categorized their program activity level by categories developed from the federal Performance Management Accountability System (PMAS). Highlights of our results are presented here organized by categories used in the survey...|$|R
30|$|Data were {{collected}} using a mail survey of 2, 419 dairy farms from California, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The list of licensed milk producers {{was obtained from}} each State’s respective Department of Agriculture in April 2012. After adjusting for bad addresses and farm exits the number of operations surveyed by state were 468 from California (25 % of operations with a license to ship milk), 115 from Florida (100 % of licensed operations), 410 from Indiana (25 % of licensed operations), 450 from Michigan (25 % of licensed operations), and 984 from Wisconsin (10 % of licensed operations). Together these states accounted for 40.9 % of U.S. milk production in 2012 (U.S. Department of Agriculture and National Agricultural Statistics Service USDA-NASS 2013 b). The tailored survey method was employed with an initial survey in May 2012 followed by a <b>reminder</b> <b>card</b> two weeks later and a second survey {{two weeks after the}} reminder (Dillman et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Background: In 2007, the Danish Cancer Society and the Tryg Fonden {{launched}} a campaign to prevent skin cancer and melanoma. As {{a part of this}} intervention programme, the Danish Cancer Society prepared a ‘‘sun policy’’, which recommends how children in Danish kindergartens can be protected from the sun. Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the factors that influence a decision to implement the sun policy in Danish kindergartens. Methods:We conducted a comparative qualitative study. Data were collected at semi-structured interviews with the principals of five kindergartens with a sun policy and five without. Results: The key factor in making a decision is the priority given to the sun policy by the principal, which in turn depends on the principal’s perception of his or her resources. Further factors are the principal’s attitude toward parental responsibility andmedia focus on sun protection. Conclusions:Principalsmust be convinced of the importance of a written sun policy. A <b>mailed</b> <b>reminder</b> containing arguments about its importance to accompany the draft sun policy might reinforce the formulation and implementation of sun policies nationwide...|$|R
40|$|Tailored {{telephone}} counseling (TTC) {{is effective}} in increasing utilization of screening mammography, but has received limited testing {{on a large scale}} in a contemporary HMO setting in which most eligible women get regular screening. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing TTC to an active control (<b>mailed</b> <b>reminders)</b> among women aged 50 - 80 enrolled in two HMOs in New England (n= 12, 905). Over a 1 -year period counselors attempted to contact women in the intervention arm who had not had a mammogram within the last 15 months. The absolute increase in mammography use due to the intervention was 4. 9 % (OR 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 6) in one HMO and 3. 1 % (OR 1. 2, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 3) in the other. We estimated that one additional woman was screened for each 10. 9 women eligible for counseling. An intervention process analysis documented a high level of acceptance of TTC and identified subgroups that could be targeted for counseling to improve the efficiency of TTC...|$|R
