5|$|Maura's {{disappearance}} was {{the subject}} of the nonfiction thriller True Crime Addict: How I Lost <b>Myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mysterious Disappearance of Maura Murray by author and journalist James Renner, in which he proposed the theory that Murray disappeared willingly and started a new life elsewhere. Murray's father, Fred, and immediate family have disputed this theory. Fred Murray stated that he believes his daughter was abducted and is dead.|$|E
5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts <b>myself.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first version {{the film was}} 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E

500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife."

500|$|Soon after Percy Shelley's death, Mary Shelley {{determined}} {{to write his}} biography.

[...] However, her father-in-law, Sir Timothy Shelley, effectively banned her from doing so. Mary began her fostering of Percy's poetic reputation in 1824 {{with the publication of}} his Posthumous Poems. In 1839, while she was working on the Lives, she prepared a new edition of his poetry, which became, in the words of literary scholar Susan J. Wolfson, [...] "the canonizing event" [...] in the history of her husband's reputation. The following year, Mary Shelley edited a volume of her husband's essays, letters, translations, and fragments, and throughout the 1830s, she introduced his poetry to a wider audience by publishing assorted works in the annual The Keepsake.|$|E

500|$|... "City of Angels" [...] is a synthrock {{song with}} {{influences}} and elements from experimental music. It opens with an instrumental section and [...] "gently burbling" [...] synthesizers. It follows {{with the sounds}} of drum beats, including taiko drums, then transitions into a piano melody. After the first verse, the chorus follows, with Leto singing, [...] "Lost in the City of Angels / Down in the comfort of strangers / I found <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights". During the bridge, he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos, affirming [...] "I am home". After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from Billboard cited [...] "City of Angels" [...] as an example of variety and experimentation in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. She described the song as a [...] "pulsating, subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band's usual rock backdrop".|$|E
500|$|... “I didn't {{write my}} raps down {{for my first}} four albums — like at all, I did it from the head {{straight}} to the booth.

With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the British media {{reported}} that she was anorexic, labelling her [...] "Kylie Thinogue".

Interviewed by Company magazine that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained [...] "It's {{a bit of a}} girl's song, with me telling myself off and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's me looking <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.'" [...] She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that Impossible Princess lead single [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a [...] "different meaning". The song discusses telling herself off when she does not learn from her past mistakes. She commented that [...] "Some of the songs from Impossible Princess are close to the heart, but this song was a little voice on my shoulder." [...] The song was originally titled [...] "Clever Girl (Did It Again)".|$|E
2500|$|The {{collection}} {{ranges from}} short, experimental stories to longer novellas.

Styles differ between stories, ranging from his early narrative approach of The Naked and the Dead to his more mature, contentious form of Advertisements. The Short Fiction of Norman Mailer illustrates Mailer's early development as an influential voice in 20th-century American letters.|$|R
