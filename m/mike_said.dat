[...] He {{spoke out against}} Obama, saying things like, [...] "Obama would make the world suffer." [...] His anti-racist sister Kayla, who is two years younger than Paul, often argued with him about his racial beliefs. A few days before his arrest, a neighbor said he heard semiautomatic gunfire coming from an open field behind Schlesselman's house. After his arrest, Schlesselman's family expressed doubt that he seriously intended {{to carry out the}} plot; his father, <b>Mike,</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I think it's just a lot of talk. He would never do something like this." [...] Kayla said she spoke with her brother after the charges were made public, and that Paul [...] "said he's sorry about everything he's done." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the band}} played around with their touring {{schedule}} in September 2001, originally they were {{to take a break}} after Ozzfest and then kick off an eleven show headlining tour of Europe in September. This show in Stockholm was the first show of the tour. Stockholm and Frederiksberg were cancelled just before the tour began for an unknown reason. The first three shows were cancelled due to various reasons. The reason for cancelling the second show was given as [...] "Because of the [...] "restructuring" [...] of their U.S. tour has Linkin Park decided to cancel their concert in KB Hallen 9 September. Since there is no immediate prospect of a replacement concert, the tickets will be refunded where they were purchased until 15 October." [...] The third show was cancelled due to the September 11 attacks. Addressing to the fans <b>Mike</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|E

[...] "It is right you were, sir, when {{you told me that}} you were afraid that rascal would try and hinder us on our way. Sure it {{has been a}} bad business, altogether. Monsieur Philip is killed, and the baron, too, I suppose, and all the others, and Miss Anne has fallen into the hands of that villain again." ...|$|E

I don't care a brass farthing whether Philip or Charles reigns over the Spaniards. It is not a nice job they will be taking on, any way, and not worth a drop of Irish blood. Well, if your honour should have the bad fortune to be hit, I shall either carry you off, though there's not a breath in your body, or else go down with you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{matter was}} easy enough," [...] <b>Mike</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "It took me {{two or three}} days to get to {{understand}} the position of the place, with water all round it except on one side; and it was plain that, if I were to start running, it is little chance I should have if I did not hit upon the right road. Luckily, they were mounting some cannon the day after you were taken away. We were ordered to go out and lend a hand, so it was not long before I learnt enough to know which road I ought to take. I was always a good runner, your honour, and many a prize have I carried off, at fairs in the old country, before troubles began. So it seemed to me that, if I could have anything of a start, I {{ought to be able to}} get off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah well, sir!" [...] <b>Mike</b> <b>said,</b> philosophically, [...] "Luck is everything. And {{who would}} go soldiering, {{if it was not}} so? When going into battle, {{everyone}} knows that a lot of his comrades will be killed, but he trusts to his luck to get through safely. One man gets promoted and another doesn't, and he hopes that luck will come his way next time. I don't say that your honour's promotion has been luck, but you have had luck in being {{on the staff of the}} Duke of Berwick, and everyone knows that it is the staff officers who get the credit and promotion, while the men who do most of the fighting get passed over. There would be nothing to say against that if, as in your honour's case, a man was chosen for the staff because he had done something that showed that he was fit for it. But it isn't so here. If a man belongs to a good family, and has interest, he gets a good appointment; and it is mighty seldom that a man is taken from his regiment, and put on to the staff, because he has done something which showed he was a good soldier." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Mike</b> <b>said</b> yes, he {{supposed}} so. After which, having put down seven and sixpence, one week's rent in advance, he {{was presented with}} a grubby receipt and an enormous latchkey, and the seance was at an end. Mike wandered out of the house. A few steps {{took him to the}} railings that bounded the College grounds. It was late August, and the evenings had begun to close in. The cricket-field looked very cool and spacious in the dim light, with the school buildings looming vague and shadowy through the slight mist. The little gate by the railway bridge was not locked. He went in, and walked slowly across the turf towards the big clump of trees which marked the division between the cricket and football fields. It was all very pleasant and soothing after the pantomime dame and her stuffy bed-sitting room. He sat down on a bench beside the second eleven telegraph-board, and looked across the ground at the pavilion. For the first time that day he began to feel really home-sick. Up till now the excitement of a strange venture had borne him up; but the cricket-field and the pavilion reminded him so sharply of Wrykyn. They brought home to him with a cutting distinctness, the absolute finality of his break with the old order of things. Summers would come and go, matches would be played on this ground with all the glory of big scores and keen finishes; but he was done. 'He was a jolly good bat at school. Top of the Wrykyn averages two years. But didn't do anything after he left. Went into the city or something.' That was what they would say of him, if they didn't quite forget him.|$|E
