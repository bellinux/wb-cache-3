40|$|Various genetic <b>map</b> <b>functions</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} to infer the unobservable genetic distance between two loci from the observable recombination fraction between them. Some <b>map</b> <b>functions</b> were found to fit data better than others. When {{there are more than}} three markers, multilocus recombination probabilities cannot be uniquely determined by the defining property of <b>map</b> <b>functions,</b> and different methods {{have been proposed}} to permit the use of <b>map</b> <b>functions</b> to analyze multilocus data. If for a given <b>map</b> <b>function,</b> there is a probability model for recombination that can give rise to it, then joint recombination probabilities can be deduced from this model. This provides another way to use <b>map</b> <b>functions</b> in multilocus analysis.

50|$|Filtering is an {{important}} part of any signal processing application. Similar to typical single dimension signal processing applications, there are varying degrees of complexity within filter design for a given system. M-D systems utilize digital filters in many different applications. The actual implementation of these m-D filters can pose a design problem depending on whether the multidimensional polynomial is factorable. Typically, a prototype filter is designed in a single dimension and that filter is extrapolated to m-D using a <b>mapping</b> <b>function.</b> One of the original mapping functions from 1-D to 2-D was the McClellan Transform.

In order to calculate likelihoods, {{it is necessary}} to have predictive formulas for multiple recombination frequencies. In the present study the Markovian assumption of Morton and MacLean is generalized to give predictive formulas for multiple-region recombination using realistic <b>map</b> <b>functions.</b> The best-fitting <b>map</b> <b>functions</b> have been determined by fitting the nine-locus data of Morgan et al. and the seven-locus data of Weinstein on the Drosophila X chromosome. Two <b>map</b> <b>functions</b> fit the data better than other published functions: that of Rao et al. with a map parameter of P =. 33 and a new function suggested in the present paper. The close agreement of the estimate of the mapping parameter with a previous estimate inferred from human male meiosis suggests that the <b>map</b> <b>function</b> is robust. A further improvement in the fit to the data can be obtained by the addition of a second parameter to reduce the expected number of multiple recombinants.
