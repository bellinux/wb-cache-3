5|$|Surface-to-surface <b>missile</b> battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one <b>missile</b> launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD <b>missile</b> launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical <b>missile</b> first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E

5|$|The AH-64A then entered phase 2 of the AAH program {{under which}} three {{pre-production}} AH-64s would be built, additionally, the two YAH-64A flight prototypes {{and the ground}} test unit were upgraded to the same standard. Weapons and sensor systems were integrated and tested during this time, including the laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire <b>missile.</b> Development of the Hellfire <b>missile</b> had begun in 1974, originally known {{by the name of}} Helicopter Launched, Fire and Forget <b>Missile</b> ('Hellfire' being a shortened acronym), for the purpose of arming helicopter platforms with an effective anti-tank <b>missile.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bold Orion <b>missile,</b> {{also known}} as Weapons System 199B (WS-199B), was a {{prototype}} air-launched ballistic <b>missile</b> (ALBM) developed by Martin Aircraft during the 1950s. Developed in both one- and two-stage designs, the <b>missile</b> was moderately successful in testing, and helped {{pave the way for}} development of the GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. In addition, the Bold Orion was used in early anti-satellite weapons testing, performing the first interception of a satellite by a <b>missile.</b>|$|E
5|$|The High Virgo <b>missile</b> was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced inertial guidance system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise <b>missile.</b> Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control. The <b>missile</b> was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the <b>missile</b> from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E

5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a Harpoon <b>Missile,</b> {{a booster}} propelled the <b>missile</b> {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the <b>missile</b> to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the <b>missile</b> to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the <b>missile</b> to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|E

5|$|From June 2000 until 21 April 2004, Tula {{underwent}} overhaul at the Zvezdochka shipyard, Severodvinsk, {{the third}} boat after Verkhoturie (K-51) and Ekaterinburg (K-84). The overhaul extended her service life by ten years, and {{allowed her to}} carry R-29RMU Sineva missiles. She conducted sea trials in early 2006 and re-entered service shortly thereafter, despite plans {{to do so in}} 2005. Tula post-overhaul operational history is characterised by a number of <b>missile</b> launches, the first of which occurred on 17 December 2007, when she launched a Sineva <b>missile</b> aimed at the Kura Test Range in the Kamchatka Peninsula.

5|$|Having {{been given}} top {{priority}} by the Air Force, {{the first flight}} test of the Bold Orion <b>missile</b> was conducted on May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched the Bold Orion vehicle {{at the apex of}} a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the <b>missile</b> itself, allowed the <b>missile</b> to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted {{the government to}} initiate an advanced <b>missile</b> programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating 388 crores for the mission, named Integrated Guided <b>Missile</b> Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic <b>missile</b> and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface <b>missile,</b> although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air <b>missile</b> (SAM) as an anti-ballistic <b>missile</b> to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the <b>missile</b> could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead {{while it was still}} far enough away to give the <b>missile</b> time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the state of the art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.|$|E

50|$|The course {{taken by}} {{ballistic}} <b>missiles</b> has two significant desirable properties. First, ballistic <b>missiles</b> that fly above the atmosphere {{have a much}} longer range than would be possible for cruise <b>missiles</b> of the same size. Powered rocket flight through thousands of kilometers of air would require vastly greater amounts of fuel, making the launch vehicles larger and easier to detect and intercept. Powered <b>missiles</b> that can cover similar ranges, such as cruise <b>missiles,</b> do not use rocket motors {{for the majority of}} their flight, but instead use more economical jet engines. However, cruise <b>missiles</b> have not made ballistic <b>missiles</b> obsolete, due to the second major advantage: ballistic <b>missiles</b> can travel extremely quickly along their flight path. An ICBM can strike a target within a 10,000 km range in about 30 to 35 minutes. With terminal speeds of over 5,000 m/s, ballistic <b>missiles</b> are much harder to intercept than cruise <b>missiles,</b> due to the much shorter time available. Therefore, ballistic <b>missiles</b> {{are some of the most}} feared weapons available, despite the fact that cruise <b>missiles</b> are cheaper, more mobile, and more versatile.|$|R

In February 2014 it was revealed that the Montenegrin Ministry of Defense chose the Brodarski institut from Zagreb to create the project documentation for the modification of the <b>missile</b> boats. As planned, the boats would be stripped of their <b>missile</b> launchers and the aft Bofors gun to allow a rigid-hulled inflatable boat to be carried.|$|E

50|$|A major {{advantage}} of air-to-surface <b>missiles</b> for ground attack by aircraft is the standoff distance they provide: <b>missiles</b> can be launched {{from a distance}} without coming within range of the target's air defences. Most air-to-surface <b>missiles</b> are fire-and-forget from a standoff distance, allowing the attacker to withdraw without approaching further after launch. Some <b>missiles</b> (typically cruise <b>missiles</b> or anti-ship <b>missiles)</b> have long enough range to be launched over the horizon, finding the target autonomously.|$|R
