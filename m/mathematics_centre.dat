This paper reports on a research carried out to obtain information on the usefulness of Science and <b>Mathematics</b> <b>Centres</b> (SMCs) in Zimbabwe. Interviews and questionnaires administered to the regional directorate andA-kvel teachers addressed the following aspects: accessibility of SMCs, use of materials at the SMCs, SMC workshops attendance, support to access the SMCs, networking and development of curriculum materials. 73. 8 % {{of the respondents indicated}} that the SMCs were easily accessible. Those in rural areas found the centres not to be accessible in terms of distance. The A-level teachers mainly come to the SMCs when invited for workshops. Only 47. 1 % of the respondents are using the resources at the centre, and it is mainly the photocopier which is used. There is no deliberate move to enhance teacher networking in the regions. It is recommended that the SMCs be made more accessible, teachers be afforded a chance for computer literacy courses, and SMC management committees should have aggressive advocacy campaigns so that intended users are aware of what is offered at the centres and the resources that are available...|$|R

In 2006 the school scrapped its A-level computing course, this despite having received specialist funding to teach the subject. After a six-year gap A-level computing was reinstated as an 11-pupil pilot subject in 2011, After positive results achieved by the pilot group, the option to take computing at A-level and GCSE was reintroduced for 2013.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we develop {{a method for}} {{assessing}} the overall performance of groups of individuals participating {{in any kind of}} human activities. For this, we represent each of the group under assessment as a fuzzy subset of a set U of linguistic labels characterizing its members ’ performance and we apply a recently developed Trapezoidal Fuzzy Assessment Model (TRFAM) for converting the fuzzy data collected from the corresponding activity to a crisp number. The TRFAM is a variation of the popular in fuzzy <b>mathematics</b> <b>centre</b> of gravity (COG) defuzzification technique, which has been properly adapted and used as an assessment method in earlier papers. According to the TRFAM the higher is an individual’s performance the more its “contribution ” to the corresponding group’s overall performance (weighted performance). Two real life applications are also presented, related to the bridge players ’ performance and to the students ’ assessment respectively, illustrating our assessment method in practice...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} report, {{the effectiveness of}} NGO-sponsored mathematics INSET on the classroom practices of primary school educators is investigated. The study analyses the classroom practices of ten <b>Mathematics</b> <b>Centre</b> for Primary Teachers (MCPT) trained educators. This analysis takes place from the stated goals of the MCPT programme on the one hand, and from a theoretical analysis {{of the construction of}} knowledge on the other. This qualitative study, which made use of structured observation schedules and interviews of ten MCPT-trained educators, revealed interesting trends in their practice in relation to MCPT training. While educators reflected ranging strategies, direct teaching and repetitive practices were marginalised, raising important issues for curriculum reform in South Africa, When employing more open methods, limits to educators ' content knowledge and indiscretion in the use of resources were revealed. In a context of limited resources in South Africa, and the significance of NGO sector, in assisting with curriculum development and change, these insights have significance beyond MCPT...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to unravel the roles of Teachers Network (TN), the school {{clusters}} and zones in promoting mathematics learning among teachers in Singapore. Specifically, the author draws from the concept of Learning Communities to discuss teachers’ continuing learning in mathematics in these communities. The case study on TN in particular looks at how, at the national level, teachers are trained to create an environment for mathematics sharing and learning through the practice of the Learning Circles (LC) methodology in their schools. At the zonal level, the author describes the work of the <b>Mathematics</b> <b>Centre</b> of Excellence (COE) in their creation of scaffoldings for collaborative learning and sharing of mathematics for schools in the East Zone. Through their activities and programmes, both the TN and the COE spawn learning communities within schools. Issues challenging the roles of TN and of COE in teachers ’ continuing professional development and the implications of these issues for policy makers are also discussed.

40|$|Is Mozambique an African success story? It has 7 {{percent a}} year growth rate and {{substantial}} foreign investment. Fifteen {{years after the war}} of destabilisation, the peace has held. Mozambique is the donors' model pupil, carefully following their prescriptions and receiving {{more than a billion dollars}} a year in aid. The number of bicycles has doubled and this is often cited as the symbol of development. In this book Joseph Hanlon challenges some key assumptions of both the donors and the government and asks questions such as whether there has been too much stress on the Millennium Development Goals, and too little support for economic development; if it makes sense to target the poorest of the poor, or would it be better to target those who create the jobs which will employ the poor; whether there has been too much emphasis on foreign investment and too little on developing domestic capital; and if the private sector really will end poverty, or must there be a stronger role for the state in the economy?This book is about more than Mozambique. Mozambique is an apparent success story that is used to justify the present 'post-Washington consensus' development model. Here, the case of Mozambique is situated within the broader development debate. Joseph Hanlon is Senior Lecturer at the Open University and the author of "Beggar Your Neighbours"; "Mozambique: Who Calls the Shots?"; and "Peace without Profit" (all James Currey) which have all made influential interventions in the development debate; Teresa Smart is Director of the London <b>Mathematics</b> <b>Centre,</b> Institute of Education...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetic model}} of the Boltzmann {{equation}} proposed {{in the work of}} Kremer and Soares 2009 for a binary mixture undergoing chemical reactions of symmetric type which occur without activation energy is revisited here, with the aim of investigating in detail the transport properties of the reactive mixture and the influence of the reaction process on the transport coefficients. Accordingly, the non-equilibrium solution of the Boltzmann equation is determined through an expansion in Sonine polynomials up to the first order, using the Chapman-Enskog method, in a chemical regime for which the reaction process is close to its final equilibrium state. The non-equilibrium deviations are explicitly calculated for what concerns the thermal-diffusion ratio and coefficients of shear viscosity, diffusion and thermal conductivity. The theoretical and formal analysis developed in the present paper is complemented with some numerical simulations performed for different concentrations of reactants and products of the reaction as well as for both exothermic and endothermic chemical processes. The results reveal that chemical reactions without energy barrier can induce an appreciable influence on the transport properties of the mixture. Oppositely to the case of reactions with activation energy, the coefficients of shear viscosity and thermal conductivity become larger than those of an inert mixture when the reactions are exothermic. An application of the non-barrier model and its detailed transport picture is included in this paper, in order to investigate the dynamics of the local perturbations on the constituent number densities, and velocity and temperature of the whole mixture, induced by spontaneous internal fluctuations. It is shown that for the longitudinal disturbances there exist two hydrodynamic sound modes, one purely diffusive hydrodynamic mode and one kinetic mode.
