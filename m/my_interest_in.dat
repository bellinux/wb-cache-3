25|$|My {{motivation}} {{was not a}} religious search for spirituality; {{it was more a}} search for somewhere to belong and to be with people who shared <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> world affairs. In my youth I was impulsive. Unfortunately, many of my decisions of that time are a reflection of that trait.|$|E
25|$|My first {{experience}} shooting {{was with my}} older brother when I was 14. He also liked guns and took me shooting with friends and family. We would {{have a great time}} setting up and shooting targets with an assortment of firearms. Ever since that first shooting experience, I continued to pursue <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> firearms.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of the BDI reflects that in its structure, with items such as [...] "I have lost all of <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> other people" [...] to reflect the world, [...] "I feel discouraged about the future" [...] to reflect the future, and [...] "I blame myself for everything bad that happens" [...] to reflect the self. The view of depression as sustained by intrusive negative cognitions has had particular application in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which aims to challenge and neutralize them through techniques such as cognitive restructuring.|$|E

500|$|Connotations was {{the first}} orchestral work in which Copland used serial {{principles}} of composition. Serial or twelve-tone music, Copland stated, carried [...] "a built-in tenseness... a certain drama... a sense of strain or tension" [...] inherent in its extended use of chromaticism. [...] "These are new tensions," [...] he continued, [...] "different from what I would have dreamt up if I had been thinking tonally." [...] To composer John Adams, Copland's embrace of serial technique was not really such as stretch [...] "because ever since the 1920s, he'd already a piss-'n-vinegar penchant for sour intervals, like {{he did in the}} Piano Variations." [...] Contrary to the charge that would be made after Connotations premiere that Copland wrote a twelve-tone work to impress younger composers, he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so. While Copland's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and Piano Fantasy and he noted that some critics (whom he did not name) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his Piano Variations of 1930, he claimed in his 1967 [...] "conversation" [...] with Edward T. Cone that the Variations were [...] "the start of <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> serial writing... Although it doesn't use all twelve tones, it does use seven of them in what I hope is a consistently logical way." [...] Prior to that interview, few had related Copland's early work to that of the founder of twelve-tone composition, Arnold Schoenberg.|$|E
2500|$|I {{first got}} into that through an {{experience}} in a hospital during the war, where I made a documentary about patients suffering from battle neuroses. I was {{in the army and}} made the picture [...] "Let There Be Light". That experience started <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> psychotherapy, and to this day Freud looms as the single huge figure in that field.|$|E
2500|$|Frith uses {{a variety}} of {{implements}} to play guitar, from traditional guitar picks to violin bows, drum sticks, egg beaters, paint brushes, lengths of metal chain, and other found objects. Frith remarked: [...] "It's {{more to do with}} <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> found objects and the use of certain kinds of textures which {{have an effect on the}} string ... the difference between the touch of stone, the touch of glass, the touch of wood, the touch of paper – those kinds of basic elements that you're using against the surface of the strings which produce different sounds." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{have always}} {{regarded}} Paine {{as one of}} the greatest of all Americans. Never have we had a sounder intelligence in this republic ... It was my good fortune to encounter Thomas Paine's works in my boyhood ... it was, indeed, a revelation to me to read that great thinker's views on political and theological subjects. Paine educated me, then, about many matters of which I had never before thought. I remember, very vividly, the flash of enlightenment that shone from Paine's writings, and I recall thinking, at that time, 'What a pity these works are not today the schoolbooks for all children!' <b>My</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Paine was not satisfied by my first reading of his works. I went back to them time and again, just as I have done since my boyhood days.|$|E
2500|$|When Lori was {{six years}} old, her mother took her to an agent who {{specialized}} in child actors. She thought that acting might be a healthy outlet for Lori. When later asked what inspired her to be an actress, Martin said, [...] "The best {{time in my life}} was when I was about four. Doree and I had to go live with my aunt in Ponca City, Oklahoma. My mother got sick and Daddy had to go to work every day, so we couldn't stay here. I didn't want to come back. I cried and cried. That was when I decided, if I had to come back, I'd be an actress. I started getting parts immediately and my little brother was signed by the same agent, but he lacked <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> acting. I just loved it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{creating}} Theater Hopper, Brazelton {{created the}} website Des Moines Music Online (DMMO) {{to discuss the}} local music scene. [...] Brazelton created DMMO to practice web design and enhance his heavily print media-based skill set; the site lasted {{about a year and}} a half, closing when it became too involved and intense for him to continue running solo. [...] Looking for a new web project to further expand his repertoire of skills, Brazelton found Penny Arcade comics being run in Penny Arcade led him to PvP, and it was while reading these that Brazelton realized his interest in doing the same: [...] "Webcomics were the perfect way to blend <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> storytelling, illustration and web design." [...] Considering himself to be equally interested in music as he is film, Brazelton eschewed a music-interest based comic so as not to re-tread the paths beaten by web cartoonists Mitch Clem and Jeph Jacques.|$|E

40|$|The {{ambiguous}} {{representation of}} spatial depth in Thornton Walker’s painting The Homage creates a peculiar {{sense in which}} the ‘whereness’ of depicted objects and atmosphere cannot be ascertained by, either perspectival convention or perceptual strategies. This visual-spatial ambiguity resonates with <b>my</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> ‘broken’ stereography. Hence, ‘duoscopy’ refers to the limitations of binocular vision when the object of perception is itself duplicitous...|$|R
2500|$|Hughes {{was accused}} of being a Communist by many on the {{political}} right, but he always denied it. When asked why he never joined the Communist Party, he wrote, [...] "it was based on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I, as a writer, did not wish to accept." [...] In 1953, he was called before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He stated, [...] "I never read the theoretical books of socialism or communism or the Democratic or Republican parties for that matter, and so <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> whatever may be considered political has been non-theoretical, non-sectarian, and largely emotional and born out of my own need to find some way of thinking about this whole problem of myself." [...] Following his testimony, Hughes distanced himself from Communism. He was rebuked by some on the Radical Left who had previously supported him. He moved away from overtly political poems and towards more lyric subjects. When selecting his poetry for his Selected Poems (1959) he excluded all his radical socialist verse from the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|Named after a 1945 book {{of graphic}} {{black and white}} {{photographs}} by Weegee the band performed an aggressive mix of [...] "soundtrack themes, bluesy hard bop, speedy hardcore rock, squealing free jazz [...] metallic funk". Zorn stated that [...] "Naked City started with rhythm and blues/Spillane type things then went into this hard-core thing... because I was living in Japan and experiencing a lot of alienation and rejection... <b>My</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> hard-core also spurred the urge to write shorter and shorter pieces." [...] This approach culminated {{in a string of}} [...] "hardcore miniatures", intense brief compositions often lasting less than a minute, 42 of which were featured on the EP, Torture Garden (1989). Some of these tracks had also featured on the band's debut Naked City and others would resurface on the band's next full-length release, Grand Guignol (1992), which also included performances of works by Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, Orlande de Lassus, Charles Ives, and Olivier Messiaen. [...] The band's third album, Heretic (1992), featured more of these short improvisations produced for the soundtrack of an underground S/M film Jeux des Dames Cruelles. The band released a second EP, Leng Tch'e, in 1992 featuring a single composition which lasted just over half an hour. Radio, released in 1993, was the first Naked City album composed solely by Zorn, and featured tracks crediting a wide range of musical influences.|$|E
2500|$|... A {{few weeks}} later, our dog {{got hit by}} a {{snowplow}} and I forgot all about the problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) {{in the same way that}} Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? [...] " ...|$|E
