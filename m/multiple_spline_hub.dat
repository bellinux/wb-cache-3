40|$|Abstract. In this article, {{a method}} of data fusion based on contour of parts is {{proposed}} for multi-factors measurement. Contour of the parts {{is used as a}} reference to fusing data because it is more sensitive to the angular changes than other parts and the relative positions between the contour and other individual part are fixed. This method not only is a reference to fuse data from multi-sensors, but also could apply feedback control for the measurement system. A key part of automotive transmission named <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> has been used in the verification experiment in which the principle and structure of the measurement system is introduced...|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> to locate the wheel and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at the nut end. These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. The wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a left hand thread on the nut and vice versa. If the wheel becomes loose the tendency is for the locking nut to tighten and hold the wheel securely.|$|R

2500|$|Bicycle wheels {{were not}} strong enough for cars [...] until the {{development}} of tangentially spoked wheels. They rapidly became well established in the bicycle and motor tricycle world but were not common on cars until around 1907. This was encouraged by the Rudge-Whitworth patented detachable and interchangeable wheels designed by John Pugh. These wheels owed their resistance to braking and accelerative stresses to their two inner rows of tangential spokes. An outer row of radial spokes gave lateral strength against cornering strains. These wheels were deeply dished so that steering pivot pins might lie as near {{as possible to the}} center-line of the tires.

5000|$|The wheel {{diameter}} on a trials unicycle is usually 19" [...] or 20", as this allows greater maneuverability {{due to the}} short circumference of the wheel. Most Trials unicycles come with 19" [...] rear rims as used on 20" [...] (or mod) trials bicycles. This allows for larger tyres to be fitted which can help provide bounce and preload for jumping, and aid stability being generally quite wide (some up to 2.5 inches).A smaller wheel also means the unicycle is lighter, although some riders prefer larger wheels. The tire is generally wide and thick, giving a large air volume. This is to cushion drops and allow large hops and jumps. The tire will often have a deep tread to allow greater grip to obstacles. Strong high tension spokes and a strong rim wheel rim is used to prevent the wheel from deforming under the great stresses exerted on it by jumping. Unicycle wheels have to withstand large lateral stresses because, unlike in conventional riding, the rider may jump sideways. Many trials unicycles have a <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> and cranks, as this design {{tends to be more}} resistant to bending and breaking than the more common cotterless, or square taper, equivalent. Long cranks give the rider extra torque and pedals with a large amount of grip (often with pins or teeth) are used to prevent the rider's feet from slipping. Unicycles with shorter cranks are generally referred to as street unicycles, as they let the rider keep up their momentum easier and do smooth tricks. Whereas Trials unicycles usually have longer cranks that are better for hopping, as the rider has better control of the rotation of the wheel, and can therefore keep the unicycle from slipping out from under him.|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of video objects (VOs) {{is one of}} the innovations of MPEG- 4. The-plane of a VO defines its shape at a given instance in time and hence determines the boundary of its texture. In packet-based networks, shape, motion, and texture are subject to loss. While there has been considerable attention paid to the concealment of texture and motion errors, little has been done in the field of shape error concealment. In this paper, we propose a post-processing shape error-concealment technique that uses geometric boundary information of the received-plane. Second-order Hermite splines are used to model the received boundary in the neighboring blocks, while third order Hermite splines are used to model the missing boundary. The velocities of these splines are matched at the boundary point closest to the missing block. There exists the possibility of <b>multiple</b> concealing <b>splines</b> per group of lost boundary parts.

Apparent bandwidth {{limitation of}} seismic data prevents successful estimation of transition sharpness by the multiscale wavelet transform. We discuss the application of two recently developed techniques for (non-linear) singularity analysis designed for bandwidth limited data, such as imaged seismic reflectivity. The first method is a generalization of Mallat's modulus maxima approach to a method capable of estimating coarse-grained local scaling/sharpness/Holder regularity of edges/transitions from data residing at essentially one single scale. The method {{is based on a}} non-linear criterion predicting the (dis) appearance of local maxima {{as a function of the}} data's fractional integrations/di#erentiations. The second method is an extension of an atomic decomposition technique based on the greedy Matching Pursuit Algorithm. Instead of the ordinary Spline Wavelet Packet Basis, our method uses <b>multiple</b> Fractional <b>Spline</b> Wavelet Packet Bases, especially designed for seismic reflectivity data. The first method excels in pinpointing the location of the singularities (the stratigraphy). The second method improves the singularity characterization by providing information on the transition's location, magnitude, scale, order and direction (anti-/causal/symmetric). Moreover, the atomic decomposition entails data compression, denoising and deconvolution. The output of both methods produces a map of the earth's singularity structure. These maps can be overlayed with seismic data, thus providing us with a means to more precisely characterize the seismic reflectivity's litho-stratigraphical information content...|$|R

The sample included 5835 respondent's {{ranging in age from}} 50 - 83. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) modeling was employed to identify <b>multiple</b> linear <b>splines.</b> Possible predictors included functional limitations (ADL, IADL), chronic diseases (back pain, stroke, arthritis, cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, & diabetes) and demographic measures (age, education, gender, being white, being Hispanic). The MARS modeling process resulted in selection of the following measures in the final model: ADL limitations, IADL limitations, back pain, stroke, education, being female, and being Hispanic. The results indicated that ADL limitations included two splines with a large increase in depression score from zero to one limitation, and a more shallow increase from one to three limitations. IADL limitations included two splines with a linear increase in depression score from zero to two limitations and a decrease in score from two to three limitations. Reporting back pain or stroke resulted in higher depression scores compared to absence of disease. Two splines were identified for education in which the highest depression scores were associated with zero to 7 years of education; there was a linear decline in depression from seven to 17 years of education.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} landscape heterogeneity and the spatial distribution of small mammals in two areas of Western Sichuan, China. Given a large diversity of species trapped within {{a large number of}} habitats,we first classified small mammal assemblages and then modelled the habitat of each in the space of quantitative environmental descriptors. Our original two step “classify then model” procedure is appropriate for the frequently encountered study scenario: trapping data collected in remote areas with sampling guided by expert field knowledge. In the classification step, we defined assemblages by grouping sites of similar species composition and relative densities using an expert-class-merging procedure which reduced redundancy in the habitat factor used within a multinomial logistic regression predicting species trapping probabilities. Assemblages were thus defined as mixtures of small mammal frequency distributions in discrete groups of sampled sites. In the modelling step, assemblages' habitats and environments of the two sampled areas were discriminated in the space of remotely sensed environmental descriptors. First, we compared the discrimination of assemblage/study areas by linear and non-linear forms of discriminant analysis (linear discriminant analysis versus mixture discriminant analysis) and of multiple regression (generalized linear models versus <b>multiple</b> adaptive regression <b>splines).</b> The “best” predictive modelling technique was then used to quantify the contribution of each environmental variable in discriminations of assemblages and areas. Mixtures of Gaussians provided a more efficient model of assemblage coverage in environmental space than a single Gaussian cluster model. However, non-linearity in assemblage response to environmental gradients was consistently predicted with lower deviance and misclassification error by <b>multiple</b> adaptive regression <b>splines.</b> The two study areas were mainly discriminated along vegetation indices. However, although the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) could discriminate forested from non-forested habitats, its power to discriminate assemblages in Maerkang, where a greater diversity of forest habitat was observed, was seen to be limited, and in this case NDVI was outperformed by the enhanced vegetation index (EVI).
