40|$|AbstractMany studies {{conducted}} on the health status {{and quality of life}} (QOL) of patients with certain chronic diseases have demonstrated that their disease had an impact on their lives. However, less is known about the QOL and health status of patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In the present study, three focus groups of IPF patients (n= 10) were run to identify the aspects of QOL or health status that are relevant to this population and to establish which measure is preferable to assess these aspects. The patients completed and discussed the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment instrument (WHOQOL- 100). Results indicated that hobbies/leisure activities, <b>mobility,</b> <b>transport,</b> social relationships, working capacity, energy and doing things slower were aspects relevant to IPF patients' QOL.

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that mobility is often {{closely linked to}} one's independence, well-being, and quality of life. This research seeks to quantify the impacts of transport mobility and investigate their impacts {{on the quality of}} life for non-working elderly Canadians. Statistics Canada's Time-Use data are used to develop contextually-derived time budgets that measure daily exposure to psychological, exercise, and community benefits of transport mobility. These time budget measures are stratified by dimensions of life situation and domains of subjective well-being. Results exhibit significant variations in transport mobility benefits by life situation and subjective well-being indices, and also indicate significant association between transport mobility benefits and quality of life. This research concludes with an evaluation of the potential for future applications of Canada's General Social Survey (GSS) time-use modules towards further development of an index of well-being that incorporates the benefits of transport <b>mobility.</b> <b>Transport</b> mobility Quality of life Time-use Elderly Canadians...|$|E

40|$|Fluid interdependencies of mobility—physical and virtual—are {{growing rapidly}} in sub-Saharan Africa: The {{remarkable}} expansion of mobile phone networks is bringing a tangible new dimension of connectivity into <b>mobility,</b> <b>transport,</b> and access equations on the ground. This article draws on in-depth field research, including co-investigation with two groups often disadvantaged in their physical mobility, youth and older people, to explicate some current African developments and their departure from prevailing Western-based conceptualizations of space–time interactions (regarding {{the potential for}} space–time flexibility and microcoordination afforded by mobile phones). Despite the fact that face-to-face interaction is often of great significance in Africa, when the value attached to personalized relationships is balanced against factors of widespread poverty and irregular, sometimes very dangerous transport, the potential for phone substitution appears greater than in many Western contexts. Better distance management through phone use could be particularly closely associated with populations with very low disposable incomes or those whose physical mobility is limited; for instance, by disability, infirmity, age, or gender...|$|E
40|$|Complex spatiotemporal {{structures}} develop {{during the}} process of aging glasses after cooling and of rejuvenating glasses on heating. The key to understanding these structures is the interplay between the activated reconfiguration events that generate mobility and the transport of mobility. These effects are both accounted for by combining the random first-order transition theory of activated events with mode coupling theory in an inhomogeneous setting. The predicted modifications by <b>mobility</b> <b>transport</b> of the time course of the aging regime are modest. In contrast, the rejuvenation process is strongly affected through the propagation of fronts of enhanced mobility originating from the initial reconfiguration events. The structures in a rejuvenating glass resemble flames. An analysis along the lines of combustion theory provides an estimate of the front propagation speed. Heterogeneous rejuvenation naturally should occur for glasses with free surfaces. The analogy with combustion also provides a {{way of looking at the}} uptake of diluents by glasses described by case II and super case II diffusion...|$|E
