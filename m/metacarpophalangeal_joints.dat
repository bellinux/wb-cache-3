25|$|Leather is {{a natural}} product with special {{characteristics}} that make it comfortable to wear, and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it {{is a natural}} product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if they fit snugly) will conform to the wearer's hand. As this occurs the leather of the glove will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as 'breaking-in' the glove. Overtime wear spots may appear on {{certain parts of the}} palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of the glove. Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the hinge joints of the wearer's hands, including the interphalangeal articulations of hand, <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joints,</b> intercarpal articulations, and wrists.|$|E

2500|$|Clinically {{the disease}} may be silent, but {{characteristic}} radiological features may {{point to the}} diagnosis. [...] The increased iron stores in the organs involved, especially in the liver and pancreas, result in characteristic findings on unenhanced CT and a decreased signal intensity in MRI scans. Haemochromatosis arthropathy includes degenerative osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis. The distribution of the arthropathy is distinctive, but not unique, frequently affecting {{the second and third}} <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joints</b> of the hand. [...] The arthropathy can therefore be an early clue as to the diagnosis of haemochromatosis.|$|E

When looking at these joints, both the number of joints with tenderness upon touching (TEN28) and swelling (SW28) are counted.

40|$|The <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> {{is vital}} for hand function. It is {{frequently}} affected by rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis {{and in some cases}} the diseased joint is replaced with an implant. The past and current <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> replacements can be divided into three main categories: hinge implants, flexible implants and surface replacement implants. There is some frustration among hand surgeons as these implants fail in vivo in comparison with the replacement of larger joints such as the hip or knee. The aim of this study was a new design concept for the replacement of the diseased <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint.</b> The biomechanics of the diseased rather than the normal <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> have been considered during the design requirements procedure. Retrospective analysis of the past and present designs has been considered. Following selection of the concept of the new <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> replacement design well established methods like lubrication analysis and contact stress analysis studies, laboratory wear tests and finite element analysis studies have been used for the evaluation of the final design. In this study a new <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> replacement has been proposed. The new implant is intended to provide a functional range of motion, sustain the forces that a diseased joint experiences and provide pain relief for the patient. The new proposed <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> replacement design tries to combine the benefits of a one piece flexible implant with those of a surface replacement implant design that utilizes the soft layered concept which has been proposed for larger synovial joint...|$|R

40|$|CHIBA MEDICAL JOURNAL Open Access Paper[SUMMARY] Pain {{reduction}} {{effect of}} vibratory stimulation has been controversial. In previous studies, reseachers evaluated the effect for injection pain. However, as injection procedures differ {{with the skills}} of individual doctors, the uniformity of‘identical’pain stimulation attempted in these studies remains unverified. In the present study, we used well-controlled electrical stimulation on the pulp of the finger to simulate superficial somatic pain. 24 healthy subjects were studied. In each trial, 50 -mA electrical stimulation was applied for 2 ms on the middle finger. We compared three trials: without vibration, with vibration on the ipsilateral <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> and with vibration on the contralateral <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint.</b> Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for comparison.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. :The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze the MR anatomy and {{variable}} imaging characteristics of the thumb in asymptomatic volunteers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS MRI of the thumb was obtained in 34 asymptomatic volunteers (mean age, 33. 9 ± 9. 2 years). Two radiologists independently assessed visibility and signal intensity (SI) and thickness of the following structures of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints: proper and accessory radial and ulnar collateral ligaments, volar and dorsal plates, adductor pollicis aponeurosis, and annular pulleys. The presence and size of a synovial recess at the base of all plates was assessed. RESULTS On intermediate-weighted fat-saturated images, the ulnar collateral ligament of the <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> (reader 1, 79 %; reader 2, 62 %) and the adductor pollicis aponeurosis (reader 1, 50 %; reader 2, 82 %) commonly had a striated appearance. The radial collateral ligament of both joints was mainly of low SI (<b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint,</b> 53 % for reader 1 and 85 % for reader 2; interphalangeal joint, 59 % for reader 1 and 82 % for reader 2). All four pulleys were visible in each volunteer. An intermediate SI was observed in almost all pulleys, whereas the variable annular pulley had predominantly a low SI (reader 1, 50 %; reader 2, 74 %). The ulnar collateral ligament of the <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> is typically less than 3 mm thick, and the radial collateral ligament is less than 2 mm thick. A full-thickness synovial recess at the base of the dorsal plate of the <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> was seen in almost all volunteers (reader 1, 97 %; reader 2, 100 %). CONCLUSION The ligaments and pulleys of the thumb show considerable variability on MRI in healthy volunteers. The ulnar collateral ligament of the <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> is typically striated and less than 3 mm thick. A full-thickness synovial recess at the base of the dorsal plate of the <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> is a normal finding and should not be misdiagnosed as a tear...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{aimed at}} testing {{the ability of}} the {{superimposed}} electrical stimulation technique to restore the mobility of pre-stiff thumbs after operative repair for rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament. Material and methodsEight patients demonstrating a pre-stiff <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> were involved in two rehabilitation sessions of a counterbalanced design. In the voluntary contraction session, they performed 20 min of repeated active flexions of the impaired <b>metacarpophalangeal</b> <b>joint.</b> In the superimposed electrical stimulation session, they performed 20 min of percutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulations which were superimposed to voluntary flexion. ResultsMean active range of motion improvement from pre- to post-session was significantly greater in the superimposed electrical stimulation condition compared to the voluntary contraction condition (11 ± 5 deg versus 3 ± 4 deg; P< 0. 01).
