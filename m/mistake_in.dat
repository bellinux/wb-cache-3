5|$|Abantiades latipennis {{is one of}} {{fourteen}} species currently identified within the genus Abantiades, {{all of which are}} found exclusively in Australia. The species was first described in 1932 by Norman Tindale, an Australian entomologist and anthropologist. Tindale described the species, under its current name, but provided no etymology for the specific epithet latipennis. He based the species description on specimens from Lorne (including the holotype male and allotype female), Pomonal and Mount <b>Mistake</b> (<b>in</b> the Langi Ghiran State Park), Victoria, and from Zeehan, Eaglehawk Neck and Launceston, Tasmania.|$|E

40|$|Background: General {{practitioners}} and medical specialists are seeing adults with {{congenital heart disease}} in their everyday practice more frequently than ever. The lack of experience and knowledge in this field of cardiology often leads to <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> the treatment of these patients. The {{purpose of this article}} is to point out the commonest problems and <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> dealing with this group of patients. 				Conclusions: In the following article we pointed out the commonest problems and <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> dealing with adults with congenital heart disease, such as differing various types of atrial septal defects and differing atrial septal defect from patent foramen ovale. We also pointed out the commonest <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> dealing with patients with cyanotic heart disease, especially those with Eisenmenger syndrome...|$|R
5|$|One month later, former Wisteria Lane {{resident}} Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) {{moves back}} to the neighborhood after twelve years of absence with her husband, Adam (Nathan Fillion), and teenage daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca). Katherine had known Susan before moving away under mysterious circumstances. Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), is puzzled to learn that Dylan has no recollection of their childhood friendship or of her life on Wisteria Lane. Later, in a cryptic conversation, Adam asks Katherine if they made a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> moving back, and Katherine reminds him {{that they did not}} have a choice.|$|E
5|$|The E-1s {{came off}} the {{production}} line in February 1938, {{in time for a}} number of these aircraft to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938.

5|$|The league {{was unusually}} competitive; a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> early April caused Benfica to lose {{much of their}} lead. Qualifying for the Portuguese Cup final did not help them to gather momentum. In early May, Benfica {{suffered}} a major blow, losing away to Penafiel and dropping to second. A crucial win against Sporting brought back thei title hope, and a week later Benfica won their first league title in ten seasons. The season ended with a loss against Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça de Portugal Final, preventing Benfica from winning their first double since 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} improved for {{the following}} race in Bahrain though, as Webber picked up his first point for the season despite a small <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> qualifying which left him starting 14th and {{marked the first time}} he had been outqualified by his teammate in F1. He was unable to continue his point scoring form, however, as intermittent electrical problems in San Marino and a lack of grip in Spain meant that he could do no better than 13th and 12th in those races.|$|E

A beach {{at the mouth of the}} Catlins River is named Surat Bay in commemoration of this wreck. The schooner Wallace and steamer Otago were also both wrecked at or near Chasland's <b>Mistake,</b> <b>in</b> 1866 and 1876 respectively, and a 4534-ton steamer, the Manuka, ran aground at Long Point north of Tautuku in 1929.

The interns make a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> the surgery, and Harris is seriously endangered, but is rescued by the residents. The interns are put on probation and rebuked by Meredith Grey, although Harris tells Lexie Grey that she is not apologetic. Following the surgery fiasco, Harris approaches the hospital's chief of surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and claims responsibility for the incident. He informs her that the reason she has not been fired is because of his personal friendship with her father.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to their disqualification, former presidents Hubert Maga and Sourou-Migan Apithy staged protests while Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, another ex-president, supported an obscure candidate named Basile Adjou Moumouni. The election was held on May 15, and was Dahomey's first since 1964. Moumouni won the election with 80 percent of the vote, but Alley declared the result void because the protest prevented nearly three-quarters of the electorate from voting. This result sparked further demonstrations, and Maga, Apithy, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and former president Christophe Soglo were forbidden to enter the country, {{in an attempt to}} crack down on dissent. Alley felt he had made a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> disqualifying Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, as he believed that only they could bring unity to Dahomey.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles robbery-homicide {{sergeant}} Vincent Hanna (Plank) is on {{the trail}} of a gang of ruthless professional criminals, led by the methodical Patrick McLaren (McArthur), whose only <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> the last heist was the killing of armored car guards by the new recruit, Waingro (Berkeley), who is a loose cannon. But Hanna is soon surprised when he discovers that he and McLaren have quite a lot in common. While McLaren and his gang plan another heist, Hanna and his colleagues keep surveillance. Hanna is facing a personal problem, as the police work is straining his relationship with his wife, Lillian (Pouget). Moreover, McLaren is also facing a similar problem when he finds himself falling in love with Eady (Harrington), which he personally condemns due to the commitment required to his profession.|$|E

Another lap later, Ricciardo changed tyres and came out fifth behind Massa, taking fourth three laps later.

Vettel came onto the back of Hamilton with five laps remaining, chasing him closely for several laps before making a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> the second to last corner of lap 55, losing his chances at second place.|$|E
5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's <b>mistake.</b> <b>In</b> spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E

Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire.

Glenn Howard had a chance to make the draw a North America sweep, starting off with a small lead against Tom Brewster, but a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> the eighth end from Brent Laing led to a chance for Brewster to come back and tie the game, which he did.

5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or <b>mistake.</b> <b>In</b> Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, when no {{contestant}} had won $1 {{million in}} any show that aired {{over a period}} of five months, the top prize was then changed from a flat $1 million to an accumulating jackpot that increased by $10,000 for each episode where the top prize was not won. On April 10, 2001, Kevin Olmstead correctly answered the final question and won $2,180,000, making him the biggest winner in television history at the time. The top prize for correctly answering the final question returned to $1 million following Olmstead's win and has remained unchanged since; just five days after Olmstead's win, the standard $1 million prize was awarded to Bernie Cullen. The last top prize winner on the original network version was Ed Toutant, on the episode aired September 7, 2001; he had previously appeared on the episode aired January 31, 2001 when the jackpot was $1,860,000, where he was ruled to have answered his $16,000 question incorrectly, but when it was discovered that there was a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> that question, Toutant was invited back and won the $1,860,000 jackpot. On the Super Millionaire spin-off, Robert Essig won $1,000,000 after answering the twelfth question and then walked away, not reaching the final question for $10,000,000.|$|E
