6000|$|ANDERSON. Well, {{perhaps you}} will let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> the news myself. Judith: {{will you give}} Mr. Dudgeon his tea, and keep him here until I return? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you pardon me," [...] he said, [...] "if I {{remark that}} this {{conversation}} has no particular interest for me? Don't let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> any further {{out of your}} way." ...|$|E

6000|$|Calib. I pr'ythee let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>thee</b> where crabs grow; and I, with my long nails, will dig thee pig-nuts, shew thee a jay's nest, and {{instruct}} thee how to snare the marmozet: I'll <b>bring</b> <b>thee</b> to clustered filberts. Wilt thou go with me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Baron,' {{said the}} old gentleman with a smile, 'has {{commissioned}} <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> this letter'; and he extended a sealed envelope.|$|R
6000|$|STRAKER. [after {{a moment}} of stupefaction at the old man's {{readiness}} in repartee] Look here: {{what do you mean}} by gittin into my car and lettin <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> here if you're not the person I took that note to? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May God grant it!" [...] said Lee to himself, as he {{left the}} room--"it will be the first lecture you ever profited by; and the devil {{confound}} the plots and plotters who made <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> to this place!" [...] So saying, he carried his discontent forth into the Park.|$|E
6000|$|Stephen moved {{step by step}} as if he {{were being}} unwillingly dragged, until he had got round the open end of the stall, and was half hidden by a screen of draperies. Maggie went on {{counting}} her money till she suddenly heard a deep gentle voice saying, [...] "Aren't you very tried? Do let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> something,--some fruit or jelly, mayn't I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Peace, Madam! peace!" [...] said Charmion. [...] "It is but {{the magician}} Harmachis, whom thou didst bid <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> to <b>thee</b> at this hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was presumptuous of <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>thee</b> here," [...] {{she said}} after a while. [...] "I feared that thou wast dead, and the CÃ¦sar...." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Pa made <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> up some herring," [...] {{returned}} Lida. She shivered, coughed, {{and stuck}} out her bare feet. Lida was {{not thinking about}} herself or her feet, and was making no bid for sympathy. She held her feet out instinctively {{to keep them from}} the wet grass around the tombstone. But Faith and Una were instantly swamped with a wave of pity for her. She looked so cold--so miserable.|$|E
6000|$|... "The prince told me, {{half an hour}} since. He {{heard it}} from the Admiral. He told me he wished he was going with you, instead of with the army. He is always thirsting after adventure. He bade <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> in to him, if you came. I said you would be sure to do so. It was useless my going out to look for you, as I could not tell what {{you might have to}} do before starting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> some ear-rings, Gwen," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, {{when the}} hair was adjusted, {{and they were}} both looking at the {{reflection}} in the glass. It was impossible for them not to notice that the eyes looked brighter than they had done of late, that {{there seemed to be}} a shadow lifted from the face, leaving all the lines once more in their placid youthfulness. The mother drew some inference that made her voice rather cheerful. [...] "You do want your earrings?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall do so willingly, Count; {{but first}} will you {{allow me to}} present you to my lady mistress? She prayed <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> up to her apartments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Endicotts {{want me to}} {{come out}} again," [...] said Laura to Dave. [...] "They want <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> along with some of your chums, and they want <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> Jessie, too, if her folks will let her come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Lord Duke," [...] said he to Richard, in French, [...] "Sir Eric {{has sent}} <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> tidings that the King of France has arrived to receive your homage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know how. I {{have only}} speculated on the coincidence; I have not tried {{to account for}} it. I feel sure he will return. When he does, dear John, let me tell him that I have at last spoken to you, and let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> together. He will {{certainly}} help us to a new livelihood. His entreaty was that he might do something to smooth my life and yours; and I gave him my promise that if we ever wanted a friend, I would remember him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is an idle vagabond!" [...] {{the mayor}} of the good town of Southampton said, in high wrath--"a ne'er do well, and an insolent puppy; and as to you, Mistress Alice, if I catch you exchanging words with him again, ay, or nodding to him, or looking as if in any way you were {{conscious}} of his presence, I will put you on bread and water, and will send you away for six months to the care of my sister Deborah, who will, I warrant <b>me,</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> to your senses." ...|$|E
60|$|There, there, I am a fool! Tears! I have {{sometimes}} {{been moved to}} tears by a chapter of fine writing in a novel; but what have I to do with tears now? All depends on me--Father, this poor girl, the farm, everything; and they both love me--I am all in all to both; and he loves me too, I am quite sure of that. Courage, courage! and all will go well. (Goes to bedroom door; opens it.) How dark your room is! Let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> in here where there is still full daylight. (Brings EVA forward.) Why, you look better.|$|E
6000|$|A wan smile {{lightened}} John Hare's face as {{he spoke}} weakly: [...] "I fear your--generous act--can't save <b>me...</b> may <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> harm. I'd rather you left me--seeing you have women in your party." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This meeting {{corresponds}} with our parting, Romola. But I {{understand that it}} is a moment of terrible suspense. I am come, however, if you will listen to <b>me,</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> the relief of hope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{message was}} to you, Monsieur de Laval,' said the young hussar, {{turning his back}} contemptuously upon my uncle. 'The Emperor has sent <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> to him at once at the camp at Boulogne.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A custom I devoutly hope King Harry will break!' exclaimed Ralf. 'If not, I'll {{some day}} find the way between those painted ribs of Monseigneur de la Mort, I can tell him! I had nearly {{given him a}} taste of my sword as it was, only some Gascon rogue caught my arm, and he was off ere I could get free. So I jumped off, that your poor corpse should not be trodden by French heels; and I hardly know how it was, but the Lady Esclairmonde was by my side as I dragged you out, and caused these good folks to let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> in behind their shop.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The carpet {{would not}} work, sir," [...] said Dick. [...] "It never {{happened}} before. Had I used my own sword," [...] and he explained its properties, [...] "the Prince of Wales {{would not be}} alive to tell his story. I can say no more, beyond offering my apology for a disappointment which I could not have foreseen. A gentleman {{can only say that}} he is sorry. But wait!" [...] he added; [...] "I can at least prove that my confidence in some of my resources is not misplaced. Bid <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> something--anything--from the ends of the earth, and it shall be in your hands. I can't say fairer." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot said to Sir Percival: [...] "Sir, let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> to my lady." [...] And therewith he took Sir Percival by {{the hand}} and led him up into the gallery and to where the Lady Elaine sat in the midst of her court. And Sir Percival looked with a very earnest regard upon that lady, and it {{appeared}} to him that he had never before beheld so sweet and gentle and beautiful a countenance as that which he then looked upon. And Sir Percival said: [...] "Lady, now that I see thee I wonder not that Sir Launcelot hath remained thus hidden away from the sight of all of us for these two years past. For if this island wherein ye dwell is a fair paradise then certes art thou a very fitting queen to that dwelling-place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{your home}} at last, Miss Clifford," [...] said the musical voice of Jacob Meyer, [...] "and I thank the Fate which rules {{us that it}} has taught <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> to it safely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> for <b>bringing</b> <b>you</b> here," [...] {{he would}} say, smiling after his crooked fashion, and lifting his hat politely, [...] "but I wish {{to ask you}} if you have not changed your mind as to being mesmerized?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{realised}} before what a spick-and-span {{person you}} were," [...] she observed. [...] "You {{are beginning to}} look a little dishevelled, aren't you? Would you really like <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> a mirror and some shaving things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ferris made no response, {{while the}} old woman knotted the fringe of her shawl with quaking hands, and {{presently}} added with a tenderness in her voice which oddly discorded with the hardness of her face: [...] "He has been very sick, poor thing, with a fever; but now {{he is in his}} senses again, and the doctors say he will get well. I hope so. But he is still very weak. He tried to write two lines to you, but he had not the strength; so he bade <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> this word: That he had something to say which it greatly concerned you to hear, and that he prayed you to forgive his not coming to revere you, for it was impossible, and that you should have the goodness to do him this favor, to come to find him the quickest you could." ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR MISS ARCHER--I don't {{know whether}} you will have heard of my coming to England, {{but even if you}} have not it will {{scarcely}} be a surprise to you. You will remember that when you gave me my dismissal at Albany, three months ago, I did not accept it. I protested against it. You in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that I had the right on my side. I had come to see you with the hope that you would let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> over to my conviction; my reasons for entertaining this hope had been of the best. But you disappointed it; I found you changed, and you were able to give me no reason for the change. You admitted that you were unreasonable, and it was the only concession you would make; but it was a very cheap one, because that's not your character. No, you are not, and you never will be, arbitrary or capricious. Therefore it is that I believe you will let me see you again. You told me that I'm not disagreeable to you, and I believe it; for I don't see why that should be. I shall always think of you; I shall never think of any one else. I came to England simply because you are here; I couldn't stay at home after you had gone: I hated the country because you were not in it. If I like this country at present it is only because it holds you. I have been to England before, but have never enjoyed it much. May I not come and see you for half an hour? This at present is the dearest wish of yours faithfully, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are wrong," [...] said Perkins gently. [...] "They {{would have}} given him the {{alternative}} of betraying his trust, and confessing everything--which he would probably have accepted. Pardon me!--this is no insinuation against you," [...] he interrupted,--"but I regret {{to say that my}} experience with the effete Latin races of this continent has not inspired me with confidence in their loyalty to trust. Let me give you an instance," [...] he continued, smiling: [...] "the ship you are expecting is supposed to be an inviolable secret of the Church, but it is known to me--to my friends ashore--and even to you, my poor friend, a heretic! More than that, I am told that the Comandante, the Padre, and Alcalde are actually arranging to deport some of the American women by this vessel, which has been hitherto sacred to the emissaries of the Church alone. But you probably know this--it is doubtless part of your errand. I only mention it to convince you that I have certainly no need either to know your secrets, to hang you from the yard-arm if you refused to give them up, or to hold you as hostage for my messenger, who, as I have shown you, can take care of himself. I shall not ask you for that secret despatch you undoubtedly carry next your heart, because I don't want it. You are at liberty to keep it until you can deliver it, or drop it out of that port-hole into the sea--as you choose. But I hear the boat returning," [...] continued Perkins, rising gently from his seat as the sound of oars came faintly alongside, [...] "and no doubt with Winslow's messenger. I am sorry you won't let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> together. I dare say he knows all about you, and it really need not alter your opinions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come and see, then," [...] said Meta. [...] "Flora told <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> home--and {{it is my}} birthday, you know. Never mind {{waiting to}} tell Ethel. Margaret will {{let her know that}} I'll keep you out of mischief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I blame him much, Barbara," [...] he replied. [...] "It {{was a very}} foolish thing for <b>me</b> to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> down here at this time. I can't {{understand}} what ever possessed me to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Godwin," [...] he said sternly, [...] "seeing how {{you have}} dealt by <b>me,</b> what <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> back into my camp? I gave you brethren your lives, and you have robbed me of one whom I would not lose." ...|$|R
