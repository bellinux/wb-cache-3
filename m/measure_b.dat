The renovations revived one of the school's last original structures: the Amador Theater, the city's most popular performing arts facility. The measure enabled the addition of renovated science classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and media center, and a sound-proofed music building. The parking lot and central quad were expanded, with more than 550 parking spaces in the new lot, and classrooms were equipped to be more energy efficient.|$|E

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{properties of}} La/B, La/B 4 C, and LaN/B, LaN/B 4 C multilayer mirrors {{have been investigated}} in the 6. 5 - 6. 9 nm wavelength range based on <b>measured</b> <b>B</b> and B 4 C optical constants. Experimentally it is verified to what extent measured and tabulated optical constants are applicable for simulations of the reflectivity of these short period multilayer mirrors. The measured maximum reflectance at various wavelength values around the boron-K absorption edge is compared to calculated values from model systems. The measured reflectance profiles of La/B and La/B 4 C show a maximum at a slightly larger wavelength than calculations would predict based on the <b>measured</b> <b>B</b> and B 4 C optical constants. This is explained by {{the influence of a}} formed boron-lanthanum compound on the wavelength where the multilayer shows maximum reflectance. The maximum reflectance profiles of LaN/B and LaN/B 4 C multilayers can be described accurately by using the same boron atomic scattering factors, indicating boron in the LaN/B 4 C multilayer to be in a similar chemical state as boron in the LaN/B multilayer. It also indicates that nitridation of the La layer in the multilayer prevents the formation of La-B compounds. We show that the optimal wavelength for boron based optics is about 6. 65 nm and depends on the B chemical state. Finally, using the <b>measured</b> <b>B</b> optical constants we are able to calculate the spectral response of the multilayers, enabling the prediction of the optimal parameters for the above mentioned multilayers (C) 2012 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
