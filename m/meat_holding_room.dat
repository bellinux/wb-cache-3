40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of hydration time on quality of Pretty Woman rose cut flower. The experiment was laid out as a 2 Ã— 2 Factorial in Completely Randomized Design with 4 treatments (Southern Roses standard for 1 h in greenhouse and 2 h in holding room; Southern Roses standard for 1 h in greenhouse and 4 h in holding room; Borehole water for 1 h in greenhouse and 2 h in holding room; Borehole water for 1 h in greenhouse and 4 h in <b>holding</b> <b>room).</b> Each treatment was replicated four times and randomly assigned to plots. Results showed that there was interaction between hydration time and preservatives on rose openness and quality. Where Southern Roses standard was used in 2 h, better quality flowers were obtained compared to those from a 4 h period. The same trend was noticed with borehole water which performed better in 2 h than 4 h holding time hence hydration time and flower preservatives are effective in quality maintenance in rose cut flowers if well combined. The results showed that Southern Roses standard solution of 1 h in green house and 2 h in <b>holding</b> <b>room</b> at 20 ppm concentration had positive effects on rose openness, stem straightness and control of Botrytis incidence whilst borehole water had positive effects on water uptake and quality of cut rose flowers. From the findings of the study, it can be concluded that keeping the flowers for 1 h in the greenhouse and 2 h in the <b>holding</b> <b>room</b> give the best quality of rose cut flowers...|$|R

50|$|With Changi-based Singapore Airlines {{being the}} launch {{customer}} for the Airbus A380, works to ensure full capability in handling the large aircraft were given priority {{in time for}} its introduction in October 2007. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore spent S$60 million in upgrading the two existing terminals and airport infrastructure, including enlarged gate holdrooms, new finger piers, and extended baggage belt carousels from the normal 70 m to 90 m. With these new carousels in place, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does from a Boeing 747-400, which carries fewer passengers. On 16 August 2005, Changi Airport unveiled the first of 11 specially built gates capable of handling the giant aircraft. Costing S$15 million, the gates or 'fingers' enable passengers to board the upper deck of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate <b>hold</b> <b>rooms.</b> The <b>hold</b> <b>rooms</b> themselves have been enlarged and appointed to cater for the larger number of passengers aboard an A380.
