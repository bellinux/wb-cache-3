40|$|Townsend's (1976) {{attached}} eddy hypothesis {{states that}} the turbulent structure in the constant stress layer can be decomposed into attached and detached eddy motion. This paper proposes and tests methodology for separating the attached and detached eddy <b>motion</b> from <b>time</b> series <b>measurements</b> of velocity and temperature. The proposed methodology {{is based on the}} time-frequency localization and filtering capabilities of the orthonormal wavelet transforms. Using a relative entropy statistical measure, the optimal wavelet basis is identified first. The turbulence <b>time</b> series <b>measurements</b> are then transformed into the wavelet domain where the contribution of specific events in the time-frequency domain are identified. The filtering scheme utilizes a recently constructed Lorentz thresholding methodology that successfully eliminated all wavelet coefficients associated with the detached eddy motion. While this filtering scheme lacks the compression efficiency of the classical Donoho and Johnstone [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Maynard Operation Sequence Technique (MOST) is a {{predetermined}} <b>motion</b> <b>time</b> {{system that is}} used primarily in industrial settings to set the standard time in which a worker should perform a task. To calculate this, a task is broken down into individual motion elements, and each is assigned a numerical time value in units known as <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> units, or TMUs, where 100,000 TMUs is equivalent to 1 hour. All the <b>motion</b> element <b>times</b> are then added together and any allowances are added, {{and the result is}} the standard time. It is more common in Asia whereas the original and more sophisticated Methods <b>Time</b> <b>Measurement</b> technique, better known as MTM, is a global standard.|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{performed}} that compares results of nonlinear model runs using two sets of earthquake ground <b>motion</b> <b>time</b> histories that have been modified to fit the same design response spectra. The time histories include applicable modified recorded earthquake ground <b>motion</b> <b>time</b> histories and synthetic ground <b>motion</b> <b>time</b> histories. The modified recorded earthquake ground <b>motion</b> <b>time</b> histories are modified from time history records that are selected based on consistent magnitude and distance. The synthetic ground <b>motion</b> <b>time</b> histories are generated using appropriate Fourier amplitude spectrums, Arias intensity, and drift correction. All of the time history modification is performed using the same algorithm to fit the design response spectra. The study provides data to demonstrate that properly managed synthetic ground <b>motion</b> <b>time</b> histories are reasonable for use in nonlinear seismic analysis...|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} between maintenance process and line production {{should also be}} considered. The maintenance time is greatly influenced by the maintainability of the product. The method used in the line production is Method <b>time</b> <b>Measurement</b> (MTM) (Laring et al. 2002), which should be corrected in the maintenance <b>time</b> <b>measurement.</b> MTM is put forward by B.S.Q. Elzendoorn and Delphine Keller. A lot of literatures discussed MTM. In 1928, A. B. Segur raised the Motion-Time Mechanism in his Ph.D. thesis (Adams and Shoemaker 1989). Within actual conditions, {{he found that the}} time required for skilled personnel to finish a certain basic action is constant. This basic scientific theory has developed into a widely used method called the Predetermined Time Standard (PTS), which is also the theoretical basis for existing measurement of non-immersive, virtual human action time. Based on this idea, European and U.S. companies invented many PTS method until recent years, such as MTA (<b>Motion</b> <b>time</b> Analysis), WF (Work Factor System), MTM (Method <b>time</b> <b>Measurement)</b> and so on. In 1966, Dr. Heyde (G.C. Heyde) founded MOD method (Modular Arrangement of Predetermined Time Standard, MOD method for short) based on his long-term research (Ma et al. 2010). It is a most summary new method of PTS technology which combined time with action. MOD method is easy to learn and use, and it is convenient and practical to apply in engineering item. What’s more, its precision is not lower than the tradition PTS techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{predetermined}} <b>motion</b> <b>time</b> systems (MTM and MOST) use <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> units (TMU) {{instead of}} seconds for measuring time. One TMU is defined to be 0.00001 hours, or 0.036 seconds. These smaller units allow for more accurate calculations {{without the use}} of decimals. In the most in-depth PMT systems, motions observed will be on the level of individual TMUs, like toss (3 TMUs in MiniMOST) and simple pick-up (2 TMUs in MTM-1). More general systems simplify things by grouping individual elements, and thus have larger time values [...] - [...] for example, a bend and arise (61 TMUs in MTM-2) and one or two steps (30 TMUs in BasicMOST). Systems with even less detail work with TMU values in the hundreds, like climbing 10 rungs on a ladder (300 TMUs in MaxiMOST) or passing through a door (100 TMUs in MaxiMOST).|$|R

40|$|Design {{procedures}} for {{high speed craft}} are currently centred on performance and structural considerations. Dramatic improvements in craft performance {{in recent years have}} led to crew injury, fatigue or performance loss becoming the limiting factor for high speed operation, particularly offshore. This has resulted in the re-evaluation of the primary design considerations to centre the design process on human capabilities. In this paper a systematic procedure is developed to enable direct correlation between numerical, or model-scale, motion data and human responses in the full scale craft. The nature of different modes of motion and their specific effects on the performance of a vessel’s crew are analysed in both a quantitative and qualitative manner. This investigation has identified the factors most detrimental to crew endurance and their performance post-transit. A procedure for measuring human responses to full scale vessel <b>motion,</b> enabling real <b>time</b> <b>measurements</b> of crew reactions to be made, is described. Data acquired for a high speed rigid inflatable boat, including measurements of sea state, vessel motions, seat motions and human responses are discussed together with associated towing tank results and predictions of vessel motion from a numerical method. An overview of the computational techniques used for predicting motions of high speed craft is given concentrating on recent improvements to them. Such an approach, combining simulation with full scale data, allows direct correlation between crew physiological and psychological responses and the sea conditions for different craft designs. This in turn enables the human response to vessel operations to be considered when the craft are being designed. <br/...|$|R
