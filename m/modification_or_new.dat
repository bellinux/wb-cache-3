The goal of the test suite is to allow researchers quickly and easily to evaluate their proposed TCP extensions in simulators and testbeds using {{a common set of}} well-defined, standard test cases, in order to compare and contrast proposals against standard TCP as well as other proposed modifications. This test suite is not intended to result in an exhaustive evaluation of a proposed TCP <b>modification</b> <b>or</b> <b>new</b> congestion control mechanism.

40|$|Abstract: Database {{applications}} are {{an area of}} very specific requirements with respect to change introduction. New requirements on a database may require database schema <b>modification</b> <b>or</b> <b>new</b> ontology assumed for existing database entities. Such new requirements may involve necessity of changes in thousands of places of all the applications that dependent on the previous version of the database schema and ontology. In the paper we propose to relax the difficulties with the change of a database schema and ontology through two kinds of generic features that can be introduced to the object-oriented database model and to OODBMS: (1) dynamic object roles that simplify schema evolution, and (2) updateable overloading database views that introduce additional semantics to already existing semantics of database entities. The paper follows the Aspect-Oriented Programming idea, but with respect to situations that appear in database applications. 1...|$|E

40|$|In the {{practice}} of software development contexts have been only implicitly modeled and transformed in fixed part of software. The information about context is dispersed in objects across the application. Each context change leads to <b>modification</b> <b>or</b> <b>new</b> development of the software. The context modeling helps developer to separate context objects from contextdependent objects. It allows better reuse of analysis, design and implementation models, if the context of certain objects is changed. The context modeling is interesting and necessary, when the software should be agile - i. e. when {{the environment and the}} condition of the software could be changed permanently, e. g. in case of platform for virtual enterprises. The paper introduces a novel approach to support processes within generic platforms for virtual enterprises: the context-based approach. The main advantage of the approach lies in its generic capacity, which allows the users to define processes flexibly to support their own enterprises. In this paper, we discuss further the phenomenon of extra-context logic, its modeling and its application case. The information of extra-context logic provides not only the better understanding of application domain, but also can be used by a wizard to support the interaction of users working with multiple systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of new learning technologies into courses at Canadian universities {{has been largely}} undertaken at the initiative of individual instructors, rather than in response to explicit institutional direction or faculty initiatives. This appears to be particularly {{the case with the}} migration of individual courses that were formally entirely face-to-face to blended delivery. In this case study, the experience of one university is used to present the types of academic policy and process issues that arose during a pilot project to re-design a single graduate program in order to facilitate the use of blended delivery. Considerations included why and how blended learning was to be used; at what level decisions regarding blended delivery should be made; decision process for individual courses versus entire programs; policy precedents and need for policy <b>modification</b> <b>or</b> <b>new</b> policy. Specific areas examined include course and program approval, resources, and instructor responsibilities and workload. The findings suggest that the work involved in policy updating in a changing environment is important because it surfaces, and opens for review, existing, often taken-for-granted institutional values, norms, and protocols. In some cases, the articulation of these values and norms serves to highlight the importance of respecting them within this new learning context. In others it suggests the need to rethink accepted protocols that may be ill-suited to the educational opportunities that emerging technologies can present...|$|E

40|$|Firefighters {{are one of}} the {{stakeholders}} that extensively use {{protective clothing}} in their service which is mostly done in hot environment. In series of studies to create a compromise between the need for safety and the need for comfortable use of personal protective clothing (PPE), testing to confirm specifications that have to be achieved in every <b>modification</b> <b>or</b> <b>new</b> proposed product of PPE is vital. Confirmation of not only physical/technical aspect specifications of PPE, but also the physiological aspect specification as a result of wearing PPE is needed. To date, European Standard (EN) 469 (2005) has provided comprehensive test methods to assess garment performance designed to protect firefighters. The British Standard (BS) 8469 (2007) also has covered almost all issues regarding test methods to assess the ergonomic performance and compatibility of PPE using humans as subjects. However, some inconsistencies between these standards still remain. For that reason, and to response the need for an easier and reliable PPE standard, a new firefighter PPE standard test was developed. In an attempt to establish this new standard, we found some valuable lessons in related to the men working using PPE in hot environment. Firstly, there is still more space to reduce the burden on firefighters by improving the SCBA and its harness design. Secondly, a PPE should be tested in hot environment to have a better understanding about the physiological impact of the PPE in a similar condition that it will be used. And lastly, although the tympanic temperature was more reactive, the tympanic temperature profiles were in a similar tendency to the rectal temperature profile so that the tympanic temperature measurement is acceptable in a PPE standard test...|$|E
40|$|Fast, {{accurate}} three dimensional (3 D) optical metrology has diverse {{applications in}} object and environment modelling. Structured-lighting techniques allow non-contacting 3 D surface-shape measurement by projecting patterns of light onto an object surface, capturing {{images of the}} deformed patterns, and computing the 3 D surface geometry from the captured 2 D images. However, motion artifacts can still be a problem with high-speed surface-motion especially with increasing demand for higher measurement resolution and accuracy. 	To avoid motion artifacts, fast 2 D image acquisition of projected patterns is required. Fast multi-pattern projection and minimization {{of the number of}} projected patterns are two approaches for dynamic object measurement. To achieve a higher rate of switching frames, fast multi-pattern projection techniques require costly projector hardware <b>modification</b> <b>or</b> <b>new</b> designs of projection systems to increase the projection rate beyond the capabilities of off-the-shelf projectors. Even if these disadvantages were acceptable (higher cost, complex hardware), and even if the rate of acquisition achievable with current systems were fast enough to avoid errors, minimization of the number of captured frames required will still contribute to reduce further the effect of object motion on measurement accuracy and to enable capture of higher object dynamics. Development of an optical 3 D metrology method that minimizes the number of projected patterns while maintaining accurate 3 D surface-shape measurement of objects with continuous and discontinuous surface geometry has remained a challenge. 	Capture of a single image-frame instead of multiple frames would be advantageous for measuring moving or deforming objects. Since accurate measurement generally requires multiple phase-shifted images, imbedding multiple patterns into a single projected composite pattern is one approach to achieve accurate single-frame 3 D surface-shape measurement. The main limitations of existing single-frame methods based on composite patterns are poor resolution, small range of gray-level intensity due to collection of multiple patterns in one image, and degradation of the extracted patterns because of modulation and demodulation processes on the captured composite pattern image. 	To benefit from the advantages of multi-pattern projection of phase-shifted fringes and single-frame techniques, without combining phase-shifted patterns into one frame, digital moiré was used. Moiré patterns are generated by projecting a grid pattern onto the object, capturing a single frame, and in a post-process, superimposing a synthetic grid of the same frequency as in the captured image. Phase-shifting is carried out as a post-process by digitally shifting the synthetic grid across the captured image. The useful moiré patterns, which contain object shape information, are contaminated with a high-frequency grid lines that must be removed. After performing grid removal, computation of a phase map, and phase-to-height mapping, 3 D object shape can be computed. The advantage of digital moiré provides an opportunity to decrease the number of projected patterns. However, in previous attempts to apply digital phase-shifting moiré to perform 3 D surface-shape measurement, there have been significant limitations. To address the limitation of previous system-calibration techniques based on direct measurement of optical-setup parameters, a moiré-wavelength based phase-to-height mapping system-calibration method was developed. The moiré-wavelength refinement performs pixel-wise computation of the moiré wavelength based on the measured height (depth). In measurement of a flat plate at different depths, the range of root-mean-square (RMS) error was reduced from 0. 334 to 0. 828 mm using a single global wavelength across all pixels, to 0. 204 to 0. 261 mm using the new pixel-wise moiré-wavelength refinement. To address the limitations of previous grid removal techniques (precise mechanical grid translation, multiple-frame capture, moiré-pattern blurring, and measurement artifacts), a new grid removal technique was developed for single-frame digital moiré using combined stationary wavelet and Fourier transforms (SWT-FFT). This approach removes high frequency grid both straight and curved lines, without moiré-pattern artifacts, blurring, and degradation, and was an improvement compared to previous techniques. To address the limitations of the high number of projected patterns and captured images of temporal phase unwrapping (TPU) in fringe projection, and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the extended phase map of TPU in digital moiré, improved methods using two-image and three-image TPU in digital phase-shifting moiré were developed. For measurement of a pair of hemispherical objects with true radii 50. 80 mm by two-image TPU digital moiré, least-squares fitted spheres to the measured 3 D point clouds had errors of 0. 03 mm and 0. 06 mm, respectively (sphere fitting standard deviations 0. 15 mm and 0. 14 mm), and the centre-to-centre distance measurement between hemispheres had an error of 0. 19 mm. The number of captured images required by this new method is one third that for three-wavelength heterodyne temporal phase unwrapping by fringe projection techniques, which would be advantageous in measuring dynamic objects, either moving or deforming...|$|E
40|$|L'auteur résume les derniers développements survenus dans le secteur public québécois depuis la grève générale de 1972. Après avoir effectué une brève rétrospective des {{incidents}} rencontrés dans cette négociation, il décrit les principales orientations qui se dégagent tant du point de vue des structures de négociation que de celui des mécanismes de règlement des conflits en vue de la prochaine ronde de négociation. No major {{development has}} taken place in Quebec, since 1972, regarding public service staff relations. Some minor events and important discussions are worth mentioning for they will have a definite impact on future negotiations. It must be recalled that, except on a few points that will be mentioned in due course, public service staff relations in Quebec fall under the general law of labour relations as contained in the Quebec Labour Code, especially in section 99 regarding strikes in public services. BARGAINING STRUCTURESThese are eight bargaining units, one of which, subdivided between white and blue collar workers, contains more than 75 % of all public servants (see Table 1). The union representing these employees was certified in the Stature itself. The other units comprise special groups such as professionals, teachers employed by the government and peace officiers; these groups were certified by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, on the recommendation of a joint committee. Practically all Quebec public servants are unionized. Any conflict respecting the bargaining unit is decided, since 1969, by the Labour Court. An important case is now pending concerning all casual workers, white and blue collar workers. Having signed up more than 1000 of them, the union (the « Syndicat des fonctionnaires provinciaux du Quebec » — S. F. P. Q.) has applied, in March 1973, to represent them all; the investigation commissioner dismissed the case, in January 1974, on the ground that he had no jurisdiction, because the Civil Service Commission had withdrawn these employees from the application of theCivil Service Act, and placed them under special regulations. On appeal, the Labour Court ruled that such withdrawal did not deprive these employees from their rights under theLabour Code. The file has been returned to the investigation commissioner to complete his enquiry. All collective agreements in the Quebec public service will terminate on June 30, 1975, except that of the peace officers (prison guards and the like) which expired June 30, 1974. Bargaining for these employees has been going on since the Spring of 1974, and an agreement has been reached in principle (September 1974) waiting to be ratified by the members. Through a labour relations committee, amendments have been made to the other agreements, on points such as sick leave banks and travel expenses. The government has refused to reopen the agreements on the cost-of-living problem; he agreed to pay earlier than foreseen in the agreement part of a cost-of-living bonus, on a lump-sum basis, scheduled for a later date. As for the bargaining structure of the next round, all interested unions are favouring sector bargaining rather than common front bargaining at one single table. Even at the sector level, interunion cartels are not guaranteed. Coordinated bargaining is much more likely to occur than any other form centralized bargaining. Greater centralization could come through government decision, either by legislation — present Bill 46 has to be replaced before June 30, 1975 — or by pressure on bargaining agents to agree on another unit. There is also the possibility of a multi-tier system, some subjects or general rules being bargained at a central table, other matters at various level sector tables. IMPASSE RESOLUTION AND THE RIGHT TO STRIKEThe Civil Service Act contains only two provisions regarding impasse resolution and the right to strike. Peace officers are forbidden to strike, and no other group of government employees may go out on strike unless the essential services to be maintained have been determined by mutual agreement or by decision of the Labour Court. For the rest, the Labour Code applies to civil servants as for all other public service employees. Common front experience of 1972 had raised forcefully the problem of essential services. To try to solve this problem with general rules, Bill 89 — « An Act to ensure public well-being in case of labour conflict » — was introducedin the National Assembly in December 1972. It would give the government great powers in public service disputes. Following a decision by a three-person committee that a work stoppage would endanger public health, safety, welfare or education, the Cabinet could, {{in the case of a}} government public service, suspend the right to strike, while the dispute was referred to the proper parliamentary committee. A secret vote on the last offers was to be held afterwards by a poll commissioner; if accepted by a majority of employees, these offers would become the collective agreement; otherwise the government would then remove the strike prohibition or refer the dispute to the National Assembly for settlement. In non-government public services, the same procedure could be followed, or the case could be referred to « commissioners on disputes » for a last-offer-selection type of arbitration. The reaction from all sides was so bad that the Minister of Labour finally withdrew the Bill. In July 1974, Bill 24 was tabled containing many amendments to various parts of the Labour Code, but nothing on section 99. The Advisory Council on Labour and Manpower had discussed possible formulas for impasse resolution without coming to a consensus, mainly on essential services. The union members of the Council advocated mediation board intervention, on the essential services to be maintained, if the parties could not agree; the board recommendations would be published to enlist public pressure on the parties, but there would be no compulsory decision. The management members considered such decision by an out-side body necessary for the protection of the public. The Labour Minister has endorsed publicly the no-coercion position, both on the determination of essential services and on the content of the collective agreement. He underlined that compulsory intervention with binding decision, brings no solution to labour disputes; it leads the parties to refuse to shoulder their responsibilities and often induces them to reject such decisions. It is not clear however how much support the Minister will be able to secure on such a position in his own party caucus. The civil servants union has come up with different recommendations. It suggests that mediation services should be granted only on joint application, but that arbitration should be available at the request of one party; the arbitration award should be made public but it would not be binding. On the question of essential services the S. F. P. Q. considers that a list should be maintained up-to-date by a joint permanent committee; in case of a strike, failing agreement of the parties on the list, a decision should be made by the Labour Court. What will finally come out of such conflicting opinions is hard to know. The no-coercion approach is appealing to labour experts; the apparent security of a legal way to determine at least essential services may be more palatable to the public in general and probably to most of the National Assembly members. SCOPE OF BARGATNINGAs in all other jurisdictions, scope of bargaining for public servants is restricted in Quebec mainly on questions that fall in the realm of the Civil Service Commission, especially on classification and promotion. Classification is the sole responsibility of the Commission, but the very first collective agreement, in 1966, stated that the forthcoming new classification would abide by certain principles, some of them were spelled out in the agreement. The new classification was approved in 1967, but difficulties grew out immediately. A consultative committee for its revision was soon in operation; it was made up of government, union and Commission representatives. Following this revision, the government and the union signed a formal agreement determining the process for the integration of civil servants into the new classification; an appeal procedure was included, with binding arbitration as the final step. 14, 000 cases were appealed, and 2, 000 submitted to arbitration, nearly half of which were won by the union. In its next round of bargaining, the union plans to go after joint decision on any <b>modification</b> <b>or</b> <b>new</b> classification. According to the current agreement, a joint committee was to make recommendations on rules that would permit an unsuccessful candidate to a higher class to be informed of the reasons of his failure, and to have the right to appeal any discriminatory decision. No progress has been made on this point, and the union will try to have these rights written out in the next agreement. To protect the merit principle, seniority cannot be considered for appointment or promotion of a white collar civil servant ; for blue collar morkers, it can be used only in cases of equal competence among two or more candidates. With the progressive encroachment of the collective agreement and joint committee activities on its various responsibilities, the Civil Service Commission progressively loses its decision powers and looks more and more as an administrative arm of the Civil Service Department; it might eventually become simply a division of the Department, the agreement and the union taking up the duties the Commission had to protect the civil servant against arbitrary decisions. CONCLUSIONSIn trying to extend the scope of bargaining and to obtain more accurate definitions of the bargaining units — as in the case of casual workers — the civil servants unions carry on the work of bringing greater rationalization in the whole structure and general rules of the Civil Service itself. The future bargaining structures are uncertain. No one wishes to reenact the chaotic situation of the 1972 common front. But the most important actor, the government, remains silent for the time being concerning its intentions. The impasse resolution system is in the process of being changed. Conflicting opinions on very basic approaches appear to block any proposal, at this point, for revision of the all-important section 99 of theLabour Code...|$|E

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{model for}} transportation networks is branched transport, which seeks the optimal transportation scheme to move material from a given initial {{to a final}} distribution. The cost of the scheme encodes a higher transport efficiency the more mass is moved together, which automatically leads to optimal transportation networks with a hierarchical branching structure. The two major existing model formulations, either using mass fluxes (vector-valued measures) or patterns (probabilities on the space of particle paths), are rather different. Once their equivalence was established, the analysis of optimal networks could rest on both. The transportation cost of classical branched transport is a fractional power of the transported mass, and several model properties and proof techniques build on its strict concavity. We generalize the model and its analysis to the most general class of reasonable transportation costs, essentially increasing, subadditive functions. This requires several <b>modifications</b> <b>or</b> <b>new</b> approaches.

5000|$|A {{temporary}} {{special test}} means the aircraft {{is intended to}} return to normal service after the tests are completed, while permanent special test aircraft are not. The Planning code is no longer used but was meant to designate aircraft [...] "on the drawing board". For example, using this system an airframe such as the F-13 could have initially been designated as ZF-13 during the design phase, possibly XF-13 if experimental testing was required before building a prototype, the YF-13; the final production model would simply be designated F-13 (with the first production variant being the F-13A). Continuing the example, some F-13s during their service life {{may have been used}} for testing <b>modifications</b> <b>or</b> researching <b>new</b> designs and designated JF-13 or NF-13; finally after many years of service, the airframe would be permanently grounded due to safety or economic reasons as GF-13.|$|R
40|$|Entertainment in {{the digital}} world {{is not only the}} {{consumption}} of content supplied by the manufacturers of game. It is increasingly invitation, or even persuading the players {{to take part in the}} creation of the game. Both by its mechanics, or by allowing them to add their own <b>modifications</b> <b>or</b> <b>new</b> content. And there are also creations in junction of the virtual world and the real one. It would seem that the player-prosumer is creation of electronic media, because it is associated with the transition from the culture of reading, to the culture of reading/writing. This approach to the problem, however, is a gross simplification, because the players created content related to games long before the era of Internet and social networks. For many of them the beginnings of virtual entertainment were even regress of creativity (see „classic” RPG games vs. early cRPG games). So more appropriate would be to talk about the digital evolution than a revolution in this field. Evolution involving the emergence of tools that allow gamers to move their own creativity from real to virtual world (easy-to-use in-game editors, game mechanics that allows for almost any creation of game world, game engines allowing to create their own works, etc.), as well as those tools that assist in creating content for the needs of non-virtual competitions. The revolution, or maybe significant qualitative jump, took place in the process of distribution of content via new media. It is difficult to imagine the possibilities of getting player-creator-amateur to the number of users, as today, without the existence of the Internet...|$|R

Typically, vendors provide either custom <b>modification</b> {{services}} <b>or</b> sell <b>new</b> effects pedals they have already modified. The Ibanez Tube Screamer, Boss DS-1, Pro Co RAT and DigiTech Whammy {{are some of the}} most often-modified effects. Common modifications include value changes in capacitors or resistors, adding true-bypass so that the effect's circuitry is no longer in the signal path, substituting higher-quality components, replacing the unit's original operational amplifiers (op-amps), or adding functions to the device, such as allowing additional control of some factor or adding another output jack.|$|R
40|$|Software {{regression}} testing techniques verify previous functionalities each time software <b>modifications</b> occur <b>or</b> <b>new</b> characteristics are added. With {{the aim of}} gaining {{a better understanding of}} this subject, in this work we present a survey of software {{regression testing}} techniques applied in the last 15 years; taking into account its application domain, kind of metrics they use, its application strategies and the phase of the software development process where they are applied. From an outcome of 460 papers, a set of 25 papers describing the use of 31 software testing regression techniques were identified. Results of this survey suggest that at the moment of apply a regression testing technique, metrics like cost and fault detection efficiency are the most relevant. Most of the techniques were assessed with instrumented programs (experimental cases) under academic settings. Conversely, we observe a minimum set of software regression techniques applied in industrial settings, mainly, under corrective and maintenance approaches. Finally, we observe a trend using some regression techniques under agile approaches...|$|R

This concept is applied to recent calls by Australian water scientists and policy-makers "to liberate the knowledge, skills and individual leadership and collaboration of all stakeholders to reflect a more decentralised, disaggregated and localised water world". Local community stakeholders appear the most neglected stakeholder currently in such water management, despite increasing international recognition of their importance for constructive change in transitional sustainability contexts. As such, place-change policy design focuses {{on the importance of}} collaborative participatory approaches for better understanding of theunderlying rationalities, and, by association, of better liberating the social knowledges, of place-based local communities for better policy input to realise new visions of sustainable water management, and beyond.
