5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the <b>most</b> <b>disturbing</b> aspects of each work.|$|E
5|$|James Frain plays Kieran Ashton, {{a former}} {{colleague}} of Karl, who faked his suicide {{and became the}} Truth Terrorist, serving as the primary antagonist. The character is motivated {{by the loss of}} his identity and family, as well as betrayal from Karl by his affair with Kieran's wife before her death. Frain believed that Kieran is the <b>most</b> <b>disturbing</b> character he has played. Portraying the character, the actor wanted to make his actions understandable, though not justifiable.|$|E

25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in parkinsonian syndromes {{for a variety of}} reasons. An overlap exists between PD and Lewy body dementia, so that where Lewy bodies are present in the visual cortex, {{hallucinations}} may result. Hallucinations can also be brought about by excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Most hallucinations are visual in nature, often formed as familiar people or animals, and are generally not threatening in nature. Some patients find them comforting; however, their caregivers often find this part of the disease <b>most</b> <b>disturbing,</b> and the occurrence of hallucinations is a major risk factor for hospitalisation. Treatment options consist of modifying the dosage of dopaminergic drugs taken each day, adding an antipsychotic drug such as quetiapine, or offering caregivers a psychosocial intervention to help them cope with the hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|One such {{therapy is}} trauma-focused therapy. This therapy {{involves}} bringing the <b>most</b> <b>disturbing</b> {{elements of a}} traumatic memory to mind and using therapist-guided cognitive restructuring {{to change the way}} the memories are thought about. The change in evaluation usually involves highlighting that the feelings of certain death, extreme danger, hopelessness and helplessness within a traumatic memory do not apply to the person now, as they survived the event. The therapy also focuses on extending the memory so it is recalled beyond the most traumatic parts. Extending them to a point where the person felt safe again, so they remember the event in a more complete way with less focus on the negative aspects. As an example, a traumatic memory of wartime combat might be extended to after a battle, to when the person was no longer in immediate danger. In processing the memory in these ways it becomes less likely to intrude into their thoughts as an unwanted flashback.|$|E

Forty random 400 m 2 plots were allocated in each fragment to survey plant population structures, number of stumps, cattle feces, burnt logs, and canopy openness. Soil cover by life forms was estimated in 1 m 2 sub-plots. Lianas were abundant in intermediately logged fragments and invasive herbs in the <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> fragment. Cattle avoided dense herbaceous strata, such as liana tangles. Cavanillesia arborea, Eugenia dysenterica and Swartzia multijuga trees occurred at very low densities in all the fragments and their seedlings were practically absent, which might endanger their future populations in these fragments. Myracrodruon urundeuva, Tabebuia impetiginosa and Astronium fraxinifolium, the most logged species, had high density of seedlings in all the fragments. However, the highest density of saplings and juvenile individuals occurred in the <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> fragment...|$|R

Altogether, 15 bryophyte species and 74 lichen species were found. Releves were classified using cluster analysis. In well-preserved forests, communities dominated by bryophytes and close to the climax associations Antitrichietum californicae and Leptodontetum smithii are present, together with elements of the Lobarion pulmonariae. Lichen communities of the Xanthorion parietinae (Physcietum adscendentis, Parmelietum acetabulae and Ramalinetum fastigiatae) are dominant in the <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> conditions, rarely accompanied by elements of the Leucodontetum schiroides. In closed coppice and young woodland a community dominated by Neckera complanata, Metzgeria furcata, Frullania dilatata, Phlyctis argena and Physconia venusta is present, probably close to the Antitrichietum curtipendulae. In mature forests of Q. pubescens and open coppices of Q. ilex, a similar community is also present, though richer in lichen species, and with Frullania dilatata as the only dominant livewort. Widespread temperate species are <b>most</b> frequent in <b>disturbed</b> conditions, while suboceanic species are more common in well-preserved and closed woodland.

500|$|Polygon's Russ Pitts {{found the}} game a {{frustrating}} exercise, his experience {{determined by the}} arbitrary quality of player designed houses, and further obstructed by the harsh consequences of failure. [...] Pitts felt the game valued its message over the player's time and yet found the message hard to take seriously; he would describe the game as the <b>most</b> <b>disturbing</b> he had ever played. Keza MacDonald, in her review at IGN, shared these frustrations, finding that tackling player-constructed houses made the game over-reliant on trial and error. She also {{found it hard to}} empathize with the small, pixelated characters, leading her to believe that the game failed in [...] "communicating much of a message". Nick Capozzoli of GameSpot also gave the game a largely negative review, criticising the nihilistic feel, and saying that it did not bring out the emotions it was aimed to.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of popular}} demand and {{favorable}} reception of Deadly Alliance, {{the number of}} finishing moves, known as Fatalities, increased to two per character.

The Hara-Kiri moves were added to allow the losers to perform a finishing move as well, creating a race between both players. The Death Traps, meant to be introduced in the previous game, were added to give the combat more strategy as well as to give more chances to players to win a fight if they are at a disadvantage. The game was originally meant to have other new finishing moves, such as tortures and falling cliffs similar to Fatalities.|$|E

Writing for Allrovi, Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four stars out of five. Television Without Pity's Daniel J. Blau felt that the episode showed series composer Angelo Badalamenti to have limited range, repeating several similar musical cues throughout. He also considered Eric Da Re's performance as Leo Johnson to be unconvincing, finding it difficult to believe that the character was as feared and menacing as was implied.

40|$|Locally {{disturbed}} flow {{has been}} suggested to play a (modulating) role in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation, but no longitudinal studies have been performed yet due to (a. o.) a lack of human data prior to AAA formation. In this study we made use of recent advances in small animal imaging technology in order to set up entirely mouse-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the abdominal aorta in an established ApoE 2 / 2 mouse model of AAA formation, combining (i) in vivo contrast-enhanced micro-CT scans (geometrical model) and (ii) in vivo high-frequency ultrasound scans (boundary conditions). Resulting areas of disturbed flow at baseline were compared to areas of AAA at end-stage. Qualitative results showed that AAA dimension is maximal {{in areas that are}} situated proximal to those areas that experience <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> flow in three out of four S developing an AAA. Although further quantitative analysis did not reveal any obvious relationship between areas that experience <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> flow and the end-stage AAA dimensions, we cannot exclude that hemodynamics {{play a role in the}} initial phases of AAA formation. Due to its mouse-specific and in vivo nature, the presented methodology can be used in future research to link detailed and animal-specific (baseline) hemodynamics to (end-stage) arterial disease in longitudinal studies in mice...|$|R
40|$|The storm time {{evolution}} of equatorially mirroring H+ ions {{in the inner}} magnetosphere has been statistically examined by {{using data from the}} Polar satellite. We focused on two energy ranges of H+ observed by Polar; 31 – 80 keV and 125 – 173 keV, which are referred to as low- and high-energy components, respectively. The following two phases were defined; the developing phase (pre-storm time to near the <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> time) and the declining phase (near the <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> time to post-storm time), which is 3 days before (after) the equatorial crossing of Polar during the storm time. We obtained the following results: (1) Low-energy H+ tends to increase during the developing, and to decrease during the declining at all magnetic local times (MLTs) except for the pre-noon sector. (2) The low-energy H+ is anti-correlated with the magnetic field, probably indicating that the low-energy H+ reduces the equatorial magnetic field due to a diamagnetic effect. (3) High-energy H+ tends to increase on the dayside during the declining phase. (4) The high-energy H+ is poorly correlated with the magnetic field. High-energy H+ behaves significantly different from the low-energy H+, and that some process other than betatron acceleration, diffusion and substorm-associated injection could have been responsible for the variation of the high-energy H+...|$|R
