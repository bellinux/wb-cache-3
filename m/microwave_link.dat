25|$|The program debuted on ABC-TV on January 22, 1955, but {{the first}} 14 {{national}} telecasts were staged at KOMU-TV in Columbia, Missouri because network television transmission capability from Springfield was not available. Columbia had a microwave transmitter, however, for ABC coverage of University of Missouri football games. After AT installed a <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> in Springfield to transmit to Kansas City (which could feed to the network via Chicago), and modifications {{were made to the}} Jewell (including extending the stage and adding a control room), the program returned to the theater with the first broadcast April 30.

40|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>links</b> in {{commercial}} cellular communication networks hold a promise for areal rainfall monitoring and could complement rainfall estimates from ground-based weather radars, rain gauges, and satellites.

Moreover, the documented, modular, and user-friendly code (a package in the scripting language "R") is made available, including a 2 -day data set of approximately 2600 commercial <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> from the Netherlands.

50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1980s the former {{telecommunication}} office at of Rottweil installed two directional antennas on Lember Tower for the realization of a passive repeater <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> between the communications building in Rottweil and the trunk exchange, situated at station road in Gosheim. This <b>microwave</b> <b>link,</b> which {{would not have been possible}} on direct way, served as addition to the existing telephone interwirings.

50|$|When {{the station}} first opened, the {{transmitter}} at Rowville {{was connected to}} the Frankston studios via a <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> which had been purchased second-hand from the MMBW (Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works). It was surplus equipment recovered from the construction site of the Upper Yarra Dam. The <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> was licensed to be operated as a 'backup link' should the mandatory PMG (now Telstra) landline fail, but the quality of the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> was far superior to the landline and was used as the primary link between the two sites. The two transmitters were (at the time) state-of-the-art RCA AM solid-state stereo transmitters and were connected to a directional antenna array which focused the signal in a south easterly direction roughly covering the Mornington Peninsula.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{microwave}} communication {{networks have}} been shown to be valuable tools for rainfall monitoring, based on the well-known Power-Law which relates rain-rate to attenuation in microwave frequencies. However, once precipitation other than pure rain exists (e. g., snow), the Power-Law relation is no longer accurate. In this paper we propose a model which relates the induced attenuation to rain, snow, and sleet. Based on this model we propose estimating the total accumulated precipitation, regardless of the precipitation type, using measurements from multiple <b>microwave</b> <b>links.</b> Our technique takes advantage of the commercial communication networks, need for redundancy, which dictates the use of multiple <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> at the same area. We show that by using measurements from at least three <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> better estimation of the total accumulated precipitation fall can be provided, when rain, snow, sleet, or a mixture of them coexists. To demonstrate the proposed approach, it has been applied on actual <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> attenuation measurements, which were provided by a cellular carrier. The estimation results were compared with Rain-Gauges and disdrometer measurements and show very good agreement and improved accuracy...|$|R
