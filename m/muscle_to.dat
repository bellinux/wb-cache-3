5|$|Hypertonia – Hypertonia {{is marked}} by an {{abnormal}} increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to {{the central nervous system}} (e.g. cerebral palsy).|$|E
5|$|The {{muscular system}} has been {{similarly}} modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> flex the knee, a different <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified {{to contribute to the}} action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.|$|E
5|$|The normal rhythmical heart beat, called sinus rhythm, is {{established}} by the sinoatrial node, the heart's pacemaker. Here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart, causing the heart <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> contract.|$|E
5000|$|Botox {{therapy is}} used to paralyze the calf <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> reduce the {{opposition}} of the <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> stretching the Achilles tendon, usually together with serial casting or splinting.|$|R
50|$|A recent {{trend in}} {{bodybuilding}} is to inject synthol into <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> create larger bulges, or injecting PMMA into <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> shape them. Use of PMMA <b>to</b> shape <b>muscles</b> is prohibited in the United States.|$|R

5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|If {{not treated}} carefully, {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, subcutaneous tissue and <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> separate from healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes {{down to the}} bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|The infrahyoid muscles lie {{in front}} of the gland and the sternocleidomastoid <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> the side. Behind the outer wings of the thyroid lie the two carotid arteries. The trachea, laryngx, lower pharynx and {{esophagus}} all lie behind the thyroid. In this region, the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery pass next to or in the ligament.|$|E
50|$|Kinesiological {{stretching}} is used <b>to</b> train particular <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> attain motion {{beyond the}} normal range. Generally {{there are various}} limiting factors for different <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> attain a range of motion beyond the normal range, and these limiting factors are known as passive limiting factors. Kinesiological stretching eliminates these passive limiting factors.|$|R

5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves {{control all}} intrinsic {{muscles of the}} larynx except for the cricothyroid muscle. These muscles act to open, close, and adjust the tension of the vocal cords, and include the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> open the vocal cords. The nerves supply muscles {{on the same side}} of the body, with the exception of the interarytenoid muscle, which is innervated from both sides.|$|E
5|$|Stacy Warner is {{a fictional}} {{recurring}} character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company's medical drama House. She {{was in a}} relationship with Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing his quadriceps <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> become necrotic. Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with acute intermittent porphyria, and so he has to remain at the hospital for close monitoring. Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.|$|E

25|$|Arterial {{muscle tone}} – forces {{arterial}} wall <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> relax, increasing blood flow, especially in microarteries; decrease of insulin reduces flow by allowing these muscles to contract.|$|E

25|$|Acetylcholine in the serum exerts {{a direct}} effect on {{vascular}} tone by binding to muscarinic receptors present on vascular endothelium. These cells respond by increasing production of nitric oxide, which signals the surrounding smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> relax, leading to vasodilation.|$|E

25|$|When the sacral dorsal {{roots are}} cut in {{experimental}} animals or interrupted by {{diseases of the}} dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans, all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished. The bladder becomes distended, thin-walled, and hypotonic, {{but there are some}} contractions because of the intrinsic response of the smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> stretch.|$|E
25|$|In a pennate muscle, as a {{consequence}} of their arrangement, fibers are shorter than they would be if they ran {{from one end of the}} <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> the other. This implies that each fiber is composed of a smaller number N of sarcomeres in series. Moreover, the larger is the pennation angle, the shorter are the fibers.|$|E
25|$|As a β2 agonist, {{salbutamol}} {{also has}} use in obstetrics. Intravenous salbutamol {{can be used}} as a tocolytic to relax the uterine smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> delay premature labor. While preferred over agents such as atosiban and ritodrine, its role has largely been replaced by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, which is more effective, better tolerated, and administered orally.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled. One possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> initiate its contraction. Another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center, which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter.|$|E
25|$|Piperazine is a flaccid paralyzing {{agent that}} blocks the {{response}} of Ascaris <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> acetylcholine, which immobilizes the worm. It prevents migration when treatment is accomplished with weak drugs such as thiabendazole. If used by itself, it causes the worm to be passed out in the feces and may be used when worms have caused blockage of the intestine or the biliary duct.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the {{deregulated}} Conrail had the <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> {{implement the}} route reorganization and productivity improvements that the Penn Central had unsuccessfully tried to implement during 1968 to 1970. Many miles of old Pennsylvania and New York Central track were abandoned to adjacent landowners or rail trail use. The {{stock of the}} subsequently-profitable Conrail was refloated on Wall Street in 1987, and the company operated as an independent, private-sector railroad from 1987 to 1999.|$|E
