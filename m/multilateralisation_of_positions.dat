40|$|The {{securitization}} {{of environmental}} issues and the consequences this holds for the surveillants and the surveilled is the central focus of this article. The last decennia securitization of social conflicts has grown exponentially, even in less obvious domains. One {{of the issues that}} has gone through a securitization process is the environment. For many issues securitization of social conflicts goes together with: a criminalization of these conflicts which implies also an enlargement of repressive intervention; a <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> actors that are given responsibility to take care of security with a responsabilization of non-security actors for security issues and a socially unequal elaboration of security infrastructure. This chapter explores whether the securitization of environmental conflicts reflects the same characteristics as the securitization of urban social conflicts. Based on this analysis we discuss whether securitization is the right way to address environmental harm...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{has since}} 2003 carried out six {{military}} operations.   This thesis seeks {{to determine the}} circumstances under which the EU will, or will not, undertake military operations.   It does so through the study of two main cases of EU military operations: the case when an operation was planned in the Lebanon war 2006 but did not occur, and the positive case of EUFOR RD Congo that same year which did occur. Three additional cases are presented. An analytical tool built on the techniques of defence planning and concepts derived from the scholarly literature is applied to the cases for the purpose of identifying the main driving and inhibiting factors behind the operations. The functional  theme of the use of force and the organizational theme <b>of</b> the <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> intervention serve as the main scholarly concepts.   The interaction between the intervener and the local actors, as well as between political and resource factors, is introduced in order to create an integrated framework for the analysis of the dynamics at play in the EU’s use of force. The limitations to the "jus bellum" tradition is noted in the analysis of the EU´s operations that have situated themselves in a low-to-middle bandwidth in terms of interests and risks at stake. Among the findings, the growing importance of local actors in shaping the room for the EU´s deployment of military force stands out, as do resource constraints, in the EU´s case primarily in the form of its limited command and control structures but also through the overstretch of the global pool of expeditionary forces felt around 2006.  As seen from the organizational perspective, the EU´s first military operations can best be understood {{in the context of the}} increasing role of regional security providers in an unofficial division of labour with regard to the <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> intervention.

40|$|In {{spite of}} Italy's {{extraordinary}} ratio {{of foreign aid}} channelled through the European Union and its support for a common European approach to international development promoted by the European Commission, combined with significant Europeanisation pressures since the early 2000 s, the ‘impact of Europe’ on Italy's development policy has been rather limited. Examining the issues of {{quantity and quality of}} aid between 2002 and 2014, and the process that led to the adoption of a new development law in 2014, this paper seeks to explain why Europe matters so little in the evolution of Italy's development policy. The central argument is that Italy's propensity to Europeanise its development policy depends on two key factors: domestic politics, in particular the different agendas of governing party coalitions; and the <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> aid, specifically the set of perverse effects it generates on the bilateral component of development policy, irrespective of changing governing coalitions...|$|R
40|$|The Hungarian Revolution {{is often}} {{analysed}} {{in a national}} context or from the angle of Hungarian-Soviet relations. From this perspective, the Eastern European satellites seem mere puppets and the Soviet bloc a monolith. Archival evidence nevertheless shows that the Kremlin actually attempted {{to build a new}} kind of international relations after Stalin’s death in 1953, in which the Eastern European leaders would gain more scope for manoeuvre. This attempt at liberalisation even facilitated the uprisings in Hungary in 1956. Avoiding a teleological approach to the Hungarian Revolution, this article argues that the Soviet invasion was neither inevitable, nor wholly unilateral. Khrushchev even sought to legitimise the invasion in bilateral and multilateral consultations. There was a mutual interest in sacrificing Hungary’s sovereignty to safeguard the communist monopoly on power. This <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> Soviet bloc security is an important explanatory factor in an analysis of the Revolution and its repercussions in Eastern Europe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explain how {{different}} forms of international trade institutions affect domestic coalitions. Negotiated trade policy instruments create incentives for sector-wide interest representation, while judicial instruments elicit interest aggregation on a more product-specific, intra-sectoral level. The reason is that reciprocity in trade negotiations calls for package deals, which in turn foster sector-wide coalitions, whereas judicialisation {{in the form of}} case-for-case administrative procedures de-links issues, which elicits interest representation on the level of intra-sectoral trade associations. In contrast to existing explanations, these propositions can account for coalition patterns during both the GATT 1947, which consisted of a series of trade negotiation Rounds, and the WTO (1995 -), which combines the reciprocity of negotiations with a <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> judicial trade policy instruments such as Anti-Dumping, Market Access investigations, and international trade Dispute Settlement. Comprehensive databases provide evidence about the predominantly intra-sectoral trade associations that lodge complaints with judicial instruments, while other sources reveal how sector-wide peak associations organise during negotiation Rounds...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the extent}} to which e-commerce provisions in existing RTAs can be multilateralised. E-commerce has been recognised as an important engine for growth and development, yet WTO negotiations in this area have yielded very little progress so far. Against the backdrop of WTO stalemate, an increasing number of RTAs adopted specific provisions and rules for e-commerce. While these provisions increase the tradability of e-commerce, they also risk the creation of an e-commerce spaghetti bowl that will undermine the prospects for future WTO consensus in this area. This study considers two broad approaches for <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> RTA provisions. First, it suggests bottom-up multilateralisation extending RTAs e-commerce undertakings and provisions to a larger number of trading partners. Second, it proposes top-down multilateralisation which can advance e-commerce provisions, commitments and common learning at the WTO level. Both approaches to multilateralisation emphasise the importance of common definitions, rule-making and extension of bilateral liberalisation undertakings. The study highlights that despite the proliferation of e-commerce provisions in RTAs, many commonalities exist thus increasing the possibility of multilateral convergence.

The <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> analysis and development strategies proposed by the Bret ton Woods institutions has major political implications for aid policies. Based on an analysis of the Canadian experience, this article raises concerns that Canada might abandon its ability to achieve coherence among its various policy instruments at the bilateral level and, as well, that Canada might abdicate responsibility for its own development and aid policies. In such a context, the existence of an autonomous specialised bilateral agency such as the Canadian International Development Agency, СIDА, represents a valuable institutional means which provides space and hence safeguards for debates, analysis and policies which are unlikely to emerge from any other institution.

40|$|This report {{examines}} services schedules of commitments in 56 {{regional trade}} agreements (RTAs) where an OECD {{country is a}} party. The preferential content of RTAs is assessed through an analysis of market access and national treatment commitments {{at the level of}} the 155 sub-sectors of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Sectoral Classification List. Partial commitments are broken down according to nine categories of non-conforming measures. The report confirms that on average RTAs in services go beyond GATS with commitments in about 72 % of sub-sectors, among which 42 % correspond to preferential bindings (GATS-plus commitments). In addition, the report provides an overview of rules of origin for services providers and MFN clauses in services chapters in order to see whether commitments granted might be extended to non-parties to minimise discrimination among foreign services suppliers. Despite the heterogeneity found in schedules of commitments, there is a certain degree of commonality in new and improved commitments that suggests that multilateralising RTAs is achievable. The <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> services commitments would however imply a more symmetric and systematic liberalisation than what is seen in the schedules of RTAs. In the end, this is a matter of political will and negotiations. services, market access, RTA, GATS, MFN, free trade agreements, multilateralisation, preferential trade agreements, commitments, national treatment, rules of origin, regional trade agreements...|$|R
40|$|Even {{a year or}} two ago, {{observers}} {{could have}} been relatively sanguine about the boom of interest in free trade agreements (FTAs). Progress was much slower than people originally expected, and negotiations seemed to drag on without agreement being reached. That situation has now changed. The large economies – not just the United States but also China, Japan and South Korea – are pursuing FTAs. Motivations apparently include their contribution to domestic and international political targets, the mobilisation of reform and dealing with new types of impediments in order to intensify trade flows in the region. ASEAN members are also actively involved but there are doubts about ASEAN’s capacity to reach a consensus on trade policy issues. While its members might hope otherwise, a hub-and-spoke outcome in which ASEAN members make up the spokes, and not the hub, is a plausible scenario, and one of the worst in terms of a regional trading regime. We therefore argue the case for the application of a new set of principles to provide a framework for risk management, including progress in the World Trade Organization (WTO) on liberalisation, new WTO rules on regional agreements, higher levels of transparency, and more work on other forms of agreement to facilitate trade. Overall, <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> preferential tariff reductions should be the main benchmark in any new set of principles for risk management in the tactic of trading with favourites. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold war {{has brought}} with it the {{emergence}} of the new international security environment. State actors can no longer calculate their national interests as they did it before. Thus, it seems sensible to explore the question of how security is being organised in the post-Cold War era. In addition to a significant change {{in the structure of the}} international system, a new security concern has emerged. That is, as a result of the termination of two superpowers rivalry between the US and the former USSR, there has been an important change in global nuclear proliferation arena. For example, nuclear proliferation challenge which comes from „suspect states‟ such as Libya and North Korea has become a key issue in relation to nuclear proliferation. The North Korean nuclear crisis has gone through very different historical phases between 2001 and 2008. The first phase of the North Korean nuclear crisis saw the bilateral confrontation between the US and North Korea. The second phase demonstrated the <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> the North Korean nuclear issue through China‟s proactive engagement in the nuclear issue. The third phase could be distinguished by the United Nations‟ involvement in dealing with the North Korean case. Each phase of the North Korean nuclear crisis has revealed its unique characteristics regarding the notion of international security. Each phase has seen the operation of different security models: the first phase can be interpreted from the perspective of a hegemonic power structure; the second phase might be understood as the operation of a concert of powers; the third phase can be relevant to the notion of collective security. To sum up, the North Korean case can be regarded as a good example which describes how security is being organised in the post-Cold War era. In conclusion, it seems difficult to consider that security in the post Cold War era can be organised through a single way. Rather, it seems reasonable to take into account the mixture of divergent security models when managing security issues in the post-Cold War era.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Britain’s {{role in the}} Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Based on multi-archival {{research and}} interviews with key diplomats, it presents the first in-depth study of Britain’s involvement in the negotiations {{leading up to the}} Helsinki Final Act of 1 August 1975. It draws on Marc Trachtenberg’s notion of the ‘constructed peace’, and Alexander Wendt’s concept of ‘cultures of anarchy’ to elucidate how the rapprochement process at once stabilised and transformed the East-West conflict. This forms the theoretical framework of the thesis. The thesis revises the interpretation of détente as a status quo project driven by the imperatives of ‘Realpolitik’. Rather, different conceptions of stability and change challenged each other during the Helsinki talks. British diplomacy and the Final Act to which it contributed in fact linked the consolidation of the status quo to an ultimately transformative agenda that was infused with liberal ideas such as human rights. Realpolitik blended with Moralpolitik. To develop this argument, the thesis’ narrative first assesses Britain’s role {{in the early days of}} détente politics in the 1950 s and 1960 s. It then traces Britain’s role in the three main phases of the Helsinki process: the transition from bilateral to multilateral détente (1970 - 1972); preliminary talks (1972 - 1973); official negotiations (1973 - 1975). The British were defensive détente sceptics at the beginning of this process, but became ambitious and positive contributors over the course of the talks. The thesis thus argues that London played a significant part in the CSCE. British foreign policymakers were initially architects of the Cold War, but then early and active proponents of détente until the mid- 1960 s, when their continental partners adopted a more proactive approach. London was to return to the forefront of détente diplomacy when the CSCE process got under way. Its involvement in the CSCE also marked an important step in Britain’s own transformation into a European middle power. The <b>multilateralisation</b> <b>of</b> détente coincided with Britain’s integration into the European Community, providing a propitious environment in which London’s negotiators acted with determination and skill, thus reasserting their country’s influence despite its continuing relative decline.
