40|$|Three-dimensional finite-element thermal-stress {{models are}} applied to predict temperature, {{distortion}} and residual stress in a continuous casting mold for steel slabs. The model predictions of temperature, distortion during operation, and residual distorted mold shape match plant observations. During operation, the copper faces bend towards the steel, with a maximum outward distortion {{on the order of}} 1 mm, found just above the center of the wide faces. Distortion during operation increases with increasing mold temperature, increasing strand width, and decreasing water jacket rigidity. <b>Mold</b> <b>clamping</b> forces, bolt prestress, friction, and ferrostatic pressure have little effect on this behavior. Constraint generated by the temperature gradients and the sides of the bolt holes in the steel water jackets generate stresses and creep in the copper hot face during operation. This leads to permanent distortion and residual stress after cooling to ambient. Residual stress and distortion increase with repeated thermal cycling over a campaign, higher temperatures, smaller water-jacket bolt holes, non-uniform water slot depth, and higher clamping forces. Increased residual distortion requires increased remachining, which reduces mold life. Increased residual stress increases the probability of a catastrophic crack failure. 1...|$|R

40|$|As an {{energy-intensive}} process, in injection molding, energy cost {{is one of}} {{the major}} cost components. The energy expenditure during molding can be divided into two forms: thermal and mechanical energy, although both are initially transferred from electrical energy. The former is mainly the energy consumed for heating the barrel, while the latter can be further partitioned as energy related to mechanical motions such as injection and <b>mold</b> <b>clamping,</b> and thermal relevant mechanical energy such as plastication. The energy saving problem has been addressed by many researchers from the equipment modification angle, for example, improving pump and motor efficiency. Different from that, this dissertation, from a system operation viewpoint, attempts to develop an energy-efficient control system. Energy over-consumption is mainly related to the overheating of melt, therefore the thermal related variables, including barrel temperatures, screw rotation speed and back pressure, are major variables concerned in this design. Proper controls and settings of these machine variables is the key to energy-efficient operation. In the previous research, the control and setting of these variables are usually considered separately, despite strong interactions existing among them. In this thesis, the energy problem is analyzed systematically first, and then control methods for these variables are developed. Afterwards, melt temperature, a key process variable, is studied to develop a faster process stabilization control strategy. Finally, an integrated setting approach for these key variables is proposed leading to an energy-efficient operation of the process...|$|R
40|$|Resin Transfer Molding is a {{technique}} used to make composite materials. Reinforcement material is placed in half of the mold and {{the second half of}} the <b>mold</b> <b>clamped</b> over the top. The reinforcement material can be pre-pressed into the mold shape; this is known as "preform". Resin materials are machine-mixed prior to being injected under pressure into the mold cavity. Complete wetting of the reinforcement material is achieved by either a pinch off device or application of vacuum to draw the resin through the cavity. Once the mold cavity is filled, the resin inlet is closed and the laminate allowed to cure. The current problem starts when it comes to making a fully homogeneous semi cured throughout the composite; this is because the machine operates under a limited design and control. One of the things to be improved is the monitoring of the gradient of the temperature, and this can be done by making a few changes in the position of each thermocouple. Another thing to consider is to make a complete change in the control of the machine, that is, changing the hardware and software. The changes in the machine will require different experiments in order to study the performance of the system, thus, observation will be a key parameter during the development of the project, considering that controlling the temperature takes a lot of time in order to establish a pattern. Finally, the main idea will be to compare the performance of the current system with the new one, taking into account the final product, the time of the process, the money investment, among other things...|$|R

50|$|The {{gravity process}} begins by {{preheating}} the mold to 150-200 °C (300-400 °F) {{to ease the}} flow and reduce thermal damage to the casting. The mold cavity is then coated with a refractory material or a mold wash, which prevents the casting from sticking to the mold and prolongs the mold life. Any sand or metal cores are then installed and the <b>mold</b> is <b>clamped</b> shut. Molten metal is then poured into the mold. Soon after solidification the mold is opened and the casting removed to reduce chances of hot tears. The process is then started all over again, but preheating is not required because {{the heat from the}} previous casting is adequate and the refractory coating should last several castings. Because this process is usually carried out on large production run work-pieces automated equipment is used to coat the mold, pour the metal, and remove the casting.|$|R

AM experts seem to agree that tooling is a large, namely untapped market. Deloitte University Press estimated that in 2012 alone, the AM Tooling market $1.2 Billion.

40|$|Quality {{inspection}} of ultra precise mold inserts is conducted outside the manufacturing machine by using phase-shifting interferometers (PSI). Reworking or a local correction of form deviations is difficult, because the mold inserts {{have to be}} repositioned in the machine tool. A promising way to overcome this problem is the machine-integration of the measurement system. But due to the sensitivity of PSI methods a direct integration into the machine tool is possible only to a limited extend. A FFT-based measurement technique was developed with reduced sensitivity. It was applied in a injection molding machine for form testing of a <b>clamped</b> <b>mold</b> insert with 80 degrees C process temperature...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{in large}} precast {{concrete}} enterprises, the management over precast concrete component has been chaotic. Most enterprises take labor-intensive manual input method, which is time consuming and laborious, and error-prone. Some other slightly better enterprises choose to manage through bar-code or printing serial number manually. However, on one hand, {{this is also}} labor-intensive, on the other hand, this method is limited by external environment, making the serial number blur or even lost, and also causes a big problem on production traceability and quality accountability. Therefore, to realize the enterprise’s own rapid development and cater {{to the needs of}} the time, to achieve the automated production management has been a big problem for a modern enterprise. In order to solve the problem, inefficiency in production and traceability of the products, this thesis try to introduce RFID technology into the production of PHC tubular pile. By designing a production management system of precast concrete components, the enterprise will achieve the control of the entire production process, and realize the informatization of enterprise production management. RFID technology has been widely used in many fields like entrance control, charge management, logistics and so on. RFID technology will adopt passive RFID tag, which is waterproof, shockproof, anti-interference, so it’s suitable for the actual working environment. The tag will be bound to the precast component steel cage (the structure of the PHC tubular pile before the concrete placement), which means each PHC tubular pile will have a unique ID number. Then according to the production procedure, the precast component will be performed with a series of actions, put the steel cage into the <b>mold,</b> <b>mold</b> <b>clamping,</b> pouring concrete (feed), stretching, centrifugalizing, maintenance, mold removing, welding splice. In every session of the procedure, the information of the precast components can be read through a RFID reader. Using a portable smart device connected to the database, the user can check, inquire and management the production information conveniently. Also, the system can trace the production parameter and the person in charge, realize the traceability of the information. This system can overcome the disadvantages in precast components manufacturers, like inefficiency, error-prone, time consuming, labor intensity, low information relevance and so on. This system can help to improve the production management efficiency, and can produce a good economic and social benefits, so, this system has a certain practical value...|$|R

50|$|This {{process is}} related to vacuum bag molding {{in exactly the same}} way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a {{flexible}} male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the <b>mold</b> is then <b>clamped</b> to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite helmets due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet bag moulding machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.|$|R
50|$|Benchtop {{injectors}} {{are smaller}} and simpler than their larger commercial counterparts because {{they rely on}} the operator to manually inject melted polymer into the mold and remove the finished part from the mold. Production injectors automatically inject melted polymer at a prescribed rate into the mold, cool the mold to rapidly solidify the polymer, then eject the part from the mold once it's cool. The two halves of the mold must be pressed together with great force to prevent a defect in the part where the two halves meet, and the nozzle of the injector must be pressed tightly against the inlet port of the mold to prevent the escape of melted polymer and again a defect in the finished part. In a benchtop injector this is done manually by clamping or bolting the <b>mold</b> together and <b>clamping</b> the complete <b>mold</b> into the injector. In a production injector this is accomplished with hydraulic or pneumatic actuators, which increase {{the cost of the}} machine but dramatically reduce the labor required to produce a finished part.|$|R

The <b>clamping</b> force and the clamping speed of clamping unit not only effect on the quality of molding products, but also determine the cyclic number. The large force amplification and large stroke ratio can reduce energy consumption and improve the productive efficiency. In this article, force amplification ratio and stroke ratio were used as the optimization goals. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm was used as the optimization method. The optimization result was better than the original design. So this article provides a reference for the same or similar product’s optimization.

40|$|The PCPro {{method is}} {{characterized}} by the application of CAD/CAM, CNC-milling and casting technologies. This article describes the PCPro method by means of the fabrication of sample parts. In addition, the manufacturing of a prototype machine is presented. The PCPro method entails several advantages compared to common process chains such as Rapid Prototyping/vacuum casting. In this chapter the main benefits and limitations of the process will be outlined. Quality: PCPro is a simple casting procedure without any gate system. Mold turbulence and thus air bubbles cannot occur. The wear of the lower mold half can be easily repaired by shifting the NC-programs and overhauling this tool half. It is not necessary to build a new tool. Complicated features (for example threads) that cannot be made by casting procedures are easy to manufacture using the integrated CNC-machining. Precision: Finish machining takes place after curing and shrinkage of the casting materials. Thus, the parts have a higher precision compared to other casting technologies. Narrow tolerances can be obtained. The complete machining is done in one set-up, therefore no inaccuracy results between inner and outer contour. There is no misalignment between lower and upper <b>mold.</b> Additional <b>clamping</b> for finish machining is avoided. Time and costs savings: The second mold half exists only in the form of NC-programs. A physical master model is not necessary, thus the costly and time-consuming model-making process with expensive Rapid Prototyping equipment and materials is avoided. The expense for mold making is reduced, because only one mold half is manufactured. Construction of the second tool half including gating system, risers, mold venting and mold parting is avoided. 3 D-CAD effort is reduced. Construction of mold release slopes and fillets for inner contours are not necessary. Preparation of the mold is reduced, since only one half has to be cleaned. Cycle time depends on the number of molds used in the machining system. Automation of the entire process chain by the usage of exchangeable modules or transfer lines makes this process capable of Rapid Manufacturing. Integration in existing machining centers is possible...|$|R
40|$|Background We have {{developed}} a novel head-holding device for behaving non-human primates that affords stability suitable for reliable chronic electrophysiological recording experiments. The device is completely non-invasive, and thus avoids the risk of infection and other complications that can occur {{with the use of}} conventional, surgically implanted head-fixation devices. New method The device consists of a novel non-invasive head <b>mold</b> and bar <b>clamp</b> holder, and is customized to the shape of each monkey's head. The head-holding device that we introduce, combined with our recording system and reflection-based eye-tracking system, allows for chronic behavioral experiments and single-electrode or multi-electrode recording, as well as manipulation of brain activity. Results and comparison with existing methods With electrodes implanted chronically in multiple brain regions, we could record neural activity from cortical and subcortical structures with stability equal to that recorded with conventional head-post fixation. Consistent with the non-invasive nature of the device, we could record neural signals {{for more than two years}} with a single implant. Importantly, the monkeys were able to hold stable eye fixation positions while held by this device, demonstrating the possibility of analyzing eye movement data with only the gentle restraint imposed by the non-invasive head-holding device. Conclusions We show that the head-holding device introduced here can be extended to the head holding of smaller animals, and note that it could readily be adapted for magnetic resonance brain imaging over extended periods of time.
