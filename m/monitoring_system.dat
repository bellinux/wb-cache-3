40|$|SIP协议是由IETF提出的应用层信令协议，用来建立、修改和终止多方参与的多媒体会话进程，具有很好的可扩展性、灵活性、互操作性和可重用性。在视频监控系统中使用SIP协议实现呼叫处理过程，可以使视频监控系统具有更好的兼容性和扩展能力。本文以网络视频监控系统为背景，介绍了视频监控系统的功能划分和SIP协议的相关内容，提出了基于SIP协议的视频监控呼叫处理方案，设计了支持节点注册、呼叫处理、用户认证、状态查询等功能的呼叫处理子系统，并且在视频监控系统中实现。为了满足运营级视频监控系统对呼叫处理能力的高要求，设计并实现了基于分布式系统的高性能SIP服务器，在集群上完成对高性能SIP服务器的性能测试。本文工作的主要贡献是：在视频监控系统中设计并实现了基于SIP协议的呼叫处理子系统；在分布式系统上设计并实现了具有高呼叫处理能力的高性能SIP服务器。SIP is an application-layer control {{protocol}} proposed by IETF. It's used to establish, modify, and terminate muti-party multimedia sessions and has strong extensibility, flexibility, interoperability and reusability. It can get better compatibility and expansion capability that implement the call process with SIP in video <b>monitor</b> <b>system.</b> In this thesis, {{based on the}} demand for network video <b>monitor</b> <b>system,</b> we introduce the video <b>monitor</b> <b>system's</b> functional division and the SIP protocol, propose a scheme for call process in video <b>monitor</b> <b>system</b> based on SIP protocol, design and implement the call process subsystem supporting node register, call process, user authentication and status enquiry in video <b>monitor</b> <b>system.</b> In {{order to meet the}} requirements of the carrier-class video <b>monitor</b> <b>system,</b> we design and implement the high-performance SIP server on the distributed system, and test the SIP server on the cluster.

5|$|Eruptions on Mauna Loa {{are almost}} always preceded and {{accompanied}} by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring {{of which was the}} primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day <b>monitoring</b> <b>system</b> was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by {{more than a year of}} seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver <b>Monitoring</b> <b>System</b> to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E

5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver <b>Monitoring</b> <b>System</b> with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{avionics}} software {{incorporates the}} concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling {{the use of the}} numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage <b>monitoring</b> <b>system,</b> and automatic test equipment. The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS of serial production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.|$|E

5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's <b>monitoring</b> <b>system</b> functioned properly.|$|E
