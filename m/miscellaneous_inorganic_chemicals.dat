40|$|A {{kraft paper}} mill {{produces}} a steady waste stream of reacted <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and organic wastes called black liquor. Both monetary and environmental concerns {{demand that the}} <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and the organic byproducts are recycled. Currently recovery boilers are the standard means to recycle the <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and organic waste to produce a large fraction of the energy needed to operate a large pulp and paper mill. Energy {{research has indicated that}} gasification of the black liquor would recover the <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and meet a mills heat / steam requirements. In addition, gasification would produce fuel gas that can then be used to generate electricity that will meet or exceed the needs of a pulp and paper mill. Unfortunately, regeneration of the <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> produces a highly corrosive Na 2 CO 3 and Na 2 S smelt. This smelt melts at about 700 °C and can produce an environment conducive to stress corrosion cracking in the composite tubes lining the recovery boiler, or can cause rapid degradation of the refractory liners in gasifiers. Numerous studies have addressed various aspects of these problems. This paper summarizes the contributions of X-ray and neutron diffraction to the materials issues in recovery boilers and black liquor gasifiers. Figure 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the <b>chemical</b> description of <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemical</b> terminologies in two Korean High School Science textbooks, ‘Science’ which is licensed, and ‘Science for the New Generation’, which is the pre version one, at 10 th grade level. A list of chemically relevant words was identified and compared in terms of the level and description of each textbook by counting the number of appearance and representation of technical vocabularies. Preliminary results included that; (1) the average appearance number of <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> is 150 chemical descriptions of 40 <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> in the licensed ‘Science’, while 358 of 90 in the pre version one; (2) out of top ten <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> in order, top three compounds are hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride, and finally (3) there are some inconsistent terminologies in the texts, which might cause students to have difficult reading when these chemical descriptions were compared through Johnstone's triangle model of chemical meaning in detail...|$|R
