5|$|HTC One {{variants}} were unveiled {{for release}} in China in late-April 2013 with HTC TD101 802w for China Unicom, HTC TD101 802d for China Telecom, and HTC TD101 802t for China Mobile. Unlike the international version, the Chinese models feature a removable back cover, exposing a <b>microSD</b> slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Complementing this feature, {{a special edition}} with a Wang Leehom-autographed back cover was also released. HTC stated that {{it was able to}} include an SD card slot in the Chinese model because its radio hardware did not take up as much internal space as that of the international models.|$|E
5|$|The device {{incorporates}} a 1.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 600, an ARMv7 SoC, with 2GB of RAM. The chip provides support for LTE networks {{where they are}} available. Most HTC One models come with either 32 or 64 GB of internal, non-expandable storage—unlike the international model, the Chinese and Japanese models include a <b>microSD</b> slot and a removable back cover. Its internal components are arranged in a pyramid-like layout similar to the HTC Butterfly and HTC Windows Phone 8X with larger components (such as the screen and battery) positioned towards the front and smaller components (such as the motherboard) positioned towards the back. This internal layout also allows the device to have a curved backing.|$|E
25|$|A new {{generation}} of memory card formats, including RS-MMC, miniSD and <b>microSD,</b> feature extremely small form factors.

30|$|The {{remaining}} part of {{this paper}} is structured as follows. “micROS Architecture” section introduces the architecture of <b>micROS.</b> “Autonomous behavior and collective intelligence” section presents the mechanisms to implement autonomous behavior and collective intelligence. “Morphable and adaptive mechanism” section describes the morphable and adaptive design of <b>micROS.</b> Practical application of <b>micROS</b> in a RoboCup system (soccer robots), as well as the corresponding experimental results, is presented in “Application and experiments” section. Finally, “Conclusion and future work” section concludes the paper and discusses about potential future work.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} achieve human–machine collaborated {{analysis}} and orientation, different kinds of cognition models are supported in <b>micROS.</b> Techniques, like data mining, will be utilized by <b>micROS</b> to extract collective implicit knowledge.

25|$|The <b>microSD</b> {{removable}} miniaturized Secure Digital {{flash memory}} cards were originally named T-Flash or TF, abbreviations of TransFlash. TransFlash and <b>microSD</b> cards are functionally identical allowing either {{to operate in}} devices made for the other. SanDisk had conceived <b>microSD</b> when its chief technology officer and the chief technology officer of Motorola concluded that current memory cards were too large for mobile phones. The card was originally called T-Flash, but just before product launch, T-Mobile sent a cease-and-desist order to SanDisk claiming that T-Mobile owned the trademark on T-(anything), and the name was changed to TransFlash. At CTIA Wireless 2005, the SDA announced the small <b>microSD</b> form factor along with SDHC secure digital high capacity formatting in excess of 2GB with a minimum sustained read and write speed of 17.6Mbit/s. SanDisk induced the SDA to administer the <b>microSD</b> standard. The SDA approved the final <b>microSD</b> specification on July 13, 2005. Initially, <b>microSD</b> cards were available in capacities of 32, 64, and 128MB.|$|E
25|$|The <b>microSD</b> card {{has helped}} propel the {{smartphone}} market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom. Due to their compact size, <b>microSD</b> cards {{are used in}} many different applications in a large variety of markets. Action cameras, such as the GoPRO's Hero and cameras in drones, frequently use <b>microSD</b> cards.|$|E
25|$|The Motorola E398 was {{the first}} mobile phone to contain a TransFlash (later <b>microSD)</b> card. A few years later, their {{competitors}} began using <b>microSD</b> cards.|$|E

50|$|<b>MICROS</b> Systems' {{point of}} sale (POS) {{software}} and hardware {{is used in the}} restaurant industry and primarily includes touchscreen computers for the serving staff to place orders, which are then sent to kitchen and bar printers for preparation. The back-office software, MyMicros (now named Oracle Hospitality Reporting and Analytics), contains different types of reports for total sales, total menu items sold for certain time periods, and more. <b>MICROS</b> provides different POS products for different restaurant sizes and styles, including products for single-entity restaurants, major chain restaurants (with centralized reporting), and multiple-restaurant properties. All <b>MICROS</b> products have the ability to interface to other systems such as inventory control systems and hotel Property Management Systems. MICROS-Fidelio is a division of <b>MICROS</b> that offers several software products for hotels including OPERA Property Management System, ORS Central Reservations System (now named Oracle Hospitality OPERA Room Reservations), and Opera Sales & Catering.|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} skin conductance continuously {{from the}} sole of a foot in babies of different conceptional ages before, during, and for 10 minutes after a 'heel prick' carried out for routine blood sampling. We studied 82 healthy babies whose gestational and postnatal ages ranged from 25 - 42 weeks, and 1 - 73 days. The median skin conductance level (preheel prick) in babies of 40 - 43 weeks' conceptional age was 0. 6 <b>microS</b> (microsiemens) and differed significantly between awake babies (1. 2 <b>microS)</b> {{and those who were}} asleep (0. 5 <b>microS).</b> In contrast babies less than 40 weeks had a significantly lower median skin conductive level (0. 3 <b>microS)</b> which was identical in awake and asleep babies. In response to the heel prick all babies became aroused and skin conductance rose sharply and immediately in 21 out of 22 (95 %) babies 40 - 43 weeks' conceptional age, and in seven out of 23 (30 %) babies 36 - 39 weeks. The median rise at one minute in babies of 40 - 43 weeks was significantly higher than those 36 - 39 weeks (2. 7 <b>microS</b> compared with 0. 5 <b>microS).</b> No babies less than 36 weeks had a change in their skin conductance after the heel prick. These results are consistent with the notion that 'emotional sweating' is a function of maturity and does not develop until 36 weeks' conceptional age...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} fuse {{perception}} information {{according to the}} different robot roles, <b>micROS</b> first defines the roles for each individual robot. <b>micROS</b> allows different ways for defining roles. For example, as defined in Webster’s dictionary, a role can be a function or a part performed function in a particular operation or process. We can also consider the role as a function that one or more robots perform during the execution of a cooperative task as in [16]. <b>micROS</b> assigns roles to collective robots according to the actual perception capabilities of their sensors in specific tasks. Furthermore, perception information from all roles is fused to achieve collective perception.|$|R
