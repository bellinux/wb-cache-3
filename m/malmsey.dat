25|$|<b>Malmsey</b> (also {{known as}} Malvasia or Malvazia) has its {{fermentation}} halted when its sugars are between 3.5 and 6.5° Baumé (63-117 g/l). This style of wine is characterised by its dark colour, rich texture, and coffee-caramel flavours. Like other Madeiras {{made from the}} noble grape varieties, the Malvasia grape used in <b>Malmsey</b> production has naturally high levels of acidity in the wine, which balances with the high sugar levels so the wines do not taste cloyingly sweet.|$|E
25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic. Also, {{although}} it is sweet, even the <b>Malmsey</b> has a dry finish, so it does not get killed by the sweetness of desserts and pudding. This makes it the most versatile of all dessert wines. Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by {{the sweetness of the}} dessert, this does not happen with Madeira.|$|E
25|$|Both Monemvasia and Candia have lent {{their names}} to modern grape varieties. In Greece, there is a variety known as Monemvasia, evidently named after the port, though now grown {{primarily}} in the Cyclades. In western Europe, a common variety of Malvasia is known as Malvasia Bianca di Candia (white <b>malmsey</b> of Crete), from its reputed origin in that area. The Monemvasia grape was long thought to be ancestral to the western European Malvasia varieties, but recent DNA analysis does not suggest a close relationship between Monemvasia and any Malvasia varieties. DNA analysis does, however, suggest that the Athiri wine grape (a variety widely planted throughout Greece) is ancestral to Malvasia.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, {{the names}} [...] "Malvasia" [...] and [...] "Malmsey" [...] {{occurred}} interchangeably. , however, [...] "Malvasia" [...] generally refers to unfortified white table or dessert wines produced from this grape, while [...] "Malmsey" [...] {{refers to a}} sweet variety of Madeira wine, though this is also sometimes called [...] "Malvasia" [...] or [...] "Malvazia". Further confusion results {{from the fact that}}, in the recent past, the term [...] "Malmsey" [...] referred to any very sweet Madeira wine, regardless of the grape variety involved. This resulted from the devastation of Madeiran vineyards by phylloxera in the late 19th century, which greatly reduced the production of Malvasia and other [...] "noble grape" [...] varieties on Madeira for the next century. As a result, most non-vintage-dated [...] "Malmsey" [...] was made from the widely grown Tinta Negra Mole or even from fox grape varieties. This changed when Portugal entered the European Union (EU) in 1986; EU regulations required that any wine bearing the name [...] "Malmsey" [...] contain at least 85% Malvasia grapes. Even further confusion results from the fact that vintage-dated <b>Malmseys</b> are often labeled [...] "Malvasia" [...] or [...] "Malvazia", probably because the relatively rare vintage Malvasias were always made with Malvasia grapes even when most non-vintage [...] "Malmsey" [...] came from lesser varieties. Some companies occasionally use the name [...] "Malvasia" [...] or [...] "Malvazia" [...] for non-vintage Madeiras, especially those primarily marketed to Portuguese-speaking countries.|$|R

25|$|Following the Fall of the Roman Empire, {{appreciation}} for aged wine was virtually non-existent. Most of the wines produced in northern Europe were light bodied, pale {{in color and}} with low alcohol. These wines {{did not have much}} aging potential and barely lasted a few months before they rapidly deteriorated into vinegar. The older a wine got the cheaper its price became as merchants eagerly sought to rid themselves of aging wine. By the 16th century, sweeter and more alcoholic wines (like <b>Malmsey</b> and Sack) were being made in the Mediterranean and gaining attention for their aging ability. Similarly, Riesling from Germany with its combination of acidity and sugar were also demonstrating their ability to age. In the 17th century, two innovations occurred that radically changed the wine industry's view on aging. One was the development of the cork and bottle which allowed producers to package and store wine in a virtually air-tight environment. The second was the growing popularity of fortifying wines such as Port, Madeira and Sherries. The added alcohol was found to act as a preservative, allowing wines to survive long sea voyages to England, The Americas and the East Indies. The English, in particular, were growing in their appreciation of aged wines like Port and Claret from Bordeaux. Demand for matured wines had a pronounced effect on the wine trade. For producers, the cost and space of storing barrels or bottles of wine was prohibitive so a merchant class evolved with warehouses and the finances to facilitate aging wines {{for a longer period of}} time. In regions like Bordeaux, Oporto and Burgundy, this situation dramatically increased the balance of power towards the merchant classes.|$|E

The ever-present candied ginger, coriander, aniseed and other spices were referred to as épices de chambre ("parlor spices") and were taken as digestibles {{at the end of}} a meal to [...] "close" [...] the stomach. Like their Muslim counterparts in Al-Andalus|Spain]], the Arab conquerors of Sicily introduced a wide variety of new sweets and desserts that eventually found their way to the rest of Europe. Just like Montpellier, Sicily was once famous for its comfits, nougat candy (torrone, or turrón in Spanish) and almond clusters (confetti). From the south, the Arabs also brought the art of ice cream making that produced sorbet and several examples of sweet cakes and pastries; cassata alla Siciliana (from Arabic qas'ah, the term for the terra cotta bowl with which it was shaped), made from marzipan, sponge cake and sweetened ricotta and cannoli alla Siciliana, originally cappelli di turchi ("Turkish hats"), fried, chilled pastry tubes with a sweet cheese filling.|$|E
2500|$|English {{historical}} tradition associates <b>Malmsey</b> {{wine with}} the death of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, brother of King Edward IV of England.

2500|$|Most ampelographers {{believe that}} the Malvasia family of grapes are of ancient origin, most likely {{originating}} in Crete, Greece. The name [...] "Malvasia" [...] is generally thought to derive from Monemvasia, a medieval and early Renaissance Byzantine fortress {{on the coast of}} Laconia, known in Italian as [...] "Malvasia"; this port would have acted as a trading center for wine produced in the eastern Peloponnese and perhaps in some of the Cyclades. During the Middle Ages, the Venetians became so prolific in the trading of [...] "Malvasia wine" [...] that merchant wine shops in Venice were known as malvasie. A competing theory holds that the name is derived from the district of Malevizi, near the city of Heraklion (known to the Venetians as Candia) on Crete. In any case, <b>Malmsey</b> was one of the three major wines exported from Greece in medieval times. (For other examples, see Rumney wine and Cretan wine). It is alleged that when Edward IV of England convicted his brother, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence of high treason, his private execution consisted of being [...] "drowned in a butt of <b>Malmsey</b> wine," [...] which is dramatized in Shakespeare's Richard III.|$|E
2500|$|When the Bourbon rule {{collapsed}} in 1860 a British man named James Stevenson bought {{the northern part}} of the island, built a villa, reopened the local mines and planted vineyards for grapes that would later be used to make <b>Malmsey</b> wine. [...] Stevenson lived on Vulcano until the last major eruption on the island, in 1888. [...] The eruption lasted the better part of two years, by which time Stevenson had sold all of his property to the local populace, and never returned to the island. [...] The villa is still intact.|$|E
2500|$|Malvasia ( [...] , {{also known}} as Malvazia) {{is a group of}} wine grape {{varieties}} grown historically in the Mediterranean region, Balearic islands, Canary Islands and the island of Madeira, but now grown in many of the winemaking regions of the world. In the past, the names Malvasia, Malvazia, and <b>Malmsey</b> have been used interchangeably for Malvasia-based wines; however, in modern oenology, [...] "Malmsey" [...] is now used almost exclusively for a sweet variety of Madeira wine made from the Malvasia grape. Grape varieties in this family include Malvasia bianca, Malvasia di Schierano, Malvasia negra, , Malvasia nera di Brindisi {{and a number of other}} varieties.|$|E
2500|$|However the Sherry in Falstaff's day was not {{as strong}} as it is today because it had not yet become a {{fortified}} wine. The natural strength of the wine rarely topped 16% ABV and the wines were closer in character to the modern day wine still being made in Montilla. At this point, the makers of Sherry were still experimenting with the various grapes available including Torrontes, <b>Malmsey</b> and some minor but growing plantings of the modern day Sherry grapes of Palomino, Pedro Ximénez, and Muscatel. Towards the turn of the 17th century, Sherry makers were starting to discover that the white chalk albariza soil of the area produced some of the freshest wine and there was some understanding of the strange but powerful effect of the yeast flor. They began calling these wines Fino or [...] "fine wine" [...] because of the delicate light style that was produced.|$|E
