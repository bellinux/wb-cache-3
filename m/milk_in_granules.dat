40|$|Neuronal {{apoptosis}} plays {{a critical}} role in the normal development of the mammalian brain and is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurologic disorders. However, the intracellular mechanisms underlying apoptosis of neurons remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we characterized a cell-cycle-based mechanism by which neuronal activity deprivation induces apoptosis of postmitotic neurons. Activity deprivation, but not growth factor withdrawal, was found to induce Cdc 2 expression and consequent Cdc 2 -mediated apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neurons of the developing rat cerebellum. We found that activity deprivation induces cdc 2 transcription in neurons via an E 2 F-binding element (EBE) within the cdc 2 promoter. The transcription factor E 2 F 1 that is expressed <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neurons was found in DNA binding assays to bind to the EBE of the cdc 2 gene. In chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, endogenous E 2 F 1 forms a complex with the promoter of the endogenous cdc 2 gene <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neurons, indicating that endogenous E 2 F 1 is poised to activate transcription of the endogenous cdc 2 gene in neurons. Consistent with this conclusion, a dominant interfering form of E 2 F, when expressed <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neurons, blocked activity deprivation-induced cdc 2 transcription. In other experiments, we found that the expression of E 2 F 1 <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neurons induces Cdc 2 expression and promotes neuronal apoptosis via the activation of Cdc 2. Remarkably, in contrast to inducing the E 2 F-mediated expression and activation of Cdc 2 <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neurons, activity deprivation fails to stimulate the expression of E 2 F-target genes that trigger DNA synthesis and replication. Together, our findings define a novel apoptotic mechanism whereby E 2 F selectively couples an activity deprivation-induced signal to cdc 2 transcription in the absence of stimulating DNA synthesis and thus culminating in Cdc 2 -mediated apoptosis of postmitotic neurons...|$|R
40|$|Starch {{structure}} strongly influences starch physicochemical properties, {{determining the}} end uses of starch in various applications. To produce starches with novel structure and exploit {{the mechanism of}} starch granule formation, an (engineered) 4, 6 -α-glucanotransferase (GTFB) from Lactobacillus reuteri 121 was introduced into two potato genetic backgrounds: amylose-containing line Kardal and amylose-free mutant amf. The resulting starches showed severe changes <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> morphology regardless of genetic backgrounds. Modified starches from amf background exhibited a significant increase <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> size and starch phosphate content relative to the control, while starches from Kardal background displayed a higher digestibility, but did not show changes <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> size and phosphate content.

40|$|Ubiquitin {{signaling}} mechanisms play fundamental {{roles in}} the cell-intrinsic control of neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity in the brain. However, whereas specific ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in key steps of neural circuit assembly, the roles of ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) {{in the establishment of}} neuronal connectivity have remained unexplored. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of USP family members <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neuron morphogenesis and positioning in the rodent cerebellum. We identify a set of 32 USPs that are expressed <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neurons. We also characterize the subcellular localization of the 32 USPs <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neurons using a library of expression plasmids encoding GFP-USPs. In RNAi screens of the 32 neuronally expressed USPs, we uncover novel functions for USP 1, USP 4, and USP 20 in the morphogenesis of granule neuron dendrites and axons and we identify a requirement for USP 30 and USP 33 <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> neuron migration <b>in</b> the rodent cerebellar cortex in vivo. These studies reveal that specific USPs with distinct spatial localizations harbor key functions in the control of neuronal morphogenesis and positioning in the mammalian cerebellum, with important implications for our understanding of the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that govern neural circuit assembly in the brain...|$|R

40|$|When {{pituitary}} lactotroph <b>granules</b> undergo exocytosis <b>in</b> {{the presence}} of FM 1 - 43, their cores absorb dye and fluoresce brightly. We report that different granules fluoresce with different colors, despite being stained with a single fluorescent dye; emission spectra from individual granules show up to a 25 nm difference between the greenest and reddest granules. We found a correlation between granule color and average fluorescence intensity, suggesting that granule color depends upon dye concentration. We confirmed this in two ways: by increasing FM dye concentration <b>in</b> <b>granules,</b> which red shifted granule color, and by partially photobleaching the FM dye <b>in</b> <b>granules,</b> which green shifted granule color. Increasing stimulation intensity (by increasing KCl concentration) increased the proportion of red granules, indicating that granules exocytosing during intense stimulation bound more dye. This, perhaps, reflects differences <b>in</b> <b>granule</b> core maturation and condensation <b>in</b> which mature <b>granules</b> with condensed cores bind more FM dye but require more intense stimulation to be released.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{experiments}} was twofold: (1) {{to determine if the}} location of chemical reactions within starch granules can be controlled by altering reaction conditions; and (2) to investigate channels <b>in</b> starch <b>granules</b> and determine the implication of their presence. To address the first objective, a rapid, valid method was needed to locate granular reaction sites. A reflection confocal laser scanning microscopy (R-CLSM) method was developed to locate anionic substituents within granules. The method was applied to two types of derivatizing groups: mono- and distarch phosphate ester groups and the 2 -hydroxy- 3 -sulfonylpropyl ether group, the latter being an anionic analog of the hydroxypropyl group. The method revealed native anionic sites <b>in</b> <b>granules,</b> presumably due to proteins, ionic lipids, and/or phosphate ester groups. To determine the degree to which location of reaction sites is a function of reaction conditions, a constant level of an anionic propylene oxide analog was used and temperature, pH, and swelling inhibiting salt type and concentration was varied during reactions with waxy maize starch granules. Reaction sites were located utilizing the RCLSM method. Results indicated that reaction conditions controlled both uniformity of reaction on a granule basis and molar substitution (MS) levels (<b>in</b> <b>granules</b> reacted with propylene oxide under similar conditions). ^ Channels were discovered for the first time <b>in</b> transitory starch <b>granules</b> of potato, sweet potato, horse chestnut, oak, and hickory leaves. Channels were not observed <b>in</b> storage starch <b>granules</b> <b>in</b> those same plants, except for starch granules from hickory nuts.
