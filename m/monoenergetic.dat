25|$|Medical grade linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use <b>monoenergetic</b> electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E

50|$|The Radiological Research Accelerator Facility (RARAF) is a National Resource Center {{supported}} by the National Institutes of Health. It {{is based on a}} Van de Graaff accelerator and provides well characterized radiations for experiments in radiobiology and radiological physics. Experiments are conducted by members of the CRR, visiting scientists and outside users. A new facility to provide neutrons with energies in the range of 10 to 100 keV is being developed.Available beams include: Single particle microbeam to irradiate individual cell nuclei with single ions; <b>monoenergetic</b> neutrons with mean energies from 0.2 to 15 MeV; charged particles (protons, deuterons, helium-3 and helium-4 ions) with defined LET in the track-segment mode; molecular ions providing pairs of particles of known average separation; 50 to 250 kVp X-rays from standard x-ray machines; and <b>monoenergetic</b> X-rays with energies between 0.3 and 3.0 keV produced by proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE).|$|E
50|$|Further {{refinements}} {{are usually}} necessary to differentiate the neutron {{signal from the}} effects of other types of radiation. Since the energy of a thermal neutron is relatively low, charged particle reactions are discrete (i.e., essentially <b>monoenergetic</b> and lie within a narrow bandwidth of energies) while other reactions such as gamma reactions will span a broad energy range, it is possible to discriminate among the sources.|$|E
5000|$|Annihilation {{radiation}} is not <b>monoenergetic,</b> unlike gamma rays produced by radioactive decay. The production mechanism of annihilation radiation introduces Doppler broadening. [...] The annihilation peak produced in a gamma spectrum by annihilation radiation therefore {{has a higher}} full width at half maximum (FWHM) than other gamma rays in spectrum. The difference is more apparent with high resolution detectors, such as Germanium detectors, than with low resolution detectors such as Sodium iodide detectors.|$|E

Rossi {{in the late}} 1960s [...] Their aim {{was to provide a}} source of <b>monoenergetic</b> neutrons designed and operated specifically for studies in radiation biology, dosimetry, and microdosimetry. The facility was built around the 4 MV Van de Graaff particle accelerator that originally served as the injector for the Cosmotron, a 2 GeV accelerator operated at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

50|$|Given {{the laws}} of {{individual}} collision events (in the form of absorption coefficients and scattering kernels/phase functions) the problem of linear transport theory is then to determine {{the result of a}} large number of random collisions governed by these laws. This involves computing exact or approximate solutions of the transport equation, and there are various forms of the transport equation that have been studied. Common varieties include steady-state vs time-dependent, scalar vs vector (the latter including polarization), and <b>monoenergetic</b> vs multi-energy (multi-group).|$|E
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} is exploited in particle therapy of cancer, to concentrate {{the effect of}} light ion beams on the tumor being treated while minimizing {{the effect on the}} surrounding healthy tissue. The blue curve in the figure ("modified proton beam") shows how the originally <b>monoenergetic</b> proton beam with the sharp peak is widened by increasing the range of energies, so that a larger tumor volume can be treated. This can be achieved by using variable thickness attenuators like spinning wedges.|$|E
50|$|Finally, if {{the data}} to be {{analyzed}} comes from electron capture events, a simulated gamma response matrix must be built using the simulated responses to individual <b>monoenergetic</b> γ rays of several energies. This matrix contains the information related to the dependence of the response function on the detector. To include also the dependence on the level scheme that is being measured, the above-mentioned matrix should be convoluted with the branching ratio matrix calculated previously. In this way, the final global response R is obtained.|$|E
50|$|Linear energy {{transfer}} is best defined for <b>monoenergetic</b> ions, i.e. protons, alpha particles, and the heavier nuclei called HZE ions found in cosmic rays or produced by particle accelerators. These particles cause frequent direct ionizations within a narrow diameter around a relatively straight track, thus approximating continuous deceleration. As they slow down, the changing particle cross section modifies their LET, generally increasing it to a Bragg peak just before achieving thermal equilibrium with the absorber, i.e., {{before the end}} of range. At equilibrium, the incident particle essentially comes to rest or is absorbed, at which point LET is undefined.|$|E
50|$|When {{they first}} {{fall into the}} center of the fusor, the ions will all have the same energy, but the {{velocity}} distribution will rapidly approach a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This would occur through simple Coulomb collisions in a matter of milliseconds, but beam-beam instabilities will occur orders of magnitude faster still. In comparison, any given ion will require a few minutes before undergoing a fusion reaction, so that the <b>monoenergetic</b> picture of the fusor, at least for power production, is not appropriate. One consequence of the thermalization is that some of the ions will gain enough energy to leave the potential well, taking their energy with them, without having undergone a fusion reaction.|$|E
50|$|In NDP, {{a thermal}} or cold neutron beam {{passes through a}} {{material}} and interacts with isotopes that emit <b>monoenergetic</b> charged particles upon neutron absorption; either a proton or an alpha, and a recoil nucleus. Since the charged particles are equally likely to be emitted in any direction, reaction kinematics are straightforward. Because low-energy neutrons are used, {{there is no significant}} momentum transfer from the neutron beam to the substrate, and the analysis is practically non-destructive. As charged particles move towards the surface, they are rapidly slowed down, primarily by interacting with the electrons of the substrate. The amount of energy loss {{is directly related to the}} thickness penetrated by the particle. The depth of the reaction site can be found by stopping power correlations.|$|E
5000|$|LET has {{therefore}} {{no meaning}} {{when applied to}} photons. However, many authors speak of [...] "gamma LET" [...] anyway, where they are actually referring to the LET of the secondary electrons, i.e., mainly Compton electrons, produced by the gamma radiation. [...] The secondary electrons will ionize far more atoms than the primary photon. This gamma LET has little relation to the attenuation rate of the beam, but it may have some correlation to the microscopic defects produced in the absorber. It {{must be noted that}} even a <b>monoenergetic</b> gamma beam will produce a spectrum of electrons, and each secondary electron will have a variable LET as it slows down, as discussed above. The [...] "gamma LET" [...] is therefore an average.|$|E
50|$|Experiments {{conducted}} in the 1970s also studied the phenomenon. These experiments revealed that although several explanations for why the LF were observed by astronauts have been proposed, {{there may be other}} causes as well. Charman et al. (1971) asked whether the LF were the result of single cosmic-ray nuclei entering the eye and directly exciting the eyes of the astronauts, as opposed to the result of Cherenkov radiation within the retina. The researchers had observers view a neutron beam, composed of either 3 or 14 MeV <b>monoenergetic</b> neutrons, in several orientations, relative to their heads. The composition of these beams ensured that particles generated in the eye were below 500 MeV, which was considered the Cherenkov threshold, thereby allowing the researchers to separate one cause of the LF from the other. Observers viewed the neutron beam after being completely dark-adapted.|$|E
50|$|The {{energy of}} the ions, {{as well as the}} ion species and the {{composition}} of the target determine the depth of penetration of the ions in the solid: A <b>monoenergetic</b> ion beam will generally have a broad depth distribution. The average penetration depth is called the range of the ions. Under typical circumstances ion ranges will be between 10 nanometers and 1 micrometer. Thus, ion implantation is especially useful in cases where the chemical or structural change is desired to be near the surface of the target. Ions gradually lose their energy as they travel through the solid, both from occasional collisions with target atoms (which cause abrupt energy transfers) and from a mild drag from overlap of electron orbitals, which is a continuous process. The loss of ion energy in the target is called stopping and can be simulated with the binary collision approximation method.|$|E
5000|$|Electron {{ionization}} {{was first}} described in 1918 by Canadian-American Physicist Sir Arthur J. Dempster {{in the article}} of [...] "A new method of positive ray analysis." [...] It was the first modern mass spectrometer and used positive rays to determine {{the ratio of the}} mass to charge of various constituents. In this method, the ion source used an electron beam directed at a solid surface. The anode was made cylindrical in shape using the metal which was to be studied. Subsequently it was heated by a concentric coil and then was bombarded with electrons. Using this method, the two isotopes of lithium and three isotopes of magnesium, with their atomic weights and relative proportions, were able to be determined. Since then this technique has been used with further modifications and developments. The use of a focused <b>monoenergetic</b> beam of electrons for ionization of gas phase atoms and molecules was developed by Bleakney in 1929.|$|E

40|$|We {{are using}} a beam port at the National Synchrotron Light Source {{facility}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory {{as a source of}} <b>monoenergetic</b> photons. The photon source is radiation from a bending magnet on the X-ray storage ring and provides a usable X-ray spectrum from 5 keV to over 50 keV. A tunable crystal monochromotor is used for energy selection. The beam is 79 mm wide and 0. 5 mm high. We imaged the ACR mammography phantom and a contrast-detail phantom using a phosphor plate as the unaging detector. Phantom images were obtained at 16, 18, 20 and 22 keV.

Chinese hamster V 79 cells were also used. Carbon-ion effectiveness for cell inactivation generally increased with LET for <b>monoenergetic</b> beams, {{with the largest}} gain in cell-killing obtained in the cells most radioresistant to X- or γ-rays.

40|$|Flux {{variations}} in quasars and BL Lac objects over a time scale {{of a day}} or less suggest an extremely high brightness temperature in these sources, which cannot be explained by conventional synchrotron theory. This work addresses the issue of extreme brightness temperature by applying synchrotron theory to unconventional electron distributions. We consider a scenario in which relativistic electrons are continuously injected into the emission region. In the first approximation, we assume the electrons are <b>monoenergetic</b> for simplicity. This approximation is insufficient when modelling the spectrum of S 5 ~ 0716 + 714, we therefore modified the electron injection spectrum to one which is a double power law in energy. This retains the low radio frequency spectral characteristics of <b>monoenergetic</b> electrons, which extends to higher frequencies as a power law. To complete {{the study of the}} intrinsic properties of synchrotron emission from <b>monoenergetic</b> electrons, we also examine their circular polarisation. We find that (1) electron distribution with low energy cut-off is able to generate high brightness temperature, and (2) the flat synchrotron spectrum produced by such distribution is in good agreement with that of the observed, and (3) in contrast to a power-law distribution, circular polarisation of synchrotron emission from <b>monoenergetic</b> electrons does not change sign...|$|E
