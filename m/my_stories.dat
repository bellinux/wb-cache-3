The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which {{it seemed to me}} several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make <b>my</b> <b>stories</b> in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E

500|$|When Cisneros {{describes}} the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, {{the theme of}} place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, {{but also to the}} positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, {{or in the case of}} their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: [...] "Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and <b>my</b> <b>stories.</b> My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after." [...] An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for [...] "a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem." [...] She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead [...] "a site of poetic self-creation." [...] One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay [...] "A Room of One's Own", that [...] "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction," [...] or put another way, [...] "economic security" [...] and personal liberty are necessary for [...] "artistic production." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} her Arena Tour 2003–2004, Hamasaki {{had grown}} {{dissatisfied}} with her position in Avex: she felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person. Along with her dissatisfaction over her last two studio albums (which she thought had been rushed), this led her to begin work on <b>My</b> <b>Story</b> (December 2004) early. In contrast with her previous albums, <b>My</b> <b>Story</b> had no set theme, nor did Hamasaki attempt to write [...] "something good" [...] or even [...] "something that would give people hope"; rather, she simply wrote freely and honestly. As a result, the album contained mostly autobiographical lyrics about her emotions and reminiscences of her career. She approached the composition of the music with the same freedom as the lyrics, with the album's notable rock overtones expressing her liking for rock music. She was so pleased with the result that she declared <b>My</b> <b>Story</b> the first album she felt satisfied with. <b>My</b> <b>Story</b> and its singles, [...] "Moments", [...] "Inspire", and [...] "Carols", all topped the weekly Oricon charts; moreover, with sales of over 1,100,000 units, <b>My</b> <b>Story</b> became Hamasaki's last million-selling studio album according to Oricon. From January to April 2005, Hamasaki held the nationwide <b>My</b> <b>Story</b> arena tour, her first album-based tour. Also in January, she began working with Lamoureux Orchestra to create <b>My</b> <b>Story</b> Classical, a classical version of My Story; the album served as an [...] "alter-ego" [...] of the mostly aggressive <b>My</b> <b>Story.</b> The orchestra also created a classical version of [...] "A Song Is Born", which was included on <b>My</b> <b>Story</b> Classical and which Hamasaki performed {{at the opening of the}} Expo 2005.|$|R

For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings—except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six Days' War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments.
