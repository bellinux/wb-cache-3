In October 2009, the Australian government was continuing {{to plan for}} a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory. However, there was opposition from indigenous people, the NT government, and wider NT community. In November 2009, about 100 anti-nuclear protesters assembled outside the Alice Springs parliamentary sittings, urging the Northern Territory Government not to approve a nearby uranium <b>mine</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many <b>mining</b> <b>sites</b> are {{remote and}} not {{connected}} to the grid. Electricity is typically generated with diesel generators. Due to high transportation cost and theft during transportation the cost for generating electricity is normally high. Renewable energy applications are becoming an alternative or amendment. Both solar and wind power plants can contribute in saving diesel costs at <b>mining</b> <b>sites.</b> Renewable energy applications have been built at <b>mining</b> <b>sites.</b>|$|R
40|$|Derelict mines pose {{potential}} risks to environmental health. Several {{factors such as}} soil structure, organic matter, and nutrient content are the greatly affected qualities in mined soils. Soil microbial communities are an important element for successful reclamation because of their major role in nutrient cycling, plant establishment, geochemical transformations, and soil formation. Yet, microorganisms generally remain an undervalued asset in <b>mined</b> <b>sites.</b> The microbial diversity in derelict <b>mine</b> <b>sites</b> consists of diverse species belonging to four key phyla: Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. The activity of plant symbiotic microorganisms including root-colonizing rhizobacteria and ectomycorrhizal fungi of existing vegetation in the <b>mined</b> <b>sites</b> is very high since most of these microbes are extremophiles. This review outlines the importance of microorganisms to soil health and the rehabilitation of derelict mines and how microbial activity and diversity can be exploited to better plan the soil rehabilitation. Besides highlighting the major breakthroughs {{in the application of}} microorganisms for <b>mined</b> <b>site</b> reclamation, we provide a critical view on plant-microbiome interactions to improve revegetation at the <b>mined</b> <b>sites.</b> Also, the need has been emphasized for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of adaptation and resistance of rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere microbes in abandoned <b>mine</b> <b>sites,</b> understanding their role in remediation, and subsequent harnessing of their potential to pave the way in future rehabilitation strategies for <b>mined</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

The presentation and discussion are oriented by the actions lines established by the 6 th environmental action programme...|$|R
5|$|To {{encourage}} tourism, the town's leaders sought National Historic Landmark {{status for}} Jerome; it was {{granted by the}} federal government in 1967. In 1962, the heirs of James Douglas donated the Douglas mansion, above the UVX <b>mine</b> <b>site,</b> to the State of Arizona, which used it to create Jerome State Historic Park. By sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the 21stcentury include art galleries, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants.|$|E

25|$|Although {{abandoned}} underground mines produce most of {{the acid}} mine drainage, some recently mined and reclaimed surface mines have produced ARD and have degraded local ground-water and surface-water resources. Acidic water produced at active mines must be neutralized to achieve pH 6-9 before discharge from a <b>mine</b> <b>site</b> to a stream is permitted.|$|E
25|$|The {{dismantling}} of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays {{will create a}} temporary community to service a <b>mine</b> <b>site,</b> building all the accommodation, shops and services required, and then remove them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings {{can be used to}} facilitate the process. A gold rush would often bring intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.|$|E
25|$|Although {{a mining}} and milling plant was {{constructed}} on the <b>mine</b> <b>site</b> before Beanland went into operation, {{there is no}} record of production. The entire plant was still in existence until at least the 1940s. It is now largely demolished; foundations, the 150horsepower boiler and part of the Ingersoll-Rand Imperial Type 10air compressor are all that remains of the plant. Much of the waste rock was dumped just northeast of the shaft near a small wetland.|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} {{concentrations of}} 226 Ra and 232 Th in Jos Tin mine tailings and its environment were measured using Hyper-pure Germanium detector (HPGe). Preset counting time of 30, 000 s {{was used for}} each sample to avoid statistical errors. Results showed the activities varied from one site to another. The activities of 226 Ra and 232 Th are {{much higher than the}} recommended average limit given by UNSCEAR in the <b>mining</b> <b>sites</b> and even at 500 m away from the <b>mining</b> <b>site.</b> At 1 Km away from the <b>mining</b> <b>site</b> the activity measured is within the limit for normal background. The ratio of activity of Thorium to Radium is greater by factor of 5 in all the samples in the <b>mining</b> <b>site</b> and 500 m away which should be about unity. The mean absorbed doses (1828. 66, 252. 08 and 171. 07 nGyh- 1) for Site 1, Site 2 and 500 m from <b>mining</b> <b>site</b> respectively in air are equally high compared with (51 nGyh- 1). Also, the estimated effective dose equivalents are much higher than the recommended limit except for 1 Km from the <b>mining</b> <b>site.</b> There is need to improve waste management practices in this industries in order not to expose those living and working in this environment to health hazards associated with these radionuclide...|$|R

25|$|Near Squamish is Britannia Beach, {{the former}} gold and copper mining town and port with some highway-based eateries and stores. Its name {{does not come}} {{directly}} from associations with Britain, but from the MV Britannia, the old Vancouver-Squamish steamer (A new MV Britannia built in 1983 is in use as a tourboat based in Coal Harbour, Vancouver). Today the mine mill site is the popular Britannia Mine Museum, with mine shaft tours, gold panning etc. The prominent multi-story mine building underwent a restoration with the replacement of hundreds of window panes. The former <b>mine</b> <b>site</b> is also frequently used as a shooting site {{for a variety of}} TV and movie productions, most notably the popular X-Files TV series.|$|E
25|$|Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. {{continues}} to expand its operations. Since December 2002, the companyâ€™s confirmed gold reserves have increased by 160% to 2,022,000 tons with an average grade of 0.46 ounces per ton containing a total of 927,000 ounces of gold. In 2003, the Company started a $21 million, 3-year exploration program targeted at adding 15,000,000 tons of ore to reserves and resources. Currently, over 500 personnel are directly or indirectly employed at the <b>mine</b> <b>site.</b> Based on todayâ€™s resources, the mine has a 12-15 year life span.

25|$|Mining robots are {{designed}} to solve {{a number of problems}} currently facing the mining industry, including skills shortages, improving productivity from declining ore grades, and achieving environmental targets. Due to the hazardous nature of mining, in particular underground mining, the prevalence of autonomous, semi-autonomous, and tele-operated robots has greatly increased in recent times. A number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains, trucks and loaders that will load material, transport it on the <b>mine</b> <b>site</b> to its destination, and unload without requiring human intervention. One of the world's largest mining corporations, Rio Tinto, has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world's largest, consisting of 150 autonomous Komatsu trucks, operating in Western Australia. Similarly, BHP has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world's largest, 21 autonomous Atlas Copco drills.|$|E
25|$|The {{centre of}} the {{township}} is on the northern side of the railway. Parts of this are now destroyed by the Gulf Developmental Road and farm tracks. The central tailings dump associated with the mines along the Golden Gate reef, also now covers much of the former Golden Gate Township. Evidence of township habitation {{is located at the}} southern end of the Golden Gate Consols <b>mine</b> <b>site.</b> No extant structures survive but the remains of dwellings are found throughout the re-growth savannah woodland. These include earth floors, some stone footings, vertical sections of corrugated iron walls (possibly 'rat walls') set into the ground, and associated scatters of broken bottle glass, bricks, stove remains, sheet iron, tins and domestic ceramics. There are also some minor surface workings in and around the township site. There are further signs of habitation on the southern side of railway, connecting with the Golden Gate Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|By late 1988 {{tensions}} {{over the}} mine {{had led to}} local violence. The government deployed the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) Mobile Squads and elements of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF). Although initially restricted to {{the area around the}} <b>mine</b> <b>site,</b> the conflict subsequently intensified. Both sides reported abuses against the native population during fighting between government forces and the rebels of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) and the conflict developed into a general separatist insurgency. The mine company closed the mine, and many non-Bouganvilleans left the island. Fighting continued for a year, during which widespread human rights violations were alleged to have occurred, including the burning of many villages. However, in early 1990 Papua New Guinea withdrew, leaving Bougainville in the control of the BRA. Despite agreeing to disarm and negotiate, Francis Ona, the leader of the BRA, unilaterally declared independence in May 1990.|$|E

40|$|Returning {{biodiversity}} of rehabilitated {{forest on}} a coal <b>mined</b> <b>site</b> at Tanjung Enim, South Sumatra. Biodiversitas 13 : 13 - 17. Restoring disturbed mined land is challenging since {{the outcomes of}} various rehabilitation procedures on <b>mined</b> <b>sites</b> in terms of vegetation structure, composition and ecological function are not presently understood, especially in the developing countries. This study examined the mechanism of biodiversity recruitment, especially on structural attributes of an undisturbed forest community and rehabilitated forests of different ages on sites disturbed by coal-mining operations at Tanjung Enim, South Sumatra. Un-mined forest was characterised by complex structural features including a dense stand of trees {{in a range of}} size classes, an almost closed canopy, and a shrubby understorey. In contrast, young <b>mined</b> <b>sites</b> were characterised by a low density of woody stems, a relatively open canopy and herbaceous ground cover. Soil characteristics of rehabilitated site were progressing towards the reference site. The marked differences in structural complexity between unmined and <b>mined</b> <b>sites</b> suggest that it willwill take very long time for the <b>mined</b> <b>sites</b> to recover into their original conditions. So, more restoration intervention will be needed to speed the recovery processes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} impacts of clay and gypsum mining on {{ecosystem}} structure and function using Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) in Segzi plain, Isfahan.
