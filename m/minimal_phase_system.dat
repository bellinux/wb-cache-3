It is suggested that the underlying mathematical problem states and solves the problem in a concise manner. This goes through the application of the Pfaff-Darboux Theorem and differential geometric tools. 1 Introduction In spite of more than 30 years research in biped walking [18], the control of such a robot remains still an open problem. The control of these systems rises a large set of new problems and questions. They require a careful analysis especially as stability is concerned. The problem of stability is of major importance for biped robots. Walking robots can have different structures and different problems of control [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Inverse {{problems}} (in {{context of}} the first kind equation) are often encountered in the modern technology of the microwave remote sensing. It is ground penetration radar, radiometric systems, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) etc. A priori knowledge of an equation kernel with sufficient accuracy is rarity for systems of modern microwave remote sensing. Often the kernel has often some a priory unknown parameters. The problems can be solved in classical adaptive technique (for example autofocusing algorithms). A more difficult situation arises in the case full a priori {{lack of knowledge about}} the kernel. If stochastic model of input process (signal) is accessible, then a solution of the problem is possible. Gaussian models of the stationary random input processes give to the opportunity of the solution only for non-coherence <b>systems</b> (<b>minimal</b> <b>phase</b> <b>systems).</b> For non-gaussian models the solution bases on the use of a multispectral technique (bispectral analysis). For SAR applications authors proposed [1] one more approach based on use of the non-stationary models of the input process and a convolution equation. In the paper the applications of the approach for a solution of the some problems of SAR systems including two-position and low-frequency spaceborne SAR data processing problem are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} an {{experimental}} testing {{for a new}} algorithm that determines an optimal controller’s coefficients for output variance reduction related to Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Systems. The algorithm features simplicity in calculation, generalization to <b>minimal</b> and non-minimal <b>phase</b> <b>systems,</b> and could be configured to achieve reference tracking as well as variance reduction after compromising with the output variance. An experiment of DCmotor velocity control demonstrates the application of this new algorithm in designing the controller.

40|$|The Gerzon-Craven noise shaping theorem {{states that}} the ideal {{information}} capacity of a sigma delta modulator design is achieved {{if and only if}} the noise transfer function (NTF) is <b>minimal</b> <b>phase.</b> In this paper, it is found that there is a trade-off between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the information capacity of the noise shaped channel. In order to verify this result, loop filters satisfying and not satisfying the <b>minimal</b> <b>phase</b> condition of the NTF are designed via semi-infinite programming (SIP) techniques and solved using dual parameterization. Numerical simulation results show that the design with a <b>minimal</b> <b>phase</b> NTF achieves near the ideal information capacity of the noise shaped channel, but the SNR is low. On the other hand, the design with a non-minimal phase NTF achieves a positive value of the information capacity of the noise shaped channel, but the SNR is high. Results are also provided which compare the SIP design technique with Butterworth and Chebyshev structures and ideal theoretical SDMs, and evaluate the performance in terms of SNR and a variety of information theoretic measures which capture noise shaping qualities...|$|R
