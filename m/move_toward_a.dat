25|$|The third Druk Gyalpo, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, was enthroned in 1952. Earlier he {{had married}} the European-educated cousin of the chogyal (king) of Sikkim and with her support made continual efforts to {{modernize}} his nation throughout his twenty-year reign. Among his first reforms was {{the establishment of the}} National Assembly — the Tshogdu — in 1953. Although the Druk Gyalpo could issue royal decrees and exercise veto power over resolutions passed by the National Assembly, its establishment was a major <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> constitutional monarchy.|$|E

In 1861, Tunisia enacted the first constitution in the Arab world, but a <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> modernizing republic was hampered by the poor economy and by political unrest. Loans made by foreigners to the government were becoming difficult to manage. In 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt; an international financial commission, with representatives from France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, took control over the economy.|$|E

25|$|Chemotaxis {{is defined}} as a passage of an {{organism}} toward or away from a chemical stimulus along a chemical concentration gradient. Certain organisms demonstrate chemotaxis when they <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> supply of nutrients. In D. discoideum, the amoeba secretes the signal, cAMP, out of the cell, attracting other amoebae to migrate toward the source. Every amoeba moves toward a central amoeba, the one dispensing the greatest amount of cAMP secretions. The secretion of the cAMP is then exhibited by all amoebae and is a call for them to begin aggregation. These chemical emissions and amoeba movement occur every six minutes. The amoebae move toward the concentration gradient for 60 seconds and stop until the next secretion is sent out. This behavior of individual cells tends to cause oscillations in a group of cells, and chemical waves of varying cAMP concentration propagate through the group in spirals.|$|E
25|$|Since Descartes's {{proposal}} of dualism, {{it became a}} general consensus that the mind had {{become a matter of}} philosophy and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness- that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> science of consciousness. Antonio Damasio and Gerald Edelman are two neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness. Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation {{play a critical role in}} high level cognition, and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation. In his research on this problem, Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms primary consciousness and secondary consciousness.|$|E

25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to figure out what to do about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E

500|$|The song {{became a}} hit and {{established}} Williams' recording career. On December 12, 1941, he recorded a second version titled [...] "Please Don't Go" [...] in Chicago for Bluebird, {{with a more}} modern arrangement and lyrics. Blues historian Gerard Herzhaft calls it [...] "the most exciting version", which Williams recorded using his trademark nine-string guitar. Accompanying him are Sonny Boy Williamson I on harmonica and Alfred Elkins on imitation bass (possibly a washtub bass). Since both songs appeared before recording industry publications began tracking such releases, it is unknown which version was more popular. In 1947, he recorded it for Columbia Records with Williamson and Ransom Knowling on bass and Judge Riley on drums. This version did not reach the Billboard Race Records chart, but represents a <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> more urban blues treatment of the song.|$|E

500|$|In The Kentucky Encyclopedia, Eastern Kentucky University {{professor}} Paul Blanchard {{writes that}} [...] "Many observers consider the governor's informal powers—those derived from tradition, custom, and precedent—as {{important as the}} formal powers." [...] Frequently the leaders of their political parties at the state level, Kentucky governors usually control the party's delegations to state and national party conventions. Though given few powers {{with regard to the}} legislature, Kentucky governors can exercise a great deal of influence over the General Assembly, often hand-selecting the leadership of both chambers. A <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> more independent legislature began {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century, particularly during the administration of Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. from 1979 to 1983. Brown was much less engaged in legislative affairs than his predecessors; he did not seek to influence the selection of the legislature's leadership, and he left on vacation during one of the two legislative sessions of his term. The trend toward a coequal legislature continued under the administrations of Brown's two immediate successors, Martha Layne Collins and Wallace Wilkinson, neither of whom was considered a strong executive.|$|E

500|$|Walras' law was {{introduced}} as a theoretical {{answer to the}} problem of determining the solutions in general equilibrium. [...] His notation is different from modern notation but can be constructed using more modern summation notation. [...] Walras assumed that in equilibrium, all money would be spent on all goods: every good would be sold at the market price for that good and every buyer would expend their last dollar on a basket of goods. [...] Starting from this assumption, Walras could then show that if there were n markets and n-1 markets cleared (reached equilibrium conditions) that the nth market would clear as well. [...] This is easiest to visualize with two markets (considered in most texts as a market for goods and a market for money). [...] If one of two markets has reached an equilibrium state, no additional goods (or conversely, money) can enter or exit the second market, so it must be in a state of equilibrium as well. [...] Walras used this statement to <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> proof of existence of solutions to general equilibrium but it is commonly used today to illustrate market clearing in money markets at the undergraduate level.|$|E
