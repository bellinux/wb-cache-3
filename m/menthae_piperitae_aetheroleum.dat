40|$|In {{the present}} work, we report {{the results of}} a spin {{trapping}} ESR study of four essential oils widely used for skin care products such as creams and bath salts. The studied essential oils are Rosmarini aetheroleum (rosemary), <b>Menthae</b> <b>piperitae</b> <b>aetheroleum</b> (mint), Lavandulae aetheroleum (lavender), and Thymi aetheroleum (thyme). Fenton reaction in the presence of ethanol was used to generate free radicals. The N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) was used as a spin trap. In the Fenton reaction, the rosemary oil had the lowest effect on radical adduct formation as compared to the reference Fenton system. Since essential oils are known to be lipid soluble, we also conducted studies of essential oils in Fenton reaction in the presence of lipids. Two model lipids were used, namely 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPPC). The obtained results suggested that in the presence of DOPC lipids, the •OH and PBN/•CHCH 3 (OH) radicals are formed in both phases, that is, water and lipids, and all the studied essential oils affected the Fenton reaction in a similar way. Whereas, in the DPPC system, the additional type of PBN/X (aN = 16. 1 G, aH = 2. 9 G) radical adduct was generated. DFT calculations of hyperfine splittings were performed at B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +G(d,p) /EPR-II level of theory for the set of c-centered PBN adducts in order to identify PBN/X radical...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita,</b> {{commonly}} known as peppermint originally came from Europe and the Middle East and its oil is commonly used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. Like many other free essential oils (EO), peppermint oil is believed to possess antimicrobial properties. However, the application of EO in food as an antimicrobial agent {{has yet to be}} established. This would require proper formulation of the EO for it to be viable in foods. This study aims to test the effects of both free <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> EO and <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> EO nanoparticles against Pseudomonas fluorescens and compare their inhibitory effects. We used nanoparticles of encapsulated <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> EO in a shell of fully hydrogenated soybean oil (FHSO) and expect that the inhibitory effects of these nanoparticles would be greater than that of the free EO due to the ability of the shell to protect the EO and control its dispersion. We observed for the presence of antibacterial properties using various methods such as well diffusion, disc diffusion, optical density measurements and plate counting of serial dilutions. We found that the best method that produced quantifiable results was to perform serial dilutions and plate count them after incubation.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Although {{antibiotics}} {{are used}} in conventional treatment of infectious diseases, a lot of unexpected side effects along with resistance to antibiotics appear. Salvia officinalis and <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> are plants found abundantly {{in most parts of}} Iran. In the present study, we extracted and identified the chemical compounds of the essential oils of Salvia officinalis and <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita.</b> Moreover, the anti-oxidative property, free radical scavenging capacity, and antimicrobial activities of the essential oils of these plants were studied. Materials & Methods: This study was conducted in the Biotechnology Department laboratories, Agricultural Faculty of Avicina University, Hamadan, Iran, in 2009. The aerial parts of Salvia officinalis and <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> were harvested in summer, when the plants were in their full blooming stage and dried in the shade. The essential oil of the aerial parts was extracted by hydro-distillation and was analyzed by capillary GC and GC/MS method. The micro-organisms employed in this study were: E. coli, S. aureus, S. enteritidis, L. monocytogenes. By employing disc diffusion and tube dilution methods, antimicrobial effects of the oils were studied. Antioxidative property, free radical scavenging capacity, and antimicrobial activities of the oils were also studied. Results: Chemical analysis of the extracts resulted in the identification of 28 and 37 compounds in the essential oils of Salvia officinalis and <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> respectively. The sensitivity of the bacteria to the oils in order of decreasing the sensitivity was L. monocytogenes, E. coli, S. aureus, and S. enteritidis. The antibacterial properties of the essential oil from <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> leaves were higher than the oil of Salvia officinalis leaves. Also inhibitions zones of microbial growth were not correlated with the microbicidal kinetics of the oils. Conclusion: This study showed that the herbal essences of Salvia officinalis and <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> are very active against E. coli, S. aureus, S. enteritidis and L. monocytogenes...|$|R

Survival and growth of Bacillus cereus, E. coli and S. aureus were studied. Twenty-six and fifteen compounds were identified in the essential oils of <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> and <b>Mentha</b> spicata, respectively. <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> contained major compounds of α-terpinene (19. 7 %), isomenthone (10. 3 %), trans carveol (14. 5 %), pipertitinone oxide (19. 3 %) and β-caryophyllene (7. 6 %). The major compounds of Mentha spicata were limonene (48 %), menthol (4. 7 %), piperitone (20. 27 %) and caryophyllene (7. 9 %). The essential oils have good or excellent antimicrobial activities against all microorganisms tested. Complete death time on exposure to <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> L. and <b>Mentha</b> spicata L. oils were (90, 15 and 10 min) and (45, 30 and 15 min) for B. cereus, E. coli and S. aureus, respectively.

Zataria multiflora was the most effective essential oil against the bacterium in all concentrations, followed by <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> and Carum carvi.

Probe consumption profiles were widely different, with neat induction times when FL is employed as target. Relative ORAC values of different herbal infusions depend upon the test molecule employed. Relative ORAC-PGR values follow the order: Rosa moschata > <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> > Tilia spp > Plantago major > Aloysia citriodora >Erythroxylum coca, while ORAC-F 1 values order is: <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> > Aloysia citriodora > Erythroxylum coca >Rosa moschata > Tilia spp > Plantago major.

MIC and MBC for <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> essential oil were measured 10. 5 and 16. 3 µg/ml, respectively. Conclusion: The Essential oils used in present study with different components showed antibacterial activity and therefore they can be used as new antibacterial substances...|$|R
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{capacity of}} essential oils of Mentha spicata L., Mentha x gentilis L., Mentha crispa L., <b>Mentha</b> <b>piperita</b> L. and <b>Mentha</b> x <b>piperita</b> L. {{was determined by}} using differential pulse voltammetry. This assay {{was based on the}} reduction in the limiting current value of the oxygen electroreduction, which was used to calculate the antioxidant capacity (K) of these species. The species M. x gentilis L. had the highest K value. Cyclic voltammetry experiments confirmed the interaction between the electrode surface and the active compounds present in the essential oils. A simple electrochemical method for determining the ability of active compounds to chelate Fe (II) is proposed...|$|R
