40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería Ambiental) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Química, 2015. There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in use <b>of</b> <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> in the Construction sector, which generates as a consequence a rise in the amount of its waste, ending in their mayority in landfills even though this is not the most optimal disposal of these residues. Therefore, it is proposed as objective of this project to evaluate the re-use <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> waste as a partial replacement of the fine aggregate for making cement mortar and concrete; due the nature of the glass it is potentially reusable in the construction sector. For this investigation, three types <b>of</b> <b>flat</b> <b>glasses</b> were evaluated (reflective glass [V-R], mirror glass [V-E] and 6 mm clear glass[V-I]) in which 4 mixtures were performed for mortars and other 4 for concretes in a defined proportion of sand and ground glass as fine aggregate, each type <b>of</b> <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> was used in a mixture and also a standard [P]. Subsequently, tests of their resistance to compression at different ages were made. In the mortar, the resistances obtained at age of 28 days in the samples with glasses were higher compared with the standards samples (V-E of 462 kg/cm 2, V-R of 440 kg/cm 2, V-I of 409 kg/cm 2 y P of 390 kg/cm 2); making possible the realization of these types of mortars and also it makes some decorative effects. In concretes, the resistance to compression was not affected with the presence <b>of</b> <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> and remained similar among all the mixtures samples (V-E of 307 kg/cm 2, V-R of 308 kg/cm 2, V-I of 313 kg/cm 2 y el P of 311 kg/cm 2). A comparison of the cost of making concrete with <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> as fine aggregate and the standard concrete was made, {{as a result of this}} comparison the mixtures cost is similar in all the cases, but the concrete with <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> can cost approximately 1 % less than the standard concrete.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the compressive strength of Portland cement concrete {{in response to}} the incorporation of 5 %, 10 % and 20 % <b>of</b> <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> powder in place of sand, at w/c (water/cement) ratios of 0. 50, 0. 55 and 0. 58.

The compressive strength test results indicate that the concrete containing a w/c ratio of 0. 50 can be used for structural applications, regardless of the waste glass content, as can that with a w/c ratio of 0. 55 containing 20 % of waste glass. We suggest that the use <b>of</b> <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> powder in place of sand in the abovementioned percentages is feasible for the production of an environmentally appropriate and structurally applicable concrete.

40|$|AbstractA {{modified}} high-power {{laser system}} with an output power of 2. 0 kW and an effective focus diameter of 1 mm allows a flexible forming <b>of</b> <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> products. Due {{to the high}} absorption of most glasses in the mid infrared wave length range the CO 2 -laser can be used very efficiently. The investigations show the potential of laser radiation for the partial forming <b>of</b> <b>flat</b> <b>glass</b> and the formability of glass materials depending on material thickness and the thermal expansion coefficient. Smaller and smaller glass components with more complex geometries can be processed {{because of the high}} focusability of the laser beam. With this intensity, it was possible to achieve forming depths of up to 6 mm. Another part of the studies is the creation of mechanical stress and its minimisation for which photoelastic methods as well as the differential interference contrast microscopy are used. The new technology can be applied especially in the fields of display glasses, sensor and medical technology...|$|R
