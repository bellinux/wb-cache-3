25|$|It {{seems that}} around 1880 {{there was a}} change in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practice</b> from {{companies}} with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information {{on the effect of}} product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate of managerial cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.|$|E

However, very few studies have been conducted on the integration of companies within a country. This study, using a survey approach, investigates an integration method based on Global <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Practices</b> data collected from small and medium manufacturing companies in Indonesia. The development of successful joint ventures, integration, and other forms of collaboration depend on the ability to successfully integrate the production activities (Gyula Vastag, 1993). Global <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Practices</b> developed by D). Clay Whybark, describe methods to examine the aspect of manufacturing activities based on the compatibility index (i. e. <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices)</b> among participating companies around the world. The measurement of compatibility developed in his study is based on the data compiled by the Global Manufacturing Research Group (GMRG). Several comparisons, primarily based on statistical analysis, are helpful in understanding differences in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices.</b> Using the Global <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Practices</b> survey, the study examines the participant perceptions of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> within their companies. The survey subjects are small and medium manufacturing firms (SMEs) from different regions of Indonesia.

40|$|AbstractNowadays, the {{manufacturing}} industry {{is faced with}} the challenge to adhere to stringent environmental regulations due to the scarcity of natural resources, global warming and waste management issues. Increasing environmental concerns and awareness are the driving force which pushes manufacturers {{all over the world to}} adopt green <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices.</b> However, the drivers and barriers of implementing green <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) differ from those for large enterprises since SMEs lack the data, resources, technical expertise and experience required to implement green initiatives. The environmental performance of SMEs is mostly driven by the intention of company owners. Since SMEs play a crucial role in a nation's economic growth, it is imperative to identify the drivers and barriers which will motivate and hinder the implementation of green <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> in SMEs, which forms the main motivation of our work. In this paper, we report preliminary findings on the drivers and barriers faced by SMEs in implementing green <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices,</b> specifically in Malaysia. We use the Delphi survey method to explore, identify and verify the drivers and barriers of green <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> by obtaining consensus from a panel of experts.

40|$|Sustainability is {{increasingly}} becoming the main objective of most forward-looking organisations. However, the selective and disconnected examinations of sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> and dimensions have denied stakeholders an overall understanding of sustainability initiatives. Practitioners and policymakers are sceptical about {{the relationships between}} sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> and sustainability dimensions such as environmental, economic and social {{from the perspective of}} the triple bottom line (3 BL). Furthermore it is evident that practitioners are only interested in following few practices to achieve 3 BL performance. Past studies either proposed new methodologies to examine sustainability dimensions or suggested few sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> such as quality and green practices that consider one or two dimensions of sustainability. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet established a relationship between composite sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> and 3 BL performance. This gap suggests a need for a theoretical framework to examine sustainable manufacturing in relation to three sustainability dimensions and study the impact of this relationship on 3 BL performance. Using explanatory case studies carried out at two local Chinese auto-parts companies we examine the extent and effectiveness of composite sustainability <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> including lean, green, and social responsibility implementation and their relation to 3 BL performance. Based on our literature review and the findings of the case studies, a composite sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> and performance framework are proposed. Findings indicate that the lean practice of ‘continuous improvement’, social practice of ‘health and safety’, and green practices of ‘use of fuel efficient tools’ and ‘machines utilisation’ contributed most to composite sustainability <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> in the investigated Chinese auto-parts companies. From the practitioners׳ points of view we formulated an optimisation model to select a few sets of practices among the composite sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> that would aid firms to achieve their targets...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} industry remains a critical {{force in the}} quest for global sustainability. An increasing number of companies are modifying their operations in favor of more sustainable practices. It is hugely important that manufacturers, irrespective of the subsector they belong to, or their organizational size, implement practices that reduce or eliminate negative environmental, social and economic impacts generated by their manufacturing operations. Consequently, scholars have called for additional studies concerning sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices,</b> not only to address the paucity of related literature, but also to contribute to practitioners’ understanding of how to incorporate sustainability into their operations. However, apart from expanding the knowledge of sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices,</b> it is first key to understand the ground set of values, or principles, behind sustainable manufacturing operations. For that reason, the purpose of this thesis is to contribute to the existing body of knowledge regarding sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> principles and <b>practices.</b> The results presented in this thesis are based on three studies: a systematic literature review exploring sustainability principles applicable to manufacturing settings, and two empirical studies addressing sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices.</b> In general, it is concluded from the literature that there is a little knowledge about sustainability principles from a manufacturing perspective. In relation to the most common sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices,</b> it is concluded that these practices mainly refer to energy and material management, and waste management. Similarly, the study of the adherence of sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> to sustainable production principles concluded that the principles concerning energy and materials conservation, and waste management were found to create the highest number of practices. Although most manufacturers still engage in reactive sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>practices</b> driven by regulatory and market pressures, some industrial sectors were found to be more prone to develop proactive sustainable manufacturing strategies than others. Furthermore, SMEs were found to lag behind large organizations regarding adherence to sustainable manufacturing principles...|$|R
