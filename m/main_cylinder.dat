25|$|The {{controller}} was a joint {{design by}} Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Hägglund, designated CMBK4. It {{was equipped with}} four cylinders. Those controlling the speed and braking were connected {{to each other and}} the controlled by the motorman by a wheel. The cylinders controlling the direction and disconnection of the motors were controlled by a lever. They were connected such that the <b>main</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the speed/braking cylinders had to be set to zero to disconnect the motors or change direction. The speed/braking controller had 24 levels. The reason for introducing a wheel was to allow the driver to man it with either hand and give it a more ergonomic location, as the motormen's job was to a greater degree to manoeuver the tram in traffic rather than a more technical control of the vehicle. The trams were unidirectional, but to allow them to back there were controls {{at the back of the}} vehicles, hidden within a hatch. It had three buttions, controlling speed, braking and emergency braking.|$|E

50|$|This chamber {{is located}} at the {{cylinder}} head and is connected to the engine cylinder by small holes. It occupies 40% of the total cylinder volume. During the compression stroke, air from the <b>main</b> <b>cylinder</b> enters the precombustion chamber. At this moment, fuel is injected into the precombustion chamber and combustion begins. Pressure increases and the fuel droplets are forced through the small holes into the <b>main</b> <b>cylinder,</b> resulting in a very good mix of the fuel and air. The bulk of the combustion actually takes place in the <b>main</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This type of combustion chamber has multi-fuel capability because the temperature of the prechamber vaporizes the fuel before the main combustion event occurs.|$|E

50|$|The Jumo 210G had {{a direct}} {{injection}} system developed by August Lichte. The Jumo system used a small pump piston positioned beside each of the <b>main</b> <b>cylinders,</b> driven off the crank shaft. The injector used a simple check valve to prevent internal pressure from blowing back into the fuel line, and the pump was timed to inject at the proper point in the intake cycle. Inclusion of the injection system increased takeoff performance by about 20 PS without increasing boost rates and it also reduced fuel consumption. For those reasons most newer German engine types were set up with fuel injection systems. The Jumo 210G was rated at 730 PS (720 hp, 534 kW) and was only available for fast aircraft like the Bf 109 and Bf 110 but not for slow aircraft like the Ju 87.|$|R

50|$|It uses water {{pressure}} from the water supply system rather than gravity from a raised tank like in previous models. A diaphragm separates a pressure chamber from the main water supply. A narrow passageway leads from the main water supply into the pressure chamber. It is the narrowness of this passage that meters the flow by slowing repressurizing of the pressure chamber after the action of a flush. The diaphragm technology allows the flush valve to open and let water into the bowl. A <b>main</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve operates up and down. A groove in this cylinder allows water from the main supply to flow through when {{it is in a}} mid position. The valve is shut off at both its top and bottom positions. A second valve, placed within the <b>main</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve, releases the water in the topmost pressure chamber when the flush lever is activated, sending the <b>main</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve shooting upwards. The topmost pressure chamber slowly refills through its narrow passageway, pushing the valve cylinder back down gradually. A flush occurs while it is in its open mid positions. Because the water is gradually shut off, slower water {{at the end of the}} cycle that will not activate the siphon serves to refill the bowl. The valve cannot be kept open by holding the flush lever in the activated position, wasting water, because this only sends the <b>main</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve all the way up to its topmost shutoff position. A flush can only occur when the valve is in one of its mid positions.|$|E

40|$|The {{tailings}} return {{system is}} an important functional part of modern combine harvesters, but published research on tailings return systems is very scarce. The tailings return system is intended to take crop material that is not completely threshed and/or not completely cleaned from the combine cleaning shoe back to the <b>main</b> threshing <b>cylinder.</b> Returning the tailings is regular practice on modern combine harvesters, but is not necessary and may be detrimental in some crops and conditions. The primary objective of this thesis is to research {{the function of the}} tailings return system with emphasis on developing a tailings rethresher. A tailings rethresher rethreshes the material from the cleaning shoe and returns it only to the cleaning section of the combine for re-processing. There are several potential advantages to rethreshing returning the tailings only to the cleaning section of the combine: 1.) Threshed grain in the tailings will not be exposed to the <b>main</b> threshing <b>cylinder</b> to be potentially damaged. 2.) The combine could be simplified and reduced in cost. 3) The rethresher will effectively reduce the loading of the <b>main</b> threshing <b>cylinder,</b> adding threshing capacity to the combine. 4.) Returning tailings to the cleaning system offers some advantages in distributing the load on the cleaning shoe for more efficient operation.; 5.) With the addition of an innovative bypass system, tailings can be returned to the cleaning system without rethreshing. Rethreshing is not necessary in many crops. This thesis addresses the data collected in the field and its implications. The function of the tailings returns has been further quantified in this study. The information is directed toward development of an improved tailings rethresher/returns system. Fourteen field studies were performed to measure tailings flow rate and composition and grain purity and damage in four different crops and numerous different conditions. Two prototype rethreshers were constructed and laboratory tested. One prototype was installed on a combine for lab testing, but it was not field tested...|$|R
5000|$|In this engine, {{similar in}} design to the Beare head, a [...] "piston charger" [...] replaces the valve system.

5000|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, GAZ {{continued}} to modify and alter (read simplify) the make-up of the car. One such {{result was the}} ZMZ-4022 motor with a stratified charge or in original terms—"prechambered—torch ignition". Similar to Honda CVCC design, GAZ experimented with such technology in the early 1950s, and its patent dates to 1968. Now that it had time to spare, {{it was decided to}} introduce this novelty. To keep production costs low, the new engine retained all of ZMZ-24Ds key features: 4 cylinders, OHV, displacement etc. However the material of both cylinder block and head was now aluminium. The big novelty was four additional inlet valves that charged the combustion prechambers. Feeding this was a three barrel carburettor, where the draft from third barrel was directed into the four prechambers. The spark plugs were located inside these chambers, and lean fuel-air mixture in <b>main</b> <b>cylinders</b> was ignited by conical jets (the [...] "torches") from these prechambers. Compared to the ZMZ-24D, power rose by 10 hp to 105 at 4750 rpm. Though the car was 50 kg heavier in weight, it could now do 0-100 km/h acceleration in 16.2 seconds (compared to the 22 on the GAZ-24) and the top speed also rose from 145 to 152 km/h. Whilst not exactly impressive dynamics {{by the turn of the}} decade, its fuel economy figures were: from 10.5 litres per 100 km on the GAZ-24 to 8.5.|$|R
50|$|The X class {{locomotives}} are a {{class of}} metre gauge 0-8-2T rack and pinion compound locomotives working on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India. They are used on the 20 km section between Coonoor and Mettupalayam where the gradient of the track can be as steep as 1 in 12.5. At these steep sections, the railway uses the Abt system. The X class locomotives are compound locomotives with two high-pressure and two low-pressure cylinders. All cylinders are outside the locomotive's frames.

50|$|In 1946, the {{production}} restarted {{with a larger}} two-cylinder 654 cc Lloyd-made engine with a bore of 70 mm and stroke of 85 mm producing 25 bhp at 2450 rpm. The twin-cylinder alloy unit was mounted transversely at the front and drove the front wheels through a four-speed gearbox with synchromesh on all speeds including reverse. It was still a two-stroke but the bearings were pressure lubricated. A third cylinder and piston which had a reciprocating and slightly rotating motion {{was connected to the}} carburettor with ports in the cylinder walls connecting to the engine's two cylinders. This was used to draw the fuel mixture from the carburettor and transfer the mixture to each engine cylinder. This double-acting fuel charging cylinder piston was hollow with ports located in the piston walls and ports located in the charging cylinder walls connecting to each of the engine's <b>main</b> <b>cylinders.</b> One engine cylinder was charged by the charging cylinder piston's down and slightly rotating stroke which allowed the piston and charging cylinder side wall port to uncover and allow the mixture transfer to the engine cylinder. The other engine cylinder was charged with mixture by the upwards stroke of the charging cylinder piston. The engine cylinders and the fuel charging cylinders were set in a triangular configuration with the fuel charging cylinder being located centrally and receiving gravity fed fuel from the bulkhead mounted fuel tank. This method of mixture input to the engine cylinders allowed for the engine wet oil sump.|$|R
