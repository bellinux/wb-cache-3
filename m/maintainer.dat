This ten-year prospective longitudinal study investigated whether differences in physical activity patterns from adolescence to young-adulthood showed different associations with subsequent cardio-metabolic risk factors and mental health in young-adulthood. Methods Based on the second and third Norwegian Nord-Trøndelag Health Surveys (HUNT 2 and 3), we included 1869 individuals (838 males) participating in Young-HUNT (1995 – 97), aged 13 – 19 years and followed-up at HUNT 3 (2006 – 08), aged 23 – 31. Self-reported physical activity (PA), mental health and perceived health were recorded, along with measurements of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides, resting heart rate (HR) and blood pressure. We used separate linear regressions models to investigate associations between physical activity and each CVD risk factor, and logistic regression analysis to examine PA patterns and subsequent mental health. Physically active <b>maintainers</b> were compared to inactive <b>maintainers.</b> Adopters (inactive as adolescents and physically active as young adults) were compared to inactive <b>maintainers</b> and to those who discontinued activity (relapsers). Results Active <b>maintainers</b> had significantly lower HR, compared to all other PA patterns. Active maintaining men had significantly lower WC than relapsers and inactive <b>maintainers.</b> When adjusted for age and gender, WC, BMI, HR, diastolic blood pressure and HDL-C showed significant differences comparing active maintaining to other PA patterns. Comparing inactive <b>maintainers</b> against adopters, only HR was significantly lower. Male adopters did not differ significantly in CVD risk compared to inactive <b>maintainers</b> and relapsers. Among females adopting was associated with lower HR and TC compared to inactive <b>maintainers.</b> Active <b>maintainers</b> showed better mental health than inactive <b>maintainers.</b> Active maintaining males had an increased likelihood of good mental health compared to adopters. Active maintaining females reported greater satisfaction with life compared to adopters. Conclusions Those who maintained their physical activity from adolescence to young adulthood demonstrated a significantly lower CVD risk and better mental health, compared to inactive <b>maintainers.</b> Compared to inactivity <b>maintainers</b> and relapsers, adopting physical activity was not significantly associated with lowered CVD risk. Adopting physical activity between adolescence and young adulthood may not necessarily protect against mental distress. </p...|$|R

40|$|Managing the {{evolution}} of complex and large software systems involves {{many different types of}} resources and knowledge such as software artefacts, user expertise, tools and techniques, etc. Variations and interrelationships among these types of resources and knowledge create well-known challenges for <b>maintainers.</b> Current research mainly focuses on establishing comprehension model, and developing tools to tackle a specific aspect of maintenance problems. Little research has been conducted to study how resources and knowledge work collaboratively together to provide guidance to <b>maintainers</b> to complete specific maintenance tasks in a given context. In this research, we introduce a customizable maintenance process model, which extends an existing IEEE standard process model, to allow visually link various resources (e. g. tools, artifacts, <b>maintainers</b> etc.) and knowledge to relevant maintenance process elements. A visual metaphor has been created to graphically represent the process model. Finally, a tool environment has been developed to provide utilities for <b>maintainers</b> to create, customize and apply our maintenance process to provide guidance for <b>maintainers</b> for their maintenance tasks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—System <b>maintainers</b> face several {{challenges}} stem-ming from {{a system}} and its library dependencies evolving separately. Novice <b>maintainers</b> may lack the historical knowledge required to efficiently manage an inherited system. While some libraries are regularly updated, some systems keep a dependency on older versions. On the other hand, <b>maintainers</b> may be unaware that other systems have settled on a different version of a library. In this paper, we visualize how the dependency relation between a {{system and its}} dependencies evolves from two perspectives. Our system-centric dependency plots (SDP) visualize the successive library versions a system depends on over time. The radial layout and heat-map metaphor provide visual clues about the change in dependencies along the system’s release history. From this perspective, <b>maintainers</b> can navigate to a library-centric dependants diffusion plot (LDP). The LDP is a time-series visualization that shows the diffusion of users across the different versions of a library. We demonstrate on real-world systems how <b>maintainers</b> can benefit from our visualizations through four case scenarios. I...|$|R

40|$|Psychosocial {{differences}} between weight loss <b>maintainers</b> {{and weight loss}} non-maintainers were compared {{at least one year}} after reaching a medically approved weight goal through a medically supervised weight loss program. Research questions addressed {{differences between}} groups on the dimensions of somatization, obsessive/compulsive issues, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, ability to resolve past emotional issues, social interpersonal relationships, and tolerance of ambiguity. The all-female sample consisted of <b>maintainers</b> of weight loss (N= 30), non-maintainers (N= 33), psychotherapy <b>maintainers</b> (N= 14), and psychotherapy non-maintainers (N=ll). Research instruments administered were the Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised, Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behavior, Personal Orientation Inventory, and Budner Scale for Tolerance/Intolerance of Ambiguity. To determine differences between groups, a t test was performed on data relating to the maintaining and non-maintaining groups. An analysis of variance was performed on data related to the maintaining, non-maintaining, psychotherapy maintaining, and psychotherapy non-maintaining groups. An intercorrelation matrix was completed for all variables. Non-maintainers of weight loss had significantly more difficulty with somatic problems as indicated in the results of both the t test and the analysis of variance (p <. 009, p <. 02, respectively). Non-maintainers expressed more complaints which focused on cardio-vascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and somatic equivalents of anxiety (headaches, pain, discomfort of the gross musculature). An analysis of variance showed non-maintainers (p <. 05) to be significantly less effective in resolving past emotional issues than <b>maintainers,</b> psychotherapy <b>maintainers,</b> and psychotherapy non-maintainers. Non-maintainers were more burdened by guilt, regrets, and resentments from the past. Results of the analysis of variance indicated that psychotherapy <b>maintainers</b> (p <. 03) were more socially adjusted than <b>maintainers,</b> non-maintainers, and psychotherapy non-maintainers. Inclusion and control subscales characterized psychotherapy <b>maintainers</b> to be more socially adaptable and flexible.
