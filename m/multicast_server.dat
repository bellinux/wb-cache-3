Nowadays, {{there are more and more}} applications that require communication systems with multipoint communication capabilities. Multicast communication reduces both the time it takes to send data to a large set of receivers and the amount of network resources required to deliver such data.

30|$|In {{point-to-multipoint}} {{services such}} as multicast, the transmission to the multicast clients may traverse different paths. As a result, the end-to-end transmission channels may exhibit diverse behaviors and capacities. End-to-end QoE can be assured by providing sufficient error protection. Feedback-based error correction such as automatic repeat request (ARQ) and hybrid ARQ [1] may not be feasible due to latency and possible feedback implosion at the <b>multicast</b> <b>server.</b> An alternative which avoids these problems is to employ FEC coding. In multicasting, {{we are faced with}} an ensemble of channels with different loss processes and require FEC that is “universally” efficient. Fortunately, fountain codes [2] have been demonstrated to well approximate the ideal. With fountain codes, the receiver can recover the source symbols with high probability when the number of correctly received code symbols is slightly larger than the number of source symbols. Crucially, this recovery capability is independent of the loss pattern or channel memory. One implication of this “independence” from channel memory is that clients connected to distinct channels with differing memory behaviors that inflict the same amount of loss will see the same throughput.|$|E

Firstly, we propose an {{interleaved}} data carousel model that is combined with the latest RQ (since it offers improved coding efficiency compared to R 10) [12]. The interleaved model mitigates against bursts of errors in a source block and hence reduces the time required to acquire all the packets that form the source block. Secondly, we present an analytical model that allows the calculation of file download times for a fountain code-enhanced data carousel. Thirdly, a realistic multi-layered simulator has been developed combining novel outdoor ray tracing, a physical (PHY) layer Wi-Fi simulator and a RQ-enabled multicast data carousel simulator. Limitations in the client (which are not predicted in our theoretic simulations) are shown to result in significant packet loss, even in ideal channel conditions. By implementing our proposed multicast carousel system (server, Wi-Fi access point and client), we show using Android-enabled tablets that real-world packet loss is a strong function of modulation and coding scheme (MCS), Raptor code parameters and <b>multicast</b> <b>server</b> rate.

30|$|Multimedia {{delivery}} {{systems can be}} optimized to maximize the overall throughput (best effort) or to satisfy client quality of experience (QoE) demands (QoS-guaranteed). QoE-guaranteed optimizations may suffer from being overly constrained, especially in large-scale multicasts. Tracking the media processing capability, QoE demand, and channel quality of every client can be daunting, prompting the search for better trade-offs between bandwidth usage efficiency and optimization complexity. Sometimes, no feasible solution exists due to bandwidth limitations and/or clients with poor channels that require forward error correction (FEC) codes with exceedingly large overheads. Therefore, having a screening process to reduce excessive QoE demands is essential, especially in large-scale multicasts. One may utilize a mechanism to dynamically assign clients to available media quality levels {{in order to improve}} resource utilization efficiency. For example, using scalable bitstreams, the <b>multicast</b> <b>server</b> may drop the highest enhancement layers when relatively few users with high-quality channels and high-resolution displays exist. The saved transmission resources could be redeployed to serve clients with poor channels. The multicast optimization needs to be performed repeatedly due to client channel and source bitstream variations, as well as to account for clients dynamically joining or leaving the multicast at random times. Thus, low complexity optimization methods are required.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In mobile ad hoc networks, due to {{unreliable}} wireless media, host {{mobility and}} lack of infrastructure, providing secure communications is a big challenge in this unique network environment. Usually cryptography techniques are used for secure communications in wired and wireless networks. The asymmetric cryptography is widely used because of its versatileness (authentication, integrity, and confidentiality) and simplicity for key distribution. However, this approach relies on a centralized framework of public key infrastructure (PKI). The symmetric approach has computation efficiency, yet it suffers from potential attacks on key agreement or key distribution. In fact, any cryptographic means is ineffective if the key management is weak. Key management is a central aspect for security in mobile ad hoc networks. In mobile ad hoc networks, the computational load and complexity for key management is strongly subject to restriction of the node’s available resources and the dynamic nature of network topology. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient key management framework (SEKM) for mobile ad hoc networks.

30|$|Multicast is an {{efficient}} way of transmitting {{the same set}} of data to multiple interested users. Unlike the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) cellular standards, for Wi-Fi, there is no standardised solution for reliable multicast data transmission. Multicast packets are delivered to multiple users as a broadcast service without support for automatic repeat request. Hence, multicast transmission often results in high packet loss. In order to improve the reliability of multicast delivery, a fixed low-speed (robust) transmission mode can be used. However, this results in the inefficient use of scarce and valuable radio bandwidth. This paper presents a reliable and efficient Wi-Fi multicast delivery solution for use in challenging outdoor environments. An application layer forward error correction (AL-FEC)-enabled data carousel is proposed to enhance reliability. For multicast transmission, we demonstrate that limitations in the Wi-Fi clients are a major source of packet loss, even in ideal channel conditions. Client limitations (particularly data rate limitations) were found to vary as a function of modulation and coding mode, Raptor code parameters and <b>multicast</b> <b>server</b> rate. Our initial Raptor-enabled carousel designs are based on computer simulations and lab-based trials.
