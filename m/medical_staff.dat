40|$|Abstract Background Primary care medical staffs’ knowledge, {{attitude}} and behavior about health emergency {{and the response}} capacity {{are directly related to}} the control and prevention of public health emergencies. Therefore, it is of great significance for improving primary care to gain in-depth knowledge about knowledge, {{attitude and}} behavior and the response capacity of primary care <b>medical</b> <b>staffs.</b> The main objective {{of this study is to}} explore knowledge, attitude and behavior, and the response capacity of primary care <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> of Guangdong Province, China. Methods Stratified clustered sample method was used in the anonymous questionnaire investigation about knowledge, attitude and behavior, and the response capacity of 3410 primary care <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> in 15 cities of Guangdong Province, China from July, 2010 to October 2010. The emergency response capacity was evaluated by 33 questions. The highest score of the response capacity was 100 points (full score), score of 70 was a standard. Results 62. 4 % primary care <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> believed that public health emergencies would happen. Influenza (3. 86 [*]±[*] 0. 88), food poisoning (3. 35 [*]±[*] 0. 75), and environmental pollution events (3. 23 [*]±[*] 0. 80) (the total score was 5) were considered most likely to occur. Among the 7 public health emergency skills, the highest self-assessment score is “public health emergency prevention skills” (2. 90 [*]±[*] 0. 68), the lowest is “public health emergency risk management (the total score was 5) ” (1. 81 [*]±[*] 0. 40). Attitude evaluation showed 66. 1 % of the <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> believed that the community awareness of risk management were ordinary. Evaluation of response capacity of health emergency showed that the score of primary care <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> was 67. 23 [*]±[*] 10. 61, and the response capacity of senior physicians, public health physicians and physicians with relatively long-term practice were significantly better (P Conclusions The knowledge, attitude and behavior about public health emergencies and the response capacity of primary care <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> of Guangdong Province (China) were poor. Health administrative departments should strengthen the training of health emergency knowledge and skills of the primary care <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> to enhance their health emergency response capabilities. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background : Hepatitis B {{virus is}} one of the main factors causing acute and chronic {{hepatitis}} and hepatocellular carcinoma. Among others, healthcare workers are at the highest risk for exposure to hepatitis B virus. Vaccination against hepatitis B virus {{is one of}} the protective strategies but anti-HBs titer will be reduced in the sera of vaccinated people after some time. The aim of this study was to determine the titer of anti-HBs in the sera of vaccinated <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> in three consecutive years since administration of the last dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Materials and Methods : This study was carried out on 90 Omidvar Hospital (Lar, Iran) <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> that had passed 3 - 4 months since the administration of the last dose of hepatitis B vaccine. All sera samples were tested for anti-HBs in an ELISA method. Finally, statistical analysis was performed using SPSS- 16 software. Results : This study was conducted in duration of 3 consecutive years on 90 <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> including 14. 44 lab technicians, 10 obstetricians, 43. 35 nurses, 6. 665 specialists, 5. 55 general practitioners and 20 maid staffs. While HBs Ab titer was measured as 87. 7 (> 100 mIU/ml) in the first year elapsed since the last dose of hepatitis B vaccination, it had been decreased to 55. 4 after 3 years. Conclusion : The results showed that re-vaccination of the <b>medical</b> <b>staffs</b> is quite necessary as anti-HBs titer had been decreased after 3 years and the desired immune response was seen only in 55. 4 of the <b>medical</b> <b>staffs...</b>|$|R
