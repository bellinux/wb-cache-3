5|$|Although Jardine {{had retired}} from regular {{first-class}} competition, {{he continued to}} play club cricket. Jardine and his wife initially lived in Kensington but moved to Reading {{after the birth of}} their first child, daughter Fianach. A second daughter, Marion, followed but the family suffered from financial worries. Jardine, as well as working in journalism, earned money from playing bridge. The family also tried unsuccessfully to engage in <b>market</b> <b>gardening.</b> To make more money, Jardine became a salesman with Cable & Wireless before working for a coal mining company in the late 1930s. In 1939, he returned to cricket journalism and according to Christopher Douglas, achieved his highest standard as a writer.|$|E

5|$|Before development, Hamersley was {{a remote}} {{district}} covered in jarrah, marri, banksia and other vegetation {{typical of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, with small areas cleared for small-scale agriculture such as <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> and poultry farming. By 1974, six {{years after the first}} subdivision, Hamersley was home to the district's first community hall, an annual parade and fair which were broadcast on Perth TV and radio, an active progress association, and its own newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, a forerunner to today's Stirling Times. Rapid growth further north removed the focus from Hamersley, which was completed in 1981 and has remained relatively stable since then.|$|E
5|$|There was {{an ancient}} {{farmstead}} from the 1st {{century to the}} 3rd century in the Upminster area, and agriculture was the predominant industry throughout the following centuries. The area was once wooded, but clearances in the 12th century gave more land over to arable farming; and by the 17th century there were a variety of crops and livestock. There was a growth in <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> in the 19th century. There {{have been a number}} of windmills in Upminster and one of which, a smock mill built in 1803, remains. Local industry included a tannery, gravel extraction and a brick works that was connected to the railway station by a tramway in 1895.|$|E
5|$|In 1754, {{a stretch}} of road south of Altrincham, along the Manchester to Chester route, was turnpiked. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed {{passengers}} {{for the maintenance of}} the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. The maintenance of roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike trusts had already declined. The connection of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 stimulated the development of <b>market</b> <b>gardening,</b> and for many years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables. By 1767, warehouses had been built alongside the canal at Broadheath, {{the first step in the}} development of Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham's industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the River Mersey, providing the town not only with a water route to Manchester, but also to the Irish Sea.|$|E

5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, {{and many of the}} stalls were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed the market to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 {{the island}} was visited by a {{magistrate}} P. Cloete aboard the Thetis investigating a possible murder. He was accompanied by Charles Moore, director of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and his assistant William Carron who forwarded plant specimens to Ferdinand Mueller at the botanic gardens in Melbourne who, by 1875, had catalogued and published 195 species. Also on the ship was William Fitzgerald, a surveyor, and Mr Masters from the Australian Museum. Together they surveyed the island with the findings published in 1870 when the population was listed as 35 people, their 13 houses built of split palm battens thatched {{on the roof and}} sides with palm leaves. At about this time there began a downturn of trade with the demise of the whaling industry and sometimes six or twelve months passed without a vessel calling.

25|$|Historically {{an ancient}} parish in Essex, its {{economic}} history is characterised by {{a shift from}} fishing and farming to <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> and industrial development south of the River Thames. The railway station opened in 1854 and has been served by the London Underground since 1908. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Barking significantly expanded and increased in population, primarily due {{to the development of}} the London County Council estate at Becontree in the 1920s, and became a municipal borough in 1931, and part of Greater London in 1965. In addition to an extensive and fairly low-density residential area, the town centre forms a large retail and commercial district, currently a focus for regeneration. The former industrial lands to the south are being redeveloped as Barking Riverside.|$|E
25|$|Fairbridge {{was born}} in Grahamstown, South Africa, and educated at St Andrew's College, Grahamstown, {{until the age of}} 11, when the family moved to Rhodesia. His father was a {{surveyor}} in Umtali (the present day Mutare, Zimbabwe) He had no further schooling until he prepared to enter Oxford University in 1908 at the age of 23. At 13 he became a clerk in the Standard Bank of South Africa at Umtali, and two years later tried to enlist for the Boer War, failing because of malaria, which he had contracted in Mashonaland. Fairbridge then took up <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> and early in 1903 visited his grandmother in England for about 12 months. The visit deeply affected him, as he observed the contrast of malnourished and impoverished children living in the London slums with the under-populated open spaces of Rhodesia.|$|E
25|$|By 1857 most of {{the trees}} in the area were felled and <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> and {{orchards}} began to flourish. The land around Papanui proved to be remarkably fertile for farming once ditches and drains were dug to relieve the swampy areas. Gradually more immigrants settled in Papanui, crops were sown and sheep and dairy farms were established in the surrounding areas. Exports of wheat and wool soon became the main source of income for the province. From the mid-1880s frozen mutton shipments, from the nearby Canterbury Frozen Meat Company in Belfast, to the U.K. grew steadily and eventually surpassed other exports to become the main export earner. In the 1890s butter shipments joined the export trade with the Fernleaf brand becoming as well known as 'Canterbury Lamb'. As settlement of Christchurch continued farms were sold for residential and commercial developments with Papanui being transformed into a suburb which became part of Christchurch city in 1923.|$|E

25|$|For much of {{its history}} Rainham was an {{agricultural}} settlement, using the River Thames for trade. In the 16th century industry was limited to a boat-builder and tannery. There are links between Rainham farms and the City of London from the Middle Ages and after the wharf was redeveloped in the 1720s trade increased; including the bringing of muck from London {{for use in the}} fields. By 1929 most of the farmland had been given over to <b>market</b> <b>gardening.</b> The ferry to London was supplemented with new coaching links in the 18th century and a railway station opened in 1854. A second wharf was constructed in 1872 and from 1869 there was a growth in industrial development, including chemical and fertiliser factories. The Murex iron-founders moved to Rainham in 1917 and grew along the river, eventually becoming part of the British Oxygen Company. Away from the river, other industries included brickmaking and after World War II there was a growth in gravel extraction.|$|E

500|$|Historically in Lancashire, {{during much}} of the 19th century Stretford was an {{agricultural}} village, with its own market, known locally as Porkhampton, a reference to the large number of pigs produced for the nearby Manchester market. It was also an extensive <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> area, producing more than [...] of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845. The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, accelerated the industrialisation that had begun in the late 19th century. By 2001 less than one per cent of Stretford's population was employed in agriculture.|$|E
