5|$|The known {{material}} (hypodigm) of Miniopterus zapfei {{includes a}} <b>mandible</b> (lower jaw) with the fourth premolar (p4), first molar (m1), and second molar (m2); a <b>mandible</b> with m1; a <b>mandible</b> with m1 and m2; a <b>mandible</b> with m2 {{and the third}} molar (m3); a <b>mandible</b> without any teeth; and an isolated fourth upper premolar (P4). Some of the mandibles also preserve the alveoli (openings) for teeth {{that have not been}} preserved. The dimensions of the p4 (length and width) are 1.03 x 0.88mm; m1 is 1.57 to 1.60 x 1.01 to 1.07mm; m2 is 1.51 to 1.64 x 0.95 to 1.05mm; the single m3 is 1.41mm long; and the single P4 is 1.38 x 1.52mm. In a well-preserved <b>mandible,</b> the length from the alveolus for the first incisor to the end of m3 is 8.80mm and the depth of the <b>mandible</b> at m1 is 1.50mm.|$|E
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The upper <b>mandible</b> hooked sharply downwards, {{while the}} heavy lower <b>mandible</b> hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper <b>mandible.</b> This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid <b>mandible</b> (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones {{in the rear of}} the <b>mandible</b> and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on the surface of the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape and}} size of beetle <b>mandibles</b> varies from species to species {{depending}} on the food preferences. For example, carnivorous beetles have extended <b>mandibles</b> to seize or crush prey. Tiger beetles' <b>mandibles</b> (similar to the piercing canine teeth of tigers) are well adapted for killing prey. Diving beetle and firefly larvae have hollow <b>mandibles,</b> which can inject digestive fluid to liquefy the tissues of the prey. When this process is over, they suck the digested tissue through the <b>mandibles.</b>|$|R

25|$|The <b>mandibles</b> and {{the muscles}} {{found in the}} <b>mandibles</b> are exaptations, the large <b>mandibles</b> {{probably}} were selected for the increased ability to carry food, and further modified to {{to use as a}} way of defense and hunting.|$|R
5|$|In the <b>mandible</b> (lower jaw), {{the mental}} foramen, an opening {{just before the}} first molar, opens sidewards, not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, join at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond that point. The capsular process, a raising of the bone {{of the back of}} the <b>mandible</b> that houses the back end of the incisor, is large.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>mandible,</b> {{the mental}} foramen, {{an opening in}} the <b>mandible</b> just before the first molar, opens to the outside, not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, join at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond that point. There is no capsular process of the lower incisor, a trait Mindomys shares with only a few other oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>mandible,</b> {{the mental}} foramen, {{an opening in}} the <b>mandible</b> just before the first molar, opens to the outside, not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, usually join into a single crest at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond the molar. There is no {{distinct}} capsular process of the lower incisor, a trait Eremoryzomys shares with only a few other oryzomyines.|$|E
50|$|Insect <b>mandibles</b> are {{as diverse}} in form as their food. For instance, {{grasshoppers}} {{and many other}} plant-eating insects have sharp-edged <b>mandibles</b> that move side to side. Most butterflies and moths lack <b>mandibles</b> as they mainly feed on nectar from flowers.|$|R

50|$|Male {{adults are}} easily {{recognized}} by their long, curving <b>mandibles,</b> reaching up to 40 mm in length, which they use in competition for females. It {{is possible that}} the <b>mandibles</b> may have been selected as secondary sex characteristics used by females to evaluate males during courtship. Males cannot use these <b>mandibles</b> to bite because they are too long; on the other hand, females have short, heavily sclerotized <b>mandibles</b> which enable them to deliver powerful bites when threatened. The antennae of males are also noticeably elongated, even longer than the <b>mandibles.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the <b>mandible,</b> {{the mental}} foramen, an opening {{just before the}} first molar, opens sidewards, not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, join at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond that point. The capsular process, a raising of the bone {{of the back of}} the <b>mandible</b> that houses the back end of the incisor, is present, but not as large as in O.couesi.|$|E
5|$|The {{hammering}} of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially {{damaging to the}} birds. In the great spotted woodpecker {{and most of its}} relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper <b>mandible</b> is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper <b>mandible</b> is significantly longer than the more rigid lower <b>mandible</b> and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mandible</b> (lower jaw) {{is short}} and deep. The mental foramen, an opening {{at the front of}} the <b>mandible,</b> just before the first molar, opens to the side. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is well developed. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E
50|$|The Hemiptera, {{and other}} insects whose {{mouthparts}} {{are described as}} piercing-sucking, have modified <b>mandibles.</b> Rather than being tooth-like, the <b>mandibles</b> of such insects are lengthened into stylets, which form the outer {{two parts of the}} feeding tube, or beak. The <b>mandibles</b> are therefore instrumental in piercing the plant or animal tissues upon which these insects feed, and in helping draw up fluids to the insect’s mouth.They are also described as <b>mandibles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A chewing insect has {{a pair of}} <b>mandibles,</b> one on {{each side}} of the head. The <b>mandibles</b> are caudal to the labrum and {{anterior}} to the maxillae. Typically the <b>mandibles</b> are the largest and most robust mouthparts of a chewing insect, and it uses them to masticate (cut, tear, crush, chew) food items. Two sets of muscles move the <b>mandibles</b> in the coronal plane: abductor muscles move insects' <b>mandibles</b> apart (laterally); adductor muscles bring them together (medially). This they do mainly in opening and closing their jaws in feeding, but also in using the <b>mandibles</b> as tools, or possibly in fighting; note however, that this refers to the coronal plane of the mouth, not necessarily of the insect's body, because insects' heads differ greatly in their orientation.|$|R
50|$|Caterpillars use sharp <b>mandibles</b> to cut {{leaves in}} {{side-to-side}} motions. Only a few moths have functional <b>mandibles</b> {{in the adult}} stage. The most notable example {{are members of the}} family Micropterigidae, small moths with toothed <b>mandibles</b> used for chewing pollen grains, lacking even the most rudimentary proboscis.|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower <b>mandible</b> applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper <b>mandible</b> acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|Generally duller and paler, {{the female}} {{has a more}} uniform and paler blue face, with highly {{contrasting}} cream bare skin around the eye. It lacks the red shoulder band, and the blue shoulder markings are darker and less distinct. The throat and chest are pale green and the belly is yellow. The upper <b>mandible</b> is paler brown-grey with a darker tip, and has been recorded as black while nesting. The lower <b>mandible</b> is pale grey to almost white. When flying, the female has a broad white bar visible on the underwing.|$|E
5|$|Hornbills are a {{group of}} birds whose bill is shaped like a cow's horn, but without a twist, {{sometimes}} with a casque on the upper <b>mandible.</b> Frequently, the bill is brightly coloured.|$|E

50|$|To use correct {{evolutionary}} terms, the <b>mandibles</b> and {{the muscles}} {{found in the}} <b>mandibles</b> are known as exaptation. Exaptations are useful traits that were not originally produced by natural selection for their current use. For example, the large <b>mandibles</b> were selected for {{in order to help}} the ants become better able to carry food, but then the ants were able to use these <b>mandibles</b> as a way of defense and for hunting.|$|R
50|$|Queen bees have <b>mandibles</b> {{with sharp}} cutting teeth unlike worker bees, who have toothless jaws. Male dobsonflies have slender <b>mandibles</b> up to 2.5 cm long, half {{as long as}} the insect's main body. Potter wasps use their <b>mandibles</b> to mix {{droplets}} of water with clay while constructing a nest.|$|R
5|$|Miniopterus tao is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus from the Pleistocene of Zhoukoudian in China. It is known {{from a number}} of mandibles (lower jaws), which were {{initially}} identified as the living species Miniopterus schreibersii in 1963 before being recognized as a separate species, M. tao, in 1986. Miniopterus tao is larger than living M. schreibersii and has more closely spaced lower premolars and more robust talonids (back groups of cusps) on the lower molars. The back part of the <b>mandible</b> is relatively low and on it, the coronoid and condyloid processes are about equally high. The average length of the <b>mandible</b> is 12.0mm.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the cheek}} teeth of Seorsumuscardinus are known; {{these include the}} fourth premolar and three molars in the upper (maxilla) and lower jaws (<b>mandible).</b> The teeth are {{medium-sized}} for a dormouse and have a flat occlusal (chewing) surface. S.bolligeri is slightly larger than S.alpinus.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse has a {{large and}} robust skull with {{well-developed}} zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region of the skull (between the eyes) is smooth, as in greater big-footed mouse, and lacks the shelves characteristic of the bastard big-footed mouse. The palate is broad and the incisive foramina (openings in the front portion of the palate) are long and broad. In the <b>mandible</b> (lower jaw), {{the root of the}} lower incisor is housed in a distinct capsular process, a protuberance {{at the back of the}} jawbone. The lower masseteric ridge (a crest on the outer side of the <b>mandible)</b> is prominent. As is typical of Macrotarsomys, the molars are cuspidate and low-crowned.|$|E
50|$|Males of {{a larger}} size, or major males, {{relative}} to their respective species in this genus exhibit enlarged <b>mandibles.</b> These enlarged <b>mandibles</b> are not used for feeding, but rather for competing with other males for mates, and males with larger <b>mandibles</b> {{are more likely to}} win these male-male fights.|$|R

50|$|In {{males of}} some species, such as of Lucanidae and some Cerambycidae, the <b>mandibles</b> are {{modified}} {{to such an}} extent that they do not serve any feeding function, but are instead used to defend mating sites from other males. In some ants and termites, the <b>mandibles</b> also serve a defensive function (particularly in soldier castes). In bull ants, the <b>mandibles</b> are elongate and toothed, used both as hunting (and defensive) appendages. In bees, that feed primarily by use of a proboscis, the primary use of the <b>mandibles</b> is to manipulate and shape wax, and many paper wasps have <b>mandibles</b> adapted to scraping and ingesting wood fibres.|$|R
5|$|Skimmers are a {{small family}} of {{tropical}} tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower <b>mandible</b> which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mandible</b> (lower jaw) looks chunky {{and has a}} long {{condyloid}} {{process at}} its back; that of T.talamancae is more slender. The capsular process, a projection {{at the back of}} the jaw which houses the root of the lower incisor, is poorly developed.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{specimen}} of ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus is a <b>mandible</b> (lower jaw) {{found in the}} spring of 1935 by David Dunkle in Edson Quarry, Sherman County, Kansas. It is in the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University as specimen MCZ 6202. Edson Quarry is in the Ogallala Formation and the Hemphillian North American Land Mammal Age. Claude W. Hibbard described the <b>mandible</b> as ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus in a 1939 paper. Hibbard wrote that the fauna was middle Pliocene, but it is now considered Miocene. The Edson Quarry fauna contains a diversity of other fossils, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.|$|E
50|$|Maxillae in most insects {{function}} partly like <b>mandibles</b> in feeding, {{but they}} are more mobile and less heavily sclerotised than <b>mandibles,</b> so they are more important in manipulating soft, liquid, or particulate food rather than cutting or crushing food such as material that requires the <b>mandibles</b> to cut or crush.|$|R
25|$|The <b>mandibles</b> of O. bauri are {{an exaggerated}} {{form of the}} sturdy and long <b>mandibles</b> found in many ant species.
