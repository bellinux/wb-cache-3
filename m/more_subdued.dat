Among the scenes created for the show, there are the conversations between Theon and Tyrion, Sansa and Septa Mordane, Doreah and Viserys, Jory Cassel and Jaime, Jon and Samwell and Eddard Stark and Cersei. The character of Alliser Thorne is given some more depth by justifying his harshness towards the new recruits, and a <b>more</b> <b>subdued</b> version of Bran's dream is included.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. The brilliant gold color became <b>more</b> <b>subdued</b> in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Additionally, her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva {{began to appear in}} public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been <b>more</b> <b>subdued,</b> with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, {{the main}} heroine of Clannad, {{at the onset}} of the story. Nagisa is a shy, soft-spoken girl who has very low {{self-esteem}} and self-confidence which causes her to rely on those around her for support. She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names of favorite foods that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as anpan. Kyou Fujibayashi, another of Clannad heroines, is an aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family. When angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes. Despite this attitude, she also has a <b>more</b> <b>subdued</b> side, especially towards her younger fraternal twin sister Ryou Fujibayashi.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the upheaval, the new Palladium had opened. The Senators, still coached by Allison, lost their opening game in the arena 3–0 to Montreal on January 17, 1996. The event was much <b>more</b> <b>subdued</b> than their franchise's first game. The Cup banners were raised, but the winches jammed, {{blocking}} the view of many fans. There were no entertainment big names, and only Firestone and Bryden participated in the ceremonial face-off. The club would lose its first four games at the Palladium, winning none for Allison, who was later fired on January 24 after the team lost 22 of 25 games. While Ottawa finished last in the League for the fourth year in a row, the 1995–96 season ended with renewed optimism, partly from the debut of new star Daniel Alfredsson, who won the Calder Trophy, the NHL rookie of the year award, the first Senator to do so. Alfredsson, selected 133rd overall in 1994, was also selected to play in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game.|$|E

5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being <b>more</b> <b>subdued</b> when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{following}} the death of Corgan's mother and his divorce, 1998's Adore represented a significant change of style from the Pumpkins' previous guitar-based rock, veering into electronica. The record, cut with assistance from drum machines and studio drummers including Matt Walker, was infused with a darker aesthetic than much of the band's earlier work. The group also modified its public image, shedding its alternative rock look for a <b>more</b> <b>subdued</b> appearance. Although Adore received favorable reviews and was nominated for Best Alternative Performance at the Grammy Awards, the album had only sold about 830,000 copies in the United States {{by the end of the}} year, which led the music industry to consider it a failure. The album nonetheless sold three times as many copies overseas. The band began a seventeen-date, fifteen-city charity North American tour in support of Adore. At each stop on the tour, the band donated 100 percent of tickets sales to a local charity organization. The tour's expenses were entirely funded out of the band's own pockets. All told, the band donated over $2.8million to charity as a result of the tour.|$|E
5|$|In 2013–14, Lin was {{replaced}} in the Rockets' starting lineup by Patrick Beverley, and Lin became the second unit's primary ball handler and scoring option as the team's sixth man. Houston liked beginning games with Beverley's defensive pressure, but also preferred increasing Lin's playing time without Harden {{also on the}} court. Lin and Harden were both attacking players offensively, but each struggled defensively. In November, Lin established the highest two-game scoring total of his career, 65 points, including season-highs of 34 points and 11 assists along with a Rockets record-tying nine three-pointers in a start in place of an injured Harden. It {{was followed by a}} 21-point performance in a win at New York. He received a round of applause upon entering the game, though it was <b>more</b> <b>subdued</b> than in his first return against the Knicks. On November 27, Lin sprained his right knee against the Atlanta Hawks, causing him to miss six games. He missed four additional games in December due to back spasms; he started in his return on December 23 with both Harden and Beverley injured—Beverley was estimated to be out four to six weeks due to a fractured right hand. On February 1, 2014, Lin recorded 15 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists—his first career triple-double—in 29 minutes off the bench in a 106–92 home victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was the first Rocket to notch a triple-double off the bench since Cedric Maxwell in 1988. However, he went into a shooting slump after the All-Star break, and again experienced problems with his back.|$|E
50|$|Oblique is {{different}} to Hutcherson's previous sessions, {{because there is}} less emphasis on his original compositions. He contributes three tunes to the date, {{all of which are}} of a <b>more</b> lyrical, <b>subdued</b> style. The one Hancock composition is of a more funky jazz-rock style, yet very laid back, likely {{due to the lack of}} horns. The set closes with two of Chambers' compositions, in his typically ominous and avant-garde manner.|$|R

5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} <b>more</b> <b>subdued</b> tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E

25|$|Realism {{began to}} {{influence}} American drama, partly through Howells, but also through Europeans such as Ibsen and Zola.

25|$|As a reaction, {{simpler and}} more {{delicate}} Neoclassical designs started to appear with <b>more</b> <b>subdued</b> colours.
