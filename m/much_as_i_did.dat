500|$|Although the Queen was {{set against}} Beatrice marrying {{anyone in the}} {{expectation}} that she would always stay at home with her, {{a number of possible}} suitors were put forward before Beatrice's marriage to Prince Henry of Battenberg. One of these was Napoléon Eugéne, the French Prince Imperial, son and heir of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France and his wife, the Empress Eugénie. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon was deposed and moved his family to England in 1870. After the Emperor's death in 1873, Queen Victoria and Empress Eugénie formed a close attachment, and the newspapers reported the imminent engagement of Beatrice to the Prince Imperial. These rumours ended with the death of the Prince Imperial in the Anglo-Zulu War on 1 June 1879. Queen Victoria's journal records their grief: [...] "Dear Beatrice, crying very <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> too, gave me the telegram... It was dawning and little sleep did I get... Beatrice is so distressed; everyone quite stunned." ...|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with a C. He criticized Gilmore's {{performance}} in [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] and earlier episodes, writing that [...] "Gilmore struggles {{to make a}} connection with his character, so it always looks like he’s reading lines," [...] which might {{have a negative effect}} on the Henry's character development. Sava felt that Espenson, based on her previous work, was good at balancing large casts and wrote [...] "this episode juggles the expansive character roster of this series better than its predecessors." [...] Conversely, IGN's Amy Ratcliffe said she has [...] "never liked Henry as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in this episode," [...] especially his explanation to Archie on why he is Jiminy Cricket. Ratcliffe added that Jiminy had the [...] "most touching backstory" [...] of the season up to that point, opining that [...] "the transformation of Dr. Hopper was moving, and this episode maybe felt the most like a fairytale of the stories we've seen so far." [...] She graded [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] with 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode.|$|E
2500|$|After the feat, Wallenda {{said he was}} [...] "not scared at all," [...] but {{admitted}} that the circumstances of Karl's death had haunted him for years. [...] "This has been a dream of mine to recreate this walk", he explained. [...] "To {{be able to walk}} in his exact footsteps is an extremely huge honor, and I did this for him as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it for my family to get some closure." [...] He also called the walk the biggest and most emotional moment of his career to that point. [...] "I can't even put it into words. It was so emotional", he said a week later.|$|E

60|$|Har. Jun. As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> you, {{in saying}} you are fair; or <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> myself, when <b>I</b> declare I die for you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I to sell {{myself because}} they have got money! No, indeed! No one despises money so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> will never be other to them than if I had the money, {{and they were the}} poor relations." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{somewhat}} dashed, blanked idiot,' emended the bank-manager's late partner. 'Thank goodness he lost as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> That's {{some light}} consolation.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{possible}} {{they may}} set us at liberty, {{but in the}} meanwhile you know <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> How did you fall into their hands?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beast! Why, that's my dog Toto, an' he's {{the kindest}} dog {{in all the}} world. Toto knows a good many things, too; 'most <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> guess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My sister, {{a married}} lady, thirty-eight years of age, sees numerals <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> but very indistinctly. She cannot draw a figure {{which is not}} by far too distinct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There they were, and {{she took}} 'em," [...] said the broad-back. Oh, what a look Miss Grogram gave her! [...] "Took them! of course I took them. That is, you took them as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> They were things that we found lying about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Madam Budd, yes; I {{dare say}} it is so, {{and ought to be}} so; and I ask pardon for having said as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But my love for your niece is of so {{animated}} and lastin' a natur', that I scarce know what I did say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not so well as you, if you hated this woman's Salome as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> If it's {{always been}} {{as bad as}} it was to-day you've {{controlled}} yourself wonderfully well never to give me any hint of it, or prepare me for it in the least." ...|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS. Yes; {{but then}} I learn {{so much more}} from my {{experiments}} than he does! And the victims learn <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> That's where my moral superiority comes in.|$|R
60|$|Oh, Basil, let us try to walk straight. Think of your wife, {{who loves}} you also--as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You're {{all the world}} to her. You can't treat her so shamefully.|$|R

60|$|Referring to woman's sphere in life, I'll {{say that}} woman is always right. For twenty-five years I've been a woman's rights man. I have always believed, long before my mother died, that, with her gray hairs and admirable intellect, perhaps she knew as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Perhaps she knew {{as much about}} voting as I.|$|E
60|$|Yes. I'm exhausted. But I {{want to tell}} you, Arthur, I think you're right. The {{worst is}} over. I'm not {{suffering}} quite so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I find it a little easier {{not to think of}} him. When I meet him I can manage to be gay and flippant and indifferent. I'm so glad, Arthur.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir, I {{would much}} rather do that. But really the person to be thanked is the old negress who gave us warning in time to escape, went down and fetched food, {{despatched}} a message to Monsieur Duchesne, and got an answer back, and who did as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in carrying her mistress down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{woman of}} ill-omen. I need thy blessings <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> thy curses. It is my order {{and none of}} thine. Lift and away! Here! Hast thou money for the road?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no {{official}} information, your highness," [...] replied Captain Dashwood. [...] "If you have received such news, you know <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> and probably {{from the same}} source--the public prints." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So much, my dear," [...] {{proceeded}} Sir Patrick, [...] "for those necessary explanations {{which are}} also the necessary nuisances of human intercourse.

Do you understand every thing, so far?" ...|$|E
60|$|I never enjoyed {{myself in}} my life as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> at that ball.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know much}} about angels; but I felt as if I'd met a couple that day, for they saved me from destruction. You cast your bread upon the waters, and it's come back when, maybe, you need it 'most as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> then.

6000|$|... "Yes; in fact, {{she feels}} <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> {{in spite of}} what the doctor said. If Dick hadn't gone to our rescue, he'd have been with us yet. Still, I don't quite understand--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} enjoy it <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> Mr. Atherton," [...] {{the girl said}} indignantly; [...] "else why do you stay upon deck {{all the time in}} spite of the wind and spray?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dora!' said Helen; 'yes, she {{has always}} been tolerably good, but she knows nearly <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Lizzie says she knows the reasons of a {{multiplication}} sum, and I am sure <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Shucks! You get to imagining trouble! Some of {{the gold}} is there all right, and, if it’s needful, I can make a show with that.

60|$|To my {{surprise}} Ja felt <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> He {{said he had}} always hated to war with other Mezops when {{there were so many}} alien races to fight against.

6000|$|... "You {{must allow}} me to reply to that," [...] cried Mrs. Wix, [...] "that you knew nothing of the sort, and that you rather basely failed to back me up last night when you pretended so plump that you did!

6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to {{understand}} that I respect the rights of the poorest and weakest of colored people, oppressed by the slave power, just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> those of the most wealthy and powerful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better, monsieur, {{four out of}} five of the National Guards hate it all <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Will you dine with us to-day, monsieur, and then we can go down {{together}} afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, if {{it would}} make you reproach yourself... but you do like me very much, Sue? Say you do! Say that you do a quarter, a tenth, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> you, and I'll be content!" ...|$|R
