Only the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> was outside of the ideal range. The creek was found to be slightly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 6.82 to 8.07. The average pH of the creek was 7.60 and only the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> was outside of the ideal range. The concentration of total dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 490.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 167.81 milligrams per liter. Only the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> was outside of the ideal range.|$|E
5|$|Cody {{signed a}} four-year, $3.385 million <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> {{contract}} with the Ravens on July 26, 2010. In training camp at McDaniel College, Cody—along with veteran cornerback Walt Harris—failed their conditioning test for the Ravens, and were thus placed on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list. He eventually passed the conditioning test on his third try, allowing {{him to go to}} training camp for the Ravens.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} the 1996 season with Buffalo, Shuey {{was promoted to}} the Indians, where he pitched to a 5–2 record with a 2.85 ERA. He pitched in the postseason for the Indians, appearing in three games in the 1996 American League Division Series, which the Indians lost to the Baltimore Orioles. Shuey received a three-year contract from the Indians {{at the start of}} the 1997 season, worth $3,203,000 guaranteed. An option year and performance bonuses made the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of the contract $11,603,000 over four seasons.|$|E

5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E
5|$|While Sherman {{stood against}} {{printing}} additional greenbacks, {{as late as}} 1872 he remained a proponent of keeping existing greenbacks backed by bonds in circulation. Over the next two years, Sherman worked to develop what became the Specie Payment Resumption Act. The Act was a compromise. It required gradual reduction of the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of greenbacks allowed to circulate to $300 million and, while earlier drafts had allowed the Treasury the choice between paying in bonds or coin, {{the final version of}} the Act required payment in specie, starting in 1879. The bill passed on a party-line vote in the lame duck session of the 43rd Congress, and President Grant signed it into law on January 14, 1875.|$|E
5|$|An Octopus card may store a <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of HK$1,000, with an On-Loan card {{having an}} initial deposit value of HK$50 and a Sold card having no initial deposit value. Negative value is {{incurred}} on a card {{if it is}} used with insufficient funds—both types of cards may carry a maximum negative value of HK$35 before value needs {{to be added to}} them again for use. At the time, the maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the Airport Express and first class of the MTR East Rail line was HK$34.8, the cost of travelling between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Lo Wu Station; the current maximum cost is HK$55.3, the cost of travelling between Disneyland Resort Station and either Lo Wu Station or Lok Ma Chau Station.|$|E

5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E
5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). There is a difference between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> that can be stored on the card. SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E
