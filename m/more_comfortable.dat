5|$|During {{the reign}} of Honoré I the {{internal}} transformation from fortress to palace was continued. The Treaty of Trodesillas {{at the beginning of}} Honoré's rule clarified Monaco's position as a protectorate of Spain, and thus later of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. This provided the security to allow the Lord of Monaco to concentrate on the <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> side of his residence rather than the constant need to defend it.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> and more secure {{and provide the}} divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E
5|$|Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was the {{official}} match ball {{used in the}} final. It was assembled and marketed by German sport firm Adidas, and was the ninth ball in the European Championship series, as well {{as part of the}} Adidas Finale. The ball's design was created by British independent brand specialist company Design Bridge, and influenced by the waters, in the Netherlands and Belgium. The ball contains synthetic foam layers, making it <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> to grip and smoother to control. The Terrestra Silverstream was later unveiled as {{the official}} match ball of the UEFA Euro 2000.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Ogle Tayloe married Julia Maria Dickinson on November 8, 1824. Although Tayloe {{preferred}} {{to live at}} Windsor, his estate in King George County, Virginia, his wife asked that they move into the city, where she was <b>more</b> <b>comfortable.</b> The house was constructed on Lots 10 and 11 in Square 221. At {{the time of the}} building's construction in 1828, the expanse of the city from 15th Street NW (one block east of the home) to 17th Street NW from the White House north to H Street NW was a flat field bare of trees and shrubs.|$|E

5|$|Kennan lost {{influence}} with Acheson, who {{in any case}} relied much less on his staff than Marshall had. Kennan resigned as director of policy planning in December 1949 but stayed in the department as counselor until June 1950. In January 1950, Acheson replaced Kennan with Nitze, who was much <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with the calculus of military power. Afterwards, Kennan accepted an appointment as Visitor to the Institute for Advanced Study from fellow moderate Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Institute.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians in the U.S. are {{estimated}} to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of sexually active adults who had had same-sex experiences within the past year, completed in 2000. A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the first}} Marshalsea, as with the second, was taken up by debtors; in 1773 debtors within 12 miles of Westminster could be imprisoned there for a debt of 40 shillings. Jerry White writes that London's poorest debtors were housed in the Marshalsea. Wealthier debtors secured their removal from the Marshalsea by writ of habeas corpus, and {{arranged}} to be moved to the Fleet or King's Bench, {{both of which were}} <b>more</b> <b>comfortable.</b> The prison also held a small number of men being tried at the Old Bailey for crimes at sea.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina and Washington {{remained}} in active {{duty in the}} years immediately after the war, possibly because they were <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> and less cramped than the four South Dakotas. The ships received alterations during this period; the Ship Characteristics Board(SCB) directed in June 1946 that four of the quadruple-mounted 40mm guns be removed, though only two were actually taken off each ship. The 20mm weapons were also reduced at some point so that both ships were decommissioned with sixteen twin mounts. North Carolina and Washington were decommissioned on 27 June 1947 and subsequently moved to the reserve fleet.|$|E
5|$|Some top riders receive special frames to {{give more}} {{stability}} and comfort. Different materials make the ride <b>more</b> <b>comfortable.</b> Tom Boonen, using a Time frame with longer wheelbase for the first time, won the race in 2005 and has since continued to use a bike with a longer wheelbase. George Hincapie had a frame featuring a 2mm elastomer insert {{at the top of}} the seat stays. The manufacturers claimed this took nearly all the shock out of the cobbles. Hincapie's Trek bicycle fared less well in 2006: his aluminum steerer tube snapped with 46km to go, the crash injuring his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The True Directions program {{involves}} the campers admitting their homosexuality (step 1), rediscovering their gender identity by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding {{the root of}} their homosexuality through family therapy (step 3), demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5). Over {{the course of the}} program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, a college student named Graham (Clea DuVall) who, though <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between light and architecture occurs inevitably. Light, {{depending on how}} it is used can transform the spatial context.

5|$|The {{group and}} Botnick {{organized}} a makeshift recording studio at their private rehearsal space, the Doors' Workshop, in a two-story building at 8512 Santa Monica Boulevard. They could then record in a <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> and relaxed setting while avoiding {{the expenses of}} a professional studio. A mixing console previously owned by Elektra was installed upstairs in the Workshop, while studio monitors, microphones, and keyboards were set up downstairs. To compensate {{for the lack of}} an isolated vocal booth, Morrison recorded in the bathroom doorway, singing into the same microphone used on the Doors' final tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Renaissance on Scottish {{architecture}} began in the reign of James III in the late fifteenth century with the rebuilding of royal palaces such as Linlithgow, and reached its peak under James V. The Reformation had {{a major impact on}} ecclesiastical architecture from the mid-sixteenth century onward, resulting in simple church buildings, devoid of ornamentation. From the 1560s great private houses were built in a distinctive style that became known as Scottish Baronial. Such houses combined Renaissance features with those of Scottish castles and tower houses, resulting in larger, <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> residences.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E

5|$|Estate {{houses in}} Scotland or Scottish country houses, are large houses usually on landed estates in Scotland. They were built from the sixteenth century, after {{defensive}} castles {{began to be}} replaced by <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> residences for royalty, nobility and local lairds. The origins of Scottish estate houses are in aristocratic emulation of the extensive building and rebuilding of royal residences, beginning with Linlithgow, under the influence of Renaissance architecture. In the 1560s the unique Scottish style of the Scots baronial emerged, which combined features from medieval castles, tower houses, and peel towers with Renaissance plans, in houses designed primarily for residence rather than defence.|$|E
5|$|Grin {{announced}} in May 2001 {{that it was}} working on an arcade version of Ballistics for distribution by Triotech.

The inspiration for the design came to Triotech co-founder, Ernest Yale; who whilst putting his feet up on the desk, realised how comfortable the playing position was. Ballistics was released for arcades in January 2002.|$|E
