5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, we <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E
5|$|Thurisind {{features}} {{prominently in}} a tale told by Paul the Deacon set in 552, {{just after the}} death of the king's son Turismod {{and the end of the}} war. The story, generally thought to track its origins to an heroic poem dedicated to Alboin, revolves around the characters of Alboin and Thurisind: in accordance with a custom of the Lombards, to obtain the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> for hospitality from a foreign king and have the latter arm him. To submit himself to this initiation, Alboin went with 40companions to Thurisind's court.|$|E
25|$|Accent or Faccent- This game {{involves}} three callers doing accents. Greg, Chris Smith or a guest <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> {{them three}} questions {{after which they}} must decide which caller(s) is/are doing a real accent (accent), and which are doing a fake accent (faccent). The theme tune is the theme tune to Keeping Up Appearances.|$|E

When the episcopal see is vacant, the {{administrator}} <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> their counsel in all the above-mentioned cases. (iii) Of examiners of the diocesan clergy. They are to be six in number. Their duties are principally to examine the junior clergy, and the candidates for irremovable rectorships.|$|E
25|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that {{if a child is}} {{intelligent}} enough to ask the four questions, the child asks them. If the child is not intelligent enough, the wife asks them. If the wife does not ask the questions, the leader of the seder asks them. And even two scholars who know the laws of Passover <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> one another (if no one else can ask).|$|E
25|$|Owing to its {{recreational}} use {{and theft}} concerns, many retailers in the US have moved dextromethorphan-containing products {{behind the counter}} so that one <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> a pharmacist to receive them or be 18 years (19 in New York, Virginia, California, and Alabama, 21 in Mississippi) or older to purchase them. Some retailers also give out printed recommendations {{about the potential for}} abuse with the purchase of products containing dextromethorphan.|$|E

25|$|Question Period has a {{reputation}} for being quite chaotic due to the commonplace cat-calling and jeering from non-participating MPs, but notwithstanding the heckling, Question Period is actually tightly-regulated. Parties are only allowed to ask a predetermined number of questions based on the size of their caucus, and <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> their questions in a specific order, predetermined by their party leadership for that day on a list given to the Speaker.|$|E
25|$|Windows NT {{kernel mode}} has {{full access to}} the {{hardware}} and system resources of the computer and runs code in a protected memory area. It controls access to scheduling, thread prioritization, memory management and the interaction with hardware. The kernel mode stops user mode services and applications from accessing critical areas of the operating system {{that they should not}} have access to; user mode processes <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> the kernel mode to perform such operations on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|The {{observance}} or {{variation of}} the discipline belongs to the Congregation of Rites; in pontifical processions, which are regulated by the masters of the ceremonies (magistri ceremoniarum pontificalium), these points are decided by the chief cardinal deacon. As to processions within the churches, some difference of opinion having arisen as to the regulating authority, the Congregation of Rites has decided that the bishop <b>must</b> <b>ask,</b> though not necessarily follow, {{the advice of the}} chapter in their regulation.|$|E

25|$|A major {{function}} of the Commission is to regulate the use of violence. For instance, a mafioso who wants to commit a murder in another clan's territory <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> {{the permission of the}} local boss; the commission enforces this rule. Any murder of a mafioso or prominent individual (police, lawyers, politicians, journalists, etc.) must be approved by the commission. Such acts can potentially upset other clans and spark a war, so the Commission provides a means by which to obtain their approval.|$|E

25|$|There {{is always}} a risk that outsiders and {{undercover}} policemen might masquerade as a mafioso to infiltrate the organization. To ensure that this does not happen, a mafioso must never introduce himself to another mafioso whom he does not personally know, even if he knows the other through reputation. If he wants to establish a relationship, he <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> a third mafioso whom they both personally know to introduce them {{to each other in}} a face-to-face meeting. This intermediary can vouch that neither of the two is an impostor.|$|E
5000|$|Lamer {{went into}} great detail on this last step. It <b>must</b> be <b>asked</b> whether the accused had any special {{knowledge}} {{related to their}} conduct that would enhance their foresight. Alternatively, was the accused unaware {{because they did not}} turn their mind to the consequences or because they lacked capacity to do so due to their [...] "human frailties"? If so, it <b>must</b> be <b>asked</b> whether, {{in the context of the}} accused, would a reasonable person have made themselves aware of the consequences of the unlawful act.|$|R

25|$|Game theorists use the Nash {{equilibrium}} {{concept to}} analyze {{the outcome of the}} strategic interaction of several decision makers. In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.|$|E
25|$|The Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust (HART), {{founded by}} Baroness Cox in 2003, works to provide lasting change through aid and {{advocacy}} for those suffering oppression and persecution, who are largely neglected {{by the international}} media. HART believe {{that in order to}} adequately meet the needs and requirements of the persecuted, oppressed and overlooked; we <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> the local people for their priorities, giving them the dignity of choice and the responsibility of their own programmes. Lady Cox travels to HART funded aid and advocacy programmes in Nagorno Karabagh, East and West Burma, East Timor, India, Nigeria, southern Sudan and northern Uganda. An Australian branch of HART was established in 2009.|$|E
25|$|City councilors can run {{as either}} a {{representative}} of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives {{the greatest number of}} votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> to be removed from the ballot for mayor if {{they do not want to}} be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.|$|E

25|$|At Springfield Elementary, Skinner is despondent at {{the thought}} that Edna could leave the school. Groundskeeper Willie lends Skinner his sports car so he can go to Orlando, where he surprises Edna with a kiss under the {{fireworks}} display. They are interrupted by Agnes, whom Skinner brought along, much to Edna's ire. During preparation for the awards ceremony, Skinner is shocked when he hears that the winner receives enough money to be able to retire. He requests Bart to help him sabotage Edna's chances of winning, though he has to resort to blackmail after Bart initially refuses. At the ceremony, each finalist <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> their nominating student a question. When Bart is asked what Edna would like to teach the world, he pretends to be illiterate, until Skinner tells the truth. Skinner asks Edna to marry him, and she agrees. Edna loses the award, but looks forward to marrying Skinner.|$|E
25|$|If one accepts that Shakespeare made a {{conscious}} decision to use Holinshed more frequently during his re-editing of True Tragedy, one <b>must</b> <b>ask</b> why he may have done so. True Tragedy is roughly one thousand lines shorter than 3 Henry VI, and whilst many of the differences are simple aesthetic changes and alternate phraseology (much of which is easily attributable to inaccurate reporting), one major difference between the two that runs throughout is how they each handle violence. On the whole, 3 Henry VI is far more restrained in its depiction of war, whereas True Tragedy has more explicit and sustained on-stage combat and more royal processions and celebrations after combat. Much more so than does 3 Henry VI, True Tragedy conforms to the so-called Tudor myth that the Wars of Roses were God's punishment for people straying from the path laid out for them, and His means of purging the country of evil and opening the way for the righteous Tudor dynasty to establish peace. Traditionally, this has been a common way of interpreting the entire octalogy; advocated and elaborated upon by critics as diverse as August Wilhelm Schlegel, Hermann Ulrici, Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Irving Ribner, M.M. Reese, Robert Rentoul Reed, and, most famously, E.M.W. Tillyard, with whom the phrase Tudor myth is now most associated.|$|E
