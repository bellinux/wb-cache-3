5|$|In late 2008, US forces began {{accelerating}} their {{move out}} of cities across Iraq, turning over the task of maintaining security to Iraqi forces. The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December. Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar, on 19 July 2009. In early August, a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain Scott Speicher, who had been missing in action since the 1991 Gulf War. By 6 October 2009, the last two Marine Regiments had left, ending the American combat presence. Experts and <b>many</b> <b>Iraqis</b> were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks to destabilize the country. There was a spike {{in the number of}} suicide attacks, and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 and appeared to be launching a concerted effort to cripple the government.|$|E

[...] and [...] "Somewhere in Texas, a Village is Missing an Idiot," [...] scrolled across the stage. The music video for [...] "Doesn't Remind Me" [...] was also critical of the Iraq war. Wilk called Bush [...] "a fucking scam" [...] in an interview, criticizing the Bush administration's rationale for war in Iraq.|$|E

500|$|As the Americans withdrew, <b>many</b> <b>Iraqis</b> and Americans {{questioned}} {{the ability of}} the Iraqi security forces, especially the police, to protect the province. Others expressed skepticism over whether Iran would dominate Iraq and whether the Iraqi government would be able to provide security. One angry Iraqi described the American legacy as [...] "total destruction... you just came in, destroyed, and left." [...] Discussing the American withdrawal, a journalist in Fallujah predicted that the Government of Iraq would continue to have trouble with Anbar Province, saying, [...] "Anbar was where instability began in Iraq. It was where stability returned. And it is where instability could start again." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{catalyst for}} violent {{activity in the}} Fallujah area came after what <b>many</b> <b>Iraqis</b> and foreign journalists dubbed a [...] "massacre" [...] in Fallujah. [...] On the evening of 28 April 2003, Saddam Hussein's birthday, a crowd of about one hundred men, women, and children staged anti-American protests outside US military outposts in Fallujah. The Iraqis claimed they were unarmed, while the Army said that some individuals were carrying and firing AK-47s. The soldiers manning one of the outposts fired on the crowd, killing at least twelve and wounding dozens more. [...] The Army never apologized for the killings or paid compensation. In the weeks afterwards, the town's pro-US mayor urged the Americans to leave.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the return}} of {{sovereignty}} to the Iraqi Interim Government on 28 June, the insurgency was still viewed by <b>many</b> <b>Iraqis</b> as legitimate and the Iraqi government as agents of the United States. In late 2004, a CIA officer said that insurgents in Ramadi were receiving financing via Syria [...] "to the tune of $1.2 million a month". The insurgency continued to enjoy broad-based support throughout Iraqi society, showing few of the sectarian divisions which would become pronounced following the 2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing. Shia Iraqis attacked Iraqi military units moving towards Fallujah, Shia leaders called on their supporters to donate blood for insurgents, and Muqtada al-Sadr referred to the insurgents in Fallujah as [...] "holy warriors". Some Shi'ia attempted to join the fighting.|$|E

500|$|In the United States, {{incidents}} like detainee {{abuse and}} the Haditha killings became front-page news, but many Iraqi deaths by American or Iraqi security forces went unreported. [...] While the U.S. military claimed that [...] "the vast majority" [...] of Iraqi deaths {{were caused by}} other Iraqis, incidents like Fallujah and Haditha caused <b>many</b> <b>Iraqis</b> to become embittered towards the Americans. [...] This later led to Iraqi outrage in 2011, when the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a long-term presence in Iraq that would give immunity to American military personnel. [...] Iraqis were further angered by what they perceived as a [...] "travesty of justice" [...] over the lack of convictions of American military personnel.

500|$|Farmers holding grain {{ingested}} it instead, {{since their}} own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed {{free of charge}} or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had. This left them dependent on tainted grain for the winter. <b>Many</b> <b>Iraqis</b> were either unaware of the significant health risk posed, or chose to ignore the warnings. [...] Initially, farmers were to certify with a thumbprint or signature that they understood the grain was poison, but according to some sources, distributors {{did not ask for}} such an indication. Warnings on the sacks were in Spanish and English, not at all understood, or included the black-and-white skull and crossbones design, which meant nothing to Iraqis. The long latent period may have granted farmers a false sense of security, when animals fed the grain appeared to be fine. The red dye washed off the grain; the mercury did not. Hence, washing may have given only the appearance of removing the poison.|$|E
500|$|According to Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha, <b>many</b> <b>Iraqis</b> became disaffected with AQI {{but were}} {{hesitant}} {{to take up}} arms against them out of fear. [...] Sheikh Ahmed said that the biggest complaint about AQI was that they were unable to create a degree of normalcy, and that [...] "people [...] are wearing masks... cannot build the country". [...] Other sheikhs specifically said that the large number of killings and kidnappings by AQI prompted the tribal revolt. [...] AQI leader Ayyub al-Masri practically admitted as much in 2008 when he ordered fighters in Anbar to avoid harming Sunnis who were not working closely with coalition forces and [...] "not interfere in social issues". [...] However, David Kilcullen argued that the abuses themselves may have been less of an issue than AQI disrupting the tribes' smuggling businesses, the belief that AQI was linked to Iran, and their general [...] "high-handed" [...] behavior. [...] He added that, whatever the spark, there was already a perception that AQI [...] "had it coming".|$|E

500|$|As the {{violence}} escalated, the US responded with what <b>many</b> <b>Iraqis</b> called the [...] "senseless use of firepower" [...] and [...] "midnight raids on innocent men". Human Rights Watch accused the Army {{of a pattern}} of [...] "over-aggressive tactics, indiscriminate shooting in residential areas and a quick reliance on lethal force", as well as using [...] "disproportionate force". [...] For example, if Iraqi insurgents set off a land mine, the US would respond by dropping bombs on those houses with arms caches; when insurgents fired a mortar round at American positions near Fallujah, the Americans responded with heavy artillery. American forces near Al Qaim conducted [...] "hard knocks" [...] on local residents, kicking in doors and manhandling individuals, only to discover they were innocent. In an incident on 11 September, soldiers manning a checkpoint near Fallujah shot multiple rounds at both an Iraqi police truck and a nearby hospital, killing seven. Soldiers also beat and abused Iraqi detainees. There was a constant rotation of units through the province, which led to confusion among the American troops: Fallujah had five different battalions rotate through in five months. Summing up the initial American approach to Al Anbar, Keith Mines, the CPA diplomat in Anbar Province, wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2006, Colonel Sean MacFarland and the 1st Brigade Combat Team (BCT) of the 1st Armored Division {{were sent}} to Ramadi. Colonel MacFarland was told to [...] "Fix Ramadi, but don't do a Fallujah." [...] <b>Many</b> <b>Iraqis</b> assumed the 1st BCT was {{preparing}} for exactly that type of operation, with over 77 M1 Abrams tanks and 84 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, but Colonel MacFarland had another plan. Prior to Ramadi, the 1st BCT had been stationed in {{the northern city of}} Tal Afar, where Colonel H. R. McMaster in 2005 had pioneered a new type of operation: [...] "Clear, Hold, Build". Under McMaster's approach, his commanders saturated an area with soldiers until it had been cleared of insurgents, then held it until Iraqi security forces were gradually built to a level where they could assume control. As in other offensive operations, many insurgents fled the city in anticipation of a big battle. The 1st BCT moved into some of Ramadi's most dangerous neighborhoods and, beginning in July, built four of what would eventually become eighteen Combat Outposts. The soldiers brought the territory under control and inflicted many casualties on the insurgents in the process. On 24 July, AQI launched a counterattack, launching 24 assaults, each with about 100 fighters, on American positions. Despite the reported presence of AQI leader Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the insurgents failed in all of their attacks and lost about 30 men. Several senior American officers, including General David Petraeus, later compared the fighting to the Battle of Stalingrad. Despite the success, Multi-National Force– Iraq continued to view Ramadi as a secondary front to the ongoing civil war in Baghdad and considered moving two of Colonel MacFarland's battalions to Baghdad. Colonel MacFarland even publicly described his operations as [...] "trying to take the heat off Baghdad." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{invasion}} and occupation led to sectarian violence which caused widespread displacement among Iraqi civilians. The Iraqi Red Crescent organization estimated the total internal displacement was around 2.3 million in 2008, {{and as many}} as 2 million Iraqis leaving the country.

The invasion led to a constitution which supported democracy as long as laws did not violate traditional Islamic principles, and a parliamentary election was held in 2005. In addition the invasion preserved the autonomy of the Kurdish region, and stability brought new economic prosperity. Because the Kurdish region is historically the most democratic area of Iraq, <b>many</b> <b>Iraqi</b> refugees from other territories fled into the Kurdish land.|$|R
