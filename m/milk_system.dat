This paper presents a pre-study, looking for discursive grounds by which institutional consumers make choices when confronted with the knowledge of GHG emission characteristics of five optional milk systems. The milk systems to be compared in terms of agricultural GHG emissions were (Option I) conventional <b>milk</b> <b>system</b> based on imported soy protein feed, (Option II) conventional <b>milk</b> <b>system</b> using domestic protein source and (Option III) organic <b>milk</b> <b>system,</b> as well as vegetable milk systems based on (Option IV) imported soy and (Option V) domestic oat. The discursive turn to these optional milk systems was taken by five catering information professionals, who tried to respond to the idea of catering for sustainability. The results revealed four different discourses, with variable ability to make use of emission information when systemic change is to be approached in everyday productive activities. Regarding emission information, the least sensitive discourse was the one of modernization, emphasising the use of conventional, cheap products. Sustainability and ecological modernization discourses exhibited most imaginative and novel solutions in productive activities. Bioregionalism discourse joined other discourses connecting them with the idea of domestic production. The discourses identified in this pre-study were, however, very fine-grained and intermingled, offering rather lean support for novel choices. Additionally the market position of organic milk suffered due to emission information, stressing heavily the reliability of environmental information as a ‘change agent’ on the market. ...|$|E

The beverage for the dyphagia patients should have the apparent viscosity {{in the range of}} nectar-like (51 to 350 mPa•s) or honey-like (351 to 1750 mPa•s). Due to the swallowing problems, dysphagia patients usually consume beverages slowly. Thus, the apparent viscosity of beverage for such patients should be high enough to be in the suitable range during the entire time of consumption. Three ratios of α-lactalbumin (α-la) /β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) (3 : 8, 1 : 1 and 8 : 3) were used to prepare the <b>milk</b> <b>systems.</b> These ratio adjusted <b>milk</b> <b>systems</b> were either processed at 70, 80, and 90 ºC for 30 min or at 25 ºC, and cooled to 25 ± 1 ºC. After the process was completed, the <b>milk</b> <b>systems</b> were set quiescently 120 min at 25 ± 1 ºC. Physical and chemical properties were assessed at various time. For the <b>milk</b> <b>systems</b> at 0 min, the apparent viscosity increased in all 90 °C processed-samples, and the increase was in the order of 8 : 3 (15. 96 %), 1 : 1 (6. 38 %) and 3 : 8 (2. 11 %) compared with the 25 ºC samples at each ratio. When the <b>milk</b> <b>systems</b> set for 120 min, apparent viscosity increased slightly by 3. 7 %. The maximum apparent viscosity was 2. 18 mPa•s, which was less than nectar-like.

This project aimed to characterize B. amyioliquefaciens' virulence potential in comparison to Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, a well-established toxigenic type strain. Pure cultures of Bacillus spp. isolated from UHT pasteurized milk were identified to the species level using fatty acid profiling and rDNA sequencing. Confirmation {{of the presence of}} pieR and codY regulator genes and nheA and hbiC enterotoxin genes was done using real-time PCR. RNA isolation from cultures grown in a model <b>milk</b> <b>system</b> was completed at predetermined time points from a growth curve, and target gene mRNA was amplified with real-time NASBA using a bioMerieux kit and transcript-specific primers to assess relative expression levels for each gene target. Biofilm production was monitored over 12 days in a model <b>milk</b> <b>system</b> on glass, stainless steel, and waxed paperboard, and the chemical composition of the biofilms was analyzed using complex carbohydrate analyses. We expect the rate of biofilm formation and composition to vary according to the type of solid support on which the biofilm forms. For real-time NASBA expression studies, no significant difference was measured between B. amyloiiquefaciens and B. cereus ATCC 14579 in mean cycle threshold values (relative expression levels) of 16 s rRNA (p= 0. 249), pieR (p= 0. 188), codY (p= 0. 465), and hb/C (p= 0. 148).

40|$|AbstractThe milk {{production}} of a dairy cow is characterized by lactation production, which is calculated from daily milk yields (DMY) during lactation. The DMY is calculated from one or more milkings a day collected at the farm. Various <b>milking</b> <b>systems</b> are in use today, resulting in one or many recorded milk yields a day, from which different calculations are used to determine DMY. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to develop a mathematical function that described {{milk production}} of a dairy cow in relation to the interval between 2 milkings. The function was partly based on the biology of the milk production process. This function, called the 3 K-function, was able to predict milk production over an interval of 12 h, so DMY was twice this estimate. No external information is needed to incorporate this function in methods to predict DMY. Application of the function on data from different <b>milking</b> <b>systems</b> showed a good fit. This function could be a universal tool to predict DMY for a variety of <b>milking</b> <b>systems,</b> and it seems especially useful for data from robotic <b>milking</b> <b>systems.</b> Further study is needed to evaluate the function under a wide range of circumstances, and to see how it can be incorporated in existing <b>milk</b> recording <b>systems.</b> A secondary objective of using the 3 K-function was to compare how much DMY based on different <b>milking</b> <b>systems</b> differed from that based on a twice-a-day milking.

The possibility of the same Pseudomonas spp. patterns are distributed in different farms and seasons using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) technique was demonstrated. Milkers’ hands, surface of cows’ teats, teat cups and cooling tanks were associated with raw milk contamination with Pseudomonas spp. on farms with manual and mechanical <b>milking</b> <b>system,</b> showing that regardless of the type of <b>milking</b> <b>system</b> and season, proper hygiene procedures of equipment, utensils and workers’ hands are essential to avoid contamination of the milk and, therefore, improve milk quality...|$|R
40|$|Producer surveys showed very {{positive}} results in switching from previous <b>milking</b> <b>systems</b> to AMS systems. An average of 12 % more cows {{are able to}} be milked {{with an average of}} 75 % less labor. Production increased 12 % while SCC dropped 36 %. Feeding and housing efficiencies were gained as well. In sum, Automatic <b>Milking</b> <b>Systems</b> gave a {{very positive}} quality of life and milking labor advantage over producer’s previous systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} two {{experimental}} programs financed to the Istituto Sperimentale per la Zootecnia are presented. The {{objective of the}} two Italian programs was the verify if automatic milking is a suitable practice for Italian dairy system. Results are summarised and compared to those obtained in other international projects. Results refer to animal behaviour, milk yield, milk quality an animal welfare. In a trial comparing cows milked with an automatic <b>milking</b> <b>system</b> and cows <b>milked</b> in a milking parlour, we observed that when the temperature and humidity are very high cows reduce their activity, have lower milking frequency and milk yield than in cold seasons. In comparison to milking parlour, automatic <b>milking</b> <b>system</b> did not increase milk yield which was affected significantly by season, stage of lactation, parity, season per treatment and parity per treatment. The causes of the negative results obtained by this group and by other international groups are discussed. We also presented the results obtained in four trials thereby four appetizers or flavourings were tested to improve efficiency of automatic <b>milking</b> <b>system.</b> Comparing the two <b>milking</b> <b>systems,</b> automatic <b>milking</b> determined a worsening of milk quality, but from these data {{is not possible to}} exclude the possibility to use automatic milking for Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano-type cheeses. Animal welfare is not negatively influenced by automatic <b>milking</b> <b>system,</b> which has the potentiality to improve the control and care of cows...|$|R
