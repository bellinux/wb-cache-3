5|$|Air-Cobot (Aircraft Inspection {{enhanced}} by smaRt & Collaborative rOBOT) is a French {{research and development}} project of a wheeled collaborative mobile robot able to inspect aircraft during <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> This multi-partner project involves research laboratories and industry. Research around this prototype was developed in three domains: autonomous navigation, nondestructive testing and human-robot collaboration.|$|E
5|$|The human operator's eyes fatigue {{over time}} while an {{automatic}} solution ensures reliability and repeatability of inspections. The decrease in time taken for inspections {{is a major}} objective for aircraft manufacturers and airlines. If <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> are faster, this will optimize the availability of aircraft and reduce maintenance operating costs.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft are {{inspected}} during <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> either outdoors on {{an airport}} between flights, or in a hangar for longer-duration inspections. These inspections are conducted mainly by human operators, visually and sometimes using tools to assess defects. The project aims to improve inspections of aircraft and traceability. A database dedicated to each aircraft type, containing images and three-dimensional scans, will be updated after each maintenance. This allows for example {{to assess the}} propagation of a crack.|$|E

5|$|The Waqf Ministry of Jordan held {{control of}} the al-Aqsa Mosque until the 1967 Six-Day War. After Israel's victory in that war, Israel {{transferred}} the {{control of the}} mosque and the northern Noble Sanctuary to the Islamic waqf trust, who are independent of the Israeli government. However, Israeli Security Forces are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque. After the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.|$|E

Faulty in building design can lead to many maintenance problem in the building and lead to building defects. The aimed for this research is aimed to establish the criteria of faulty building design that affect <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> of state mosque. The methodology used in this study was based on semi-structure interview and fieldwork to determine faulty in building design and identify the factor in faulty building design that affect <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation..</b> Three (3) case studies at Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin Mosque, Putrajaya, Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Mosque, Selangor and Malacca Straits Mosque, Melaka have been selected to do this research. Each of the respondents at the building has been involved in <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> work which is Facility Manager and Head of Building Management. This research resulted that three main factors of building design that affect <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> which is defect in design, defect in material and defect in maintenance.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the existing approach to automobiles technical maintenance in agriculture. We have pointed out that in modern conditions it is impossible to forecast the automobiles <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> frequency and as a result its improvement as well. It is obvious that one cannot achieve the considerable increase of <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> efficiency by separate means and there exist the necessity to treat it as a system and use the up-to-date methods to investigate and improve complicated systems. We have made a conclusion that the increase of <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> efficiency is not possible without some rational strategy of <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> and repair. We have shown that the program of <b>maintenance</b> <b>operation</b> and repair being an integral part of automobiles technical maintenance has considerable effect on maintenance and repair quality. As a result, there is some necessity of the developed system of parameters diagnosing and control in technical maintenance and repair. We have shown that to get sufficient diagnose information one needs selection of the controlled parameters which give maximum information about the object technical status taking into account possible characteristics of its operational faults. We have discovered that in order to solve the task it is necessary to have the object’s information pattern, calculation of possible characteristics of the controlled object being in good or bad order due to some parts fault, evaluation of information brought by every parameter and determining parameters to be diagnosed. We have proposed to evaluate the parameters’ information value with the help of information entropy as uncertainty measure {{that is one of the}} main concepts of the information theory.
