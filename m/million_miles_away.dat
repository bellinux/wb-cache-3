The telescope was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight <b>million</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> It also received data from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was {{launched}} April 24, 1990, and was deployed April 25 into low Earth orbit (LEO). It was {{soon discovered that}} the metal poles holding the solar arrays were expanding and contracting as the telescope orbited the Earth passing between the sunlight and the Earth s shadow. The expansion and contraction, although very small, was enough to cause the telescope to shake because of thermal-induced jitters, a detrimental effect when trying to take pictures <b>millions</b> of <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Therefore, the European Space Agency (ESA, the provider of the solar arrays) built new solar arrays (SA- 11) that contained bi-stem thermal shields which insulated the solar array metal poles.

The new solar arrays were put on the HST during an extravehicular activity (EVA), also called an astronaut space walk, during the first servicing mission (SM 1) in December 1993.
