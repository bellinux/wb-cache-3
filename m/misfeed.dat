50|$|The {{development}} of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter revealed that the T171 Vulcan (later redesignated M61) suffered problems with its linked ammunition, being prone to <b>misfeed</b> and presenting a foreign object damage (FOD) hazard with discarded links. A linkless ammunition feed system was developed for the upgraded M61A1, which subsequently became the standard cannon armament of U.S. fighters.|$|E
50|$|A <b>misfeed</b> {{can occur}} when the metal strip is fed through the {{blanking}} machine. The punches sometimes overlap {{the leading edge of}} the metal producing a straight clip. Sometimes, the punches strike an area of the strip which overlaps the hole left by the previous strike producing a curved clip. Sometimes punches strike the irregular trailing edge of the metal strip producing irregular clips.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{armament}} of the F-104 was the 20 mm M61 Vulcan autocannon. As {{the first}} aircraft {{to carry the}} weapon, testing of the Starfighter revealed issues with the initial version of the M61: the Gatling-mechanism cannon suffered problems with its linked ammunition, being prone to <b>misfeed</b> and presenting a foreign object damage (FOD) hazard with discarded links. A linkless ammunition feed system was developed for the upgraded M61A1 installed in the F-104C; the M61A1 has subsequently been used by {{a wide variety of}} American combat aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Both the Mk and {{the later}} Miki {{suffered}} chronic <b>misfeeds</b> {{due to the}} internal design of the gun {{and the location of}} the magazine {{at the side of the}} gun. Had McCrudden relocated the magazine to the top he may well have had a successful design.|$|R
50|$|The Tippmann TiPX is {{the second}} {{generation}} of the pistol. The second generation mostly included fixes to the valve and regulator, and also combined the both into one solid piece. The Tru-Feed magazine was also introduced to correct <b>misfeeding</b> that the 8-round magazines would occasionally have. Tippmann {{has been known to}} send owners of the TPX new TiPX internals in trade for the old ones, and also trade in the old 8-round magazines for the 7 round Tru-Feed magazines.|$|R
5000|$|The PPSh drum {{magazine}} holds 71 rounds. In practice, <b>misfeeding</b> {{is likely to}} occur with more than about 65. [...] In addition to feed issues, the {{drum magazine}} is slower and more complicated to load with ammunition than the later 35-round box magazine that increasingly supplemented the drum after 1942. While holding fewer rounds, the box magazine does {{have the advantage of}} providing a superior hold for the supporting hand. Although the PPSh is equipped with a sliding bolt safety, the weapon's open-bolt design still presents a risk of accidental discharge if the gun is dropped on a hard surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{coated paper}} of {{magazines}} and bound textbooks {{can make them}} difficult for the rollers in an ADF {{to pick up and}} guide along the paper path. An ADF which uses a series of rollers and channels to flip sheets over may jam or <b>misfeed</b> when fed coated paper. Generally there are fewer problems by using as straight of a paper path as is possible, with few bends and curves. The clay can also rub off the paper over time and coat sticky pickup rollers, causing them to loosely grip the paper. The ADF rollers may need periodic cleaning to prevent this slipping.|$|E
5000|$|Made by {{a variety}} of manufacturers, often with {{subcontracted}} parts, some early Sten guns were made poorly and/or not made to specification, and could malfunction in operation, sometimes in combat. The double-column, single-feed magazine copied from the German MP28 was never completely satisfactory, and hasty manufacturing processes often exacerbated <b>misfeed</b> problems inherent in the design. A common statement heard from British forces at the time was that the Sten was made [...] "by Marks and Spencer out of Woolworth." [...] British and Commonwealth forces {{in the early years of}} the war often extensively test-fired their weapons in training to weed out bad examples; a last-minute issue of newly manufactured Stens prior to going into action was not always welcomed.|$|E
50|$|By late 2002, 89 {{percent of}} U.S. troops {{reported}} they were confident with the M4, {{but they had}} a range of problems. 34 percent of users said the handguards rattled and became excessively hot when firing, and 15 percent had trouble zeroing the M68 Close Combat Optic. 35 percent added barber brushes and 24 percent added dental picks to their cleaning kits. There were many malfunctions, including 20 percent of users experiencing a double feed, 15 percent experiencing feeding jams, and 13 percent saying that feeding problems were due to magazines. 20 percent of users were dissatisfied with weapon maintenance. Some had trouble locking the magazine into the weapon and having to chamber a round in order to lock the magazine. Soldiers also asked for a larger round to be able to kill targets with one shot. New optics and handguards made usage of the M4 easier, and good weapon maintenance reduced the number of <b>misfeeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additional {{problems}} {{stemmed from}} the Sten's magazine, which was a direct copy of the one used in the German MP-38, originally {{in order to facilitate}} the use of German 9 mm magazines. Unfortunately, this decision necessarily incorporated the Erma magazine's faults in the process. The magazine had two columns of 9 mm cartridges in a staggered arrangement, merging at the top to form a single column. While other staggered magazines, such as the Thompson, fed from both the left and right side alternately (double-column, double feed), the Sten magazine, like the MP38, required the cartridges to gradually merge {{at the top of the}} magazine to form a single column (double column, single feed). As a consequence, any dirt or foreign matter in this taper area could cause feed malfunctions. Additionally, the walls of the magazine lip had to endure the full stresses of the rounds being pushed in by the spring. This, along with rough handling could result in deformation of the magazine lips (which required a precise 8° feed angle to operate), resulting in <b>misfeeding</b> and a failure to fire.|$|R
5000|$|Externally, the TT-33 is {{very similar}} to John Browning's {{blowback}} operated FN Model 1903 semiautomatic pistol, and internally it uses Browning's short recoil tilting-barrel system from the M1911 pistol. In other areas the TT-33 differs more from Browning's designs — it employs a much simpler hammer/sear assembly than the M1911. This assembly is removable from the pistol as a modular unit and includes machined magazine feed lips preventing <b>misfeeds</b> when a damaged magazine was loaded into the magazine well. Soviet engineers made several alterations to make the mechanism easier to produce and maintain, most notably the simplifications of the barrel's locking lugs, allowing fewer machining steps. Some models use a captive recoil spring secured to the guide rod which does depend on the barrel bushing to hold it under tension. The TT-33 is chambered for the 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge, which was itself based on the similar 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge used in the Mauser C96 pistol. The 7.62×25mm cartridge is powerful, has an extremely flat trajectory, and is capable of penetrating thick clothing and soft body armor. Able to withstand tremendous abuse, large numbers of the TT-33 were produced during World War II and well into the 1950s. In modern times the robust TT-33 has been converted to many extremely powerful cartridges including [...]38 Super and 9×23mm Winchester. The TT-33 omitted a safety catch other than the half cock notch which rendered the trigger inoperable until the hammer was pulled back to full cock and then lowered manually to the half cock position. Many imported variants have manual safeties added, which vary greatly in placement and function.|$|R
