5|$|The Llanberis Path is {{the longest}} route to the summit, and has the shallowest gradient. It largely follows {{the line of the}} Snowdon <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway,</b> and is {{considered}} the easiest and least interesting route to the summit of Snowdon. It is the route used by the annual Snowdon Race, with a record time of less than 40 minutes recorded from the start to the summit.|$|E
5|$|The first {{building}} on the summit of Snowdon was erected in 1838 to sell refreshments, and a licence to sell intoxicating liquor was granted in 1845. Very basic accommodation was also provided for visitors. When the Snowdon <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway</b> was opened in 1896, it added its own accommodation and sales outlet near the summit.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>railways</b> often, but by {{no means}} always, use narrow gauge to allow for tight curves in the track and reduce tunnel size and {{structure}} gauge, and hence construction cost and effort. Where a <b>mountain</b> <b>railways</b> need to climb steep gradients, they may use steep grade railway technology, or even operate as funicular railways.|$|R
5|$|On 14 April 1951, the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway, the South Indian Railway and the Mysore State Railway were merged to {{form the}} Southern Railway, the first zone of Indian Railways. The South Central zone was created on 2 October 1966 as the ninth zone of Indian Railways and the South Western zone was created on 1 April 2003. Most of the region is covered by the three zones with small {{portions}} of coasts covered by East Coast Railway and Konkan Railway. Metro rail is operated by Namma Metro in Bangalore, Chennai Metro in Chennai and Hyderabad Metro in Hyderabad. Chennai MRTS provides suburban rail services in Chennai {{and was the first}} elevated railway line in India. The Nilgiri <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway</b> is a UNESCO World Heritage site.|$|E
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway,</b> which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
25|$|Two other {{railways}} on Sodor {{are directly}} based on real railways. The Culdee Fell Railway (usually {{known as the}} <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway)</b> {{is based on the}} Snowdon <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway,</b> also in Wales. The Small Railway, more correctly known as the Arlesdale Railway, is based on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway in Cumbria. Some other lines on Sodor are heavily inspired by real lines. For example, Duke's railway (the Mid Sodor Railway) acknowledges the Ffestiniog and Corris Railway and Duck's branch line (aka the Little Western) bears a resemblance to the South Devon Railway.|$|E

25|$|David J. Macpherson (b. 1854, Ontario, Canada), a civil {{engineer}} from Cornell University and a newcomer to Pasadena (1885), proposed a steam driven cog wheel train to reach the crest via Mount Wilson. It wasn't until he {{was introduced to the}} millionaire Thaddeus S. C. Lowe (arrived in Pasadena 1890) that a fully funded plan could be put into action. The two men visited Colorado to view the <b>mountain</b> <b>railway</b> to Pike's Peak. Lowe was impressed with the trolley car systems in the city and thought that should be the way to go. This would make the Mount Lowe Railway the only electric traction rail line ever to be put into scenic <b>mountain</b> <b>railway</b> service.|$|E
25|$|The town is in a South Wales Valleys {{environment}} {{just south}} of the Brecon Beacons National Park, and this, along with its rich history, means it has huge potential for tourism.

25|$|The island {{used to have}} an {{extensive}} narrow-gauge railway system, both steam-operated and electric, {{but the majority of}} the steam railway tracks were taken out of service many years ago, and the track removed. As of 2017, there is a steam railway between Douglas and Port Erin, an electric railway between Douglas and Ramsey and an electric <b>mountain</b> <b>railway</b> which climbs Snaefell.|$|E

25|$|The Manx Electric Railway is an {{electric}} interurban tramway connecting Douglas, Laxey and Ramsey in the Isle of Man. It connects with the Douglas Bay Horse Tramway at its southern terminus at Derby Castle {{at the northern}} end of the promenade in Douglas, and with the Snaefell <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway</b> at Laxey. The line is undulating and passes through areas of scenic beauty. Many visitors take an excursion on the trams.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the {{government}} of Himachal Pradesh declared the railway a heritage property. For about a week starting on 11 September 2007, an expert team from UNESCO visited the railway to review and inspect it for possible selection as a World Heritage Site.

25|$|The {{line was}} privatised in 1989, {{the first part}} of BR to be privatised, being sold to Peter Rampton and Tony Hills (the late owner and General Manager of the Brecon <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway).</b> In 1996, Rampton and Hills split their partnership, with Hills {{retaining}} control of the Brecon, and the Rheidol being sold to a trust formed by Rampton, the Phyllis Rampton Narrow Gauge Railway Trust. Unusually, the VoR operated completely without volunteers for approximately the first 20 years of its privatised operation.|$|E

At {{the same time}} there was a more general reconfiguration involving the routes into the city of other local meter gauge <b>mountain</b> <b>railways,</b> which also involved an expansion of the city tram network. A new tram line was constructed linking local termini of <b>mountain</b> <b>railways</b> with the city centre. This line ran from the Staatsbahnhof (main station) to the Dollinger Inn at the [...] "Chain Bridge".|$|R

25|$|The Wairarapa railcars {{hold the}} fastest speeds for {{operations}} over the Rimutaka Incline. Passenger services were previously slow trains {{operated by the}} H class locomotives specially built to operate on the Fell <b>mountain</b> <b>railway</b> system employed on the Incline. The Wairarapa railcars were designed to operate unaided on the Incline, and as they were lighter and more nimble, they achieved speeds well in excess of any service operated by an H class (or any of the few other engines occasionally permitted {{to work on the}} Incline).|$|E
25|$|In 1891, Lowe and Macpherson {{incorporated}} the Pasadena & Mount Wilson Railroad (later the Mount Lowe Railway). Unable to obtain all {{the rights of}} way to Mt. Wilson, the two men redirected their railway toward Oak Mountain via the Echo promontory. The difference between this and any other scenic <b>mountain</b> <b>railway</b> of its kind {{was that it was}} an all-electric traction trolley (streetcar), the only one of its kind to ever exist. Oak Mountain was later renamed Mount Lowe, and to make it official, Andrew McNally, the co-founder of the map printing company Rand McNally who had moved to Altadena, had the name Mt. Lowe printed on all his maps.|$|E
25|$|The first section, {{from the}} {{northern}} end of the promenade at Douglas to Groudle Glen, opened in 1893, to Laxey in 1894 (the Snaefell <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway</b> opened the following year from Laxey) and Ramsey in 1899. The first section was built by Douglas Bay Estates Ltd., and by 1894 the tramway had been acquired by the Douglas & Laxey Electric Tramway Co. Ltd, which changed its name to the Isle of Man Tramways & Electric Power Co. Ltd (I.o.M.T.&.E.P.) the same year. The I.o.M.T.&.E.P. went into liquidation in 1900 {{as a consequence of the}} collapse of Dumbell's Bank. The line was sold by the liquidator to the newly formed Manx Electric Railway Co. Ltd, which took over in 1902. By the late 1950s the company was in financial difficulties, and in 1957 it was acquired by the Isle of Man Government (which carried out a similar move two decades later to save the Isle of Man Railway). A nationalisation livery of green and white was applied to some trams and trailers for a limited time, though this was unpopular and later dropped. A government Board was formed to manage the line and the Snaefell <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway,</b> and still does so after various changes of title from the original Manx Electric Railway Board to Isle of Man Passenger Transport Board, now Isle of Man Heritage Railways (the word heritage being added in 2009). This is a division of the Department of Community, Culture & Leisure of the Isle of Man Government, and is also operates the island's buses as Bus Vannin.|$|E

25|$|Construction {{beginning}} in 1829, the Little Schuylkill Railroad ran from Port Clinton northward to Mahanoy Junction above Tamaqua. It {{would become the}} keystone of the Philadelphia and Reading system, serving as a gauntlet for its eastern and western branches. Connecting with it were four important lines. The 146 mile (235km) Catawissa Railroad operated from Mahanoy Junction to West Milton, providing access to the Mahanoy region by joining the northern terminus of the Little Schuylkill with connections to New York City and Scranton. At Port Clinton, it connected with the P's main line from Mount Carbon. Its most important connection would be with the Mahanoy and Broad <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway</b> via Mahanoy Tunnel and East Mahanoy Railroad.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the line opened in 1874 between Wellington and Lower Hutt, with the entire line to Woodville {{completed}} in 1897. It was the only New Zealand Government Railways route out of Wellington until 1908, when the government bought out the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company who owned and operated the present North Island Main Trunk section between Wellington and Palmerston North. The line originally included the famous Rimutaka Incline, which used the Fell <b>mountain</b> <b>railway</b> system to cross the Rimutaka Range between Upper Hutt and Featherston. In the mid-1950s, the line between Petone and Featherston was substantially realigned, with the line diverted to the east of the Hutt River between Petone and Haywards to serve new housing developments in northern Lower Hutt, and the construction of the Rimutaka Tunnel to replace the Rimutaka Incline. Part of the former route west of the Hutt River has been retained as the Melling Branch.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the number}} of open and ungated level {{crossings}} there are minor collisions, and these are reported in the local press. These have become more commonplace but are usually minor; warning signage to alert motorists that trams are operating has been erected at the start of each season in recent times, but incidents still occur. There are many occupation crossings, some with restricted visibility for motorists. The most recent incident took place on Monday, 27 July 2009, when a vehicle carrying a mechanical excavator came into contact with the overhead wires supplying power to both the line and the Snaefell <b>Mountain</b> <b>Railway</b> at a busy road crossing in Laxey; there were no injuries. Police and the line's electrical engineering crews attended the scene, the report also said. It did not indicate what damage had occurred. Service resumed the next day after temporary repairs to the overhead lines, which were permanently repaired over the subsequent couple of weeks. An investigation into the incident was scheduled to take place later.|$|E

50|$|The boilers are {{inclined}} {{to ensure that the}} boiler tubes and the firebox are always covered by water when on the gradient. This is a standard practice on <b>mountain</b> <b>railways</b> as the locomotive always runs chimney-first up the mountain. The cylinders are mounted towards the cab end of the locomotive (rather than the chimney end, which is more conventional for a steam locomotive), hence Awdry's 'back-to-front' description. The drive to the wheels is through a series of levers that allow the pistons to have a longer stroke than the cranks. This is another common feature in <b>mountain</b> <b>railways.</b>|$|R
