5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). <b>Microscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E
5|$|Tremella mesenterica {{may also}} be {{confused}} {{with members of the}} Dacrymycetaceae family, like Dacrymyces chrysospermus (formerly D.palmatus), due to their superficial resemblance. <b>Microscopic</b> <b>examination</b> shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have Y-shaped basidia with two spores, unlike the longitudinally split basidia characteristic of Tremella; additionally, D.chrysospermus is smaller, has a whitish attachment point to its substrate, and grows on conifer wood.|$|E

5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} most {{commonly}} transmitted by an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites {{travel to the}} liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by P.falciparum because P.vivax, P.ovale, and P.malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species P.knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of T. cruzi is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It {{can be detected}} by <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of fresh anticoagulated blood, or its buffy coat, for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with Giemsa, for direct visualization of parasites. Microscopically, T. cruzi can be confused with Trypanosoma rangeli, which is not known to be pathogenic in humans. Isolation of T. cruzi can occur by inoculation into mice, by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by xenodiagnosis, where uninfected Reduviidae bugs are fed on the patient's blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{monitored}} resonant {{behavior of}} fatigue specimens of metastable {{austenitic stainless steel}} (AISI 304) is correlated with its damage accumulation in the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime. The resonant behavior is studied experimentally and shows a distinct transient characteristic. <b>Microscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> indicate that during VHCF a localized plastic deformation in shear bands arises on the specimen surface. Hence, this work focuses {{on the effect of}} damage accumulation in shear bands on the resonant behavior of AISI 304 in the VHCF regime. A microstructural simulation model is proposed that takes into account specific mechanisms in shear bands proven by experimental results. The simulation model is solved numerically using the two-dimensional boundary element method and the resonant behavior is characterized by evaluating the force-displacement hysteresis loop. Simulation of shear bands agrees well with <b>microscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> and plastic deformation in shear bands influences the transient characteristic of the resonant behavior...|$|R

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{is usually}} {{confirmed}} by the <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). In some areas, RDTs {{need to be able}} to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections. Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his <b>microscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of {{the hair on the}} lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's.

An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E

A total of 597 vaginal exudates from pregnant women who were examined at the Hospital de Clinicas in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 1 August 2005 to 31 January 2007, were prospectively and consecutively evaluated. The investigation of Trichomonas vaginalis was made by different <b>microscopic</b> <b>examinations,</b> and culture on liquid medium. The sensitivity and specificity of the <b>microscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> were assessed considering culture on liquid medium as the "gold standard". The prevalence of T. vaginalis obtained by culture on liquid medium was 4. 0 % (24 / 597). The prevalence of T. vaginalis obtained by direct wet smear, prolonged May-Grunwald Giemsa staining, and sodium acetate-formalin (SAF) /methylene blue staining-fixing technique was 1. 8 %, 2. 3 % and 2. 5 %, respectively.
