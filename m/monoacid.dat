The feasibility of such a process can be established only by investigating all the equilibria involved during the process of extraction. Initially, a detailed study of the mechanism known as reaction at the interface made it possible to touch the limits of application of this model when the operational parameters change, thus, this criticism led to a revision of the assumptions on which this model is founded. Taking into account the solubility of Tributylphosphate in aqueous phase, a model known as of reaction in the aqueous phase was proposed. It was applied successfully to five <b>monoacids</b> with a broad area of initial concentration of acid, three solvent ratios and eight concentration of extractant (TBP) diluted in dodecane.

40|$|I {{started a}} study of polar organic {{compounds}} in the atmosphere of Los Angeles and its vicinity in early 1980 s, when acid rain problems became an important environmental issue. In late 1980 s, another two problems were recognized to be serious; i. e., global warming due to the increased greenhouse gases and depletion of stratospheric ozone discovered over Antarctica. I have developed GC and GC/MS methods to determine various organic compounds in the atmosphere including water-soluble mono- (C 1 -C 10) and di-carboxylic (C 2 -C 10) acids. Using those methods, formic and acetic acids were found as major <b>monoacids</b> in rainwater and in gas phase, followed by propionic acid. Total <b>monoacids</b> were found to account for up to 12 % of total organic carbon in the Los Angeles rainwater. Their concentrations were equal to 1 / 4 to 1 / 2 of those of inorganic acids (sulfate and nitrate). Similarly, oxalic acid (C 2) was found as the most abundant diacid species followed by malonic (C 3) and succinic (C 4) acids in aerosols and rainwater. Studies of diacids in the atmosphere of urban Tokyo showed a diurnal variation with daytime maximum, indicating that secondary photochemical production of small diacids {{is more important than}} the primary emission from fossil fuel combustion (motor exhausts). Although diacids (C 2 -C 10) account for < 2 % of total aerosol carbon in the urban atmosphere, the values increased up to 9 % in the Arctic and 26 % in the marine aerosols from the Pacific. Polar sunrise experiments conducted at Alert in the high Arctic further confirmed a significant secondary production of small diacids in early spring when sun returns on the horizon. Based on the spatial distributions of diacids over the Pacific, photochemical transformation (aging) of organic aerosols was characterized by an enrichment of oxalic acid in the marine atmosphere. Because dicarboxylic acids are water-soluble and can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere, they likely contribute to the formation of cloud droplets and thus affect indirectly on radiation balance of the Earth and the climate changes. Recent advances in the organic aerosol studies are also reviewed together with the studies on their hygroscopic properties (CCN activity) with a scope for the future study. 2005 年度日本地球化学会賞受賞記念論...|$|R
40|$|A new {{detailed}} {{aqueous phase}} mechanism named the Cloud Explicit Physico-chemical Scheme (CLEPS 1. 0) is proposed {{to describe the}} oxidation of water soluble organic compounds resulting from isoprene oxidation.

The GROMHE SAR allows the evaluation of Henry's law constants for undocumented organic compounds. This new aqueous phase mechanism is coupled with the MCM v 3. 3. 1 gas phase mechanism through a mass transfer scheme between gas phase and aqueous phase. The resulting multiphase mechanism has then been implemented in a model based on the Dynamically Simple Model for Atmospheric Chemical Complexity (DSMACC) using the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP) that can serve to analyze data from cloud chamber experiments and field campaigns.

Among these, the iminodiacetic acid phosphoramidate of deoxyadenosine monophosphate (IDA-dAMP) represents an interesting example, as it could overcome some of the problems observed when using L-aspartic acid as the leaving group, that is, poor chain elongation. We have now synthesized and evaluated a series of IDA-dAMP analogues that bear either an extended aliphatic chain in the amino acid function, or a phosphonic acid moiety (substituting for the carboxylic acid function). Among these compounds, the nucleotide with an iminodipropionic acid leaving group (IDP-dAMP) was identified as the best substrate; the excellent single incorporation (91 [*]% conversion to a P+ 1 strand at 50 μM) was at a substrate concentration ten times lower than that used for IDA-dAMP). This nucleotide also presented improved kinetics and elongation capability compared to IDA-dAMP. The analogues with T, G, and C base moieties were also investigated for their incorporation ability with HIV- 1 RT. The incorporation efficiency was found to decrease in the order A>T>G>C.

The protease NH 2 -terminal sequence exhibited more than 60 % <b>monoacids</b> identity with those of insect putative peptidases. The protease displayed no sequence homology with classical proteases. From this point of view, the protease recalls {{the case of the}} scorpion lipase which displayed no sequence homology with known lipases. The scorpion amylase purified and characterized by our time, has an amino-acids sequence similar to those of mammalian amylases. The enzyme was characterized with respect its biochemical properties: it was active on a chymotrypsin substrate and had an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa, like the classically known chymotrypsins. The dependence of the SCP activity and stability on pH and temperature was similar to that of mammalian chymotrypsin proteases. However, the SCP displayed a lower specific activity and a boarder pH activity range (from 6 to 9). Conclusion lower animal have a less evaluated digestive organ: a hepatopancreas, whereas, higher ones possess individualized pancreas and liver.

40|$|International audienceIt has {{recently}} been established that unsaturated water-soluble organic compounds (UWSOCs) might efficiently form oligomers in polluted fogs and wet aerosol particles, even for weakly soluble ones like methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). The atmospheric relevance of these processes is explored by means of multiphase process model studies in a companion paper. In the present study, we investigate the aging of these aqueous-phase MVK oligomers formed via center dot OH oxidation, {{as well as their}} ability to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA) upon water evaporation. The comparison between aqueous-phase composition and aerosol composition after nebulization of the corresponding solutions shows similar trends for oligomer formation and aging. The measurements reveal that oligomer aging leads to the formation of organic diacids. Quantification of the SOA mass formed after nebulization is performed, and the obtained SOA mass yields seem to depend on the spectral irradiance of the light used to initiate the photochemistry. Investigating a large range of initial MVK concentrations (0. 2 - 20 mM), the results show that their center dot OH oxidation undergoes competition between functionalization and oligomerization that is dependent on the precursor concentration. At high initial MVK concentrations (>= 2 mM), oligomerization prevails over functionalization, while at lower initial concentrations, oligomerization is not the major process, and functionalization dominates, resulting in small carbonyls, dicarbonyls and <b>monoacids.</b> The atmospheric implications of these processes are discussed...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: This phase I clinical trial involved 18 women with biopsy-proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at the Beckman Laser Institute, Irvine, Calif. Colposcopically directed cervical biopsy specimens obtained after 1. 5, 3, or 6 hours of exposure to a randomly assigned photosensitizer were evaluated for selective drug absorption with hematoxylin and eosin staining and fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: After exposure to 5 -aminolevulinic acid, cervical tissue showed maximal fluorescence in dysplastic cells relative to normal cells, with negligible stromal fluorescence. According to our detection methods benzoporphyrin-derivative <b>monoacid</b> ring demonstrated nonselective, diffusion-driven uptake, with fluorescence appearing in the superficial cells, followed by nonselective drug absorption in the remaining cells and stroma of the epithelium.

Thermochemolysis and thermodesorption were used to monitor bacterial activity (stability) whereas diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and thermodifferential analysis (TDA) permitted to determine the degree of OM humification (maturity). DRIFT spectroscopy and TDA provide two indicators of maturity since, with these two techniques, the signals associated with the biodegradable organic matter decrease relatively to the signals associated with refractory organic matter. This increase in RTG and RIR ratios between aromatic to aliphatic signals constitutes a proof for OM complexification. It correlates with humic acids/fulvic acids ratio {{known to be a}} maturity index. Pyrolysates are mainly constituted of lignin moieties, terpenoids, nitrogen containing compounds, carbohydrates (furanosic moiety), mono- and diacids (as methyl esters), and methoxyesters.

As an alternative strategy we describe here a mathematical model for pKa determination based on quantitative structure-property relationships. The model uses two quantum chemical descriptors, the natural atomic charge on the N 3 proton (qH +) and the frontier orbital energy (εL), allowing the determination of pKa values for every compound of a given series with a reasonable computational effort. A linear relationship is described among pKa, qH +, εL and the number of ester groups in the molecule n. Multiple linear regression analysis of the available series of imidazol- 1 -ylalcanoic compounds allowed to obtain the expression pKa=- 119. 435 ×qH++ 0. 612 ×εL- 1. 043 ×n+ 65. 204 which reproduced the experimental values within 0. 1 pKa units. © 2004 Elsevier B.

In this study, the composition of apoplasmic barriers in hypodermal cell walls and oxygen profiles in roots and the surrounding medium of four Amazon tree species that are subjected to long-term flooding at their habitat was analyzed. In hypodermal cell walls of the deciduous tree Crateva benthami, suberization is very weak and dominated by <b>monoacids,</b> 2 -hydroxy acids, and omega -hydroxycarboxylic acids. This species does not show any morphological adaptations to flooding and overcomes the aquatic period in a dormant state. Hypodermal cells of Tabernaemontana juruana, a tree which is able to maintain its leaf system during the aquatic phase, are characterized by extensively suberized walls, incrusted mainly by the unsaturated C 18 omega -hydroxycarboxylic acid and the alpha,omega -dicarboxylic acid analogon, known as typical suberin markers. Two other evergreen species, Laetia corymbulosa and Salix martiana, contained 3 - to 4 -fold less aliphatic suberin in the exodermis, but more than 85 % of the aromatic moiety of suberin are composed of para-hydroxybenzoic acid, suggesting a function of suberin in pathogen defense.

This thesis represents {{a study of the}} performance of a range of calixarene compounds either as the active component of an optical sensor or as the lonophore in potentiometnc sensors. Determination of enantiomeric purity has become important in recent years due to increasing restrictions on the composition of pharmaceuticals whose efficacy depends on a chiral moiety. With the aim of enantiomeric selectivity, three novel fluorescent calixarenes were synthesised and their interaction with R and S enantiomers of phenylethylamine and norephedrine were investigated Stem-Volmer plots were used to evaluate the calixarenes and from this {{it was found that the}} calix[4]arene with a dinaphthylprolinol group attached to the lower nm exhibited the best selectivity of the three compounds investigated. Using this compound it was possible to determine the percentage of one enantiomer in the presence of the other. In keeping with the increasing popularity of optical modes of transducing host-guest interaction o f calixarenes, an ammonia gas optical sensor based on the nitrophenylazophenol cahx[4]arene ligand was developed. The optode membranes were prepared from a PVC cocktail composition and exhibited significant colour change on exposure to gaseous ammonia.

30|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century artists were aware that emerald green should not be mixed with sulfur-containing {{pigments}} such as yellow cadmium sulfide, as this leads to the formation of brown copper sulfides [23]. Nevertheless, emerald green is also found to degrade in the absence of sulfur-containing pigments leading to transparent discolored brown layers [1]. In this extreme case, the paint containing emerald green is medium rich with a relatively high concentration of <b>monoacids,</b> diacids and resin acids. These acids groups react with the emerald green pigment, forming copper carboxylates, like copper soaps (4 Cu(FA) 2) (FA = fatty acids) and arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3). The degradation mechanism of emerald green has been revealed by analytical imaging studies on paint samples from The Descent of the Cattle in the High Jura Mountains (1836) by Théodore Rousseau in the Mesdag Collection in The Hague, supported by chemical laboratory experiments [1]. The transparent, brown appearance is ascribed to the loss of the emerald green pigments as light reflectors in combination with darkening of the multiple thick medium-rich paint and varnish layers. Energy dispersive X-ray analyses indicate that, not unlike paintings containing realgar and/or orpiment, arsenic degradation products are found throughout a degrading painting containing emerald green in layer interfaces, varnishes and regions surrounding particles containing iron and/or aluminum. However, the chemical speciation of the arsenic-based reaction products in paintings containing emerald green has not yet been done, so the degradation mechanism is still not understood. In this paper we report arsenic (As) K–edge micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES) analyses that have been carried out to identify the chemical speciation of the degradation products of emerald green containing arsenic.|$|R
40|$|Naphthenic acids are {{a diverse}} group of {{saturated}} mono- and polycyclic carboxylic acids that may account for as much as 10 - 12 weight % of crude oil. During production at several newer oil fields, there have been discoveries of oil that have very high acid and calcium content. This indicates that there are some naphthenic acids bound to calcium as calcium naphthenates present in the oil, and that these are oil-soluble. Oil-soluble calcium naphthenates can cause problems during refinery, as the calcium present can lead to fouling and catalytic deactivation. The coke and fuel quality will also be affected. The removal of calcium in the refinery can be an expensive and comprehensive process, which results in the suppliers getting a lower price on their crude oil. In this master thesis, naphthenic acids from non-soluble calcium naphthenates have been isolated by using an ion exchanger method and a Solid Phase Extraction-method. The work also consisted of neutral and acidic washing of the samples, measurements of water-content, Ca-content and total acid numbers. The different phases from the isolations have also been analyzed by using FT-IR Spectroscopy, APPI-MS and ESI-MS for characterization to see if the naphthenic acids bound to calcium differ from other acids. The naphthenic acids that are bound to calcium in the crude oil have a higher average molecular weight than the other naphthenic acids, at 875 and 580 g/mole respectively. This result was confirmed by TAN-measurements and APPI-MS of samples after isolation with the Acid-IER method. The correlation between the TAN-measurements and the results from APPI-MS suggest that the acids can be characterized as <b>monoacids.</b> They do not have a particular molecular weight, but have a broad distribution between 150 and 2000 g/mole. It seems that the calcium naphthenate formation is controlled by the total amount of acids in the oil, their molecular weight and pH, and not as much on structure as first were presumed...|$|R

In addition, incorporation of certain amphiphilic gadolinium(III) complexes into liposomes showed enhanced proton relaxibility [18, 19].|$|E
40|$|A two-channel {{optical system}} has been {{developed}} to provide spatially resolved simultaneous imaging of singlet molecular oxygen (1 O 2) phosphorescence and photosensitizer (PS) fluorescence produced by the photodynamic process. The current imaging system uses a spectral discrimination method to differentiate the weak 1 O 2 phosphorescence that peaks near 1. 27 μm from PS fluorescence that also occurs in this spectral region. The detection limit of 1 O 2 emission was determined at a concentration of 500 nM benzoporphyrin derivative <b>monoacid</b> (BPD) in tissue-like phantoms, and these signals observed were proportional to the PS fluorescence. Preliminary in vivo images with tumor laden mice indicate {{that it is possible}} to obtain simultaneous images of 1 O 2 and PS tissue distribution...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT PURPOSE: Uniform intratumor {{distribution}} of sufficient photosensitizer {{is one of}} the important aspects of photodynamic therapy for solid tumors. METHODS: Multicellular spheroids derived from a human transitional cell carcinoma cell line (MGHU 3) were used as a surrogate system of tiny solid tumors to study intratumor {{distribution of}} photosensitizers. Photosensitizers included Photofrin, hypocrellins (HBEA-R 1 /R 2, HBBA-R 2), aluminum phthalocyanine chloride (AlPC), benzoporphyrin derivative <b>monoacid</b> ring A (BPD-MA), protoporphyrin-IX (PpIX), and liposomal formulations of HBBA-R 2 and BPD-MA. Spheroids were incubated with various doses of the above drugs for 1 – 4 hours, and were examined by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Histology showed all cells were healthy in spheroids less than 400 µm in diameter. Scanning electron microscopy showed tight cell-to-cell interdigitation in spheroids. HBEA...|$|E
