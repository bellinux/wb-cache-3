The government awarded his family a pension of £100 a year.|$|E

I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young <b>man</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps.
