40|$|BACKGROUND: Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) {{is recognized}} as an effective treatment for movement disorders. We recently changed our technique, {{limiting the number of}} brain penetrations to three per side. OBJECTIVES: The first aim was to evaluate the electrode precision on both sides of surgery since we implemented this surgical technique. The second aim was to analyse whether or not the electrode placement was improved with <b>microrecording</b> and macrostimulation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed operation protocols and MRIs of 30 patients who underwent bilateral DBS. For <b>microrecording</b> and macrostimulation, we used three parallel channels of the 'Ben Gun' centred on the MRI-planned target. Pre- and post-operative MRIs were merged. The distance between the planned target and the centre of the implanted electrode artefact was measured. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference in}} targeting precision on both sides of surgery. There was more intra-operative adjustment of the second electrode positioning based on <b>microrecording</b> and macrostimulation, which allowed to significantly approach the MRI-planned target on the medial-lateral axis. CONCLUSION: There was more electrode adjustment needed on the second side, possibly in relation with brain shift. We thus suggest performing a single central track with electrophysiological and clinical assessment, with multidirectional exploration on demand for suboptimal clinical responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{revitalization}} of surgery for Parkinson's disease (PD) has fueled {{discussion about the}} best methodology to define the target. Placement of electrodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS) requires the usual stereotactic technique but the argument is mainly centered {{on whether or not}} <b>microrecording</b> neuronal activity is necessary. We compared the accuracy of calculating the coordinates X (medio-lateral) and Y (rostro-caudal) considered by the classic stereotactic method, i. e., definition of the AC-PC intercomissural line by MRI and a digitized version of the Schaltenbrand's atlas, with final electrode placement according with <b>microrecording</b> and microstimulation in 21 patients. For both the globus pallidum internum (GPi) (n = 21) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (n = 36) there was, respectively, a 43 % and 45 % mismatching of more than 3 mm between the theoretic coordinates and the final site of electrode location. This applies to both the X and Y planes. Accuracy was not improved in patients (n = 11) in whom the bilateral procedure was undertaken in a single day. We conclude that proper electrode positioning of the STN and GPi requires fine electrophysiologic assessment. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report a}} patient with postischemic parkinsonism who responded neither to {{levodopa}} nor to bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation. MRI revealed bilateral lesions of the substantia nigra, the striatum, the external pallidum, {{and part of the}} internal pallidum. PET showed reduced striatal dopa-decarboxylase activity, D- 2 receptor binding, and glucose metabolism. Perioperative <b>microrecording</b> showed low-frequency activity of STN cells. This case suggests that parkinsonian patients who do not have a good response to levodopa or in whom a postsynaptic dopaminergic lesion can be shown may not be good candidates for STN surgery...|$|R
40|$|The work {{performed}} {{in this thesis}} has been conducted {{in the light of}} improving treatments for patients with anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and also to {{contribute to the development of}} a new device for electrical brain stimulation and <b>microrecording.</b> These two techniques are commonly used in neuroscience; electrical brain stimulation is a technique used to relieve symptoms in patients with movement or psychiatric disorders by delivering small electrical pulses to certain brain areas. <b>Microrecording,</b> i. e. the recording of electrical signals of individual brain cells, can be applied to gain knowledge about the brain structures to be stimulated, the neuronal mechanisms that may play a role in the disorders or in the mechanisms of the treatment. In the first part of the thesis, we examined the effect of an electrolytic lesion or high frequency electrical stimulation in the mediodorsal thalamus in a validated animal model for anorexia nervosa, the activity-based anorexia model in rats. In a previous study (not part of the thesis), it was found that the glucose metabolism in the mediodorsal thalamus was increased in rats in this model. The model was successfully replicated, with a reduction in body weight, food intake, and survival time and an increase in running activity. Electrical stimulation or a curative lesion in the mediodorsal thalamus did not have an effect on survival, body weight, food intake and locomotor activity in activity-based anorexia rats, compared to control groups. However, a preventive electrolytic lesion in the mediodorsal thalamus caused a significant reduction in locomotor activity but there was no improvement in survival, body weight and food intake compared to the control group. Apart from this positive effect on running activity, we found no convincing evidence for the suitability of the mediodorsal thalamus as a neuromodulation target for anorexia nervosa patients. Also in the first part of the thesis, we investigated the neuronal single-cell activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in an animal model for obsessive-compulsive disorder, the schedule-induced polydipsia model. This brain area may be a new potential target for deep brain stimulation in patients with this disorder. We found significant differences in firing rate and firing pattern of neurons in this nucleus compared to normal control rats or rats that are resistant to the model, and also differences in firing pattern between hemispheres and recording position within the nucleus. These findings suggest that rats in the schedule-induced polydipsia model, which models compulsive behavior in humans, display a change in firing behavior of neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the second part of the thesis, we evaluated a conceptually new neural probe for deep brain stimulation and <b>microrecording</b> in vivo. After the design and processing phase and in vitro characterization, the acute in vivo recording and stimulation capabilities were investigated intwo generations of probes. We were able to obtain stable neuronal signals with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio with probes of different configurations. Stimulation with the first generation probe in the motor cortex to elicit contractions of the hind limb did not prove to be successful. However, stimulation with the second generation probe in the ventral tegmental area track did induce the expected behavioral effect, namely whisker movements. In the next phase, we evaluated the MRI compatibility, biocompatibility and chronic recording capabilities of the first generation probe. Although not many neuronal signals could be captured during this experiment, it was possible to record neuronal signals after 5 weeks and 3 MRI scans. No differences in noise levels, which are an indication of the functionality of the probe, were observed over time or between the scanned and the control group. MRI images showed an acceptable artifact induced by the presence of the probe, which did not change over time. The tissue response, characterized by the amount of gliosis, inflammation, and neuronal cell loss showed an extensive glial and microglial reaction at 1 week post-implantation, but no neuronal cell loss. MR scanning did not induce additional tissue damage. Furthermore, we developed an experimentally derived model that would predict the insertion mechanics and amount of tissue dimpling for neural implants with certain dimensions and inserted at a particular speed. This pointed out interesting interaction effects between these factors. It showed that for particular factor configurations, one can safely increase certain factors without causing unwanted significant force or tissue dimpling increase. The penetration behavior was found to be mainly dependent on the tip angle and insertion speed, while the rest of the insertion forces were more sensitive to the implant width and again the insertion speed. Furthermore, coating the implant with parylene-C proved to be beneficial in reducing the friction between the implant and the surrounding tissue. The model developed in this study was able to deliver accurate predictions of the insertion behavior for a particular design and could be used as a tool for design optimization of future neural implants. Lastly, the effect of insertion speed on long-term tissue response and insertion mechanics was investigated. No difference in dimpling, penetration force or the force after a 3 min rest period in the brain was observed when inserting a probe at 10 µm/s or at 100 µm/s. However, the force at the end of the insertion phase was significantly higher when inserting the probes at 100 µm/s compared to 10 µm/s. Two additional peaks were noticed in the insertion force curve at the transition from gray matter to white matter tracks, which indicates a larger stiffness of white matter compared to gray matter. Further, an expected tissue response was seen with an increase of glial and microglial reactivity around the probe, but no overall neuronal cell loss was found. Comparison of the tissue response between insertion speeds showed no differences. In conclusion, this work has contributed to the understanding and improvement of therapies for patients with anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and has built a platform to evaluate in vivo new devices for electrical brain stimulation and <b>microrecording.</b> This last part has been succesfully applied to the neuro-probe developed by imec. nrpages: 199 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Validate an MRI {{procedure}} to localize {{the position of}} our final implanted electrodes. Material and Methods: 26 parkinsonian patients were selected for DBS. Surgery was performed with a CRW (Radionics) frame. The final electrode (Medtronic Activa 3389) was implanted according to the MRI preoperative target, <b>microrecording</b> and macrostimulation. A postop 3 D MPRAGE MRI was performed to localize the distal end of the distorsion artifact induced by the contacts of the electrodes. The size of this artifact was studied independently by scanning the electrode in a reference system. It allowed us to calculate {{the center of each}} contact, together with the projected angles of the electrode, the height of one contact and the distance between 2 adjacent contacts. Results: A distance of 1. 4 mm was measured between the artifact and the contact. 208 contacts and 65 active contacts were projected on sagittal, coronal and axial views of the Schaltenbrand and Wahren stereotactic atlas (SWSA). The mean coordinates of each contact were reported as well as the active contact (AP: 3. 09 mm behind, LAT: 12. 06 mm, VERT: 4. 06 mm below the MCP). Conclusion: Considering the knowledge of the distorsion artifact induced by the electrodes, the validation of our procedure is based on the exact matching of the planned target and the mean active contact. The distribution of our contacts over the anatomical limits of the STN on the SWSA suggests a possible variability of position between individuals as well as the possible efficacy of other stimulated structures (SNr) on PD symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: We report our {{operative}} observations with STN stimulation for Parkinson's {{disease in}} 45 patients. Methods: Ten patients had previous surgery for Parkinson's disease. Radiological localization {{was done with}} MRI. One trajectory microelectrode recording was obtained in most, and macrostimulation in all. A period of trial stimulation followed, Kinetra and Itrel II generators were used. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics. A postoperative MRI was obtained. One patient was not definitively implanted. Results: Targeting was accomplished by stereotactic coordinates or a semidirect visual recognition. Time for bilateral electrodes placement was 3 h 45 min and for generator placement 1 h 15 min. For 5 electrodes, a second trajectory was necessary for final placement. The interval between the operations was 5 days. There were 7 instances of transient confusional state, one case of air embolus, one seizure at coagulation of the dura. There were no surgical mortality, hemorrage, infection or permanent neurological deficits. Four electrodes required repositioning after trial stimulation period. One connector wound dehiscence required revision. Microelectrode recording demonstrated the expected findings in over half the trajectories. 60 % of the patients followed at our institution and for 3 months or more postoperatively have remained medication-free; the others have reduced their treatment by 60 %. Conclusion: STN stimulation for PD provides the same results as optimal medication treatment in many patients. MRI proves to be reliable in targeting the STN. The reduced number of trajectories for <b>microrecording</b> and the short operating time, however associated with satisfactory results, {{may contribute to the}} low morbidity...|$|R
40|$|Cluster {{headache}} (CH) is a short-lasting unilateral headache {{associated with}} ipsilateral craniofacial autonomic manifestations. A {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) study {{has shown that the}} posterior hypothalamus is activated during CH attacks, suggesting that hypothalamic hyperactivity {{plays a key role in}} CH pathophysiology. On this basis, stimulation of the ipsilateral posterior hypothalamus was hypothesized to counteract such hyperactivity to prevent intractable CH. Ten years after its introduction, hypothalamic stimulation has been proved to successfully prevent attacks in more than 60 % of 58 hypothalamic implanted drug-resistant chronic CH patients. The implantation procedure has generally been proved to be safe, although it carries a small risk of brain haemorrhage. Long-term stimulation is safe, and nonsymptomatic impairment of orthostatic adaptation is the only noteworthy change. <b>Microrecording</b> studies will make it possible to better identify the target site. Neuroimaging investigations have shown that hypothalamic stimulation activates ipsilateral trigeminal complex, but with no immediate perceived sensation within the trigeminal distribution. Other studies on the pain threshold in chronically stimulated patients showed increased threshold for cold pain in the distribution of the first trigeminal branch ipsilateral to stimulation. These studies suggest that activation of the hypothalamus and of the trigeminal system are both necessary, but not sufficient to generate CH attacks. In addition to the hypothalamus, other unknown brain areas are likely to play a role in the pathophysiology of this illness.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Subthalamic nucleus (STN) {{deep brain}} {{stimulation}} (DBS) of patients with PD allows reduction of antiparkinsonian medication but has only a mild direct effect on dyskinesia. Since antiparkinsonian medication has short- and long-term effects that may prevent {{an estimate of the}} maximal possible impact of STN DBS, such medication was used at the lowest possible dosage after DBS implantation. OBJECTIVE: To study the maximal and long-term effects of STN DBS using the lowest dose of medication. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with PD with motor fluctuations and dyskinesia underwent bilateral implantation under stereotactic guidance, <b>microrecording,</b> and clinical control. All medications were stopped before implantation and reintroduced, at the lowest dosage needed, only if the postoperative motor score did not reach the baseline level. Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor (subscale III) scores were measured at baseline and after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS: After 21 plus minus 8 months, the UPDRS III "off-medication" score was decreased by 45 % and was similar to the preoperative UPDRS III "on" score. Overall, medication was reduced by 79 %, being completely withdrawn in 10 patients. Fluctuations and dyskinesia showed an overall reduction of &gt; 90 %, disappearing completely in patients without medication. These improvements were maintained for 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that STN DBS could replace levodopa and allowed all antiparkinsonian medication to be discontinued in 50 % of patients with PD. Fluctuations and dyskinesia disappeared completely in these patients but persisted in those still on medication. These improvements were maintained for 2 years...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Over {{the past}} few years many reports have shown that posteroventral pallidotomy is an {{effective}} method for treating advanced cases of Parkinson's disease. The main differences with earlier descriptions were the use of standardised evaluation with new high resolution MRI studies and of single cell <b>microrecording</b> which can electrophysiologically define the sensorimotor portion of the internal globus pallidus (GPi). The present study was performed on a consecutive series of 40 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent posteroventral pallidotomy to determine localisation discrepancies between the ventriculography based theoretical and the electrophysiologically defined target for posteroventral pallidotomy.  METHODS—The tentative location of the posteroventral GPi portion was defined according to the proportional Talairach system. Single cell recording was performed in all patients. The definitive target was chosen according to the feasibility of recording single cells with GPi cell features, including the presence of motor drive and correct identification of the internal capsule and of the optic tract by activity recording and microstimulation.  RESULTS—In all 40 patients the electrophysiologically defined sensorimotor portion of the GPi was lesioned, with significantly improved cardinal Parkinson's disease symptoms as well as levodopa induced dyskinesias, without damage to the internal capsule or optic tract. Significant differences between the localisation of the ventriculography based theoretical versus electrophysiological target were found in depth (p< 0. 0008) and posteriority (p< 0. 04). No significant differences were found in laterality between both approaches. Difference ranges were 8 mm for laterality, 6. 5 mm for depth, and 10 mm for posteriority.  CONCLUSIONS—Electrophysiologically defined lesion of GPi for posteroventral pallidotomy, shown to be effective for treating Parkinson's disease, is located at a significantly different site from the ventriculography based theoretical target. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The optimal imaging {{modality}} for preoperative targeting of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for high-frequency stimulation is controversially discussed. Commonly used methods were stereotactic {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), stereotactic ventriculography, and fusion between MRI and stereotactic computer tomography. All of these techniques not only have their own advantages but also specific limitations and drawbacks. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the accuracy of the preoperative MRI targeting as compared with ventriculography in terms of both the STN target as well as the internal landmarks. METHODS: Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent bilateral surgery for STN-high-frequency stimulation received both stereotactic ventriculography and stereotactic MRI. The theoretical target was determined by each of these two imaging modalities. The final electrode placement was performed after extensive electrophysiological evaluation using <b>microrecording</b> and microstimulation. The real target was assumed to be given by the electrode contact with the best clinical result assessed by the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in the postoperative follow-up. In addition, the coordinates of the two landmarks, anterior commissure and posterior commissure, were determined using both imaging methods. RESULTS: The mean targeting error was 4. 1 +/- 1. 7 mm (mean +/- standard deviation) for MRI and 2. 4 +/- 1. 1 mm for ventriculography (P< 0. 0001). The mean target mismatch between the two imaging methods was 2. 9 +/- 1. 2 mm. The length of the anterior commissure-posterior commissure distance differed significantly (P < 0. 0001) between MRI (27. 6 +/- 1. 6 mm) and ventriculography (25. 0 +/- 1. 3 mm). The mismatch was mainly induced by an anterior displacement of the anterior commissure by 1. 9 +/- 2. 2 mm (P < 0. 0001) in MRI determination, as compared with ventriculography. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the indirect targeting of the STN using coordinates based on radiological landmarks is more accurate than the direct targeting using anatomic visualization of the target structure. Regardless of the imaging procedure, electrophysiological mapping is required for optimal electrode placement, although in 20 % of cases, the target determined by MRI falls out of the radius explored by electrophysiology...|$|R
