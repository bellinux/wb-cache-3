25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the current study}} is to develop a quantitative understanding of the effects of spatial variability in physical and geochemical properties of crystalline rock on the <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> along a single fracture in bedrock. A stochastic model was developed to describe the transport of solutes in fractured rock. The model describes the <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b> along a one-dimensional path and includes the transversal diffusion into the rock matrix and sorption kinetics. By using a Lagrangian method of description we can extend the model to the description of a two-dimensional transport problem in single fractures. This study presents the first analysis of the impact of heterogeneous mass transfer on the transport of radionuclides in rock fractures, where most of the relevant rock properties such as aperture, porosity, effective diffusivity, sorption capacity and maximum diffusion depth are defined as being spatially random. The stochastic analysis performed here reflects the uncertainty in our knowledge of the properties associated with a discrete sampling technique in site investigations. Geostatistics of the main parameters was determined experimentally on a large number of rock samples taken from the Swedish crystalline basement. The knowledge of the covariance functions of the main rock properties is then used as a basis for a stochastic analysis. By combining the small perturbation approach with the spectral method the problem could be solved in terms of closed form solutions for the central temporal moments of the residence time probability density function. In {{order to be able to}} distinguish between the effects of various mechanisms from the effects of heterogeneity on the <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides,</b> it was necessary to perform independent studies of the effect of the variation of the dispersion coefficient on the aspect ratio of a rectangular flow section and the effect of adsorption kinetics on the migration.

On this basis modeling processes <b>of</b> <b>migration</b> and relocation <b>of</b> <b>radionuclides</b>  in a typical slope by a method of box models is carried out. Is shown, that actively and quickly enough redistributes radionuclides. As a result of modeling it is possible to estimate and  to prognose  of dynamics  of distribution <b>radionuclides</b>  in typical <b>of</b> slope`s   ecosystem and to establish probable    of dose   loading on the people, which use parts such  slope`s ecosystem. </p...|$|R
