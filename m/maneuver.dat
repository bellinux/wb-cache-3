According to Van Eemeren (2010), strategic <b>maneuvering</b> {{takes place in the}} discussion as a whole, in each discussion stage, but also in each individual discussion move, such as providing an argument. This article gives an overview of the steps to be taken in analyzing strategic <b>maneuvering</b> and offers a method for analyzing the <b>maneuvering</b> with an argument. It is argued that <b>maneuvering</b> with arguments can be analyzed more precisely {{with the help of the}} argument scheme. Pragmatic argumentation is used as an example. The <b>maneuvering</b> is described by examining which choices have been made with respect to the three aspects of strategic <b>maneuvering</b> in concretizing the central premise in the scheme, in this case ‘Action X leads to desirable consequence Y’. As an example, the article provides an analysis of <b>maneuvering</b> with pragmatic arguments in the British vaccination brochure Arm against cervical cancer.

5|$|General Eisenhower had {{reviewed}} the airborne role in Operation Husky, and {{had concluded that}} large-scale formations were too difficult to control in combat to be practical. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces, had similar misgivings: once an airborne supporter, he had been greatly disappointed by their performance in North Africa and, more recently, Sicily. However, other high-ranking officers believed otherwise, notably the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, George Marshall. He persuaded Eisenhower {{to set up a}} review board and to withhold judgement on the effectiveness of divisional-sized airborne forces until a large-scale <b>maneuver</b> could be tried in December. When Swing returned to the United States to resume command of the 11th Airborne Division in mid-September 1943, he had an additional role. McNair ordered him to form a committeethe Swing Board–composed of U.S. Army Air Forces, parachute and glider infantry, and artillery officers to arrange a large-scale <b>maneuver</b> that would effectively decide the fate of the divisional-sized airborne force. As the 11th Airborne Division was in reserve in the United States, and had not yet been earmarked for overseas shipment, the Swing Board chose it as the test formation; it would be opposed by a composite combat team from the 17th Airborne Division with a battalion from the 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment temporarily attached. The <b>maneuver</b> would also provide both divisions with further airborne training, as had occurred several months previously in a large-scale <b>maneuver</b> undertaken by the 82nd and the 101st Airborne Divisions.|$|E

40|$|Ship {{transportation}} is increasing globally as is {{risk of collision}} especially in congested areas is a main concern. Numerical modeling method is major simulation method to predict ship maneuverability. Ship <b>maneuvering</b> in calm water is an important topic to avoid collisions and leads to safe navigation. Therefore reliable ship <b>maneuvering</b> simulations are required for incident analysis and prevention. In recent time within the research community orientated towards ship hydrodynamics an increasing {{attention has been paid}} to simultaneous solution of the <b>maneuvering</b> of planing ship problem. The maneuverability of planing crafts has been the subject of many research projects during the last few decades. To assess the maneuverability of planing crafts at the early design stage, reliable simulation models are required. Traditionally, these tools have used empiric descriptions of the forces and moments on the planing craft’s hull. Ship <b>maneuvering</b> calculations, horizontal plane motion control and development of <b>maneuvering</b> simulators need a mathematical description of ship <b>maneuvering.</b> In the recent years, different mathematical models are suggested for <b>maneuvering</b> of displacement vessels that are capable of estimation of vessel <b>maneuvers</b> with acceptable precision. But simulation of planing craft maneuverability through mathematical model is not common yet and is the subject of future research. <b>Maneuvering</b> of planing crafts is influenced greatly by action of rudder. But research efforts have been to include the rudder action in the mathematical models of planing ship <b>maneuvering.</b> In this paper a mathematical model is developed for planing craft <b>maneuvering</b> that includes the rudder forces and moments. Different <b>maneuvers</b> are executed through the mathematical model. Simulations are validated by model tests. Finally the influence of rudder angle on maneuverability of planing ship is studied. The mathematical model and hydrodynamic coefficients presented in this paper can be applied for estimation of course control and turning ability of a planing craft in the early stages of design...|$|R
