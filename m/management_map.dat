40|$|A {{spatially}} {{variable rate}} herbicide application system {{was developed and}} a site-specific evaluation of its field performance and accuracy was conducted. A 4. 2 -ha (10. 4 -ac) field was sampled on an 18. 3 -m (60 -ft) grid for soil type and organic matter percent (OM%). A herbicide management table {{was used to determine}} the appropriate active ingredient (AI) application rate for each area of the field depending on spatial variation of field parameter data (soil type and OM%). Application rate of AI varied from 3510 mL/ha (1. 5 qt/ac) up to 5260 mL/ha (2. 25 qt/ac). Using geographical information system (GIS) software, a georeferenced map (<b>management</b> <b>map)</b> of field application rates was produced. A direct nozzle injection field sprayer was equipped with a real-time differentially corrected global positioning system (DGPS). A program was developed to receive on-the-go the sprayer position data (latitude and longitude) and retrieve the desired application rate from the GIS map at the current sprayer field position. A datalogger was used to change on-the-go the AI flow rate (water was used as a substitute for the AI) to correspond with the desired application rate at a specific sprayer ground speed and field position. To evaluate the system accuracy in reproducing the <b>management</b> <b>map,</b> data was collected from the DGPS to determine its field accuracy. DGPS data and datalogger output (data produced by sprayer monitoring sensors) along with the GIS map were utilized to reveal the spatial accuracy of the application system. Control system reaction time and accuracy were investigated using data from the datalogger program output. Results revealed that the DGPS maintained an accuracy of at least 1 m (3. 3 ft). Spatial analysis showed that the application system reproduced the application rate <b>management</b> <b>map.</b> On the average, the greatest reaction time of the control system was 2. 2 s. For the four application rates used in the study, the highest average application rate error was 2. 0 %...|$|E

Cultural and language differences among multiple countries can hinder the exchange of information during dynamic emergency response. With increasing international threats and the explosion of near real-time data availability, the emergency response process has become mired in complex communication practices. Maps {{have the potential to}} provide an intuitive medium for communication and means for establishing situation awareness during emergency events.

40|$|Technology {{management}} maps {{have been}} developed to evaluate new product development (NPD) within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These maps provide a graphical 'footprint' of a company in terms of knowledge, resources, quality, and innovation & change. A series of 15 case-study companies highlight that the shape and extent of the technology management maps correlate well with the overall impact of the NPD activities. Implementation of an effective NPD process is the main distinguishing factor between the best- and worst-performing companies. The inherent benefits of design-led technology are also encapsulated, specifically in the areas of resource savings and improved product quality.

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{in the domain of}} {{context-aware}} and adaptive HCI is the lack of a shared understanding of context. Many of the existing context-aware applications act independently from a shared context management service relying on a curtailed context model not appropriate for interoperability between independently running components. This paper aims at identifying the core of context parameters for a mobile user, followed by a discussion about the classification of these parameters. For each identified class, the most important properties are then determined. The context model presented here is a result of our two major projects from the domain of mobile workplaces and mobile knowledge <b>management</b> (<b>map</b> and mummy).
