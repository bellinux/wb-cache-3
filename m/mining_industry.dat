5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18thcentury {{the copper}} <b>mining</b> <b>industry</b> of North Wales centred around Parys Mountain declined, and the {{depression}} in the British copper market ended. As the price rose, the Cornish mines began to reopen. By this time, the Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation and efficiency. While the mine managers of the 18thcentury generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore, the managers of these new mines sought to use all their employees as efficiently as possible.|$|E
