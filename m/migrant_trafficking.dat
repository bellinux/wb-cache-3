40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine one of the most {{pressing}} global challenges, the ongoing <b>migrant</b> <b>trafficking</b> across sea, from international trade law and policy perspective. It identifies global poverty as one of the underlying causes of such trafficking. It argues that restrictive trade in labour-intensive services of the World Trade Organization (WTO) contributes to and sustains poverty in many migrant producing countries. Chronic unemployment in poor countries with surplus manual workforce renders these workers bewildered to survive in a jobless and incomeless home markets. Non-liberalization of movements of natural persons under General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Mode 4 prevents legal cross-border delivery of labours. Restrictive trade in agriculture has but aggravated their marginalized plight. It is this poverty trap that pushes workers, lured by smugglers, to take risky migration routes for better life in countries with labour shortages. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts a blend approach of theoretical and applied aspects of international trade law and policy, which is interpreted and applied to a fact situation of contemporary challenge of <b>migrant</b> <b>trafficking</b> by sea. Findings – This paper establishes a nexus between restrictive Mode 4 trade and its implications for poverty-induced migration trafficking trade. It suggests a palatable trade law and policy-based reform response for the WTO to ameliorate poverty and migration trafficking trade concurrently through the creation of legal channels for the cross-border delivery of labours by liberalizing Mode 4 trade in a manner beneficial for developed countries as well. Originality/value – Its value lies in its contribution to maximize multi-lateral trade liberalization for the benefit of all countries, social inclusion and economic emancipation of the disadvantaged, which would minimize global poverty. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} a homage to F. Ferracuti, who first studied in a {{systematic}} way the problem of migrant criminality in Europe. Since the times in which Ferracuti wrote (1970), many changes occurred {{in the context of}} migrations, also in the nexus with criminality. According to the authors’ opinion, today we must keep in mind one variable concerning the criminality of migrants: the organisation of criminal groups trafficking in migrants. The hypothesis this work puts forward is that a part of the crimes committed by aliens (mostly clandestine) is closely linked to the trafficking operations and to the exploitation of criminal organisations, which devote themselves to illegal migration. Furthermore, the probability that trafficked people are pushed into parallel criminal circuits in the destination countries (such as prostitution, drug dealing, robbery, begging, black labour) increases with the better organisation of trafficking groups. A new key for reading the relation between migration and criminality must combine the classical theories with a new method which considers migrant criminality as influenced by the involvement of criminal organisations in <b>migrant</b> <b>trafficking</b> activities. In order to better understand the work hypothesis, the essay tries to explain the chain linking migrations to criminality through its rings: traffic-exploitation-induced criminality. Particular focus is given to the Italian situation...|$|E
40|$|This essay, {{first of}} all, seeks to answer {{questions}} related {{to the problem of}} the traffic of migrants in Europe: are there organised criminal groups active in the continent who concern themselves with human trafficking and if so which groups? How do they organise their traffic? Which routes are most widely used in order to perform this criminal activity? These questions will be dealt with under a particular light: while answering them, the author will try to give a framework, though very general, of the role played in these scenarios by Western, Central and Eastern European states, sometimes as sending, sometimes as transit or destination countries. The analysis is also projected towards the comprehension of those which are the most common illicit conducts performed by organised criminals while trafficking migrants. Since the beginning, it seems noteworthy to highlight a particular point of view under which the phenomenon of traffic in human beings can be analysed and which can explain why in this context the attention of the author is mainly focused on well-organised criminal groups. There appears to be reason to believe that this illegal traffic, when it involves organised criminal organisations, is very dangerous especially because it links an international criminal dimension to a local one. In fact, the more the traffic is organised, the more it seems to exist in illegal circuits that, starting from the traffic of migrants, come to the exploitation of these people in the local criminal markets of the destination countries. It is to say that very often trafficked people, once arrived in their host countries, are pushed by the organised trafficking groups into deviant or criminal markets, such as those of drug pushing, prostitution, begging or theft, very often as a mechanism for repaying the cost of being smuggled. The second part of this essay sets some guidelines in order to build up a feasible and comprehensive strategy, at the European regional level, to fight the international <b>migrant</b> <b>trafficking.</b> In particular, it suggests to design some countryby-country tailor-made interventions. The devising of such instruments should not only be focused on criminal law but should start from a consideration: some Central and Eastern European countries are the main sending countries or seem to be chosen as transit places from which to gather migrants before moving on towards the West; while Western European countries, on their part, are mainly receivers of illegal migration flow...|$|E
