25|$|In {{classical}} (or respondent) conditioning, {{behavior is}} understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be unconditioned, such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning {{might be seen as}} one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations. For instance, a dentist <b>might</b> <b>wonder</b> why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a group of {{children}} singing the chorus, [...] "All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us". In between the chorus lines, one child chants, [...] "Don't worry what people say, we got it true" [...] after which another child says, [...] "Enough is enough of this garbage!" [...] According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] is played in the key of D minor and the track's time signature is common time. The song, which is cited as being a pop song, has a moderately slow tempo of 90 beats per minute. Instruments used include a piano and guitar. Jon Pareles stated that Jackson was calling himself [...] "a victim of police brutality" [...] and a [...] "victim of hate". He continued, [...] "A listener <b>might</b> <b>wonder</b> just who 'Us' is supposed to be... To make the songs lodge in the ear, Jackson uses elementary singsong melodies – a 'nyah, nyah' two-note motif in 'They Don't Care About Us'... and he comes up with all kinds of surprises in the arrangements".|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "it's a little {{surprising}} that the just-released clip for Beyoncé's 'Video Phone' has nary a flame or fish-eye shot (there are, of course, plenty of outlandish costumes). However, don't {{make the mistake of}} thinking this video is by any means straightforward— it's plenty WTF! [...] It's definitely not the Gaga we're used to seeing, but her appearance isn't exactly run-of-the-mill, either. And neither is this video, for that matter. Especially not when you're watching Beyoncé snap her gum and shake her hips and grope an AK-47 while the screen pops from electric green to Kool-Aid red." [...] Jocelyn Vena of the same publication noted, [...] "The clip is charged with energy, and the cynics out there <b>might</b> <b>wonder</b> if putting two sizzling divas in a room together created any kind of rivalry." [...] Jim Farber from New York's Daily News compared Knowles' look to that of pin-up model Bettie Page, and said [...] "The clip for 'Video Phone' [...] doesn't offer {{much in the way of}} chemistry or even interaction between the two divas. [...] clip seems about as innovative as a rotary dial up." [...] Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone commented that the video was an [...] "almost seizure-inducing parade of cinematic homages and wardrobe changes." [...] He also compared Knowles' look to Page, as well as Katy Perry and rapper M.I.A. The Daily Mail gave a positive review of the video, calling it avant-garde and naughty.|$|E
500|$|Until the Whole World Hears {{met with}} an overall mixed to {{positive}} response from critics. Several critics regarded the musical aspects of the album as mediocre or sub-par, while others praised the album's lyrical content. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and described it as a [...] "powerful worship experience", but also stated that [...] "some <b>might</b> <b>wonder</b> how a little more variety would sound from such experienced professionals... the band's core sound continues to land in the AC cross hairs". Andrew Greer of CCM Magazine commented that the album [...] "ups the musical ante a bit, with some borderline poetic verses and interesting musical riffs", but also commented that [...] "many of these tracks still suffer from the 'Crowns Cliché Syndrome,' using lyrical Christian-ese to produce trite rhymes that seem hard-pressed to energize a ready-to-worship crowd". Robert Ham of Christianity Today criticized the album for using what he deemed as a repetitive musical formula, but also praised the song [...] "Joyful, Joyful", which he compared to Coldplay's song [...] "Viva la Vida", as well as Megan's Garrett's vocals on [...] "Mercy". He concluded that Until the Whole World Hears [...] "feels like a step backward creatively". At Cross Rhythms, Tony Cummings rated the album seven out of ten squares, saying [...] "this album is a little disappointing considering some of the glories that preceeded [...] it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of course, one <b>might</b> <b>wonder</b> {{whether we}} are {{justified}} in assuming that [...] The answer is affirmative, if the flow satisfies certain basic assumptions.

In fact, the approximate relation between [...] and [...] that we assumed is just a linear approximation to the generic barotropic equation of state of the fluid.|$|E
2500|$|One <b>might</b> <b>wonder</b> {{what effect}} this {{interpretation}} of the Law of Contraposition has on Hempel's paradox of confirmation. [...] "If [...] is a raven then [...] is black" [...] is equivalent to [...] "If [...] were not black then [...] {{would not be a}} raven". Therefore whatever confirms the latter should also, by the Equivalence Condition, confirm the former. True, but yellow cows still cannot figure into the confirmation of [...] "All ravens are black" [...] because, in science, confirmation is accomplished by prediction, and predictions are properly stated in the indicative mood. It is senseless to ask what confirms a counterfactual.|$|E
2500|$|As Andrew Ilachinski {{points out}} in his Cellular Automata, many {{scholars}} have {{raised the question of}} whether the universe is a cellular automaton. Ilachinski argues that the importance of this question may be better appreciated with a simple observation, which can be stated as follows. Consider the evolution of rule 110: if it were some kind of [...] "alien physics", what would be a reasonable description of the observed patterns? If an observer did not know how the images were generated, that observer might end up conjecturing about the movement of some particle-like objects. Indeed, physicist James Crutchfield has constructed a rigorous mathematical theory out of this idea, proving the statistical emergence of [...] "particles" [...] from cellular automata.], [...] 75, 11–54, 1994. Then, as the argument goes, one <b>might</b> <b>wonder</b> if our world, which is currently well described, at our current level of understanding, by physics with particle-like objects, could be a CA at its most fundamental level with the gaps in information or incomplete understanding of fundamental data appearing as an arbitrary random order that would seem contrary to CA.|$|E
