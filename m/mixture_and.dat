5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas <b>mixture,</b> <b>and</b> a separate filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method {{is characterized by a}} stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in <b>mixture</b> <b>and</b> layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E

5|$|Callisto's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 20%. Its surface {{composition}} {{is thought to}} be broadly similar to its composition as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 micrometers. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface of Callisto, with a mass fraction of 2550%. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from the ground has revealed various non-ice materials: magnesium- and iron-bearing hydrated silicates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, on Callisto with the Hubble Space Telescope|year=1996|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI| url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc97/pdf/1852.PDF|page=1852|format=PDF}} and possibly ammonia and various organic compounds. Spectral data indicate that Callisto's surface is extremely heterogeneous at the small scale. Small, bright patches of pure water ice are intermixed with patches of a rock–ice <b>mixture</b> <b>and</b> extended dark areas made of a non-ice material.|$|E
5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their <b>mixture</b> <b>and</b> are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E
