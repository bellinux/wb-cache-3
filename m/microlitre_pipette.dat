30|$|For the {{labelling}} procedure, 60  μg DOTA-NOC acetate was {{dissolved in}} 150  μl of 0.25  M sodium acetate buffer. After switching {{on the block}} heater within the labelling module at a fixed time, a volume of 100  μl DOTA-NOC (40  μg) is added with a calibrated <b>microlitre</b> <b>pipette</b> (range 10 to 100  μl) to a volume of 1  ml 0.25  M sodium acetate buffer and subsequently injected in the reaction vessel. After a heating time of 5  min, direct elution of the 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator is performed with 4  ml 0.05  M hydrochloric acid into the reaction vessel. Labelling takes place at 90 °C to 95 °C for 10  min. Subsequently, the labelling mixture is transferred to the waste vial through the C 18 purification column and rinsed with 5  ml 0.9 % NaCl. In the final step, the C 18 purification column is eluted with 1  ml 60 % (V/V) ethanol and rinsed with 5  ml 0.9 % NaCl through the on-line 0.2  μm filter into the product vial.|$|E
40|$|A simple optical {{deflection}} {{technique was}} used to monitor the vibrations of microlitre pendant droplets of deuterium oxide, formamide, and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrabromoethane. Droplets of different volumes of each liquid were suspended {{from the end of}} a <b>microlitre</b> <b>pipette</b> and vibrated using a small puff of nitrogen gas. A laser was passed through the droplets and the scattered light was collected using a photodiode. Vibration of the droplets resulted in the motion of the scattered beam and time-dependent intensity variations were recorded using the photodiode. These time- dependent variations were Fourier transformed and the frequencies and widths of the mechanical droplet resonances were extracted. A simple model of vibrations in pendant/sessile drops {{was used to}} relate these parameters to the surface tension, density and viscosity of the liquid droplets. The surface tension values obtained from this method were found to be in good agreement with results obtained using the standard pendant drop technique. Damping of capillary waves on pendant drops was shown to be similar to that observed for deep liquid baths and the kinematic viscosities obtained were in agreement with literature values for all three liquids studied...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} patient’s reliability in {{the administration}} of eyedrops. Method: The study is based on a randomised, controlled clinical trial in which a steroid-containing drug delivery system (DDS) was directly compared to conventional steroid eyedrops after cataract surgery. 32 eyes undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction with intra-ocular lens insertion received a DDS, while 31 eyes received 0. 1 % dexamethasone eyedrops q. d. s for 30 days. Patients with DDS were given a placebo eyedrop in the form of 0. 9 % sodium chloride, while all 63 eyes received topical chloramphenicol eyedrops q. d. s for 30 days. At the conclusion of the 30 day visit, the eyedrop containers were collected and the residual volume of medication remaining in each bottle was then measured to the nearest 10 <b>microlitre</b> using a <b>pipette.</b> Results: 31 patients returned the complete set of eyedrop containers. There was no statistical significant difference in the volume used between the types of eyedrops, sex and diabetic status. All the patients used more than the prescribed amount. Older patients tended to use less medication. Conclusion: The amount of medication that patients actually administered in this trial varied widely according to the individual, and patient age may be a factor affecting compliance in using eyedrops...|$|R
