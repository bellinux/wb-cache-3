50|$|<b>Bubble</b> <b>memory</b> {{is a type}} of {{non-volatile}} {{computer memory}} that uses a thin film of a magnetic material to hold small magnetized areas, known as bubbles or domains, each storing one bit of data. The material is arranged to form a series of parallel tracks that the bubbles can move along under the action of an external <b>magnetic</b> field. The <b>bubbles</b> are read by moving them {{to the edge of the}} material where they can be read by a conventional magnetic pickup, and then rewritten on the far edge to keep the memory cycling through the material.
