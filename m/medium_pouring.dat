40|$|AbstractA {{primipara}} {{presented to}} our hospital due to fetal ascites, bilateral hydronephrosis and hydrometrocolpos. The female baby had two giant abdominal cysts, a single atrium and foot polydactyly. Absence of the vaginal orifice was noticed, and the hymen was broken through; the left cyst collapsed after fluid drainage. The right cyst was punctured and drained, which improved the hydronephrosis. Contrast imaging showed <b>medium</b> <b>pouring</b> into the abdominal cavity via the uterine tube; the right cyst was a 6  ×  5  cm closed cavity. Vaginal uroplania persisted even after hospital discharge. At {{the age of}} 4 years, cystoscopy showed a fistulous opening on the urethra 5  mm distal from the internal urethral orifice. A catheter inserted via the opening {{was found in the}} vagina. In our case, urine poured into the abdominal cavity through the fistula and uterine tube; following obstruction of the uterine tube, giant hydrometrocolpos and hydrosalpinx appeared. Three cases of congenital urethrovaginal fistula (CUVF) with imperforate hymen have been reported. A remnant of communication between the uterovaginal primordium and urogenital sinus may be responsible for CUVF...|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of {{creating}} the sculpture bronze had not been used in {{almost half a century}} for a monumental work of art. Cellini made the conscious decision to work in this <b>medium</b> because <b>pouring</b> molten metal into his cast, he was vivifying the sculpture with life-giving blood. The most difficult part would be completing the entire cast all at once. Donatello’s Judith and Holofernes was already placed within the Loggia dei Lanzi in the westernmost arch. While it was made out of bronze, Judith had been casted in several sections. Cellini was competing against monumental works, like Michelangelo’s David and wanted to make a statement for himself and the patron, Cosimo I.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} pouring {{temperature}} and slurry viscosity {{in terms of}} heat transfer on surface roughness during lost foam casting (LFC) of LM 6 alloy were investigated experimentally. Heat transfer of molten materials is an important factors to changes the microstructure which is considered in the present study. It is primarily dependent on the pouring temperature, casting thickness, mould material, mould temperature and surrounding <b>medium.</b> The <b>pouring</b> temperature changed from 700 to 740 °C and slurry viscosity altered from 20 to 36 sec. A full 2 -level factorial design experimental technique was used to identify the significant factors that effect on surface roughness of castings. The results show that surface roughness improved by lower pouring temperature, whereas slurry viscosity has less influence {{on the quality of}} surface...|$|R
30|$|Solubilization {{of calcium}} {{phosphate}} was done according to Sylvester-Bradley et al. ([1982]). Bacteria were grown in GY (glucose yeast medium) (10  g glucose, 2  g yeast extract and 15  g agar per liter). Two other solutions were prepared separately, one containing 5  g K 2 HPO 4 in 50  mL of distilled water, {{and the other}} containing 10  g CaCl 2 in 100  mL of distilled water. These solutions were added to one liter of GY <b>medium</b> just before <b>pouring</b> onto Petri dishes, and together they formed an insoluble layer of calcium phosphate that made the medium opaque. Clear halos around the colony were recorded as a positive result (after 12  days).|$|R
