50|$|In a single-spindle machine, {{these four}} {{operations}} {{would most likely}} be performed sequentially, with four cross-slides each coming into position in turn to perform their operation.

50|$|On {{draw bar}} models {{the height of}} the cut is {{determined}} using hydraulic rams on the mower itself; this requires remote hydraulics on the tractor. These mowers in this category range from 3.3 to 22 ft mowing width. Draw bar mowers which are able to mow larger widths up to 20 ft are available. These are <b>multi-spindle</b> and hinged so that the side wings can move over varied terrain. Also these wings can be folded up into a vertical position to reduce width for transport on roadways.|$|E
50|$|A roller mower, or rollermower, is a tractor-powered <b>multi-spindled</b> {{rotary mowers}} that have full width rollers front and rear. Most rollermowers attach to a four-wheeled tractor via the three-point linkage and are {{powered by the}} tractor’s power {{take-off}} (PTO), though larger models connect three or more complete mowing decks to a separate chassis that is towed behind the tractor. Good rollermowers can produce a finish rivalling that of reel (cylinder) mowers while generally being far more robust and requiring considerably less maintenance. Modern machines can also cope efficiently with {{a wider range of}} grass lengths and densities than cylinder mowers.|$|R

This paper reviews the important developments of the crankshaft grinding process, primarily by analysing patented grinding methods.

50|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of rotation}} around a fixed axis {{is that of}} constant angular speed. Then the total torque is zero. For {{the example of the}} Earth rotating around its axis, there is very little friction. For a fan, the motor applies a torque to compensate for friction. Similar to the fan, equipment found in the mass production manufacturing industry demonstrate rotation around a fixed axis effectively. For example, a <b>multi-spindle</b> lathe is used to rotate the material on its axis to effectively increase production of cutting, deformation and turning. The angle of rotation is a linear function of time, which modulo 360° is a periodic function.|$|E
5000|$|The {{spinning}} jenny is a <b>multi-spindle</b> spinning frame, {{and was one}} of the key {{developments in}} the industrialization of weaving during the early Industrial Revolution. It was invented in 1764 by James Hargreaves in Stanhill, Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire in England. The device reduced the amount of work needed to produce cloth, with a worker able to work eight or more spools at once. This grew to 120 as technology advanced. The yarn produced by the jenny was not very strong until Richard Arkwright invented the water-powered 'Water Frame', which produced yarn harder and stronger than that of the initial spinning jenny. It started the factory system.|$|E
40|$|A {{volumetric}} {{error compensation}} method for a machining center that has multiple cutting tools operating simultaneously has been developed. Due to axis sharing, the geometric errors of <b>multi-spindle,</b> concurrent cutting processes {{are characterized by}} a significant coupling of error components in each cutting tool. As a result, {{it is not possible}} to achieve exact volumetric error compensation for all axes. To minimize the overall volumetric error in simultaneous cutting, a method to determine compensation amount using weighted least squares has been proposed. This method also allows tolerance distribution of machining accuracy for different surfaces of a workpiece. A geometric error model has been developed using an arch-type, <b>multi-spindle</b> machine tool, and the error compensation simulation results based on this model are presented. The simulation results demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed error compensation algorithm for use with <b>multi-spindle</b> simultaneous cutting applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{describes}} {{tool breakage}} monitoring in a <b>multi-spindle</b> drilling using acoustic emission (AE) signals. Measurements {{have been carried}} out in a real industry environment with a tailor-made <b>multi-spindle</b> gun drilling machine. The drilling machine comprises some 300 spindles in one line and it is used to drill holes in paper machine parts. Measured AE-signals have been analysed both in time and frequency domain and especially high frequency content of AE-signals (over 150 kHz) have been examined. Breakage can be detected distinctly over the frequency content of AE-signals born in a normal undisturbed drilling. The location of sensors play very crucial role because the high frequency content of AE-signals attenuates very rapidly with increasing distance between the sensor and cutting process...|$|E
40|$|Transfer Line Balancing Problem (TLBP) was {{introduced}} in [3] In comparison with the well-known assembly line balancing problems, TLBP has many new assumptions reflecting the particularities of the machining environment. Machining transfer lines are usually paced and serial. They consist of a sequence of stations linked by an automated material handling device. In lines of this type, each station is equipped by a special machine-tool which performs machining operations block by block. All operations of each block are executed simultaneously using one <b>multi-spindle</b> head. The parallel execution of operations is possible {{due to the fact}} that the <b>multi-spindle</b> heads carry several simultaneously activated tools. When machining at the current station is finished (all blocks installed on this machine have been activated) the part is moved to the next station. The time span between two movements can not exceed the given time value T 0 referred to as line cycle time. The balancing problem consists in assigning the given set of operations to parallel blocks and stations under given assignment restrictions. The objective is to configure a serial machining line that consists of a number of linearly ordered machines. All the machines are linked by an automated material handling device without buffers between machines. Each machine is equipped with <b>multi-spindle</b> heads activate...|$|E

In this investigation, <b>multi-spindle</b> machining heads were analyzed using equipment from Technology for Energy Corporation. A spectral analysis program was also written {{in order to better}} understand black box results provided by commercial software. Three case studies indicate that gear mesh frequencies, bearing noise, and the natural frequencies of spindles and shafts represent the majority of the peaks found in the frequency spectrum for <b>multi-spindle</b> heads. These frequencies were calculated analytically and then identified in each frequency spectrum. The results show that in many cases the gear mesh frequencies are too close to the natural frequencies of the spindles and shafts. This causes the spindles to be excited at their natural frequency and can lead to premature failure of the spindle bearings...|$|E

40|$|The goal {{of cancer}} {{chemotherapy}} is targeting tumor cells and/or tumor-associated microvessels {{with the lowest}} systemic toxicity. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are promising vehicles for selective drug delivery due to their peculiar ability to home to pathological tissues. We previously showed that MSCs are able to uptake and subsequently to release the chemotherapeutic compound Paclitaxel (PTX) and to impair the growth of subcutaneous glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) xenografts. Here we used an orthotopic GBM model 1) to assess whether PTX-loaded MSCs (PTX-MSCs) retain a tropism towards the tumor cells in the brain context, and 2) to characterize the cytotoxic damage induced by MSCs-driven PTX release in the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: U 87 MG GBM cells were fluorescently labeled with the mCherry protein and grafted onto the brain of immunosuppressed rats. In adjacent brain regions, we injected green fluorescent protein-expressing murine MSCs, either loaded with PTX or unloaded. After 1 week survival, the xenografted brain was assessed by confocal microscopy for PTX-induced cell damage. RESULTS: Overall, MSCs showed remarkable tropism towards the tumor. In rats grafted with PTX-MSCs, the nuclei of U 87 MG cells showed changes that are typically induced by PTX, including <b>multi-spindle</b> mitoses, centrosome number alterations, and nuclear fragmentation. <b>Multi-spindle</b> mitoses resulted in multinucleated cells that were significantly higher in tumors co-grafted with PTX-MSCs than in controls. Nuclear changes did not occur in astrocytes and neurons surrounding the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: MSCs appear particularly suited for anti-neoplastic drug delivery in the brain since PTX-specific damage of GBM cells can be achieved avoiding side effects to the normal tissue...|$|E
