Jerry Falwell was {{a perfect example of}} that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
500|$|Blake {{comments}} that Disraeli [...] "produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse. Further {{he wrote a}} discourse on political theory and a political biography, the Life of Lord George Bentinck, which is excellent... remarkably fair and accurate." [...] But it is on his novels that Disraeli's literary achievements are generally judged. They have from the outset divided critical opinion. The writer R. W. Stewart observed that {{there have always been}} two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels—one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, [...] "It is after all, even if you are a Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one." ...|$|E

Additionally, “God Help the Outcasts” [...] "touches on a basic idea behind most faiths." [...] Asking [...] "was Jesus [...] not an outcast, too, as [...] sees firsthand how her people, are persecuted for their differences," [...] the first verse of the song reads, [...] "I don't know if You can hear me/Or if You're even there/I don't know if You would listen/To a gypsy's prayer." [...] Teen Ink observed, [...] "This part is about how it seems like God doesn't listen to you or help you, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> pray or talk to him." [...] Finally, asking people to be kind and unselfish, Esmeralda sings, [...] "Please help my people, the poor and downtrodden/I thought we all were the children of God.” In The Gospel According to Disney, author Mark I. Pinsky drew similarities between [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] and the Christian hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," [...] as both songs explore [...] "the love of God that knows no bounds."

[...] Louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was, in fact, a dream—until he finds his feet and bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles. Nevertheless, Louis dismisses the dream as the product of the stress he experienced during Pascow's death, coupled with his wife's lingering anxieties about the subject of death.|$|E
2500|$|... 3. In three {{dimensions}} {{a consequence of}} the Brouwer fixed-point theorem is that, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> stir a cocktail in a glass (or think about milk shake), when the liquid has come to rest, some point in the liquid will end up in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, that the liquid after stirring is contained within the space originally taken up by it, and that the glass (and stirred surface shape) maintain a convex volume. [...] Ordering a cocktail shaken, not stirred defeats the convexity condition ("shaking" [...] being defined as a dynamic series of non-convex inertial containment states in the vacant headspace under a lid). [...] In that case, the theorem would not apply, and thus all points of the liquid disposition are potentially displaced from the original state.|$|E
