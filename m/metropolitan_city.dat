40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a brief {{assessment}} of the legal framework of the newly established <b>metropolitan</b> <b>cities</b> in the Italian domestic legal order.

The conclusion will argue that, while the enactment of local government reforms combined with the entering into force of a significant constitutional amendment will increasingly diminish {{the role of the}} Regions, <b>metropolitan</b> <b>cities,</b> due to their ambivalent nature, still lack any propulsive thrust and face the risk of being marginalized until a consistent legal framework for their proper funding is laid down (4) ...|$|R
