Directly-controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century {{very few}} castles were well <b>maintained</b> by their owners. Many royal castles were {{receiving}} insufficient investment {{to allow them}} to be <b>maintained</b> – roofs leaked, stone work crumbled, lead or wood was stolen. The Crown was increasingly selective about which royal castles it <b>maintained,</b> with others left to decay. By the 15th century only Windsor, Leeds, Rockingham and Moor End were kept up as comfortable accommodation; Nottingham and York formed the backbone for royal authority in the north, and Chester, Gloucester and Bristol forming the equivalents in the west. Even major fortifications such as the castles of North Wales and the border castles of Carlisle, Bamburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne saw funding and maintenance reduced. Many royal castles continued to have a role as the county gaol, with the gatehouse frequently being used as the principal facility.|$|E
