5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that <b>many</b> <b>women</b> are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, <b>many</b> <b>women</b> turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E

5|$|Pregnancy {{leads to}} marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology.

5|$|The modern {{family is}} {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} originated in the 1830s: courtship became more open, marriages were often based on affection, and parents devoted more attention to children. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, married couples began to emphasize the importance of sexual attraction and compatibility in their relationships. This led to more intimate and open relationships along with more adolescent freedom. The transition of the family was influenced by the Great Depression, which forced <b>many</b> <b>women</b> into the workplace in order to compensate for lack of financial stability. In 1932, a federal executive order stated that only one spouse could work for the federal government. This resulted in <b>many</b> <b>women</b> being forced to resign allowing their husbands to continue working.|$|E
