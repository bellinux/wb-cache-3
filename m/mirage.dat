5|$|On 18 June 1992, a Greek <b>Mirage</b> F-1 crashed {{during a}} dogfight with a Turkish F-16. On 8 February 1995, a Turkish F-16 {{crashed into the}} Aegean after being intercepted by Greek <b>Mirage</b> F1 fighters.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{acquired}} a single <b>Mirage</b> for testing, as a preface to production under license of 100Dassault <b>Mirage</b> IIIS interceptors, with strengthened wings, airframe, and undercarriage. Avionics would differ as well, with the Thomson-CSF Cyrano II radar {{replaced by the}} Hughes Electronics TARAN-18system, to provide the <b>Mirage</b> IIIS compatibility with the AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missile. The <b>Mirage</b> IIIS {{was intended to be}} operated as an interceptor, ground attack, and reconnaissance aircraft, using wing pods for the photographic mission.|$|E
5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a <b>mirage</b> caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water <b>mirage</b> in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This {{would have resulted in}} a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|E
50|$|Over the {{demilitarized zone}} on the Israeli {{side of the border}} with Syria, a total of 6 MiGs were shot down the first day <b>Mirages</b> fought the MiGs. In the Six-Day War, apart from 12 <b>Mirages</b> (4 in the air and 8 on the ground) left behind to guard Israel from Arab bombers, all the <b>Mirages</b> were fitted with bombs and sent to attack the Arab air bases. However, the <b>Mirage's</b> {{performance}} as a bomber was modest. During the following days <b>Mirages</b> performed as fighters, and {{out of a total of}} 58 Arab aircraft shot down in air combat during the war, 48 were accounted for by <b>Mirages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The UFOs seen on radar {{can also}} be due to Fata Morgana, since water vapor in the air can create radar <b>mirages</b> more readily than {{temperature}} inversions can create optical <b>mirages.</b> According to GEPAN/SEPRA, the official UFO investigation in France, As is well known, atmospheric ducting is the explanation for certain optical <b>mirages,</b> {{and in particular the}} arctic illusion called [...] "fata morgana" [...] where distant ocean or surface ice, which is essentially flat, appears to the viewer in the form of vertical columns and spires, or [...] "castles in the air." [...] People often assume that <b>mirages</b> occur only rarely. This may be true of optical <b>mirages,</b> but conditions for radar <b>mirages</b> are more common, due to the role played by water vapor which strongly affects the atmospheric refractivity in relation to radio waves. Since clouds are closely associated with high levels of water vapor, optical <b>mirages</b> due to water vapor are often rendered undetectable by the accompanying opaque cloud. On the other hand, radar propagation is essentially unaffected by the water droplets of the cloud so that changes in water vapor content with altitude are very effective in producing atmospheric ducting and radar <b>mirages.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1985 the <b>Mirage</b> IIIS fleet, nearing 20 {{years of}} {{operational}} service, began a major upgrade program {{to improve the}} capabilities of the aircraft. The interceptors were retro-fitted with canards manufactured by Israeli Aircraft Industries on the air intakes to improve maneuverability and stability at landing speeds, new avionics and countermeasures, and redesignated the <b>Mirage</b> IIIS C.70.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Swiss Air Force {{acquired}} 20 British Aerospace Hawk Mk.66s {{to provide}} an interim solution to its jet training requirements, but these were retired in 2003 and sold to Finland.

5|$|On 8 October 1996, 7 {{months after}} the {{escalation}} over Imia a Greek <b>Mirage</b> 2000 reportedly fired an R.550 Magic II missile and shot down a Turkish F-16D over the Aegean Sea. The Turkish pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces. In August 2012, after the downing of a RF-4E on the Syrian Coast, Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz confirmed that the Turkish F-16D was shot down by a Greek <b>Mirage</b> 2000 with an R.550 Magic II in 1996 after violating Greek airspace near Chios island. Greece denies that the F-16 was shot down. Both <b>Mirage</b> 2000 pilots reported that the F-16 caught fire and they saw one parachute.|$|E

40|$|One {{explanation}} for the apparent volatility of asset prices is that people overreact to trades that are uninformative, creating self-generated information "mirages. " The authors test whether <b>mirages</b> occur in experimental asset markets. There are insiders in only half the periods, so traders cannot be sure if the trades of others reveal information. The authors observed four clear <b>mirages</b> in forty-seven periods without insiders. <b>Mirages</b> always occurred early in an experimental session; in later periods, traders learn whether there are insiders by observing nonprice information, such as the speed of trading, and <b>mirages</b> occurred only temporarily.

5|$|The new, larger {{aircraft}} design soon emerged, which was initially designated as P.1150/3 {{prior to being}} redesignated as the P.1154. In January 1962, HSA submitted the P.1154 design to NATO via the Ministry of Aviation. NBMR.3 also attracted ten other contenders, among which was P.1154's principal competitor, the Dassault <b>Mirage</b> IIIV. This design employed a separate lift/thrust engine concept whereby eight Rolls-Royce engines would provide lift during vertical flight alongside a single turbofan for thrust during horizontal flight. The <b>Mirage</b> IIIV was supported by British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), and also had the favour of {{several members of the}} Air Staff. In May 1962, the P.1154 emerged as the winner in the competition for the NBMR.3 over the <b>Mirage</b> IIIV.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo <b>Mirage</b> Sessions ♯FE {{is set in}} modern-day Tokyo, Japan. The story moves between {{multiple}} well-known city districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku. In {{the universe}} of Tokyo <b>Mirage</b> Sessions ♯FE, everyone holds an energy called Performa {{that enables them to}} pursue their dreams. Performa attracts beings called Mirages, who hail from an alternate dimension called the Idolasphere: while some Mirages harvest Performa for evil motives, others form alliances with humans to protect the real world. Those who form alliances with friendly Mirages are referred to as <b>Mirage</b> Masters. The main cast are employees and associates of Fortuna Entertainment, a talent agency that secretly acts as a hub and recruiting organization for <b>Mirage</b> Masters.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo <b>Mirage</b> Sessions ♯FE opens {{five years}} prior to the game's main events: at an opera {{attended}} by a young Tsubasa and Yashiro, everyone apart from Tsubasa vanishes without a trace. In the present, Itsuki encounters Tsubasa at the One of Millennium talent audition event, where she is hoping to begin her career as an idol. The compare is possessed by a hostile <b>Mirage,</b> and everyone in the building apart from Itsuki and Tsubasa is stripped of their Performa. Itsuki follows Tsubasa into the Idolasphere, and both are attacked by hostile Mirages. Awakening to their Performa, they use it to cleanse the Mirages: their attackers are revealed to be Chrom and Caeda, who ally respectively with Itsuki and Tsubasa. With help from Touma, who is the <b>Mirage</b> Master to Cain, the party free the compare from the hostile Mirage's control. Leaving the Idolasphere, they encounter Maiko, who offers them positions alongside Touma in Fortuna Entertainment so they can both forward their entertainment careers and help fight <b>Mirage</b> attacks alongside Kiria and her <b>Mirage</b> Tharja. They are aided by Tiki, who is suffering from amnesia similar to the other allied Mirages.|$|E

Acting on media speculation that the Iroquois engine program was also in jeopardy of being cancelled, the French government chose to end negotiations in October 1958 and opted for an upgraded version of the indigenous Snecma Atar, instead. There was never an explanation for this decision offered by the French government, even after Avro tried to offer the Iroquois as a private venture.|$|E

Four 119 Squadron Dassault <b>Mirages,</b> meanwhile, were to penetrate Egyptian airspace in the far south near Hurghada, imitating a routine reconnaissance flight. Once Soviet MiGs were scrambled to intercept the <b>Mirages,</b> these were to draw the MiGs westward, at which point the Phantoms and four 117 Squadron <b>Mirages</b> on station over the Sinai were to close in on the MiGs from the east, springing the trap.
