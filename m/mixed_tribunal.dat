50|$|Edward III made further {{attempts}} {{to involve the}} Crown with border law, and to regularise its machinery. He appointed Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick to join the Wardens as their supervisor; the 1367 commission included the requirement to have a quorum (of two) on the judicial bench; days of march were agreed on in advance; felons were required to be presented by English and Scottish juries before being sent before the Warden and a <b>mixed</b> <b>tribunal</b> (assuming not yet proven guilty); the guilty had to make restitution within fifteen days (if they had no goods to hand over and no lord to vouch for them, they were set to ransom); sheriffs were told to assist the Wardens in capturing suspects who had taken flight; for the first time, lesser nobility were brought into the system as conservators.Richard II's reign saw a failed attempt by the English Crown to lessen {{the power of the}} northern magnates and to manipulate their hold on the Wardenships (the Wardens becoming paid officers {{by the end of the}} 1380s) and it also saw intensive cross-border raiding and destruction. However, the use of border law was strengthened, perhaps because the region fell more closely under the influence of the Wardens (particularly the Percies and Nevilles in England and the Douglas family in Scotland). For example, the problem of felons fleeing to the various liberties where the King's writ did not run, was partially solved by making the lord of one of the largest of them (the Bishop of Durham who held the Liberty of Durham) Warden of the East March. Distraining ('poinding') was abolished in 1386 as being unworkable, and responsibility for compensation was given to the Wardens alone.|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} {{to the fact that}} academic projects on lay participation in China written in English have been very scarce, and also the views of the three schools of Chinese scholars, this thesis will conduct a thorough review of lay participation in China. Chapter 1 of this thesis firstly outlines the worldwide situation regarding lay participation. Chapter 2 sets out the historical background to the growth of lay participation in China, by recounting the various forms of and experiments with lay participation during China’s history. Chapters 3 and 4 study the status quo of the sole form of lay participation in China today, that is, the <b>mixed</b> <b>tribunal</b> system. Chapter 5 looks into the contribution that lay participation could potentially make to Chinese society. Chapter 6 offers some proposals with regard to the prospective direction for developing lay participation in China, from a realistic perspective. The thesis finds that lay participation has been neither declining worldwide, nor has been absent during China’s history. It also finds that although the <b>mixed</b> <b>tribunal</b> system in China today faces an array of problems, lay participation may potentially contribute to Chinese society in terms of a better justice system and improved democracy. After clarifying the prospects for continuing lay participation in China and proposing possible reformative measures, my thesis concludes that the system, with careful reconstruction, deserves a position in China’s future legal system; and that the leftist proposal, to abolish lay participation in China, should be rejected.

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{intended}} to provide in brief compass a review of much that {{is known about the}} American jury system, including the jury’s historical origins, its political role, controversies over its role and structure, its performance, both absolutely and in comparison to judges and <b>mixed</b> <b>tribunals,</b> and proposals for improving the jury system. The essay is informed throughout by 50 years of research on the jury system, beginning with the 1965 publication of Kalven and Zeisel’s seminal book, The American Jury. The political importance of the jury is seen to lie more in the jury’s status as a one shot decision maker largely independent of trial court bureaucracies than in its ability to nullify the law. Despite flaws in the jury process and room for improvement, the message that emerges from the literature is that juries take their job seriously {{and for the most part}} perform well. There is little reason to believe that replacing jury trials with bench trials or <b>mixed</b> <b>tribunals</b> would improve the quality of American justice, and some reason to think it might harm it...|$|R

This study researches lay people's attitudes toward the new system, their psychological knowledge (e. g., the reliability of eyewitness testimony) and legal knowledge (e. g., 'presumed innocent'), and the relationship between attitude and knowledge. Study 1 examined the responses of 294 citizens to a questionnaire; 90 responses are examined in Study 2. In both studies, respondents showed concerns about their lack of ability and knowledge to become a lay judge.

This hybrid system, where democratic rules have been adopted but not necessarily practiced, is controlled by the country‘s long tradition of patronage politics, corruption and impunity where money, power and political favors have enabled the bypassing of the rule of law. The legislature and judiciary is weak. The ruling party is influencing the laws being made and the judges by bribery and extortion etc. This due to decades of a weak legal system, after the Khmer Rouge wiped out all legal and moral norms, and killed almost the entire legal profession.

40|$|Córdoba is {{the first}} {{province}} of Argentina to adopt lay participation for the decision of criminal cases. Since 2005, a <b>mixed</b> <b>tribunal</b> of 8 lays and 3 judges decide some criminal cases by the rule of majority. Drawing on in-depth interviews with judges, other officials and jurors, this thesis explores this unique encounter of legal professionals and lays {{from the perspective of}} “microphysics of power” as put forward by Michel Foucault. The analysis first focuses on legal professionals’ perceptions of jurors and unveils how these perceptions construct jurors as a problem that needs to be governed. Secondly I discuss the tools of governance put into practice by legal professionals and the Judiciary to direct jurors’ conduct and argue that the interaction between lays and professionals is largely demarked by the mutual operation of power relations and knowledge. Next I look to jurors’ narratives to unravel their practices of self-governance and finally I trace the possibility of the emergence of resistant discourses by focusing on the narrative of a single juror. All in all this thesis constitutes an important departure from the previous body of work about lay participation in criminal justice by its theoretical approach and methodological advantages. It aims to make, by the theoretically informed analysis of relevant qualitative data, fruitful contributions both to the field of inquiries on jury trials and to more general discussions on how power in its myriad forms shapes subjectivities and governs conducts whilst circulates and is resisted against. </p...|$|E

40|$|Whatever court tries Saddam, {{it must be}} seen in {{the eyes}} of the world as fair, write Andrew Byrnes and Hilary Charlesworth IT IS not yet clear what type of court will be used to try Saddam Hussein for the atrocities that he and his regime inflicted on the Iraqi people and their neighbours. The US President, George Bush, has {{suggested}} that it will be a primarily Iraqi tribunal, but one that can withstand international scrutiny. What are the options? Any tribunal must satisfy international standards of impartiality and competence and observe due process. While the defendants must be assured a fair opportunity to present their case, it would be undesirable for a trial to drag on for years or to become a forum for political grandstanding. This is why it must be properly resourced. One possibility is trial before a national tribunal. The Iraqi Governing Council last week proclaimed a law establishing a special tribunal to try Iraqi nationals who had committed crimes against humanity and war crimes inside or outside Iraq during the Baathist period (1968 - 2003). This tribunal will comprise Iraqi judges and prosecutors (the council may appoint non-Iraqi judges if it considers this necessary). It will be assisted by international experts with a purely advisory role, and may end up a sizeable institution, with dozens of judges carrying out investigative functions, conducting trials and hearing appeals. The tribunal will apply international law, largely drawn from the Statute of the International Criminal Court, supplemented by reference to Iraqi criminal law. Unlike the ICC, the tribunal will probably have the power to impose the death penalty, a feature that will create controversy in the international community. It is far from clear that the Iraqi legal community has the necessary expertise for what will be a complex logistical and legal task. It would be sensible to include in the tribunal international judges with expertise in the fields of international criminal and humanitarian law. While a national tribunal would have the advantage of Iraqis judging Iraqis, it is also important that this is not seen as a domestic version of victors’ justice. A second option would be a purely international tribunal. The ICC would be of limited use, since it can deal only with crimes that have occurred since July 1 last year. Even the crimes allegedly committed during this year’s war in Iraq could only be brought before the ICC if the Security Council referred the situation to the court. This is most unlikely, given the antipathy of the US to the ICC and its power to veto any Security Council resolution along those lines. Another international model is the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals set up by the victorious powers after the second world war to try German and Japanese war criminals. However, the taint of victors’ justice that adheres to them even today suggests that similar tribunals staffed by the occupying powers would lack legitimacy. A further, arguably better, option would be a <b>mixed</b> <b>tribunal</b> of some sort, similar to the court recently established after an agreement between the UN and Sierra Leone. This court, unlike the UN ad hoc tribunals in The Hague, sits in the country where the atrocities occurred, comprises international and national judges and prosecutors, and applies international and local law. This would balance the interests of the community that has borne the brunt of the human rights abuses and those of the international community in ensuring that those who have threatened international peace and security are brought to justice; it is also likely to enjoy both international and national legitimacy. All of these possibilities are focused on the atrocities of the Baathist regime. It is also important that the allegations of war crimes made against coalition forces during the invasion of Iraq are openly and fairly investigated and dealt with, even though they may seem minor when viewed against Saddam’s record. This is not to fall into the trap of moral equivalence, but simply to assert the rule of law. The opportunity to put Saddam on trial for the atrocities committed over the years is profoundly significant. By learning the lessons of past tribunals, we have the opportunity to respond to barbarity with justice, dispensed in accordance with the international rule of law.

40|$|On May 1, 2007, Korea 2 ̆ 7 s National Assembly {{approved}} a judicial reform bill that introduces a jury system for serious criminal cases in Korean courts. The jury system is limited: jurors will only participate {{in cases where}} the defendant agrees to a trial by jury, and the jury 2 ̆ 7 s verdicts are only advisory to the judge. Nonetheless, Korean citizens now have a remarkable new opportunity to make judgments about criminal trials. With this law reform, Korea joins a growing list of countries whose legal systems employ citizens as legal decision makers. The United States, Great Britain, and many other common law countries use juries composed of citizens drawn from the general population who decide cases collectively. Civil law countries also use laypersons but more typically in the role of mixed decision-making bodies with law-trained judges. Lay judges, lay magistrates, and lay courts are also part of some judicial systems. What is the significance of including citizens as legal decision makers? Do the different forms of citizen involvement matter? Do they genuinely promote democracy and meaningfully contribute to the legal system 2 ̆ 7 s legitimacy, or do they merely serve as window-dressing, a patina of democratic participation masking authority that lies elsewhere? I have looked on with great interest as other countries have experimented in recent years with employing juries or <b>mixed</b> <b>tribunals</b> of lay citizens and law-trained judges in legal fact-finding. For example, following the oppressive regime of Franco, Spain introduced a jury system, as did Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
