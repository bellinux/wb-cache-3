40|$|Transcription initiates {{when the}} enzyme binds to the {{promoter}} region and melts open an initial transcribing bubble that extends from position - 4 to + 4. The initiation phase continues until the enzyme synthesizes ∼ 8 mer RNA, {{at which point}} T 7 RNA polymerase begins its transition into the elongation phase. The initiation phase {{is characterized by a}} energetic instability, which leads to release of small RNA 2 - 8 bases in length, known as abortive cycling. ^ Abortive cycling, which is the release of small RNA transcripts during synthesis of the first 8 bases of a transcript, has been well documented in most single and multisubunit RNA polymerases, and has been shown to occur in vivo. Structural studies have prompted the ‘scrunched intermediate’ mechanistic model (an elaboration of the earlier stressed intermediate model), which proposes that compaction of the upstream template DNA within the enzyme and/or expansion of the bubble during initiation leads to instability and the release of abortive RNAs. T 7 polymerases represent one of the most well characterized transcription systems and despite having no structural similarities to other multi subunit polymerases, shares very similar fundamental mechanistic features. In the initially transcribing abortive phase, the bubble expands as the initial RNA:DNA hybrid grows and the hybrid pushes on components of the enzyme: both key features in the proposed scrunching mechanism. In this work, we directly test predictions of the scrunching model. The introduction of nicks or gaps into the template (scrunched) strand should reduce stress and therefore reduce abortive. Similarly, the introduction of extra bases in this region should increase the release of abortive RNAs or shift their profile to shorter lengths. For all of these modifications, our results show no systematic change in the abortive amounts or profile. An alternate model predicts that a critical source of stress during abortive initiation is the stress caused by the steric clash of the DNA-RNA hybrid against the N-terminal domain. It is already known that this steric clash leads to the transition of the enzyme into a stable elongation complex, however it is unclear as to whether it induces energetic instability within the system. By introducing bulk at the 5 ’ end of an initiating RNA primer we have increased the putative stress of the DNA-RNA primer against the N terminal domain and demonstrated a slight increase in the release of abortive products. The increase in abortive RNA was however not systematic and even with an increase in the steric push, the enzyme continues to transition into the elongation phase and <b>make</b> <b>run</b> off RNA. Our results suggest that abortive cycling is a kinetically controlled process as opposed to any structurally mediated mechanism. ...|$|E
40|$|Above ground steel {{storage tanks}} {{are widely used}} to store liquids {{in a variety of}} industries. The design and fitness for service {{procedures}} for such tanks are a concern for international standards and need to be continually improved upon to ensure better safety and serviceability. Several important aspects about tank design and assessment are studied in this thesis. The bottom plate material near the shell to bottom joint in the tank is generally in plastic range. It is a critical failure point in many modes of tank failure. The effect of increasing the bottom plate projection length at this joint for tanks with rigid ring wall foundations is studied both theoretically and numerically. A theoretical beam model is validated using finite element analysis (FEA) and extended to determine the length of bottom plate projection needed for maximum effect. The formation of plastic hinges in the bottom plate on the inside and outside of this joint is discussed in detail using FEA. Tanks operating at elevated temperatures (200 ﾟF to 500 ﾟF) need to consider additional stresses due to thermal expansions and restraints from the tank shell and bottom plate interactions. The frictional forces from the foundation cause significant stresses at the tank bottom. The design guidelines by API 650 standard address this issue using a factor named ‘C’ that defines the ratio of actual expansion against free expansion of the tank bottom. At present, an empirical range of ‘C’ values (0. 25 – 1. 0) is allowed without clear guidelines for selecting a suitable value. This thesis evaluates the current procedure and suggests an alternate method by incorporating the friction coefficient directly in the stress equations, instead of the C-factor. The fill/draw down cycle of the stored liquid could lead to low cycle fatigue near shell to bottom joint. The peak alternating stress (strain) at this location determines the fatigue life of the tank. The widely used API 650 procedure employs beam on elastic foundation theory to determine the fatigue life for all tanks. The thesis shows that this is incorrect for tanks on concrete ring wall. The appropriateness of using this theory is studied and an alternative beam model is proposed. It is verified using FEA. Damage due to corrosion in the form of local thin area (LTA) is a widespread problem in storage tanks. Fitness for service (FFS) methods are quantitative engineering evaluations used to demonstrate the structural integrity of an in-service tank containing damage like LTA and <b>make</b> <b>run,</b> repair or replace decisions. The mα-tangent method is a simplified limit load procedure {{that can be used for}} such FFS evaluations. This thesis uses a modified reference volume for mα-tangent method applied to tanks and reports initial results for FFS evaluations. The study also finds that for large cylinders like tanks with very high R/t ratio, the circumferential decay lengths will be smaller than those previously reported (2. 5 Rt rather than 6. 3 Rt) ...|$|E
