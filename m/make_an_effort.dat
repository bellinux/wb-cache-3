5|$|In {{addition}} to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools. The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York {{public schools in}} 1921. The ACLU, working with the NAACP, also supported racial discrimination cases. The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923. There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, government search and seizure issues, right to privacy, or wiretapping.|$|E
5|$|A throw-in by Hagi led to Şükür {{attempting}} to reach Erdem, {{who was in}} the penalty area, but was tackled and match play continued, which saw Arsenal attack on the counter under Parlour, whose volley shot went wide. Overmars then had an opportunity, after being given the ball by Henry, but the shot was off target. In the 70th minute, Korkmaz exchanged passes with Erdem, but his effort was successfully blocked by Tony Adams. Three minutes later, Parlour attempted a bending cross for Henry, but Taffarel read it easily. A well-played pass by Nwankwo Kanu ensured the ball reached Henry on the left area, who proceeded to give it to Overmars in the penalty area – however, Overmars's shot fell flat, but still enough for Taffarel to make a save. With four minutes of normal time remaining, the Turks came close to a winning goal, when Şükür collected the ball from the centre and entered Arsenal's area, but lost his footing before he could <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> on goal, allowing Seaman to pick up the ball for a goal kick. Two minutes of extra time were added on, just when a free-kick was awarded to Galatasaray. Şükür took the shot, but the ball headed wide around the wall. It proved to be the final event in normal time, as the match entered extra time.|$|E

5|$|Away from Crescent's daily {{affairs and}} former {{political}} and media engagements, Ijaz {{has served on}} the College Foundation Board of Trustees at the University of Virginia, and he serves on the advisory board of the Rebuilding Afghanistan Foundation. RAF raises funds for building education infrastructure and programs in Afghanistan, including the construction of schools such as Mayar Elementary School, which enrolled 400 boys and girls from Maidan Wardak Province upon opening in late 2005. During the mid-1990s, Ijaz supported Developments in Literacy, an initiative to build and operate elementary schools in rural Pakistan as alternatives to the religious schools in which many Pakistani children were being radicalized. The group did not seek to create a secularized school system; its goal was to teach the Qur'an as one of many subjects rather than as the only subject. Ijaz and his wife Valérie also serve as goodwill ambassadors for a British charity, Children of Peace, that works to reconcile differences between Palestinian and Israeli youth. In late 2011, while addressing the World Peace Festival, a peace conference held in Berlin, Ijaz announced an intention to donate 1% of his net worth to create a Humanitarian Relief Fund that would <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to alleviate the root causes of poverty. In noting his belief that governments have often failed to provide assistance to the poor in sufficient ways over the long term, Ijaz sought similar pledges for the proposed fund from other philanthropists.|$|E

Barry followed Blackwell during her many trans-Atlantic moves, during her furious house hunt between 1874 and 1875, during which they moved six times, and finally to Blackwell's final home, Rock House, a small house off Exmouth Place in Hastings, Sussex, in 1879.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} between {{the release of the}} band's second seven-inch EP and the Out of Step record, the band briefly split when guitarist Lyle Preslar moved to Illinois to attend college for a {{semester}} at Northwestern University, Preslar was a member of Big Black for a few tempestuous rehearsals. During that period, MacKaye and Nelson put together a studio-only project called Skewbald/Grand Union; in a reflection of the slowly increasing disagreements between the two musicians, they were unable to decide on one name. The group recorded three untitled songs, which would be released posthumously as Dischord's 50th release. During Minor Threat's inactive period, Brian Baker also briefly played guitar for Government Issue and appeared on the <b>Make</b> <b>an</b> <b>Effort</b> EP.|$|E

25|$|Neither caliph {{participated in}} the direct {{military}} operations of the war. In Al-Musta'in's case, he was generally content to leave the responsibility of conducting the war effort to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah. As commander, Muhammad opted for an overall defensive strategy. Relying on his position in Baghdad, {{he was reluctant to}} engage in any sort of offensive operations outside the city and its surrounding districts, even when he was advised by others to do so. While he did <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to securing the nearby towns that controlled access to the city, {{there is no mention of}} any attempt to attack Samarra. By staying within Baghdad and keeping the city's supply routes open, while at the same time cutting off foodstuffs and tax receipts meant for Samarra, Muhammad likely believed that he could outlast al-Mu'tazz's armies.|$|E
25|$|Sonic 3D Blast {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} viewpoint in a 2D environment and uses pre-rendered 3D sprites, displaying pseudo-3D graphics. Sonic must find and destroy robots located around the zones, {{and bring the}} flickies inside them to large rings. Every zone has three acts: two standard levels and a boss fight against Robotnik, without any flicky-collecting involved. Once the player collects all five flickies from each section of an act, Sonic is either further advanced into the act, or taken to the next act. If Sonic or the following flickies are hit by an obstacle or enemy, the flickies will scatter. Each individual flicky's colour determines its behaviour. Blue and pink/orange flickies <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to find Sonic, while green and red flickies wander off at random; the latter even jumping about, making them harder to re-collect.|$|E
25|$|Some male {{behaviors}} {{that may have}} led to polyandry are displacement, where a male is gripped onto and mating with a female, another male may <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to mate as well and displace the male that was originally copulating; forced copulation, where there is a high density of aggressive males, and female abandonment, where a female but spots a better one to mate with and abandons the less favorable one. This can lead to sequential polyandry if the male leaves before the entire clutch is released and an additional male fertilizes these eggs as well. In Bibron's toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) females spread out their eggs across the nests of two to eight males, with those who exhibited higher levels of polyandrous behavior having higher mean offspring survivorship, showing that insurance against nest failure and dispersal of mortality risk is related to the evolution of polyandry.|$|E

25|$|On May 31, Xu Hai's raiders laid siege to Tongxiang with {{an arsenal}} of siege engines at their disposal, {{including}} siege towers mounted on boats, wheeled battering rams, and Portuguese breech-loading swivel guns. However, Tongxiang was protected by a new wall that was completed in 1553 and competent defenders who withstood the siege.

25|$|In November 1988, Harbourside's lease was {{transferred}} to Luna Park Investments Pty Ltd. A year later, after no efforts {{had been made to}} repair and reopen Luna Park, and several submissions to replace most or all of the amusement park with high-rise apartment blocks and hotels, the New South Wales State Government issued an ultimatum to the company - open Luna Park by 1 June 1990, or lose the lease. Despite this ultimatum, Luna Park Investments did little to prepare the site.

Four days after the government ultimatum passed, the lease was terminated and the Luna Park Reserve Trust was established.

25|$|Amargosa voles are a {{subspecies}} that {{is active}} year-round; {{they have no}} period of hibernation. Intraspecific interactions are frequent for Amargosa voles and {{can be attributed to}} their polygynous social system. They can found living in underground burrows in family groups of up to one male, several females, and their offspring. The female home range averages 0.02 acres and the male home range averages 0.03 acres, although the females generally travel longer distances than males throughout non-breeding season. Especially during peak breeding season in March and April, males tend to be territorial and <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to exclude other males from their home ranges. Male and female home ranges, however, may overlap. Daily ranges of these animals is substantially smaller, with individuals traveling only 16–17 feet from the burrow entrance to meet most of its life history needs. Daily movements and home range sizes vary somewhat with the environment and population density. Voles disperse throughout their lifetime, but dispersal is often limited by fragmentation of their habitat.|$|E

25|$|The 4th Session of the Central Council, held in Moscow from March 9–15, 1926, began {{just as the}} 6th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI came to a close.

Amsterdam had paid scant attention to Asia, leaving the field open to the Profintern's efforts, Lozovsky noted in his report to the Comintern Executive. RILU did <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to break new organizational ground outside of Europe as early as February 1922 when it established a Moscow office comparable to the Comintern's Eastern Bureau, headed by Buffalo, New York druggist Boris Reinstein, Bulgarian-American IWW member George Andreychine, and H.

25|$|The Alford plea arose {{out of the}} 1970 {{case before}} the Supreme Court of the United States, North Carolina v.

Wallace-Johnson also campaigned for improved salaries and working conditions for workers, national unity and an increased civic role for women.
