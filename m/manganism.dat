5|$|<b>Manganism</b> is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms {{give way to}} late-stage <b>manganism,</b> which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, <b>manganism</b> is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage <b>manganism</b> become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|E
5|$|In biology, manganese(II) ions {{function}} as cofactors {{for a large}} variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause <b>manganism,</b> a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{overexposure}} is {{most frequently}} associated with <b>manganism,</b> a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons {{employed in the}} production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations.

5|$|Manganese is an {{important}} element for human health, essential for development, metabolism, and the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake {{may lead to a}} condition known as <b>manganism,</b> a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors is large and includes oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses (though not lentiviruses such as HIV) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing polypeptides may be arginase, the diphtheria toxin, and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD).|$|E

40|$|Excessive {{manganese}} exposure {{may induce}} a neurological syndrome called <b>manganism,</b> {{which is similar}} to Parkinson’s disease (PD).

40|$|Manganese (Mn), is a trace metal {{required}} for normal physiological processes in humans. Mn levels are tightly regulated, as {{high levels of}} Mn result in accumulation {{in the brain and}} cause a neurological disease known as <b>manganism.</b> <b>Manganism</b> shares many similarities with Parkinson’s disease (PD), both at the physiological level and the cellular level. Exposure to high Mn-containing environments increases the risk of developing <b>manganism.</b> Mn is absorbed primarily through the intestine and then released in the blood. Excessive Mn is secreted in the bile and excreted in feces. Mn enters and exits cells through a number of non-specific importers localized on the cell membrane. Mutations in one of the Mn exporters, SLC 30 A 10 (solute carrier family 30, member 10), result in Mn induced toxicity with liver impairments and neurological dysfunction. Four PD genes have been identified in connection to regulation of Mn toxicity, shedding new light on potential links between <b>manganism</b> and PD...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{inhalation}} of {{high levels}} of manganese results in a nonspecific pulmonary edema, while chronic manganese inhalation leads to a characteristic neurotoxicity known as <b>manganism</b> with strong similarities to Parkinson’s disease. <b>Manganism</b> is characterized by motor deficits (dystonia, altered gait, fine tremor, generalized rigidity) and may include psychiatric disturbances. At low manganese levels {{and in the absence}} of frank <b>manganism,</b> subtle deficits in cognitive and neurobehavioral functions have been reported in both adults and children. Neurodevelopmental deficits have been associated with early life exposure to excessive manganese and include impaired intellectual performance and behavioral disinhibition.

40|$|Note: Figures may {{be missing}} from this {{format of the}} {{document}} For nearly a century, manganese has been recognized as an essential nutrient for proper bone formation, lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism.

40|$|Welding fume {{contains}} manganese (Mn) {{which is}} known to be bio-available to and neurotoxic for the central nervous system. Although an essential metal, Mn overexposure may cause <b>manganism,</b> a parkinsonian syndrome. The present welder study sought to improve the clinical portrait of <b>manganism</b> and to determine dose-effect relationships. The welders were employed {{in the construction of the}} new Bay Bridge (San Francisco) and welded in confined spaces for up to 2 years with minimal protection and poor ventilation. Neurological, neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and pulmonary examinations were given to 49 welders. Clinical cases were selected on the basis of apriori defined criteria pertaining to welding history and neurological/neuropsychological features. Among the 43 eligible welders, I I cases of <b>manganism</b> were identified presenting with the following symptoms: sleep disturbance, mood changes, bradykinesia, headaches, sexual dysfunction, olfaction loss, muscular rigidity, tremors, hallucinations, slurred speech, postural instability, monotonous voice, and facial masking. Significant associations between outcome variables and cumulative exposure index (CEI) or blood Mn (MnB) were obtained with CEI for variables implicating attention and concentration, working and immediate memory, cognitive flexibility, and verbal learning; and with MnB for executive function, cognitive flexibility, visuo-spatial construction ability, and visual contrast sensitivity. This study strongly suggests that neuropsychological features contribute in a dose-effect related way to the portrait of <b>manganism</b> usually characterized by tremor, loss in balance, diminished cognitive performance, and signs and symptoms of parkinsonism.

40|$|Manganese (manganese ion; {{referred}} to as Mn) is essential for neuronal function, yet it is toxic at high concentrations. Environmental and occupational exposure to high concentrations of Mn causes <b>manganism,</b> a well-defined movement disorder in humans, with symptoms resembling Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, <b>manganism</b> is distinct from PD and the neural basis of its pathology is poorly understood. To address this issue, we generated a zebrafish model of <b>manganism</b> by incubating larvae in rearing medium containing Mn. We find that Mn-treated zebrafish larvae exhibit specific postural and locomotor defects. Larvae begin to float on their sides, show a curved spine and swim in circles. We discovered that treatment with Mn causes postural defects by interfering with mechanotransduction at the neuromasts. Furthermore, {{we find that the}} circling locomotion could be caused by long-duration bursting in the motor neurons, which can lead to long-duration tail bends in the Mn-treated larvae. Mn-treated larvae also exhibited fewer startle movements. Additionally, we show that the intensity of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity is reversibly reduced after Mn-treatment. This led us to propose that reduced dopamine neuromodulation drives the changes in startle movements. To test this, when we supplied an external source of dopamine to Mn-treated larvae, the larvae exhibited a normal number of startle swims. Taken together, these results indicate that Mn interferes with neuronal function at the sensory, motor and modulatory levels, and open avenues for therapeutically targeted studies on the zebrafish model of <b>manganism...</b>|$|E
