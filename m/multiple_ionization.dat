5000|$|For {{noble gas}} atoms, {{non-sequential}} double ionization was first observed by L'Huillier. The interest to this phenomenon grew rapidly {{after it was}} rediscoveredin infrared fields and for higher intensities. <b>Multiple</b> <b>ionization</b> has also been observed. The mechanism of non-sequential double ionization in noble gas atoms differs from the one in alkaline earth atoms. For noble gas atoms in infrared laser fields, following one-electron ionization, the liberated electron can recollidewith the parent ion.This electron acts as an [...] "atomic antenna", absorbing theenergy from the laser field between ionization and recollision anddepositing it into the parent ion. Inelastic scattering on theparent ion results in further collisional excitation and/orionization. This mechanism {{is known as the}} three-step model of non-sequential double ionization, which is also closely related to the three step model of high harmonic generation.|$|E
50|$|Two {{models have}} been {{proposed}} to explain the non-sequential ionization; the shake-off model and electron re-scattering model. The shake-off (SO) model, first proposed by Fittinghoff et al., is adopted {{from the field of}} ionization of atoms by X rays and electron projectiles where the SO process {{is one of the major}} mechanisms responsible for the <b>multiple</b> <b>ionization</b> of atoms. The SO model describes the NS process as a mechanism where one electron is ionized by the laser field and the departure of this electron is so rapid that the remaining electrons do not have enough time to adjust themselves to the new energy states. Therefore, there is a certain probability that, after the ionization of the first electron, a second electron is excited to states with higher energy (shake-up) or even ionized (shake-off). We should mention that, until now, there has been no quantitative calculation based on the SO model, and the model is still qualitative.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the gammas, which ionize {{only the}} atoms they strike, a rapidly moving beta induces {{enormous}} magnetic fields in atoms they pass nearby, {{causing them to}} ionize while slowing the beta down. Each beta can thus cause <b>multiple</b> <b>ionizations,</b> {{as well as being}} a free electron on its own. This causes a much larger but spread out current pulse of lower energy electrons released from these air molecules. Since the reaction takes place between 50 and 60 km, the result is a disk of ionized air about 10 km thick and (typically) several hundred kilometers across.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to charging effects, AES {{data can be}} obscured {{by the presence of}} characteristic energy losses in a sample and higher order atomic ionization events. Electrons ejected from a solid will generally undergo multiple scattering events and lose energy in the form of collective electron density oscillations called plasmons. If plasmon losses have energies near that of an Auger peak, the less intense Auger process may become dwarfed by the plasmon peak. As Auger spectra are normally weak and spread over many eV of energy, they are difficult to extract from the background and in the presence of plasmon losses; deconvolution of the two peaks becomes extremely difficult. For such spectra, additional analysis through chemical sensitive surface techniques like x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is often required to disentangle the peaks. Sometimes an Auger spectrum can also exhibit [...] "satellite" [...] peaks at well-defined off-set energies from the parent peak. Origin of the satellites is usually attributed to <b>multiple</b> <b>ionization</b> events in an atom or ionization cascades in which a series of electrons is emitted as relaxation occurs for core holes of multiple levels. The presence of satellites can distort the true Auger peak and/or small peak shift information due to chemical bonding at the surface. Several studies have been undertaken to further quantify satellite peaks.|$|E

In fact, for every MeV of radiation energy deposited in matter, about 5 x 10 ! secondary electrons (- 10 !!>s time window, these entities may propagate through nanometer distances in the biological medium, leading to several inelastic events [3]. Low energy electrons, with energy below 20 eV can be resonantly captured in unoccupied molecular orbitals (virtual orbitals) [4, 5].
