She was quite sure of that. Whether proletary or not, there was nothing about him to offend {{the taste of the}} best-born of ladies. That he was better educated than any of the highly-bred young men she saw around her, she was quite sure. He had <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> than others. Of his birth and family she knew nothing, but rather prided herself in knowing nothing, because of that {{doctrine}} of hers that a man is to be estimated only by what he is himself, and not at all by what he may derive from others. Of his personal appearance, which went far with her, she was very proud. He was certainly a handsome young man, and endowed with all outward gifts of manliness: easy in his gait, but not mindful of it, with motions of his body naturally graceful but never studied, with his head erect, with a laugh in his eye, well-made as to his hands and feet. Neither his intellect nor his political convictions would have recommended a man to her heart, unless there had been something in the outside to please her eye, and from the first moment in which she had met him he had never been afraid of her,--had ventured when he disagreed from her to laugh at her, and even to scold her. There is no barrier in a girl's heart so strong against love as the feeling that the man in question stands in awe of her.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Over {{the last}} two decades, a sense of {{awareness}} has arisen that universities are facing important challenges. This article focuses on the challenge that could be broadly termed as ‘the digitisation of academic work’, yet without assuming that this digitisation would be an explanatory factor clarifying the precise nature of contemporary academic work. On the contrary, and adopting a relational actor-network theory (ANT) approach, this article stresses the concrete composition of academic work without making any general presumptions regarding how the university looks at present. Furthermore, by introducing a specific interview technique as methodological approach and different visualisations as (qualitative) analytical approach, this article offers a threefold exploratory textual and visual analysis of academic practice in the making. The article concludes, firstly, that it makes not much sense any <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> academic practice in terms of humans or non-humans, material or digital, etc. Instead, perhaps {{it makes more sense}} to speak of actors in academic practice as being humandigital. Secondly, the article concludes that sociomaterial approaches might constitute a fruitful addition to more traditional research about the university that is inclined to focus on epochal changes that are suggested or expected to alter the position of academics and the university...|$|E

Some of general change types match aspect-oriented design patterns or their combinations. ...|$|R

40|$|This study brings {{together}} {{the literature on}} social network approaches to social capital and health and on migration and HIV risks to examine how non-migrating wives of labor migrants use their personal networks to cope with perceived risks of HIV infection in rural southern Mozambique. Using data from a 2006 survey of 1, 680 women and their dyadic interactions, we compare the composition of personal networks, HIV/AIDS communication, and preventive behavior of women married to migrants and those married to non-migrants. Results show that migrants’ wives {{were more likely than}} non-migrants’ wives to have other migrants’ wives as personal network members, to engage in HIV/AIDS communication, and to discuss HIV prevention. However, they were no <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> HIV/AIDS with migrants’ wives than with non-migrants’ wives. They were also no <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> AIDS and its prevention than non-migrants’ wives who express worry about HIV infection from their spouses. Finally, we detect that network members’ prevention behavior was similar to respondents’, although this did not depend on migration.
