40|$|Abstract. The {{kinetics}} of <b>microbial</b> ferrous-iron <b>oxidation</b> {{have been}} well studied {{as it is a}} critical sub-process in bioleaching of sulphide minerals. Exhaustive studies in continuous culture have been carried out recently, investigating the effects of conditions relevant to heap bioleaching on the <b>microbial</b> ferrous-iron <b>oxidation</b> by Leptospirillum ferriphilum [1 - 3]. It was postulated that ferric-iron, which is known to be inhibitory, also acts as a stress stimulus, promoting microbial growth at higher total iron concentration. This paper investigates this phenomenon further, by comparing tests run with pure ferrous-iron feeds against those where the feed is partially oxidised to ferric at comparable concentrations. The findings clearly suggest that, contrary to reactor theory, it is indeed ferrous iron concentration in the reactor feed that determines biomass concentration and that ferric iron concentration has little effect on microbial growth. Further mathematical analysis shows that the phenomenon can be explained {{on the basis of the}} Pirt equation and the particular reaction conditions employed in the test work...|$|R

40|$|Neutrophilic Fe(II) {{oxidizing}} microorganisms {{are found}} in many natural environments. It has been hypothesized that, at low oxygen concentrations, <b>microbial</b> iron <b>oxidation</b> is favored over abiotic oxidation. Here, we compare the kinetics of abiotic Fe(II) oxidation to oxidation {{in the presence of}} the bacterium Leptothrix cholodnii Appels isolated from a wetland sediment. Rates of Fe(II) oxidation were determined in batch experiments at 20 ◦C, pH 7 and oxygen concentrations between 3 and 120 μmol/l. The reaction progress in experiments with and without cells exhibited two distinct phases. During the initial phase, the oxygen dependency of <b>microbial</b> Fe(II) <b>oxidation</b> followed a Michaelis-Menten rate expression (KM = 24. 5 ± 10 μmol O 2 /l, vmax = 1. 8 ± 0. 2 μmol Fe(II) /(l min) for 108 cells/ml). In contrast, abiotic rates increased linearly with increasing oxygen concentrations. At similar oxygen concentrations, initial Fe(II) oxidation rates were faster in the experiments with bacteria. During the second phase, the accumulated iron oxides catalyzed further oxidative iron precipitation in both abiotic and microbial reaction systems. That is, abiotic oxidation also dominated the reaction progress in the presence of bacteria. In fact, in some experiments with bacteria, iron oxidation during the second phase proceeded slower than in the absence of bacteria, possibly due to an inhibitory effect of extracellular polymeric substances on the growth of Fe(III) oxides. Thus, our results suggest that the competitive advantage of <b>microbial</b> iron <b>oxidation</b> in low oxygen environments may be limited by the autocatalytic nature of abiotic Fe(III) oxide precipitation, unless the accumulation of Fe(III) oxides is prevented, for example, through a close coupling of Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III) reductio...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{presented}} data that indicated <b>microbial</b> sulfide <b>oxidation</b> would out-compete strictly chemical, abiotic sulfide oxidation reactions under nearly all conditions relevant to extant ecosystems (Luther et al., 2011). In particular, we showed how anaerobic <b>microbial</b> sulfide <b>oxidation</b> rates were several {{orders of magnitude}} higher than even metal catalyzed aerobic sulfide oxidation processes. The fact that biotic anaerobic sulfide oxidation is kinetically superior to abiotic reactions implies that nearly all anaerobic and sulfidic environments should host microbial populations that oxidize sulfide at appreciable rates. This was likely an important biogeochemical process during long stretches of euxinia in the oceans suggested by the geologic record. In particular, phototrophic sulfide oxidation allows the utilization of carbon dioxide as the electron acceptor suggesting that this process should be particularly widespread {{rather than relying on}} the presence of other chemical oxidants. Using the Chesapeake Bay as an example, we argue that phototrophic sulfide oxidation may be more important in many environments than is currently appreciated. Finally, we present methodological considerations to assist other groups that wish to study this process...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{studies have}} shown that neutrophilic Fe(II) oxidizers can {{conserve}} energy from Fe(II) oxidation, however, it is still unclear how they can compete against the fast abiotic reaction at neutral pH, or to which extent these bacteria increase the overall Fe(II) oxidation rate. Similar to acidophilic Fe(II) oxidizers, neutrophilic oxidizers use Fe(II) as electron source. In contrast to acidophilic Fe(II) oxidizers, however, they are challenged by the fast kinetics of the abiotic reaction, because Fe(II) oxidation is significantly faster at neutral pH compared to oxidation under acidic conditions. The competition with abiotic Fe(II) oxidation may be attenuated by environmental factors other than pH. For example, temperature or oxygen concentration may potentially favor <b>microbial</b> Fe(II) <b>oxidation,</b> but the dependence of <b>microbial</b> Fe(II) <b>oxidation</b> rates on these factors has not yet been systematically investigated. This thesis aims at filling this gap by studying the effect of temperature and oxygen concentration on the kinetics and products of <b>microbial</b> Fe(II) <b>oxidation.</b> While the experimental work was conducted in the laboratory under controlled conditions, with a single strain of iron oxidizing bacteria, an attempt was also made to better characterize the relationship between physico-chemical conditions and the occurrence of Fe(II) oxidizers in sediments from a freshwater marsh. The highest abundance of Gallionella-like Fe(II) oxidizers was observed in the upper 5 - 12 cm of sediments collected in the fresh water part of the Scheldt estuary in Belgium. In spring, the largest diversity and cell densities of Fe(II) oxidizers were found when coincidently also the highest concentrations of extractable Fe(III) were detected. The diversity of the Fe(II) oxidizers was smaller and no Fe(III) was detected in samples collected during summer and fall. The change in diversity and possibly the activity of the bacteria may be related to changes in temperature and oxygen concentration. However, no simple relationship between geochemistry and occurrence of Fe(II) oxidizers could be deduced from the results. The laboratory experiments with Leptothrix cholodnii Appels showed that microbial and abiotic Fe(II) oxidation proceed in two phases with different kinetics. During the initial phase, <b>microbial</b> Fe(II) <b>oxidation</b> rates exceeded those of the abiotic reaction. In this phase, the oxygen dependency of the <b>microbial</b> Fe(II) <b>oxidation</b> followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and the temperature dependency was characterized by an optimum temperature around 30 - 37 °C. During the second phase, the accumulated iron oxides catalyze the reaction so that abiotic Fe(II) oxidation was dominant also in experiments with Leptothrix. Hence, microbial and abiotic rates were similar and showed similar dependencies on temperature and oxygen concentration. Characterizing the oxides from microbial and abiotic experiments revealed that both contained lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite. However oxides produced in the presence of Leptothrix were smaller and better ordered compared to abiotic oxides. In conclusion, oxygen and temperature can influence the role of neutrophilic iron oxidizers in Fe redox cycling by affecting the rates of microbial and abiotic Fe(II) concentration...|$|R

The aim of this research was to study two possible microbial iron precipitation pathways in the biofilm, namely, <b>microbial</b> iron <b>oxidation</b> and <b>microbial</b> degradation of organic Fe(III) complexes. The iron-oxidizing activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the formation of the dye Wurster blue in biofilm extracts. Iron-oxidizing activity was effectively detected in extracts obtained by oxalic acid treatment of biofilm fragments. Extracts obtained without oxalic acid treatment, heated extracts, or extracts supplemented with H(g) Cl 2 did not show any activity. This suggests that an iron-oxidizing factor (IOF), possibly an enzyme, coprecipitated with the mineral. Additional information gathered by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel-filtration chromatography, and UV spectrophotometry indicate that the IOF would be a small peptide or glycopeptide (1, 350 Da). Microbial degradation of organic Fe(III) complexes was assayed with biofilm fragments incubated in a medium containing ferric citrate. Analysis of the supernatants after various intervals revealed that the complex was degraded by living microorganisms much faster than in the heat-killed negative controls.
