25|$|In 1981, Brown, who had {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} strong environmentalist, was confronted with a serious <b>medfly</b> infestation in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was advised by the state's agricultural industry, and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection service (APHIS), to authorize airborne spraying of the region. Initially, in accordance with his environmental protection stance, he chose to authorize ground-level spraying only. Unfortunately, the infestation spread as the <b>medfly</b> reproductive cycle out-paced the spraying. After more than a month, millions of dollars of crops had been destroyed and billions of dollars more were threatened. Governor Brown then authorized a massive response to the infestation. Fleets of helicopters sprayed malathion at night, and the California National Guard set up highway checkpoints and collected many tons of local fruit; in the final stage of the campaign, entomologists released millions of sterile male medflies in an attempt to disrupt the insects' reproductive cycle.|$|E
25|$|Interfering with insects' {{reproduction}} can {{be accomplished}} by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring. This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the <b>medfly,</b> the tsetse fly, and the gypsy moth. However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of the}} few {{suspected}} acts of entomological bioterrorism an eco-terror {{group known}} as The Breeders claimed to have released Mediterranean fruit flies (medflies) amidst an ongoing California infestation. Lockwood asserts that there is some evidence the group {{played a role in the}} event. The pest attacks a variety of crops and the state of California responded with a large-scale pesticide spraying program. At least one source asserted that there is no doubt that an outside hand played a role in the dense 1989 infestation. The group stated in a letter to then Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that their goals were twofold. They sought to cause the <b>medfly</b> infestation to grow out of control which, in turn, would render the ongoing Malathion spraying program financially infeasible.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1975, when <b>medflies</b> {{were first}} {{seen in the}} area, California erected small McPhail traps to attract and capture the <b>medflies</b> to help measure the {{estimated}} population.

500|$|In {{response}} to a Mediterranean fruit fly (also known as “Medfly”) outbreak, officials from the Florida Department of Agriculture sprayed pesticides (primarily malathion) and bait over five counties during {{the spring and summer}} of 1998. [...] Scientists from the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences stated that malathion was being sprayed in a manner that did not pose a significant risk to public health. [...] During the eradication effort, the Florida Department of Health investigated 230 cases of illness that were attributed to the pesticide. [...] Officials from the Florida Department of Health and the SENSOR-Pesticides program published an article in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) that described these case reports and recommended alternative methods for <b>Medfly</b> control, including exclusion activities at ports of entry to prevent importation, more rapid detection through increased sentinel trapping densities, and the release of sterile male flies to interrupt the reproductive cycle. [...] The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) incorporated these suggestions into their 2001 Environmental Impact Statement on the Fruit Fly Cooperative Control Program. [...] These impact statements guide the USDA's development of insect control strategies and decisions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Three major components, ethyl-(E) - 3 -octenoate, g ranyt acetate, and (E.

Peak emission of these compounds occurred uring the third to fifth {{hours of the}} photophase and differences were observed in the ratios of the three com-ponents emitted by male laboratory-reared and wild flies. These three com-pounds were synthesized, and a method was developed to formulate a synthetic blend that released the compounds in a ratio similar to that emitted by wild male <b>medflies.</b> Attractiveness of the blend to female <b>medflies</b> was demonstrated under field conditions by comparing trap catches. Black spher-ical traps, baited with the synthetic blend to release 1. 6 male equivalents, caught significantly more females than blank traps and traps from which the blend released was 0. 3, 3. 2 or 6. 4 male equivalents...|$|R

50|$|<b>Medfly</b> infestations are {{not without}} precedent, both in California and {{elsewhere}} in North America. Between 1975 and 1993 the state of California spent more than $170 million on <b>medfly</b> eradication programs meant to contain 12 different infestations. In 1996 the state began utilizing sterile medflies in its eradication program and between 1996 and 2007 the state experienced five infestations. A major 1981 <b>medfly</b> infestation cost California $40 million by itself. The 1981 infestation turned into a political crisis {{and led to the}} beginning of the state's aerial spraying program in July of that year. Medflies were found in traps as late as 2007 in Solano County, California. The first medflies in Florida turned up in 1929 and they have been a constant threat to the citrus crop there ever since. <b>Medfly</b> sightings occurred in Florida in 1997 and 2010.|$|E
5000|$|... "State {{officials}} have probably noticed an increase {{as well as}} an unusual distribution of <b>Medfly</b> infestation in Los Angeles County since March, 1989... Letter of responsibility [...] In December 1989, a two-page letter addressing Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was sent to the Los Angeles Times and Fresno Bee ostensibly from an [...] "ecoterrorist organization" [...] calling itself [...] "The Breeders". The Breeders claimed that it was responsible for the summer release of the medflies as retaliation for the environmental damage caused by the Malathion aerial spraying by the state. It also threatened to expand its <b>medfly</b> infestation into the San Joaquin Valley. The letters claimed that officials would have noticed an uptick in <b>medfly</b> numbers around March 1989. The group promised to make the aerial spraying program politically and financially impossible through the coordinated release of thousands of medflies. As early as December 1989 the group's claim was taken seriously. Initially, the letter was dismissed as [...] "some crank trying {{to get a lot of}} publicity", but there was evidence the group played a role in the infestation. [...] Certain characteristics of the 1989 <b>medfly</b> infestation led investigators to the conclusion that someone was responsible for deliberately releasing medflies. The dense <b>medfly</b> population coupled with the low number of <b>medfly</b> larvae found in the infested areas left entomologists baffled as to how the infestation could be completely natural. The writer of the letter, and any members of the alleged group, were never identified.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose the}} {{hypothesis}} that individual longitudinal trajectories of fertility are closely coupled to varying survival schedules across geographically isolated populations of the same species, {{in such a way}} that peak reproduction takes place before substantial increases in mortality are observed. This reproductive adaptation hypothesis is investigated for <b>medflies</b> through a statistical analysis of biodemographic data that were obtained for female <b>medflies</b> from six geographically far apart regions. The following results support the hypothesis: (1) Both survival and reproductive schedules differ substantially between these populations, where early peaks and subsequently fast declining reproduction are observed for short-lived, and protracted reproductive schedules for long-lived flies; (2) When statistically adjusting reproduction for the observed differences in survival, the differences in reproductive schedules largely vanish, and thus the observed differences in fertility across the populations can be explained by differences in population-specific longevity; (3) Specific survival patterns of the <b>medflies</b> belonging to a specific population predict the individual reproductive schedule for the flies in this population. The analysis is based on innovative statistical tools from functional data analysis. Our findings are consistent with an adaptive mechanism whereby trajectories of fertility evolve in response to specific constraints inherent in the population survival schedules...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the year}} {{following}} the attack, there were seizures of postal shipments {{which sought to}} intercept <b>medfly</b> larvae. In addition, 61,731 passengers and 2,430 cargo shipments were searched entering through airports, but no larvae were discovered. There were five [...] "intensive searches" [...] of cargo and baggage as it arrived at Los Angeles Airport and San Francisco Airport that tested positive for <b>medfly</b> larvae. 6306. Unless otherwise permitted by law, any person who willfully and knowingly imports into, or who willfully and knowingly transports or ships within, this state, a Mediterranean fruit fly is guilty of a felony. California Food and Agricultural Code, Section 6306 After its repeated sprayings failed to eradicate the <b>medfly</b> threat, California halted its Malathion aerial spraying program in March 1990, {{three months after the}} threat from The Breeders was received. The state instead opted to try the voluntary introduction of millions of radiation-sterilized medflies to interrupt the reproductive cycle and control the population.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale {{experiments}} on <b>medflies</b> that {{were subjected to}} sterilizing doses of ionizing radiation (plus intact controls) and maintained on either sugar-only or full, protein-enriched diets revealed that, whereas the mortality trajectories of both intact and irradiated male cohorts maintained on both diets are similar, the mortality patterns of females are highly variable. Mean mortality rates at 35 days in male cohorts ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 3 but in female cohorts ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 35, depending on treatment. The study reports three main influences: (a) qualitative differences exist in the sex–mortality response of <b>medflies</b> subjected to dietary manipulations and irradiation, (b) the female mortality response is linked to increased vulnerability due to the nutritional demands of reproduction, and (c) female sensitivity to environmental changes underlies {{the dynamics of the}} sex-mortality differential...|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, {{a sudden}} {{invasion}} of <b>medflies</b> (Mediterranean fruit flies) descended on California and began devastating crops.

40|$|Reproduction exacts a {{price in}} terms of {{decreased}} survival. Our analysis of the interplay between age patterns of fecundity and mortality for individual female <b>medflies</b> (Ceratitis capitata) revealed that individual mortality {{is associated with the}} time-dynamics of the egg-laying trajectory. In a sample of 531 <b>medflies,</b> we found that each individual has a characteristic rate of decline in egg laying with age. This defines an individual's rate of reproductive exhaustion. This rate was shown to predict subsequent mortality The larger the remaining reproductive potential, the lower the subsequent mortality An increased mortality risk was seen in flies for which egg production declined rapidly early on, irrespective of the level of egg production. Thus, reproductive potential and lifetime are coupled {{in such a way that}} those flies which are able to profit most from an extended life span {{in terms of}} increased egg output are indeed likely to live longer...|$|R
50|$|Ceratitis capitata, the Mediterranean fruit fly, or <b>medfly</b> for short, is {{a species}} of fruit fly capable of causing {{extensive}} damage {{to a wide range}} of fruit crops.

The quantile regression approach appears useful in refining several of the conclusions drawn from this study including the apparent decline in mortality rates at advanced ages, and the gender cross-over effect in survival functions for <b>medflies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Males of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, are {{strongly}} attracted to various plant odors, and previous work {{has demonstrated that}} male exposure to certain odors, including the scent of orange oil (OO) and ginger root oil (GRO), increases their mating success relative to non-exposed males. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this mating increase is not known. Here, we describe several experiments that further investigate the association between GRO- and OO-exposure and male signaling activity, pheromone attractiveness, and mating success in male <b>medflies.</b> Exposure to GRO or OO increased time spent pheromone calling but did not accelerate the rate of male sexual maturation. Using a wind tunnel, we compared female attraction to the pheromone of control, non-exposed males versus males previously exposed to OO or GRO. There {{was no evidence that}} GRO exposure enhanced the attractiveness of the male pheromone. The data for OO were inconclusive: females tended to spend more time on spheres emanating pheromone from OO-exposed males than on spheres emanating pheromone from non-exposed males, but the number of female landings did not differ between the two types of pheromone sources. Female choice tests confirmed that GRO- and OO-exposure boost male mating success relative to non-exposed males. Application of GRO directly to the abdomen reduced male mating success, whereas similar application of OO boosted male mating success. The potential role and mode of action of plant chemicals in the mating behavior of male <b>medflies</b> are evaluated in light of these findings...|$|R
