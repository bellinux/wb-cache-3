40|$|Maintenance {{is crucial}} to {{ensuring}} and improving system dependability: By performing timely inspections, repairs, and renewals the lifespan and reliability of systems can be significantly improved. Good maintenance planning, however, has to balance these improvements against the downsides of maintenance, such as costs and planned downtime. In this paper, we study the effect of different maintenance strategies on a pneumatic compressor used in trains. This compressor {{is critical to the}} operation of the train, and a failure can lead to a lengthy and expensive disruption. Within the rolling stock maintenance company NedTrain, we have modelled this compressor as a fault <b>maintenance</b> <b>tree</b> (FMT), i. e. a fault tree augmented with maintenance aspects. We show how this FMT naturally models complex maintenance plans including condition-based maintenance with regular inspections. The FMT is analysed using statistical model checking, which allows us to obtain several key performance indicators such as the system reliability, number of failures, and required unscheduled maintenance. Our analysis demonstrates that FMTs can be used to model the compressor, a practical system used in industry, including its maintenance policy. We validate this model against experiences in the field, compute the importance of performing minor services at a reasonable frequency, and find that the currently scheduled overhaul may not be cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on biodeterioration {{processes}} at six Jewish cemeteries in north-eastern Italy, which were generally subject to very poor maintenance. Several crustose lichens, as well as ruderal wooden plants, were found growing differentially on stone types in the various cemeteries. Lichens colonizing gravestones and woody plants were examined through field observations and several microscopic analyses. Evaluations were carried out on selected species and some damage risk indices were applied. The Index of Lichen Potential Biodeteriogenic Activity (LPBA) was calculated for Nanto stone, which suffered the highest degree of deterioration. The Hazard Index (HI), which is independent from the lithotype, was calculated for all the wooden plants. We also analyzed the ecological relationships of such colonization in order to evaluate indirect conservation treatments. The various lichen species were causing differential interactions with the stone, sometimes contributing in cracking and detachment of fragments. Their potential aggressiveness is mainly attributable to the different lithotypes, but also to changes in <b>maintenance,</b> <b>tree</b> canopy cover, and eutrophication. We have made suggestions for an appropriate plant management that considers their environmental, ornamental and symbolic importance in such context. For the stone conservative treatments against lichens, we also carried out tests on selected biocides...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance is an {{important}} way to increase system dependability: timely inspections, repairs and renewals can significantly increase a system’s reliability, availability and life time. At the same time, maintenance incurs costs and planned downtime. Thus, good maintenance planning has to balance between these factors. In this paper, we study the effect of different maintenance strategies on the electrically insulated railway joint (EI-joint), a critical asset in railroad tracks for train detection, and a relative frequent cause for train disruptions. Together with experts in maintenance engineering, we have modeled the EI-joint as a fault <b>maintenance</b> <b>tree</b> (FMT), i. e. a fault tree augmented with maintenance aspects. We show how complex maintenance concepts, such as condition-based maintenance with periodic inspections, are naturally modeled by FMTs, and how several key performance indicators, such as the system reliability, number of failures, and costs, can be analysed. The faithfulness of quantitative analyses heavily depend on {{the accuracy of the}} parameter values in the models. Here, we have been in the unique situation that extensive data could be collected, both from incident registration databases, as well as from interviews with domain experts from several companies. This made that we could construct a model that faithfully predicts the expected number of failures at system level. Our analysis shows that that the current maintenance policy is close to cost-optimal. It is possible to increase joint reliability, e. g. by performing more inspections, but the additional maintenance costs outweigh the reduced cost of failures...|$|E

40|$|Maintenance is {{essential}} to ensuring the dependability of a technical system. Periodic inspections, repairs, and renewals can prevent failures and extend a system’s lifespan. At the same time, maintenance incurs cost and planned downtime. It is therefore important to find a maintenance policy that balances cost and dependability. This paper presents a framework, fault <b>maintenance</b> <b>trees</b> (FMTs), integrating <b>maintenance</b> into the industry-standard formalism of fault trees. By translating FMTs to priced timed automata and applying statistical model checking, we can obtain system dependability metrics such as system reliability and mean time to failure, as well as costs of maintenance and failures over time, for different maintenance policies. Our framework is flexible and can be extended to include effects specific to the system being analysed. We demonstrate that our framework {{can be used in}} practice using two case studies from the railway industry: electrically insulated joints, and pneumatic compressors...|$|R

40|$|Cyber-physical systems, like Smart Buildings {{and power}} plants, {{have to meet}} high standards, {{both in terms of}} {{reliability}} and availability. Such metrics are typically evaluated using Fault trees (FTs) and do not consider maintenance strategies which can significantly improve lifespan and reliability. Fault <b>Maintenance</b> <b>trees</b> (FMTs) [...] an extension of FTs that also incorporate maintenance and degradation models, are a novel technique that serve as a good planning platform for balancing total costs and dependability of a system. In this work, we apply the FMT formalism to a Smart Building application.

This allows us to apply the probabilistic model checking more efficiently.

40|$|Multicasting {{has been}} the most popular {{mechanism}} for supporting group communication, wherein group members communicate through a multicast data distribution tree that spans {{all the members of the}} group. In a dynamic multicast session, members join/leave the group using graft/prune mechanisms, based on locally optimal paths, which would eventually degenerate the quality of the multicast tree. Therefore, efficient mechanisms need to be invoked periodically to maintain the cost of the multicast tree near optimal. However, <b>tree</b> <b>maintenance</b> would result in service disruption for the session. Therefore, there exists a trade-off between minimizing tree cost and minimizing service disruption. The goal of this dissertation is to develop and analyze a set of efficient <b>tree</b> <b>maintenance</b> techniques that aim to balance this tradeoff in QoS and overlay multicasting. To achieve this goal, the dissertation makes three key contributions. First, the design of scalable protocols, viz. tree migration and tree evolution, for maintaining QoS multicast trees. Second, the design of an efficient strategy, called partial protection approach, and its implementation methods for member join problem with path reliability being a QoS constraint. Third, the design of an efficient <b>tree</b> <b>maintenance</b> algorithm, based on the idea of mesh-tree interactions, for end-system based overlay multicasting. The proposed <b>tree</b> <b>maintenance</b> solutions have been evaluated and analyzed through a combination of simulation and analytical studies. The studies show that the proposed solutions indeed achieve a good balance between tree cost and service disruption competitively...|$|R
