500|$|Ravel was not by {{inclination}} a teacher, {{but he gave}} {{lessons to}} a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal {{that it was impossible}} to learn from studying Debussy's music: [...] "Only Debussy could have written it and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> only Debussy can sound." [...] When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they [...] "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto." ...|$|E
500|$|The Orb {{has been}} a {{prolific}} remixing team, having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989. Even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo, the Orb found steady work remixing for artists including Depeche Mode, Lisa Stansfield, and Front 242. The Orb's remixes from the early and mid-1990s feature {{a large number of}} comical samples, Progressive-Sounds describe them as [...] "ahead of their time" [...] and NME notes them as [...] "not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling." [...] Some pieces, such as their Bee Gees cover collaboration with Robbie Williams, received criticism for being [...] "beyond a joke" [...] for their use of strange noises. The Orb's remix of Nine Inch Nails' [...] "The Perfect Drug", too, was described as [...] "silly", as they <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Trent Reznor was [...] "drowning in his bathtub". Though Paterson maintains that much of the Orb's remix work is done to support other artists, he admits some of their remixes for major artists were performed so that they could [...] "pay the bills".|$|E
500|$|... "Chillin" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Steve Roberts from MTV praised Gaga's verse and for employing a similar singing style to M.I.A.. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard complimented the [...] "club-ready single" [...] for its [...] "bouncy hook and slick verses" [...] {{and called the}} song [...] "the perfect precursor to Wale's long-awaited debut". Mehan Jayasuriya from PopMatters commended the song for being a [...] "token party jam" [...] on the album track list. She added that [...] "for all the flack that the [...] has caught, it's still an indisputably catchy song, even if the 9th Wonder and Nick Catchdubs reworking from [...] Back to the Feature stands as the definitive version." [...] Andres Tardio from HipHopDX believed {{the composition of the}} song as [...] "Pop-friendly". A reviewer for XXL compared and described [...] "Chillin" [...] as [...] "distinctly D.C.-sounding anthem". David Jeffries from AllMusic praised Wale's [...] "natural delivery and quirky sense of humor" [...] in the song, likening his vocals to that of Jay-Z and Gaga's vocals to that of singer Rihanna. Describing [...] "Chillin" [...] as a [...] "club-friendly hopper", Chris Richards from The Washington Post believed that using Rihanna or M.I.A. on the track would have made it successful, rather than Gaga who was then considered a relatively unknown singer. Richards recalled a similar situation when Washington D.C. based go-go band Experience Unlimited had collaborated with androgynous singer Grace Jones on a track. Sobhi Youssef from Sputnikmusic noticed that the song's production <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a different track than the rest of Attention Deficit.|$|E
2500|$|In a five-star review, Rolling Stone critic David Fricke {{wrote that}} Sea Change was [...] "the best album Beck has ever <b>made,</b> and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> he's paid dearly for the achievement." [...] Rolling Stone {{went on to}} name it the best album of 2002; the next year, the album was ranked number 436 on the magazine's list of the 500 {{greatest}} albums of all time. It was ranked number 17 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 best albums of the 2000s.|$|R
50|$|Filming of Call of the Flesh {{began on}} January 27, 1930, under the working title The Singer of Seville, and lasted through March. It {{was shot at}} Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City. Before the premiere, the title was changed to Call of the Flesh because the {{original}} title <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> too much <b>like</b> a musical. Ramon Novarro apparently hated the new title.|$|R
60|$|There {{are many}} ways of saying 'Ah!' You can put joy, amazement, rapture into it; you can also make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if <b>it</b> were a reply to a remark on the weather. James Boyd <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> just <b>like</b> that. His hair was rumpled, his brow contracted, and his manner absent. The {{impression}} he gave Elizabeth {{was that he had}} barely heard her. The next moment he was deep in a recital of the misdemeanours of the actors now rehearsing for his four-act comedy. The star had done this, the leading woman that, the juvenile something else. For the first time Elizabeth listened unsympathetically.|$|R
500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} Rebel Heart {{begins with the}} track [...] "Best Night", an 80s electro {{composition}} reminiscent of Sade's songs with drums and Indian flute instrumentation. Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You can call me M tonight" [...] but her voice is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me what you know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E
2500|$|... 647 P206s were {{produced}} {{under the name}} “Super Skylane” which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> {{a version of the}} Cessna 182, which it was not. [...] Sub-variants were designated P206 to P206E.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Lady Hammergallow, {{throwing}} {{her head back}} and speaking with deliberate indignation, as she rustled forward, [...] "if you cannot play with Mr Wilmerdings I am afraid I cannot ask you to play again." [...] She <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> an ultimatum. Her glasses in her hand quivered violently with indignation. The Angel was now human enough to appreciate {{the fact that he was}} crushed.|$|E
50|$|In early broadcasts, {{her name}} {{appeared}} as Victoria Good, but she quickly changed this to Tori Good. After marrying, {{she changed her}} name to Tori Lacey. Radio Five Live presenter Simon Mayo suggested <b>it</b> <b>made</b> her <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> an X-rated porn star, so she is considering changing her on-screen name to her full married name of Victoria Lacey.|$|R

The donor Queen Byang-chub had <b>it</b> <b>made</b> to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the <b>sound</b> of the drum roll of the gods in the heavens and it was cast by the abbot, the Chinese monk Rin-cen as a religious offering from Tshal and to call all creatures to virtue." ...|$|R
5000|$|Paul Temple's catchphrase, [...] "by Timothy", first {{occurred}} in episode {{two of the}} first ever serial, Send for Paul Temple. As spoken by Kim Peacock in the 1940s serials, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> Temple <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Wilfrid Hyde-White (<b>it</b> was a phrase Hyde-White frequently used, particularly in the BBC radio series The Men from the Ministry). Interviewed in 2006, Peter Coke said he hated the phrase, because even in the 1950s he thought <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> old-fashioned.|$|R

50|$|John McLaughlin {{formed a}} fusion band, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, with drummer Billy Cobham, violinist Jerry Goodman, bassist Rick Laird and keyboardist Jan Hammer. The band {{released}} their first album, The Inner Mounting Flame, in 1971. Hammer pioneered {{the use of}} the Minimoog synthesizer with distortion effects and, with his mastery of the pitch bend wheel, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> very much <b>like</b> an electric guitar. The sound of the Mahavishnu Orchestra was influenced by both psychedelic rock and Indian classical sounds.|$|R
5000|$|Thom Jurek of Allmusic {{gave the}} album two stars out of five, saying, [...] "there are nine solidly written songs, a good one, and a throwaway," [...] but {{adding that he}} thought the {{production}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> [...] "more <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was recorded by machines than by people." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave it a positive review, calling it [...] "brash and ballsy, anchored with well-chosen and often female-empowering themes" [...] and saying that the lyrics use [...] "cleverly-chosen details, unusual hooks and interesting turns of phrase." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Alice," [...] he {{announced}} tranquilly; and his subdued {{manner of speaking}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> so much <b>like</b> a confidential communication that I fancied myself nodding understandingly and whispering: [...] "I see, I see." [...] . Of course, I did nothing of the kind. Neither of us did anything; we stood side by side {{looking down at the}} girl. For quite a time she did not stir, staring straight before her as if watching the vision of some pageant passing through the garden in the deep, rich glow of light and the splendour of flowers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions were}} lengthy and chaotic, often hampered by Spector's drinking and unpredictable temperament. Bruce Springsteen and Miami Steve visited the studio during the recording sessions. [...] On its completion in 1974, DiMucci effectively disowned the record, {{stating that the}} production <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "funeral music".|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, {{soon after}} joining ABC 702, {{listeners}} gave {{feedback on the}} ABC Guestbook on his voice and that his rapid pace and speedy pronunciation of the word [...] "Australian", <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "strine". Similar feedback was noted in letters to the Sydney Morning Herald in 2011, regarding his tone of voice.|$|E
5000|$|Politifact {{also criticized}} Romney advertisements, {{saying that the}} Romney campaign, [...] "cherry-picked a quote that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Obama was dismissive of {{businesses}} when in fact {{he was making a}} point that success comes from the combination of 'individual initiative' and the fact that 'we do things together'", and that by doing so [...] "Romney and his supporters have misled viewers and given a false impression." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following a talk {{broadcast}} on BBC Radio 4 in Holy Week 2007, John was criticised by some Evangelical bishops: Tom Wright, Bishop of Durham; Pete Broadbent, Bishop of Willesden; and Wallace Benn, Bishop of Lewes, for denying {{the doctrine of}} penal atonement. Referring to this particular explanation of the Christ's crucifixion, John said, [...] "It was worse than illogical, it was insane. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> God <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a psychopath." [...] In explaining his own view, he said, [...] "On the cross Jesus dies for our sins; the price of our sin is paid; {{but it is not}} paid to God but by God". He cited Julian of Norwich, a widely admired 14th-century English mystic who asserted that [...] "there is no wrath in God".|$|R
5000|$|Minkovski {{complained about}} an {{interview}} program that introduced her as “a hard-left, Russian-born, ‘blah blah blah’ {{who works for}} the Russian-funded…" [...] (RT), saying <b>it</b> <b>made</b> her <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Putin’s girl in Washington." [...] She believes such critics are just trying to discredit her but that it only bothers her when they call her [...] "anti-American," [...] because she is not. (Minkovski is a registered Democrat who calls herself liberal.) She has responded by suggesting [...] "people are just so scared of an 'other,' something that might be unknown to them and they can't see past that. So in their eyes, working for RT de-legitimizes you." [...] At the same time, when she has been denouncing very harshly Republicans and the Fox Network for having an homophobic agenda, she has refused to answer what her opinion is regarding the anti-homosexual laws passed in Russia under Vladimir Putin in 2013.|$|R
6000|$|Considering {{the high}} social {{tone of the}} Royal Grand, {{it was really a}} very loud {{instrument}} indeed. It gave vent to three deafening brays and so burst the dam of silence that had long pent it in. It seemed to be chiefly full of the greatuncles of trumpets, megalo-trombones and railway brakes. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> shunting trains. <b>It</b> did not so much begin as blow up your counter-scarp or rush forward to storm under cover of melodious shrapnel. It had not so much an air as a ricochette. The music had, in short, the inimitable quality of Sousa. It swept down upon the friend of Lady Jane and carried away something socially striking into the eternal night of the unheard; the American girl to the left of it was borne shrieking into the inaudible. [...] "HIGH cockalorum Tootletootle tootle loo. HIGH cockalorum tootle lootle loo. BUMP, bump, bump--BUMP." [...] Joyous, exorbitant music it was from the gigantic nursery of the Future, bearing the hearer along upon its torrential succession of sounds, as if he was in a cask on Niagara. Whiroo! Yah and have at you! The strenuous Life! Yaha! Stop! A Reprieve! A Reprieve! No! Bang! Bump! ...|$|R

5000|$|According to Stevie Nicks, {{the title}} {{came from a}} {{conversation}} she had with Tom Petty's first wife Jane, about the couple's first meeting.

Speaking to Billboard, she explained: [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> urgency, <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> betrayal. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> running. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> fainting. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> love. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> - *gasp!*" [...] On May 19, 2014, Minaj revealed the single's cover art on Instagram.|$|R
