5|$|Gibraltar {{has three}} marinas: <b>Marina</b> Bay, Ocean Village <b>Marina,</b> and Queensway Quay <b>Marina.</b> Ocean Village <b>Marina</b> {{is located on}} Gibraltar's Westside, outside the {{northern}} end of Gibraltar Harbour, in the Bay of Gibraltar, next to the airport runway. It is adjacent to <b>Marina</b> Bay which is just to its north. The <b>marina</b> forms part of the Ocean Village Project or Ocean Village <b>Marina</b> Complex, often referred to as just Ocean Village. Ocean Village <b>Marina</b> is the former Sheppard's <b>Marina</b> or Sheppard's Yard. Both <b>Marina</b> Bay and Ocean Village <b>Marina</b> have been incorporated into Ocean Village, between the North Mole and the airport runway. The strategic location of the <b>marina</b> offers protection from moisture-laden Levanter winds.|$|E
5|$|Ocean Village <b>Marina</b> was {{formerly}} Sheppard's <b>Marina,</b> owned by H. Sheppard & Co. By 2004, the <b>marina</b> {{had been sold}} to Ocean Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced. The <b>marina</b> retained its original name, at least informally, for several years after the sale. The sale of Sheppard's <b>Marina</b> was not without controversy, as some residents of the <b>marina</b> were eventually evicted from their berths by the new owners. After Ocean Village Investments acquired the adjacent <b>Marina</b> Bay in 2006, both marinas were incorporated into Ocean Village, a resort with residential, retail, and leisure facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Ocean Village <b>Marina</b> is one {{of three}} marinas in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, at the {{southern}} end of the Iberian Peninsula. Formerly Sheppard's <b>Marina,</b> it is located in the Bay of Gibraltar, between the North Mole of Gibraltar Harbour and the runway of Gibraltar International Airport. Both Ocean Village <b>Marina</b> and the adjacent <b>Marina</b> Bay have been incorporated into the Ocean Village Project, a luxury resort.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>marinas</b> on the seas, rivers, lakes and canals of Europe occurs {{in two different}} forms: (1) as a private investment project, and (2) as an urban municipal investment. Both forms of investment and {{development of}} <b>marinas</b> satisfy the criteria of entrepreneurship, which is important for each global and European economy. The purpose {{of this research is}} explanation of the possibilities for development of <b>marinas</b> and their immediate and distant destination which supports the development of the local economy. The scientific and research achievements were applied and, for the purpose of transparency, a case study showing several <b>marinas</b> and the examples of two basic models of development are presented. Structurally, this research consists of two parts, namely (1) a theoretical part, where a definition of nautical tourism and its classification are presented and (2) the development of specific indicators of <b>marinas</b> in Europe are explored...|$|R
5|$|According to Gary Oldman, {{very little}} was written about Oswald in the script. Stone gave him several plane tickets, {{a list of}} contacts, {{and told him to}} do his own research. Oldman met with Oswald's wife, <b>Marina,</b> and her two daughters to prepare for the role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with <b>Marina</b> Oswald. Since the script {{contained}} few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of perceived service quality on customer satisfaction in <b>marinas</b> in Turkey. A total of 134 customers from eight <b>marinas</b> which were included in the sample have participated to the research. The impact of services that customers receive on perceived service quality levels was analyzed. This study mainly concludes that there is direct impact of quality of the services on customer satisfaction in <b>marinas</b> in Turkey. The results also show that the highest impact on customer satisfaction was “reliability and competence”, followed by “management, planning and standards”, and “physical assets, respectability and environment”. Furthermore, the study shows that foreign and Turkish customers have significantly different opinions on some service quality variables. In the future a more comprehensive study could be done during high season. In addition, the survey could include additional languages at other <b>marinas,</b> which would increase the sample size. Future studies could compare <b>marinas</b> in other countries...|$|R

50|$|The National Boat Show was {{an account}} held by Bruno for 40 years. He started {{publicity}} for the Show in 1926, {{but he and}} Blythe realised that, without <b>marinas</b> where boats could be moored, the market for boats would be limited. Dick Blythe went to Miami, Florida to research the construction and operation of <b>marinas.</b> They wrote and circulated a manual with their findings to communities that had potential <b>marinas.</b> In their work a shortage of <b>marinas</b> was similar to a shortage of airports. To promote Essomarine, a product of Standard Oil, Bruno engaged artist Ted Geisel to develop a unique concept to sell the marine lubricant. Show visitors were invited into the Seuss Navy, an imaginary but well-illustrated and animated league.|$|R
