25|$|Although {{intertidal}} ecology {{has traditionally}} focused on these negative interactions (predation and competition), there is emerging evidence that positive interactions are also important. Facilitation refers to one organism helping another without harming itself. For example, salt <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> species of Juncus and Iva {{are unable to}} tolerate the high soil salinities when evaporation rates are high, thus they depend on neighboring plants to shade the sediment, slow evaporation, and help maintain tolerable salinity levels. In similar examples, many intertidal organisms provide physical structures that are used as refuges by other organisms. Mussels, although they are tough competitors with certain species, are also good facilitators as mussel beds provide a three-dimensional habitat to species of snails, worms, and crustaceans.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{eutrophication}} initiates top-down control via {{the impact}} of snow geese on the arctic marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997). By the 1980s, the snow geese that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in temperate wetlands to feeding in heavily fertilized agricultural fields. Over a period of 30 years, the geese population exploded. Snow geese have since utterly destroyed {{hundreds of thousands of}} acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. The geese grubbed <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to oxygenate the soil the substrate became anoxic. This undesirable environment for marsh plants disallows sexual recruitment to the area. Snow geese have denuded the marsh until recolonization by clonal runners can restore marsh vegetation, which could take years. Because of the use of artificial fertilizers on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997).|$|E
25|$|Research on {{the salt}} marsh snail Littoraria irrorata {{and its effects}} on <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> productivity, have {{provided}} strong evidence of consumer control in marshes triggered by overexploitation. This snail is capable of turning strands of cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) (>2.5m tall) into mudflats within 8 months, which is less than one growing season (Silliman and Bertness 2002). As previously referenced, marsh snails inflict cuts on cordgrass leaves when they graze, providing substratum and nutrients for fungus. At high snail densities, cordgrass can succumb to fungal infections and marsh die-off can ensue (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005). Natural predators of the marsh snail are blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and terrapin turtles (Malaclemys terrapin), which historically regulated snail abundances. However, these predators have been commercially overexploited, and now suffer from diseases due to small population size, releasing the snails from consumer pressure, and allowing the snails to wreak havoc on salt marsh cordgrass populations (Silliman and Zieman 2001).|$|E

2500|$|Human {{introduction}} of non-native species can {{also contribute to}} top-down control of marsh systems (Furbish and Albano 1994, Gough and Grace 1998). Introduced feral horses on the barrier islands of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas have entirely denuded marsh ecosystems (Furbish and Albano 1994), and the introduced rodent nutria on Gulf Coast marshes of Louisiana can decrease <b>marsh</b> <b>plant</b> primary production (Gough and Grace 1998).|$|E

6000|$|A most {{interesting}} {{view of the}} way in which pious heathens of a late age regarded Apollo's menagerie may be got from Plutarch's essay on the Delphic responses. It is the description of a visit to Delphi. In the hall of the Corinthians the writer and his friends examine the sacred palm tree of bronze, and [...] "the snakes and frogs in relief round the root of the tree". [...] "Why," [...] said they, [...] "the palm tree is not a <b>marsh</b> <b>plant,</b> and frogs are not a Corinthian crest." [...] And indeed one would think ravens and swans, and hawks and wolves, and anything else than these reptiles would be agreeable to the god. Then one of the visitors, Serapion, very learnedly showed that Apollo was the sun, and that the sun arises from water. [...] "Still slipping into the story your lightings up and your exhalations," [...] cried Plutarch, and chaffed him, as one might chaff Kuhn, or Schwartz, or Decharme, about his elemental interpretations. In fact, the classical writers knew rather less than we do about the origin of many of their religious peculiarities.|$|E
