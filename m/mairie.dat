25|$|When {{his brother}} Napoleon Bonaparte annexed the Kingdom of Holland into the French Empire in 1810, {{he had all}} local {{government}} radically reformed to become compatible with French structures. Ommen too was affected: the separate jurisdictions of Stad Ommen (composed {{of the city of}} Ommen and the Ommerschans) and Ambt Ommen (which comprised {{most of the rest of}} the current municipality, Avereest and Den Ham as well) were merged into one <b>Mairie</b> Ommen (though Den Ham became a separate municipality). This caused much controversy and discontent locally because the marke communities thus lost their ancient rights of self-governance. In 1818, shortly after Dutch independence, <b>Mairie</b> Ommen was once more decentralised into the municipalities Stad Ommen, Ambt Ommen and Avereest. To ensure good coordination, one burgomaster was appointed over both Stad and Ambt from 1851 onwards.|$|E
25|$|After fifty-five {{years of}} operation, {{transporting}} two million passengers annually, the funicular was {{in need of}} renovation. A novel idea was proposed by the RATP and the <b>Mairie</b> de Paris: lengthen the line with a tunnel to the Anvers métro station. The idea was abandoned due to its high cost.|$|E
25|$|Beginning at Issy-les-Moulineaux, {{south-west}} of Paris, with a three way tunnel underneath l'avenue Victor-Cresson, the terminus is at <b>Mairie</b> d'Issy, and {{has only}} two tracks. It runs north-east, entering Paris at Porte de Versailles, a major station with three tracks, one of which gives access to the workshop at Vaugirard. The line then runs underneath rue de Vaugirard, following all the bends of this narrow street.|$|E
25|$|The {{rolling stock}} of Line 12 is {{maintained}} at the Vaugirard workshop, situated underground in the 15th arrondissement of Paris between the rues Croix-Nivert, Desnouettes and Lecourbe, and Lycée Louis-Armand. They {{connect with the}} main line on the tunnels toward the <b>Mairie</b> d'Issy station, north until the Porte de Versailles station. It is also connected to the Petite Ceinture, a minor disused railway, by tracks which cross Rue Desnouettes.|$|E
25|$|On 15 May 1923, Dolores {{married the}} St. Louis art {{collector}} Tudor Wilkinson in Paris and {{retired from the}} stage. The ceremony {{took place in the}} <b>mairie</b> of the first arrondissement and later at the oratory of the Louvre. Mr and Mrs Dudley Field Malone were the witnesses. In 1925, the American press reported that the couple lived on the Île Saint-Louis in a house overlooking Notre-Dame Cathedral, most likely the three-storey apartment at 18 Quai d'Orleans referred to in later sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of the reburials, {{with the exception of}} one reserved for the dedication ceremony in July, took place in February 2010. The reburials, starting on 1 February, took place on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, starting at 9am, with up to thirty soldiers being re-interred each day, all with full military honours. There is a viewing area from which the military funerals can be observed, and an area to leave tributes. In addition, there were public displays at Fromelles Town Hall (<b>Mairie)</b> and at the recovery location, and a Book of Remembrance is available to sign.|$|E
25|$|On most days, {{the last}} {{northbound}} train leaves <b>Mairie</b> d’Issy station at 00:39. The last southbound trains leave Porte de la Chapelle station at 00:39 and 00:42, the second terminating at Porte de Versailles station. On Fridays and Saturdays, the final departures are at 01:39. The train frequency is {{every two to}} four minutes during the day, and five to seven minutes in the late evening. The frequency on Sundays is four to six minutes. After 00:30 on Friday and Saturday evenings and bank holidays, the interval between trains is 10 minutes. The RATP employs two categories of staff: ticketing agents and drivers. The former manage the stations, sell tickets and look after passengers. Drivers {{are responsible for the}} operation of the trains.|$|E
25|$|Boudet donated {{a copy of}} La vraie langue celtique to the Cambridge University Library, {{the book}} {{is still in the}} University of Cambridge's {{possession}} as late as 2015, in a letter written and signed by Boudet to the rector of the University of Cambridge, established the date of the donation on 11 December 1886. The manuscript of La vraie langue celtique was deposited in 1887 in the Manuscript Division of the Archives départementales, communales et hospitalières de l'Aude. Boudet donated another copy of his book to the Bibliothèque de la Société des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne in 1894. A Joseph Bonnafous was recorded to have done the same in 1907, this time to the Société d'Études Scientifiques de l'Aude which he was also a member and possibly the same Bonnafous who was printer in Carcassonne, rue de la <b>Mairie</b> and blood relative of Victor Bonnafous who printed Boudet's book. The Bibliothèque nationale de France once held an original copy of the La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains but it went missing at some unknown date, its disappearance was reported during an inventory. The Bibliothèque de Narbonne had also received a copy of Boudet's book in 1889.|$|E

The extension comprised only two stations with [...] long platforms, terminating at standard two track station, followed by a reversing area.

2500|$|The {{dominant}} {{architectural style}} of the Second Empire was eclecticism, drawing liberally from the Gothic style, Renaissance style, and the styles dominant during the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI. [...] The style was described by Émile Zola, not an admirer of the Empire, as [...] "the opulent bastard child of all the styles.". [...] The best example was the Opera Garnier, [...] begun in 1862 but not finished until 1875. [...] The architect was Charles Garnier (1825-1898), who won the competition for the design {{when he was only}} thirty-seven. [...] When asked by the Empress Eugénie what the {{style of the}} building was called, he replied simply, [...] "Napoleon III." [...] At the time, it was at the time the largest theater in the world, but much of the interior space was devoted to purely decorative spaces: grand stairways, huge foyers for promenading, and large private boxes. [...] Another example was the <b>Mairie,</b> or city hall, of the 1st arrondissement of Paris, built in 1855-1861 in a neo-Gothic style by the architect Jacques-Ignace Hittorff (1792-1867).|$|E
2500|$|Line 12 {{was founded}} as [...] "Line A" [...] by the Nord-Sud Company, who also built line 13. It was built between 1905 and 1910, {{to connect the}} districts of Montparnasse, in the south, and Montmartre, in the north. The first trip, from Porte de Versailles to Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, was on 5 November 1910. The line was the second to be built on the north-south axis of the city, in {{competition}} with Line 4 of the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (Paris Metropolitan Railway Company," [...] CMP). It was extended bit by bit until 1934 when it reached <b>Mairie</b> d'Issy in the south. Tunnelling to the northern terminus at the Porte de la Chapelle on the perimeter of Paris had been completed in 1916. In 1930, the CMP bought the Nord-Sud company and Line A was integrated into the new, unified network as Line 12. In 1949, the CMP was itself merged into the RATP, Paris's public transport company. They operate the line today and have plans to extend it south {{as far as the}} town of Issy, and north to La Plaine Saint-Denis.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{this did}} not lead to any further {{immediate}} success, Dargent, encouraged by his friend and rival Gustave Doré, applied himself to book illustration which brought in a greater income than his paintings, and worked on illustrations for magazines such as [...] "Magasin pittoresque", [...] "Musée des familles", [...] "La vie à la campagne" [...] and [...] "La France illustrée". At this time he had a villa built near to Saint-Pol-de-Léon at Créac'h-André, a spot where he had often walked whilst a schoolboy. On 3 July 1867, he married Eugénie Antoinette Stéphanie Mathieu, a musician and the daughter of the painter Eugène Mathieu a director of the [...] "La France illustrée". Then between 1869 and 1878,he was commissioned to contribute to the decoration of several churches in Saint-Servais, Landerneau, Morlaix, Ploudalmézeau and the Quimper cathedral of Saint-Corentin. His work at the cathedral which involved painting murals for all the lateral chapels took him seven years. Other works include the canvas [...] "la Petite Roscovite" [...] which hangs in the Saint-Pol-de-Léon <b>mairie.</b> In February 1877 he was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour. In 1898 when the Union régionaliste bretonne was established he became the first president of the Breton Beaux-Arts. Towards {{the end of his life}} he had some financial problems but was supported by his son. He died on the 19 November 1899 seemingly from a pulmonary embolism and is buried in Saint-Servais. See section on Dargent's tomb and the litigation which followed his burial.|$|E
6000|$|The {{marriage}} licence {{was for the}} following day--at the <b>mairie</b> of the eighth arrondissement first, and in the synagogue of the Rue des Halles afterwards. I chose the {{marriage licence}}. What could I do, Sir? I was helpless! ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Two {{hours ago}} {{we got in}} from Calais, and I have just been on board the Rose and left my lad’s traps there; then I found out at the <b>mairie</b> that you had arrived and had put up here, and we have also taken up our {{quarters}} in the house.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} Leigh {{went to the}} <b>mairie</b> and {{explained}} that, not having found the ship commanded by citoyenne Martin's husband, and thinking it likely that they would hear of him at Bordeaux, they had taken passage by the Trois Freres, which sailed the next day. The addition was made to his papers without a question, {{and the next morning}} they went on board. They were heartily received by the captain.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{can easily}} be remedied, monsieur. If you will walk back {{with me to the}} <b>mairie,</b> I will write a fresh paper out, and destroy the one I have given you. But what shall I say is your object in journeying to Paris? You are too young to be going to {{purchase}} goods and, indeed, would hardly be taking a woman and child with you for such a purpose.|$|E
6000|$|Arnold {{shook his}} head gloomily; [...] "I must go through it to the end. The cause is a noble one, {{and it is not}} because its leaders are base, {{and at the same time}} wholly {{incapable}} men, that I should desert it. Besides, even if I should do so, she would not. No, it is not to be thought of. The marriage will take place at the <b>Mairie</b> of Montmartre, at eleven o'clock tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, of course, {{that it is}} all right, or {{my cousin}} would not have {{recommended}} you so strongly to me; but in these days everyone is suspicious, and one cannot be too cautious. I will {{get one of the}} market authorities to go up with me. I am well known to them all, and 'tis likely that none of the people at the <b>mairie</b> will know me, seeing that I am a quiet man, and keep myself to myself." ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{my wedding}} day I have but a dim recollection. It was all hustle and bustle; from the <b>mairie</b> to the synagogue, and thence {{to the house}} of M. Goldberg in the Rue des Médecins. I must say that the old usurer {{received}} me and my bride with marked amiability. He was, I gathered, genuinely pleased that his sister had found happiness and a home by the side of an honourable man, seeing that he himself was on the point of contracting a fresh alliance with a Jewish lady of unsurpassed loveliness.|$|E
60|$|Leigh had {{no trouble}} in buying a sailor's dress, at a shop down by the wharves and, having put this on, went up with Monsieur Tourrier {{and one of the}} market {{officers}} to the <b>mairie.</b> As the former had anticipated, there was no difficulty. Leigh's pass was examined. The market official testified to the grocer as being a well-known citizen, doing business with the market people, and taking no part in public affairs; while Monsieur Tourrier showed the letter that he had received from his cousin, the adjoint at Arthenay.|$|E
6000|$|After an hour's ride, {{they arrived}} at Moulins, and Desmond rode at once to the <b>mairie.</b> Being in uniform, he was {{received}} with every respect by the mayor, who, however, on hearing his story, {{said that he did}} not see how he could interfere in the matter. It seemed to be a private quarrel between two nobles, and, even if he were ready to interpose, he had no force available; [...] "but at the same time, he would send out four men, with a cart, to bring in any they might find with life in them." ...|$|E
6000|$|On the 12th of August, 1861, at {{the hour}} of the close of mass, a guide arrived out of breath at the <b>mairie</b> of Chamonix, and bearing on his {{shoulders}} a very lugubrious burden. It was a sack filled with human remains which he had gathered from the orifice of a crevice in the Glacier des Bossons. He conjectured that these were remains {{of the victims of}} the catastrophe of 1820, and a minute inquest, immediately instituted by the local authorities, soon demonstrated the correctness of his supposition. The contents of the sack were spread upon a long table, and officially inventoried, as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} the {{privateer}} commenced to unload, for the most valuable portions of the cargoes of the captured ships had been taken on board when the vessels themselves, with the greater portion of the goods they carried, had been sent into port under the charge of prize crews. They remained on board for ten days, going freely into the town, sometimes with the sailors and sometimes alone. Terence pretended to make considerable progress in French, and was able, though with some difficulty, to make himself understood by the crew. The first mate had gone {{with them to the}} <b>mairie,</b> where the official stamp had been affixed to their ship papers.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} Leigh {{procured}} a jacket and waistcoat, with brass buttons; and a cap {{with a gold}} band. He then sauntered along the wharves and went aboard the Trois Freres, and told the skipper that no news had been received of his sister's husband. It had been {{agreed that it was}} best that they should not go to Monsieur Flambard's house, but that the merchant should call at the lodging, after dark. When Leigh returned to the midday meal, he found that the papers had come back from the <b>mairie,</b> duly stamped and countersigned, and that as no one had been to the house to make inquiries, it was evident that no suspicion had been excited.|$|E
60|$|Seeing that a {{boat was}} advertised to sail from Dover to Calais on the 11th of August, Lieutenant Embleton and Stephen {{went over there}} on the evening before; going on board at seven in the morning, they arrived at Calais at mid-day. Mr. Hewson had {{obtained}} passports for them, and they went on next morning by diligence to Boulogne. Stephen’s chest was at once taken on board the Rose. Making inquiries at the <b>mairie</b> they learned that Lord Cochrane had arrived with his family on the previous day from England, and had put up at the Cheval Blanc Hotel. They therefore went there and engaged rooms, and then called upon Lord Cochrane.|$|E
