40|$|In the past, {{methylmercury}} compounds were manufactured as fungicides or {{appeared as}} unwanted byproducts {{of the chemical}} industry, but today the methylation of inorganic mercury in aquatic sediments and soils is the predominant if not the sole source of methylmercury. This form of mercury is bioaccumulated to a high degree in aquatic food chains to attain its highest concentrations in edible tissues in long-lived predatory fish living in both fresh and ocean waters. It is well absorbed from the diet and distributes {{within a few days}} to all tissues in the body. It crosses without hindrance the blood-brain and placental barriers to reach its principal target tissue, the brain. It is eliminated chiefly in the feces after conversion to inorganic mercury. The biological half-time of methylmercury in human tissues is about 50 days, but there is wide individual variation. Adult poisoning is characterized by focal damage to discrete anatomical areas of the brain such as the visual cortex and granule layer of the cerebellum. A latent period of weeks or months may ensue before the appearance of signs and symptoms of poisoning. The latter manifest themselves as paresthesia, ataxia, constriction of the visual fields, and hearing loss.

40|$|Methylmercury is a {{ubiquitous}} environmental pollutant and potent neurotoxin. Treatment of <b>methylmercury</b> <b>poisoning</b> relies {{almost exclusively}} {{on the use of}} chelating agents to accelerate excretion of the metal. The present study demonstrates that oral administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a widely available and largely nontoxic amino acid derivative, produces a profound acceleration of urinary methylmercury excretion in mice. Mice that received NAC in the drinking water (10 mg/ml) starting at 48 hr after methylmercury administration excreted from 47 to 54 % of the 203 Hg in urine over the subsequent 48 hr, as compared to 4 - 10 % excretion in control animals. When NAC-containing water was given from the time of methylmercury administration, it was even more effective at enhancing urinary methylmercury excretion and at lowering tissue mercury levels. In contrast, excretion of inorganic mercury was not affected by oral NAC administration.

40|$|Abstract: Mercury {{exists in}} various {{chemical}} forms. The important forms from a toxicological viewpoint are the metallic form, {{also called the}} elemental form, the divalent inorganic forms and methylmercury compounds. Elemental (Hg 0) mercury has a high vapor pressure and the vapor causes {{a number of cases}} of poisoning via inhalation. Classical mercury poisoning is characterized by a triad of signs, namely tremors, erethism and gingivitis. Mercurial erethism, which is characterized by behavioral and personality changes such as extreme shyness, excitability, loss of memory, and insomnia are also observed. Recently, the effects of mercury exposure at levels around 0. 05 mg/m 3 or lower have been of concern and may include minor renal tubular damage, increased complaints of tiredness, memory disturbance and other symptoms, subclinical finger tremor, abnormal EEG by computerized analysis and impaired performance in neurobehavioral or neuropsychological tests. Abnormal gait, dysarthria, ataxia, deafness and constriction of the visual field are typical of the symptoms of <b>methylmercury</b> <b>poisoning</b> observed in Minamata and Iraqi outbreaks, as well as in occupational <b>methylmercury</b> <b>poisoning</b> cases. Furthermore, an infant born to a mother with excessive methylmercury consumption showed various neurological disturbances and delayed development.

40|$|The {{outbreak}} of <b>methylmercury</b> <b>poisoning</b> in the geographic areas around Minamata Bay, Kumamoto, Japan in the 1950 s {{has become known}} as Minamata disease. Based on earlier reports and extensive pathological studies on autopsied cases at the Kumamoto University School of Medicine, destructive lesions in the anterior portion of the calcarine cortex and depletion predominantl y of granular cells in the cerebellar cortex came to be recognized as the hallmark and diagnostic yardstick of <b>methylmercury</b> <b>poisoning</b> in humans. As the number of autopsy cases of Minamata disease increased, it became apparent that the cerebral lesion was not restricted to the calcarine cortex but was relatively widespread. Less severe lesions, believed to be responsible for the motor symptoms of Minamata patients, were often found in the precentral, postcentral, and lateral temporal cortices. These patients also frequently presented with signs of sensory neuropathy affecting the distal extremities. Because of few suf ciently comprehensive studies, peripheral nerve degeneration has not been universally accepted as a cause of the sensory disturbances in Minamata patients. The present paper describes both biopsy and autopsy ndings of the peripheral nerves in a male sherman who {{died at the age of}} 64 years and showed the characteristic central nervous system lesions of Minamata disease at autopsy.

Mercury in Sediments When mercury is first deposited in a sediment, it is rapidly and strongly complexed to various components of the sediment. Mercury is most strongly bound to sulfur-containing organic and inorganic particles. In surface sediments, up to 62 % of the mercury present is bound to these types of particles (1). To a lesser extent, mercury is also bound strongly to clays, mineral sediments containing iron and manganese oxides, and to fine sands (2). Only a small portion of mercury in sediments is released into the pore water.
