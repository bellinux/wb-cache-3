40|$|Ion beam {{sputter etching}} {{has proven to}} be a {{superior}} technique for producing grating sampling mirrors for large optical systems. The patterns to be etched are defined by a photoresist <b>masking</b> <b>film</b> on the mirror sur-face. Grating patterns have been produced on laser mirrors by replication of diamond-scribed master patterns, while holographic construction has been used to produce linear and nonlinear gratings. The microscopic details of ion etched grating profiles show that the process is capable of high resolution pattern delineation and large area device fabrication...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} {{two methods}} of enhancing a photographic image and applies them to duplicating mammographs. Subtractive unsharp masking, one such method, is a photo-optical edge enhancement technique. The degree of unsharpness {{is controlled by}} interspacing between the mammograph and a receiving film while exposing. The other method is optimizing the combination of <b>masking</b> <b>film</b> contrast and duplicating film contrast. Three levels of unsharpness, two levels of mask contrast and two levels of duplicating film contrast were tested. The common objective of this project and mammography in general involves the recognition and diagnosis of breast cancer. Specifically, the experimental objective {{is to increase the}} detectability of breast tumors and calcium deposits caused by cancer relative to an original mammograph. Individual examinations of 36 samples by six radiologists provided data enabling subjective and statistical conclusions to be made. Tumor and calcium detectability were rated relative to an original mammograph. Respectively, results showed that 54 % and 96 % of the samples observed were rated superior in diagnostic qualit...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{producing}} a uniform, highly textured surface on oxygen-free, high conductivity (OFHC) copper by ion bombardment using sputtered molybdenum as a texture-inducing <b>masking</b> <b>film</b> {{was developed and}} used to provide samples for study. The purpose {{was to develop a}} basically OFHC copper surface having very low secondary electron emission characteristics. Surfaces having low secondary electron emission are a requirement for the electrodes of very high efficiency multistage depressed collectors (MDC's). Such MDC's are used in microwave amplifier traveling wave tubes for space communications and other applications. OFHC copper is the material most commonly used for MDC electrodes because it has high thermal conductivity, it is easy to machine, and its fabrication and brazing procedures are well established. However, its untreated surface displays relatively very high levels of secondary electron emissions. Textured OFHC copper samples were tested for true secondary electron emission and relative reflected primary electron yield at primary electron beam energy levels from 200 to 2000 eV and at direct (0 deg) to oblique (60 deg) beam impingement angles. The test results for three of the samples, each of which was processed in a slightly different way, are compared {{with each other and with}} test results for a machined OFHC copper sample. Although the textured samples are not represented here as having been processed optimally, their measured secondary electron emission characteristics are significantly lower than those of the untreated OFHC copper sample over the range of conditions studied. Importantly, the relative reflected primary electron yield of one of the textured samples is conspicuously lower than that of the others. Clearly, with further development, the molybdenum-masked ion-textured OFHC copper surface will be a promising material for high-efficiency MDC electrodes...|$|E

40|$|A novel quartz micromachined {{gyroscope}} {{is proposed}} in this paper. The novel gyroscope is realized by quartz anisotropic wet etching and 3 -dimensional electrodes deposition. In the quartz wet etching process, {{the quality of}} Cr/Au <b>mask</b> <b>films</b> affecting the process are studied by experiment. An excellent <b>mask</b> <b>film</b> with 100 Å Cr and 2000 Å Au is achieved by optimization of experimental parameters. Crystal facets after etching seriously affect the following sidewall electrodes deposition process and the structure’s mechanical behaviours. Removal of crystal facets is successfully implemented by increasing etching time based on etching rate ratios between facets and crystal planes. In the electrodes deposition process, an aperture mask evaporation method is employed to prepare electrodes on 3 -dimensional surfaces of the gyroscope structure. The alignments among the aperture masks are realized by the ABM™ Mask Aligner System. Based on the processes described above, a z–axis quartz gyroscope is fabricated successfully...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A bio-etching method using Thiobacillus ferrooxidans (T. f.) for {{processing}} micro-gear has been developed. The principle of bio-etching method is that certain microorganisms in nature consume some metal ions to be energy during their growth. The strain of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans consume elemental ferric and cooper ions as its energy source, so T. f. is selected as bio-etching tool, Leathen culture medium is selected as culture medium of T. f., and the thin copper sheet {{is used as}} the processed material. During the micro-gear is processed, firstly, thin copper sheet of 0. 05 mm is cleaned in the acid liquid and some materials such as dirt and grease are cleaned away, then, the anti-erode film {{is applied to the}} surface of thin copper sheet, then the surface of thin copper sheet is irradiated by ultraviolet under the condition that the surface is covered by <b>mask</b> <b>film</b> and developed, the anti-erode film that not covered by <b>mask</b> <b>film</b> will be dissolved and cleaned away, after that, thin copper sheet is put into the T. f. liquid and agitating, after the 3 h, micro-gear is obtained. The result is showed that micro-gear can be processed by bio-etching method...|$|R
