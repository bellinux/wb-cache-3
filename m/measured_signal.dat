40|$|Described is {{a method}} for {{measuring}} the particle size of ultra-small particles (202) which are suspended in a fluid. Laser light (121, 123) is guided via a first optical path (160) to a suspension (201), and light (125) scattered by the particles (202) in the suspension (201) is guided to an optical detector (140) via a second optical path (170). The optical detector (140) generates an electrical <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> (Sm) which is presented to a signal processing device (300). According {{to the concept of}} the invention, the signal-to-noise ratio of the <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> (Sm) is lowered by presenting to the optical detector (140) a noise signal {{in the form of a}} light signal (126) via a third optical path (180), so that the <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> (Sm) is always a heterodyne <b>measuring</b> <b>signal.</b> As a result, the uniformity, reliability and accuracy of the <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> is improved.

25|$|To {{improve the}} <b>measured</b> <b>signal</b> in Auger {{electron}} spectroscopy, the gate voltage is scanned in a linear ramp. An RC circuit serves to derive the second derivative, {{which is then}} amplified and digitized. To reduce the noise, multiple passes are summed up.

By applying a negative ramp to the screen this can be compensated. It is also possible to add a small sine to the gate. A high Q RLC circuit is tuned to the second harmonic to detect the second derivative.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian {{method for}} deducing the {{structure}} of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiologic (EEG/MEG) signal. The first step is to make a prediction as to the relationships between the brain regions of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals, one can take the <b>measured</b> <b>signal</b> and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered brain regions under different conditions. A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM is the relationship between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between brain regions, which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the imaging modality in use.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a setup for evaluating a <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> for its amount and phase {{in relation to}} a reference signal and is used preferably in optical spectroscopy for building a measurement setup for trace gas analysis using modulated laser radiation, e. g., that of a diode laser. The invention proposes the simultaneous operation of single-tone and double-tone systems for modulating and demodulating the signal of the diode laser, whereby evaluation of the <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> is simplified. The main feature here is that a decision can be made a priori as to which modulation or demodulation process can be given preference. As a result of the flexibility of the solution proposed by the invention, it is possible to select an optimum technology suited to the given conditions. Since all components can be designed to be computer-controlled, computer-controlled optimization is possible. As a result of the invention, high modulation frequencies are achievable and it can be applied in rapi d-tuning cw systems and in pulsed laser spectroscopy systems.

5000|$|The {{previous}} {{analysis is}} a simplified one because the power signal Ps(t) given by equation (4) does {{not correspond to}} the actually measured power Pm(t). There are two reasons for that. First, neither the injection, nor the mixing of compound B are instantaneous. Second, the ITC instrument has also a finite response time τITC, which implies that a sudden heat signal Ps(t) delivered into the measurement cell will in fact give rise to an actually <b>measured</b> <b>signal</b> Pm(t) decreasing exponentially with a characteristic time τITC. Such a response is named the impulse response. These two complications can nevertheless {{be dealt with by}} using standard methods in signal processing. Essentially, the actual signal is obtained by a Convolution of the ideal signal with the impulse response function.
