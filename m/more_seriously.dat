5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army {{soldiers}} {{who were in the}} lead train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected by the force of the collision and were <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> injured. One person from the overtaking train had been thrown onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Further rebellions {{occurred}} in 1287–88 and, <b>more</b> <b>seriously,</b> in 1294, {{under the leadership}} of Madog ap Llywelyn, a distant relative of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. This last conflict demanded the King's own attention, but in both cases the rebellions were put down.|$|E
5|$|The RAF now had 276 Spitfires and Hurricanes in the air. The Germans outnumbered the British in this raid by two to one. <b>More</b> <b>seriously,</b> {{for every}} two RAF fighters, {{there were three}} Bf 109s.|$|E
50|$|The April 2010 Baghdad bombings were {{a series}} of bomb attacks in Baghdad, Iraq that killed at least 85 people over two days. Hundreds <b>more</b> were <b>seriously</b> wounded.|$|R
50|$|During {{construction}} {{an accident}} occurred when cable snapped causing a cableway container with over 20 workers to fall onto the partially built road deck. 11 workers {{died in the}} accident and 12 <b>more</b> were <b>seriously</b> injured.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, 14 {{members of}} a {{mountaineering}} expedition from the University of Alaska Anchorage (two instructors and twelve students) fell 1,000 feet down the mountain's north face. Two people died, and 11 <b>more</b> were <b>seriously</b> injured.|$|R
5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on {{the approach to}} Felling station. The cause {{was a combination of}} a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E
5|$|Ballard {{first entered}} {{competitive}} wheelchair races in 1994, {{at the age}} of twelve. Her first racing wheelchair was bought second hand. By 1997, she started taking the sport <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> and began setting records in Australian athletics for her classification. A year later she was representing her country on the international stage. By 2000, she held national records in the T53 100m and 200m events.|$|E
5|$|In April 1863, food {{shortages}} led to rioting in Richmond, as poor people robbed and looted numerous stores for food until Davis cracked down and restored order. Davis feuded bitterly with his vice president. Perhaps even <b>more</b> <b>seriously,</b> he clashed with powerful state governors who used states' rights arguments to withhold their militia units from national service and otherwise blocked mobilization plans.|$|E
5000|$|In November, 1967, 81 {{people in}} Chiquinquirá, {{most of them}} children, were fatally {{poisoned}} and hundreds <b>more</b> became <b>seriously</b> ill after eating bread {{that had been made}} with flour that had been contaminated with a powdered insecticide.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} that followed, 36 gangsters were killed and many <b>more</b> were <b>seriously</b> wounded in an {{estimated}} 220 gun battles. At the time, local newspapers carried daily [...] "scorecards" [...] with the latest body counts on both sides.|$|R
50|$|Three {{people died}} as a result of the blast (including a {{pregnant}} woman) and many <b>more</b> were <b>seriously</b> hurt, including Cash, who was standing close to the bomb; he received injuries to his back and shoulder, and burns to his face and legs.|$|R
5|$|Other factors {{contributed to}} the rising {{tensions}} as well. On his way to Egypt in 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and forcibly removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The French Directory, furthermore, {{was convinced that the}} Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the English actually discussed this possibility.|$|E

5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E
25|$|A special {{recording}} of the song was made in solidarity with Bradford City following the Valley Parade fire in 1985, when 56 spectators died and many <b>more</b> were <b>seriously</b> injured. The song was performed by The Crowd, which was a supergroup featuring Gerry Marsden, Paul McCartney and others, and spent two weeks at number-one in the UK.|$|R
25|$|Over 2,000 women, {{children}} and elderly {{were killed and}} 3,000 <b>more</b> were <b>seriously</b> injured in the air raids, many of the attacks were aimed at the thousands of factories that manufactured weapons of war, including the Castle Bromwich aeroplane factory that mass-produced the Spitfire fighter aircraft. The longest raid took place on 11 December and lasted 13 hours, King George VI inspected damage the next day.|$|R
50|$|The Armistice enabled some 350,000 {{members of}} the Canadian Expeditionary Force to return home. Over 60,000 Canadians had died in battle. Thousands <b>more</b> were <b>seriously</b> wounded {{and many of them}} {{would never be able to}} resume normal life. The return to {{civilian}} life after so terrible a war is often difficult for veterans. Similarly, the resumption of activities by the Hull Militia was not without its problems.|$|R
5|$|The Wii's success caught {{third-party}} developers by surprise, {{leading to}} apologies {{for the quality}} of their early games. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that they made a mistake in rushing out their launch titles, promising to take future projects <b>more</b> <b>seriously.</b> Take-Two Interactive, which released few games for the Nintendo GameCube, changed its stance towards Nintendo by placing a higher priority on the Wii.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights issued {{their own}} factual {{statement}} to the press in January. Nevertheless, the flights did not create public excitement—if people even knew about them—and the news soon faded. In Paris, however, Aero Club of France members, already stimulated by Chanute's reports of Wright gliding successes, took the news <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> and increased their efforts {{to catch up to}} the brothers.|$|E
5|$|Tracy, {{yearning to}} be taken <b>more</b> <b>seriously,</b> tries to earn an EGOT while {{starring}} in the movie Hard to Watch and Jenna meets a new love interest {{who is also a}} straight drag queen (Will Forte) and meets her mother, Verna (Jan Hooks). However, things don't go well for Kenneth as certain events lead to endangering his job as an NBC page.|$|E

25|$|Fentanyl {{may produce}} more {{prolonged}} respiratory depression than other opioid analgesics. In 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began investigating several respiratory deaths, but {{doctors in the}} United Kingdom were not warned of the risks with fentanyl until September 2008. The FDA reported in April 2012 that twelve young children had died and twelve <b>more</b> made <b>seriously</b> ill from separate accidental exposures to fentanyl skin patches.|$|R
50|$|According to his friend, theologian Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam, <b>More</b> once <b>seriously</b> {{contemplated}} abandoning {{his legal}} career {{to become a}} monk. Between 1503 and 1504 More lived near the Carthusian monastery outside the walls of London and joined in the monks' spiritual exercises. Although he deeply admired their piety, More ultimately decided to remain a layman, standing for election to Parliament in 1504 and marrying the following year.|$|R
5|$|Tzara {{continued}} to write, becoming <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> {{interested in the}} theater. In 1924, he published and staged the play Handkerchief of Clouds, which was soon included in the repertoire of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. He also collected his earlier Dada texts as the Seven Dada Manifestos. Marxist thinker Henri Lefebvre reviewed them enthusiastically; he later {{became one of the}} author's friends.|$|E
5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. <b>More</b> <b>seriously,</b> the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{publication}} of Industrial Society and Its Future, Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife Linda {{to follow up on}} suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber. David was at first dismissive, but began to take the likelihood <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written by Ted and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to that found in Industrial Society and Its Future.|$|E

5|$|During {{the liberation}} of Normandy, between 13,632 and 19,890 French civilians were killed, and <b>more</b> were <b>seriously</b> wounded. In {{addition}} to those who died during the campaign, 11,000 to 19,000 Normans are estimated to have been killed during pre-invasion bombing. A total of 70,000 French civilians were killed {{throughout the course of}} the war. Land mines and unexploded ordnance continued to inflict casualties upon the Norman population following the end of the campaign.|$|R
60|$|P.S.--You {{were talking}} to-day of the American E'n {{of a certain}} unquenchable {{memorial}} of my younger days [1]. As it can't be helped now, I own I have some curiosity to see a copy of transatlantic typography. This you will perhaps obtain, and one for yourself; but I must beg {{that you will not}} import <b>more,</b> because, <b>seriously,</b> I do wish to have that thing forgotten as much as it has been forgiven.|$|R
5|$|Crawford {{originally}} created Frog Fractions {{to entertain}} his friends, {{and to see}} their reactions when they first played it. Later on, he felt that with the indie genre taking off, Frog Fractions was taken <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> among gamers. Crawford noted that although critics often described the game as a satire on old educational games, he never intentionally developed Frog Fractions with that in mind. Instead, Crawford explained that Frog Fractions had an educational theme because of the name's alliteration, and because he considered educational games {{a part of his}} youth.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Nielsen {{began to}} take his violin playing <b>more</b> <b>seriously,</b> {{studying}} privately under Carl Larsen, the sexton at Odense Cathedral. It is not known how much Nielsen composed during this period, but from his autobiography, it can be deduced that he wrote some trios and quartets for brass instruments, {{and that he had}} difficulty in {{coming to terms with the}} fact that brass instruments were tuned in different keys. Following an introduction to Niels W. Gade, the director of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, by whom he was well received, Nielsen obtained his release from the military band at short notice, and studied at the Academy from the beginning of 1884.|$|E
5|$|In February 1950, Pontecorvo's Harwell {{colleague}} Klaus Fuchs {{was arrested}} for espionage, and the AERE began to take security <b>more</b> <b>seriously,</b> and Pontecorvo was interviewed by Henry Arnold, the security officer at AERE. While Arnold had no evidence that Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy, he did feel {{that he was a}} security risk, and recommended that he be moved to a position where he did not have access to Top Secret material. Herbert Skinner suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the University of Liverpool, where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics. In June 1950, Pontecorvo was offered the position.|$|E
