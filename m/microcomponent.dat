40|$|International audienceAt the microscale, small inertia {{and high}} {{dynamics}} of microparts increase {{the complexity of}} grasping, releasing and positioning tasks. The difficulty increases especially because the position, the dimensions and the stiffness of the micropart are unknown. In this paper, {{the use of a}} microgripper with integrated sensorized end-effectors with high dynamic capabilities is proposed to perform stable and accurate grasps of multistiffness microcomponents. A dynamic nonlinear force/position model of the complete microgripper while manipulating a <b>microcomponent</b> is developed. The model takes into consideration not only free motion and constrained motion, but also, contact transitions which is a key issue at the microscale due to the predominance of surface forces. It enables to estimate the position of the microgripper’s end-effectors, the contact position of the <b>microcomponent</b> and the force applied on the <b>microcomponent.</b> Using the proposed microgripper and its model, both of the gripping forces are measured and the position of each of the microgripper’s endeffectors is estimated. This enables to perform a stable grasp of the micropart by providing force and position feedback. Moreover, using the developed microgripper and its model, the characterization of the <b>microcomponent</b> can be performed by estimating its dimensions and its stiffness...|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} for shape-selective directed assembly of anisotropic, deformable, chemically-identical <b>microcomponents</b> onto patterned rigid templates based on {{shape and size}} differences is modeled and demonstrated. The assembly method not only controls the selective placement of the components, but also aligns the components with the assembly sites. Unlike the assembly of isotropic (spherical) <b>microcomponents,</b> in which only size differences {{can be used to}} discriminate among chemically-identical components to achieve selective placement, differences in both shape and size can enable selectivity in the assembly of anisotropic (non-spherical) <b>microcomponents.</b> The present selective directed assembly is driven by shape-matching to a microfabricated template to provide selectivity, uniform chemical surface functionalization to promote assembly, and megasonic excitation to prevent assembly into poorly shape-matched binding sites. A theoretical framework quantifies the predicted selectivity of this approach and predicts that it will be effective for many material combinations, including hydrogels and bio-compatible polymers. Experiments demonstrate successful directed assembly of cylindrical, hydrogel colloidal <b>microcomponents</b> with 26 μm mean diameter and 50 μm length into silicon templates patterned with hemicylindrical assembly sites. During the assembly, tapered <b>microcomponents</b> with 150 μm length and a nominal diameter of 26 μm that decreases along the components’ lengths were successfully excluded from hemicylindrical assembly sites.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper was the design, development, and test of a {{flexible}} and reconfigurable experimental setup for the automatic manipulation of <b>microcomponents,</b> enhanced by an accurately developed vision-based control. Design/methodology/approach – To achieve a flexible and reconfigurable system, an experimental setup based on 4 degrees of freedom robot and a two-camera vision system was designed. Vision-based strategies were adopted to suitably support the motion system in easily performing precise manipulation operations. A portable and flexible program, incorporating the machine vision module and the control module of the task operation, was developed. Non-conventional calibration strategies were also conceived for the complete calibration of the work-cell. The developed setup was tested and exploited in the execution of repetitive tests of the grasping and releasing of <b>microcomponents,</b> testing also different grasping and releasing strategies. Findings – The system showed its ability in automatically manipulating <b>microcomponents</b> with two different types of vacuum grippers.

The results confirm reliability in grasping and that the release is precluded by adhesive effects.
