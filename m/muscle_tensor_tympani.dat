40|$|Using {{recently}} developed highly specific antisera {{to the full}} range of known adult mammalian skeletal muscle myosins, an immunohistochemical and histochemical examination was made of the middle ear <b>muscle</b> <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> in the dog and cat. Approximately half the fibres were of the IIM type and there was a substantial population of apparently slow-tonic fibres, both these types being rare in mammals. In addition, some type I but no IIA nor IIB fibres were detected. Moreover, as no multiple end-plate innervation, thought to be typical of slow-tonic fibres, could be demonstrated in this muscle by acetylcholinesterase staining or by Ruffini gold impregnation, it is suggested that in tensor tympani the slow-tonic fibres are focally innervated. The very short length of the fibres, only 1 – 2 mm, is probably sufficient to permit adequate depolarization of a whole fibre by a single centrally situated end-plate. The functional implications of this combination of very rare fibre types in tensor tympani are unclear at present...|$|E

40|$|<b>Muscles</b> (from the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> to {{the left}} {{ventricle}} [LV]) {{are in the business}} of generating force. In cardiac mechanics, the innate ability to generate force independently of preload is called contractility. A central tenet of cardiology is that the prognosis of most cardiac diseases is determined in large part by the health or disarray of the myocardium conferred by this property of contractility. Before the era of molecular biology, a search for the perfect index of contrac-tility had become a Holy Grail of cardiology. Such an index would be independent of preload, afterload, and cardiac vol-ume and mass; sensitive to changes in inotropy; reproducible; and easy to apply. Perhaps the most accurate of these is end-systolic stiffness (the modulus of systolic stress and strain), 1 but the tedium of its clinical use is so daunting that it is rarely used.

40|$|Backgroun. In the {{auditory}} brainstem of mammals, {{there are two}} main descending reflex systems to {{the auditory}} system; The middle ear muscle reflex and the olivocochlear reflex. The two middle ear muscles participating in the middle ear muscle reflex are the stapedius and the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani.</b> In man, the stapedius is known to react to strong low frequency acoustic stimulation, enacting forces perpendicular to the stapes superstructure, increasing middle ear impedance and reducing the intensity of acoustic energy arriving at the cochlea of the inner ear. Unlike the stapedius, the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>muscle</b> has been proven to contract in response to self-generated noise such as chewing, swallowing and other non-auditory stimuli. The first theories on <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> function were created by the a 16 th Century Italian anatomist and scientist called Hieronymous Fabricius (1533 - 1619). He was the first to allude to both an auditory and non-auditory role of the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>muscle</b> in humans. Since his work, many theories have been created founded on an evolving ability to analyze the components of the middle ear reflex pathways of the brainstem using various labeling techniques. It is now known that transduction of sound happens in the cochlea, causing an action potential that is sent along the auditory nerve to the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem. The cochlear nucleus is the first relay station for all ascending sound information originating in the ear. Unknown interneurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus then spread either directly or indirectly to the multiple middle ear muscle motoneurons located elsewhere in the brainstem. These motoneurons provide efferent innervation to the stapedius and the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani.</b> There are many interesting differences among species in the acoustic thresholds for contraction of the middle ear muscles, which may be a reflection of underlying anatomical and physiological differences such as the number of <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>muscle</b> motoneurons. The goal of one of our research studies was to investigate the quantity, location and morphological characteristics of the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> motoneurons in the mouse model. Although the ascending and descending limbs of these reflex pathways have been described, the identity of the reflex interneurons within the reflex pathway is still unknown, as are the sources of modulatory inputs to these pathways. Olivocochlear neurons participate in the olivocochlear reflex pathway. They react to acoustic stimulation and provide descending input that controls auditory processing in the cochlea. As in the middle ear muscle reflex, the identities of these neurons in the pathways providing inputs to olivocochlear neurons are also incompletely understood and similar labeling techniques were used to further study these interneurons. Furthermore, we relate our findings to the unpublished results off recent experiments that used infrared light as a means of stimulating the auditory brainstem as a possible technology in future clinical applications of brainstem implants. Materials and methods. This work consists primarily of four papers of which two are based on research that focuses on the anatomical geography (and postulated function) of the middle ear and the olivocochlear reflex pathways. The animal models in each investigation were mice and guinea pig. For the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>muscle</b> reflex experiments, we used the chemical trans-synaptic tracer called Fluorogold to retrogradely label cell bodies and their dendrites in mice. For the olivocochlear reflex experiments, we also used a retrograde transneuronal tracer but {{in the form of a}} pseudorabies virus (Bartha strain, expressing green fluorescent protein) to label neurons and their input in guinea pigs. These animal models have become the most common subjects for auditory and neuroscience research based on many factors, both biological and practical. The mouse and guinea pig were chosen because of the large availability of genetically altered strains in neuroscience research. Their relatively short lifespan renders them preferable for studies on the effects of aging. Furthermore, the very high frequency range of the hearing in mice vs. the low-frequency effects of middle ear muscle contraction makes it interesting to speculate on the functional roles of middle ear muscles in this species. The aim of the scientific papers was to provide an overview of the middle ear muscle reflex anatomy and physiology, to present new data on the middle ear muscle reflex anatomy and physiology, to describe the clinical implications of our research and to dedicate some attention to the historical efforts of research on the middle ear <b>muscles,</b> especially the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani.</b> The latter was achieved by studying the original theories presented on <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> function postulated by a renowned Italian anatomist/scientist named Hieronymous Fabricius (1533 - 1619). These theories, translated from Latin, were analyzed from his book “De Visione, Voce et Auditu” (The vision, voice and hearing) first published in 1600 and access to which was gained with scheduled permission from the Harvard Center for Rare Books, Cambridge (Massachusetts, USA). Results and conclusions. After injections of Fluorogold into the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>muscle,</b> a column of labeled <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> motoneurons (TTMNs) was identified ventro-lateral to the ipsilateral trigeminal nucleus. The labeled TTMNs were classified according to their morphological characteristics into three subtypes: “octopus-like”, “fusiform” and “stellate”, suggesting underlying differences in function. All three subtypes formed sparsely branched and radiating dendrites, some longer than 600 μm. Dendrites were longest and most numerous in the dorso-medial direction, stretching into non-auditory regions of the brainstem. The long dendrites and the various subtypes of TTMNs support the idea that contraction of the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> <b>muscle</b> can be secondary to multiple non-auditory inputs. Our findings agree with past experiments showing that the labeled TTMNs were found just outside the trigeminal motor nucleus, probably forming part of a separate “tensor tympani motor nucleus of V”. This separate nucleus was distinct from the trigeminal motor nucleus in term of cellular composition and orientation. To explore the olivocochlear pathways, the retrograde transneuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (Bartha strain, expressing green fluorescent protein) was used successfully to label neurons and their inputs in guinea pigs. Labeling of olivocochlear neurons started on the first day after injection into the cochlea. On the second day (and for longer survival times), transneuronal labeling spread to the cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, and other brainstem areas. There was a relationship between the numbers of these transneuronally labeled neurons and the number of labeled medial olivocochlear neurons, implying that the spread of labeling proceeds predominantly via synapses on the medial olivocochlear neurons. In the cochlear nucleus, the transneuronally labeled neurons were classified as “multipolar” cells including the subtype known as “planar” cells. In the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, transneuronally labeled neurons were of two principal types: neurons with disc-shaped dendritic fields and neurons with dendrites in a stellate pattern. Transneuronal labeling was also observed in pyramidal cells in the auditory cortex and in centers not typically associated with the auditory pathway such as the pontine reticular formation, subcoerulean nucleus, and the pontine dorsal raphe. These data presents us more information on the identity of neurons providing input to auditory neurons, which are located in auditory as well as non-auditory centers. Additionally, we learnt from translated written accounts that Fabricius was a pioneer in approaching anatomy from a structure-function relationship and that he was an active proponent for improving the learning environment for students. The writings of Fabricius on the middle ear also provided the foundation for modern ideas on the role of the <b>tensor</b> <b>tympani</b> in mammals. He was also the first to propose a non-auditory function to this middle ear muscle. </p...|$|R
