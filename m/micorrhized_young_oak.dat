In 2010, the <b>Young</b> <b>Oak</b> Kim Center for Korean American Studies opened at the University of California, Riverside. The <b>Young</b> <b>Oak</b> Kim Center has published many books discussing {{the history of the}} Korean American community, and has dedicated a biography to <b>Young</b> <b>Oak</b> Kim's life in the military after his military service. The book is called [...] "Unsung Hero: the Col. Young O. Kim Story," [...] and was originally written in Korean by Woo Sung Han and was translated to English by Professor Edward T. Chang.A world map tracking many of Colonel Kim's life events has been created by the <b>Young</b> <b>Oak</b> Kim Center. It can be found here: <b>Young</b> <b>Oak</b> Kim: Hero and Humanitarian Map In 2016, the Council of Korean Americans (CKA), a national, non-partisan, non-profit organization of Korean American leaders, spearheaded coordination of diverse civic, political, and military leaders from across the United States to nominate Kim for a 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom.

60|$|Then {{the witch}} was terrified, {{and taking a}} <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> tree she burnt it into white ashes, and {{sprinkled}} the ashes on the stones that stood around. And in a moment the two princes stood before their brother, and their beasts stood round them.|$|R
40|$|Assimilation and {{photosynthetic}} efficiency (quantum yield) of <b>young</b> <b>oaks</b> were compared in coppice and standard sessile oak stands of comparable age (100 - 120 years) under different light intensity categories. Measurements of assimilation response were performed during three consecutive growing seasons (2012, 2013 and 2014). In every category 8 <b>young</b> <b>oaks</b> of generative origin and {{same number of}} coppice sprouts of different stool were measured. The quantum yield in optimal conditions in standards was highest in the category A of closed canopy, while in coppices in category C. During severe drought in 2013 the drop in efficiency of standards was evident in all categories, while in coppices no differences in efficiency were confirmed between optimal and drought stress, proving the advantage of young coppices over standards...|$|R
60|$|The road led around hill sides, under <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> trees, across dappled sands, {{and over}} little streams where the horses stopped to drink. It was like some world-old idyl, this {{ride in a}} heavy {{rumbling}} wagon; it led to glory and light, this road among the hills.|$|R

25|$|Amanita velosa is a late-season {{mushroom}} in {{its range}} of occurrence, being found from midwinter into spring, {{up until the}} end of the California rainy season. Its favored habitat is the ecotone between oak (particularly coast live oak) woodlands and open grassland, living in an ectomycorrhizal relationship with <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> trees.|$|R
50|$|Oaks {{produce more}} acorns {{when they are}} not too close to other oaks and thus {{competing}} with them for sunlight, water and soil nutrients. The fires tended to eliminate the more vulnerable <b>young</b> <b>oaks</b> and leave old oaks which created open oak savannas with trees ideally spaced to maximize acorn production.|$|R
50|$|This is {{surrounded}} by a circle of 16 <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> trees, which were dedicated by member associations of the Fylde Ex-Service Liaison Committee, and special ex-service organisations connected with the Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre areas. At the base of each tree is a polished black granite plaque, inscribed with a badge and an epitaph.|$|R
60|$|Just at this time, {{they were}} {{ascending}} a hill, and, after passing over {{the summit of}} it, {{they came to a}} place where Forester said he saw, in the woods, a number of <b>young</b> <b>oaks</b> and beeches, which, he said, would make good canes. The oak, he said, was very strong, and hard, and tough; so was the beech.|$|R
40|$|Charcoal {{analysis}} was undertaken on samples associated with inhumations and cremation burials at this Anglo-Saxon cemetery. Pyre waste {{proved to be}} heavily dominated by oak with lesser Maloideae, hazel, alder and ash wood.

That is to say, she ate sheep sorrel, Indian tobacco, roots of ferns, May apples, rose leaves, rose-buds, raw turnips, choke-cherries, wild crab-apples, slippery elm bark, {{and the green}} balls on <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> trees, {{as well as the}} bitter acorns. These acorns she chewed into pats, and dried in the sun, to eat at other times, like a savage.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{on a field}} {{adjacent}} to Park Lane, an ancient road between Tiptree and Tolleshunt Knights. In 1976 the council purchased the land for sports facilities, but these were never constructed due to shortage of funds, and in the 1990s the area became a nature reserve. It has acid rough grassland with <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> woodland, and a pond which was created by widening Layer Brook.|$|R

40|$|The Wessex Silvicultural Group {{spent three}} years {{studying}} the management and silviculture of the oaks (Quercus robur L and Qpetraea (Matt) Leibl) in the Wessex area. Low input methods of establishment {{including the use of}} tree shelters and the tending and thinning of <b>younger</b> <b>oak</b> stands together with control of timber quality were examined in twenty-one forests and estates. Environmental values were acknowledged. While Q robur has previously predominated, Qpetraea is now generally preferred...|$|R
5000|$|The site of {{the gallows}} is now marked by three <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> trees that were planted in 2014 on {{an island in the}} middle of Edgware Road at its {{junction}} with Bayswater Road. Between the trees is a roundel with the inscription [...] "The site of Tyburn Tree". It is also commemorated by the Tyburn Convent, a Catholic convent dedicated to the memory of martyrs executed there and in other locations for the Catholic faith.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} radioactive contamination of dietary components of the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Zhytomirske Polesie (Ukraine). Studies were conducted on two research plots in forests with similar levels of radioactive contamination, 29 ± 8 kBq/m 2 - 55 ± 17 kBq/m 2, in mixed coniferous forests and mixed broadleaved forests, which are the dominant forest types of the area. The highest level of radionuclide accumulation was observed in <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> seedlings...|$|R
50|$|One type of spear, the menaulion, is {{described}} in detail; it was very thick, taken whole from <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> or cornel saplings and capped by a long blade (45-50 cm), for use by especially strong infantrymen (called menaulatoi after their weapon) against enemy kataphraktoi - {{an excellent example of}} a weapon and a type of specialized soldier developed for a specific tactical role. Both light infantry and cavalry carried javelins (akontia, riptaria) no longer than three meters.|$|R
60|$|After me came Jack, I {{felt his}} hot breath on my flank. I jumped the ditch, yes, I found power to jump that ditch {{where there was}} a rabbit run just by the trunk of a <b>young</b> <b>oak.</b> Jack jumped after me; we must both have been in the air at the same time. But I got through the rabbit run, whereas Jack hit his sharp nose against the trunk of the tree and broke his neck. Yes, he fell dead into the ditch.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} years, {{the church was}} served by circuit-riding preachers who ministered to the early {{settlers}} of the era. [...] Many of the service were held underneath a <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> tree. In 1990, that tree had grown large, but had become infested by ants. [...] In response, the church members removed most of the tree, but left {{the base of the}} trunk, which they then carved into a statue of a circuit-riding preacher. [...] "Reverend Stump," [...] as it was called. The stump still stands, but is still plagued by carpenter ants.|$|R
60|$|Next morning early, while Romer slept, {{and the men}} {{had just}} begun to stir, I went apart from the camp out into the woods. All seemed solemn and still and cool, with the aisles of the forest brown and green and gold. I heard an owl, perhaps belated in his nocturnal habit. Then to my {{surprise}} I heard wild canaries. They were flying high, and to the south, going to their winter quarters. I wandered around among big, gray rocks and windfalls and clumps of <b>young</b> <b>oak</b> and majestic pines. More than one saucy red squirrel chattered at me.|$|R
