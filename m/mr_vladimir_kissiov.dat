60|$|When <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> ceased {{speaking}} the Assistant Commissioner lowered his glance, {{and the conversation}} dropped. Almost immediately afterwards <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> took leave.|$|R
6000|$|... “I think,” he said, “that you {{had better}} see <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir.</b> Yes, decidedly I {{think you ought to}} see <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir.</b> Be good enough to wait here,” he added, and went out with mincing steps.|$|R
6000|$|... “Can he {{be waiting}} for me,” thought <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> looking up and down for some signs of a hansom. He saw none. A couple of {{carriages}} waited by the curbstone, their lamps blazing steadily, the horses standing perfectly still, as if carved in stone, the coachmen sitting motionless under the big fur capes, without {{as much as a}} quiver stirring the white thongs of their big whips. <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> walked on, and the “confounded policeman” fell into step at his elbow. He said nothing. At the end of the fourth stride <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> felt infuriated and uneasy. This could not last.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> {{bore the}} look of heavy inquiry with perfect serenity.|$|R

6000|$|... “That’s your affair,” murmured <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> {{with soft}} brutality. “When you {{cease to be}} useful you shall cease to be employed. Yes. Right off. Cut short. You shall—” <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> frowning, paused, {{at a loss for}} a {{sufficiently}} idiomatic expression, and instantly brightened up, with a grin of beautifully white teeth. “You shall be chucked,” he brought out ferociously.|$|R
60|$|But <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> sitting, stony-eyed, {{inside the}} hansom, drove {{off without a}} word.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> {{arranging}} his cravat, observed him in {{the glass}} over the mantelpiece.|$|R
60|$|Mr Verloc, {{thinking}} of <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> {{did not hesitate}} {{in the choice of}} words.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> {{observed}} the forced expression of bewilderment on Verloc’s face, and smiled sarcastically.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> and the Assistant Commissioner, introduced, {{acknowledged}} each other’s existence with punctilious and guarded courtesy.|$|R
60|$|This {{flight of}} fancy {{provoked}} {{something like a}} faint smile on Mr Verloc’s face. <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> retained an imperturbable gravity.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} drawing-room hurriedly, and found <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> {{still in the}} hall, {{wrapping}} up his throat carefully in a large silk handkerchief. Behind him a footman waited, holding his overcoat. Another stood ready to open the door. The Assistant Commissioner was duly helped into his coat, and let out at once. After descending the front steps he stopped, as if to consider the way he should take. On seeing this through the door held open, <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> lingered in the hall to get out a cigar {{and asked for a}} light. It was furnished to him by an elderly man out of livery with an air of calm solicitude. But the match went out; the footman then closed the door, and <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> lighted his large Havana with leisurely care.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> {{affecting}} not to listen, leaned {{towards the}} couch, talking amiably in subdued tones, but {{he heard the}} Assistant Commissioner say: ...|$|R
50|$|Until mid-August 2007, the {{investigation}} was conducted by the Major Case Investigator <b>Mr.</b> <b>Vladimir</b> Vladimirovich Kolodkin, of Veliky Novgorod (MCI or MCI Kolodkin henceforth).|$|R
5000|$|Arbitrary Detention, Mr. El Hadji Malick Sow (Senegal), Ms. Shaheen Sardar Ali (Pakistan), Mr. Roberto Garreton (Chile), <b>Mr.</b> <b>Vladimir</b> Tochilovsky (Ukraine), <b>Mr.</b> Mads Andenas (Norway) ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{will be only}} feeding up the lying {{spirit of}} these revolutionary scoundrels,” <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> protested. “What {{do you want to}} make a scandal for?—from morality—or what?” ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> {{raised a}} large white, plump hand. “Ah, yes. The unlucky attachment—of your youth. She {{got hold of}} the money, and then sold you to the police—eh?” ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir’s</b> {{anxiety was}} obvious. The Assistant Commissioner having ascertained {{in this way}} {{that there must be}} some truth in the summary {{statements}} of Mr Verloc, said indifferently: ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Tut, tut!” {{broke out}} <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> with a {{frowning}} grimace. “The French police {{had no use}} for your warning. Don’t roar like this. What the devil do you mean?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You got off easily,” was <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir’s</b> comment. “And, anyhow, {{it served}} you right for letting {{yourself}} get caught. What made {{you go in}} {{for that sort of}} thing—eh?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “He’s been {{frightening}} me,” declared {{suddenly the}} lady who sat {{by the side of}} <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> with an inclination of the head towards that gentleman. The Assistant Commissioner knew the lady.|$|R
6000|$|Lost {{for a whole}} {{minute in}} the abyss of meditation, Mr Verloc did not reach the depth of these {{abstract}} considerations. Perhaps he was not able. In any case he had not the time. He was pulled up painfully by the sudden recollection of <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> another of his associates, whom in virtue of subtle moral affinities {{he was capable of}} judging correctly. He considered him as dangerous. A shade of envy crept into his thoughts. Loafing was all very well for these fellows, who knew not <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> and had women to fall back upon; whereas he had a woman to provide for— ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Aha! Cherchez la femme,” <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> deigned to interrupt, unbending, {{but without}} affability; there was, on the contrary, {{a touch of}} grimness in his condescension. “How {{long have you been}} {{employed}} by the Embassy here?” he asked.|$|R
60|$|The doleful {{change in}} Mr Verloc’s physiognomy, the {{momentary}} drooping of his whole person, confessed that {{such was the}} regrettable case. <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir’s</b> hand clasped the ankle reposing on his knee. The sock was of dark blue silk.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> did not stumble, did not stagger back, did {{not change}} his stride. But he could not prevent himself from exclaiming: “What?” The Assistant Commissioner did not repeat his statement. “You know him,” he {{went on in the}} same tone.|$|R
25|$|Adapted by the BBC as two 45 minute {{episodes in}} 1967, with Nigel Green as Adolph Verloc, Mary Webster as Winnie, Dennis Waterman as Stevie, David Collings as <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> Edwin Richfield as Chief Inspector Heat, and John Cater as The Professor.|$|R
25|$|A second BBC version, as {{a single}} 95 minute play, was {{screened}} in 1975, with Paul Rogers as Verloc, Frances White as Winnie, Peter Clough as Stevie, Anton Rodgers as <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> Peter Sallis as Chief Inspector Heat, and John Cater reprising as The Professor.|$|R
6000|$|... “These outrages {{need not}} be {{especially}} sanguinary,” <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> went on, as if delivering a scientific lecture, “but they must be sufficiently startling—effective. Let them be directed against buildings, for instance. What is the fetish of the hour that all the bourgeoisie recognise—eh, Mr Verloc?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You are {{too lazy}} to think,” was <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir’s</b> comment upon that gesture. “Pay {{attention}} to what I say. The fetish of to-day is neither royalty nor religion. Therefore the palace and the church should be left alone. You understand what I mean, Mr Verloc?” ...|$|R
60|$|He had not {{recovered}} thoroughly as {{yet from}} {{that state of}} bewilderment {{brought about by the}} effort to follow <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir’s</b> rapid incisive utterance. It had overcome his power of assimilation. It had made him angry. This anger was complicated by incredulity. And suddenly it dawned upon him that all this was an elaborate joke. <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> exhibited his white teeth in a smile, with dimples on his round, full face posed with a complacent inclination above the bristling bow of his neck-tie. The favourite of intelligent society women had assumed his drawing-room attitude accompanying the delivery of delicate witticisms. Sitting well forward, his white hand upraised, he seemed to hold delicately between his thumb and forefinger the subtlety of his suggestion.|$|R
6000|$|... “Constable!” said Mr Verloc, with no {{more effort}} than if he were whispering; and <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> burst into a laugh on seeing the {{policeman}} spin round as if prodded by a sharp instrument. Mr Verloc shut the window quietly, {{and returned to the}} middle of the room.|$|R
6000|$|... “That cock won’t fight,” <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> retorted, with {{an amazingly}} genuine English accent. “You’ll get your screw every month, {{and no more}} till {{something}} happens. And if nothing happens very soon you won’t get even that. What’s your ostensible occupation? What {{are you supposed to}} live by?” ...|$|R
60|$|On repeating {{this last}} word <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir</b> laid {{a long white}} {{forefinger}} {{on the edge of}} the desk. Every trace of huskiness disappeared from Verloc’s voice. The nape of his gross neck became crimson above the velvet collar of his overcoat. His lips quivered before they came widely open.|$|R
25|$|A third BBC version, {{as three}} 55 minute episodes, {{appeared}} in 1992, with David Suchet as Adolf Verloc, Cheryl Campbell {{as his wife}} Winnie, and Peter Capaldi as <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir.</b> Verloc {{was transformed into a}} much more sympathetic character for this work, in which he deeply grieved for Stevie's death.|$|R
6000|$|The Assistant Commissioner then {{imparted}} {{briefly to}} the great man, who sat still, resting his eyes under the screen of his hand, Mr Verloc’s appreciation of <b>Mr</b> <b>Vladimir’s</b> proceedings and character. The Assistant Commissioner {{did not seem to}} refuse it a certain amount of competency. But the great personage remarked: ...|$|R
