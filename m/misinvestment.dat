40|$|This {{report was}} written as a {{resource}} for professionals involved in multifamily audits, retrofit delivery, and program design, as well as for building owners and contractors. It is intended to serve as a guide for those looking to evaluate and improve the efficiency and operation of one-pipe steam heating systems. In centrally heated multifamily buildings with steam or hydronic systems, the cost of heat for tenants is typically absorbed into the owner's operating costs. Highly variable and rising energy costs have placed a heavy burden on landlords. In the absence of well-designed and relevant efficiency efforts, increased operating costs would be passed on to tenants who often cannot afford those increases. <b>Misinvestment</b> is a common problem with older heating systems [...] multiple contractors may inadequately or inappropriately upgrade parts of systems and reduce system functionality and efficiency, or the system has not been properly maintained...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{investment}} in human capital {{is a subject}} of great concern among economists. By means of an overlapping-generations macrodynamic model with credit constraints, imperfect insurance and exogenous labor supply, we appraise inefficiencies related to <b>misinvestment</b> in human capital and propose a simple scheme of redistributive taxation to mitigate them. A numerical simulation is calibrated in order to match stylized facts of Brazilian economy and shows that, in steady-state, with a flat-tax mechanism and lump-sum transfers, government intervention is beneficial to the extent it maximizes our utilitarian measure of welfare and reduces both inefficiency associated with misdirected {{investment in}} human capital and standard inequality indexes. After considering the possibility of decomposing our utilitarian measure of welfare and of allowing for public debt, we show that reduced inequality {{is the driving force}} which accounts for welfare improvement and that public debt plays no role. Robustness analysis shows that endogenizing labor supply does not lead to substantial changes in previous resultsinvestment in human capital; idiosyncratic risk; efficiency; overaccumulation of capital; redistributive taxation; public debt; welfare measures; social insurance...|$|E

40|$|In {{times when}} public {{expenditures}} are being decreased {{in nearly all}} European countries {{it is hard to}} argue {{that there is a need}} for additional sta-tistics about a small and so-called niche market. However, additional statistical information can also help to save public expenditures. Through an im-provement of statistical market data policy makers and market actors receive a better grounded basis for their decisions affecting organic markets so that mis-investments of public and private money can be avoided. Results of such <b>misinvestments</b> are e. g. reconversions of organic farms to conventional agriculture in many European countries. Nearly all of these farms have received governmental support for a conversion to organic agriculture beforehand. A long-term strategy to improve coordination and enhance current data availability and quality is envisaged...|$|R
40|$|Up to now, organic {{market data}} {{collection}} has been inconsistent, or data from different organisations and/or countries {{has not been}} comparable, because different methodologies have been used. Hence, the organic market suffers from information-asymmetry {{and a lack of}} transparency. Interpretations based on incomplete and inconsistent data might lead to wrong decisions and <b>misinvestments.</b> More coherent data collection and thorough data analyses are needed to overcome current dispersion and fragmentation of data sources. This executive summary gives a short overview on the current situation of organic market data collection in Europe by showing some results of a European-wide survey among data collectors. Furthermore the application of quality dimensions for the identification of ‘best practice’ examples is described in order to provide recommendations for data collection and compilation, the evaluation of existing data collection methods, and the assessment of data quality...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{emerged as}} part of the collaborative project “Data network for better European organic market information” carried out in the 7 th Framework Programme of the EU. Up to now, organic market data collection has been inconsistent throughout European countries; data from different organisations and/or countries is hard to compare, because very different sampling methods, product categories, and nomenclatures have been used. Interpretations based on incomplete and inconsistent data might lead to wrong decisions and <b>misinvestments</b> of companies or policy divisions. The objective of this contribution is the identification of inconsistencies in organic market data which is currently available throughout Europe. Therefore plausibility checks were applied to data collected through a standardized survey in 39 countries. The inconsistencies that could be revealed were grouped according to data type and also according to data origin. The number of inconsistencies highly depends on the availability of data, which in turn depends on the country the data stems from. These inconsistencies often occur due to heterogeneous nomenclature and varying definitions of product categories. Inconsistencies in data from two subsequent years often occur because data from different sources was used. Further steps resulting from the outcome of the data plausibility checks are the compilation of a guideline for organic market data collectors, the exchange of opinions and experiences within the organic data network, and the revision of current organic market data reports...|$|R
