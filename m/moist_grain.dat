40|$|Abstract Background Drying is {{currently}} {{the most frequently used}} conservation method for cereal grain, which in temperate climates consumes a major part of process energy. Airtight storage of moist feed grain using the biocontrol yeast Pichia anomala as biopreservation agent can substantially reduce the process energy for grain storage. In this study we tested the potential of moist stored grain for bioethanol production. Results The ethanol yield from moist wheat was enhanced by 14 % compared with the control obtained from traditionally (dry) stored grain. This enhancement was observed independently of whether or not P. anomala was added to the storage system, indicating that P. anomala does not impair ethanol fermentation. Starch and sugar analyses showed that during pre-treatment the starch of <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> was better degraded by amylase treatment than that of the dry grain. Additional pre-treatment with cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes did not further increase the total ethanol yield. Sugar analysis after this pre-treatment showed an increased release of sugars not fermentable by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Conclusion The ethanol yield from wheat grain is increased by airtight storage of <b>moist</b> <b>grain,</b> which in addition can save substantial amounts of energy used for drying the grain. This provides a new opportunity to increase the sustainability of bioethanol production. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{biocontrol}} yeast Pichia anomala J 121 prevents mould spoilage by Penicillium roqueforti and prolongs {{the safe}} storage of <b>moist</b> cereal <b>grain</b> in malfunctioning airtight storage systems. P. anomala is naturally occurring on grain and {{is classified as}} safe, i. e. biosafety level 1 microorganism.

The ability of P. anomala to prevent mould growth during 14 months of wheat grain storage was evaluated in outdoor silos with different air permeability. P. anomala rapidly consumed O 2 leaking into the silo during the spring, and P. roqueforti did not grow in treatments inoculated with P. anomala. A connection between production of the ester ethyl acetate and biocontrol activity was found. The biocontrol effect was enhanced when complex medium or glucose was added to grain minisilos. The addition did not markedly influence yeast cell numbers, but products of glucose metabolism, ethyl acetate in particular and ethanol, increased.

Lactobacillus plantarum of the starter consortium grew well, but Lactobacillus panis from the feed ingredients dominated both inoculated and non-inoculated fermentations. The starter culture did not influence yeast populations. Starter strains should be adapted to the system and may include appropriate yeasts. The lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus fermentum, L. panis and Pedicoccus pentosaceus, and the yeasts Pichia fermentum and Pichia anomala may be included in such starter cultures.

40|$|Ethanol for {{automotive}} purposes is {{an issue}} much debated and researchers disagree {{about the benefits of}} bioethanol. Converting energy-rich crops into ethanol suitable as motor fuel is a complex process and continuous development and improvements of processes and material used are important steps in the work of developing environmental friendly fuels. Grain is usually preserved by drying which consumes a lot of energy. Alternative storage of high-moisture grain in airtight storage systems reduce the energy required to produce bioethanol and studies have also shown that ethanol yields are increased more than 10 % in ethanol fermentations of <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> compared to dry. Airtight storage is often not perfectly airtight so biocontrol agents are necessary in order to preserve the grain. The yeast Pichia anomala has anti-microbial activity and inhibits mould growth in airtight stored <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> with some air leakage and is therefore an attractive alternative for biocontrol. Starch has to be degraded by enzymes into fermentable sugars before it can be fermented into ethanol. Storing high-moisture grain improves enzymatic degradation which results in higher ethanol yields and the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if ethanol yields could be increased further by pre-treating the grain with amylase producing Lactobacillus plantarum strains in combination with P. anomala J 121. Amylase is an enzyme that degrades starch into sugar units and pre-treating grain with bacteria that has amylase activity might have a positive effect on glucose concentrations in grain before and after starch is enzymatically degraded and ultimately result in increased ethanol yields. Also, lactic acid bacteria have been observed to have antifungal activity. Amylase producing L. plantarum strains Amy 1 to 7 were screened for their ability to degrade starch and for possible antifungal activity. No inhibiting activity against P. anomala J 121 or Penicillium roqueforti J 9 was detected. L. plantarum Amy 1 to 7 did inhibit growth of Fusarium culmorium J 617. L. plantarum Amy 1, was used in a two months storage study to investigate how ethanol yields are affected by microbial pretreatment during storage. Grain was inoculated with L. plantarum Amy 1 or P. anomala J 121 alone or a combination of the two and fermentations were performed on the grain after one month and two months of storage. Inoculation with L. plantarum Amy 1 did not increase ethanol yields, but slightly higher yields were observed in grain pretreated with P. anomala J 121. Two different moisture contents of the grain were used in the study; 25 % and 40 %. Increased ethanol production rates were observed in the wetter grain but final ethanol yields were similar in both moisture contents. Earlier findings that ethanol yields are increased in fermentations of grain stored moist was confirmed. To study if pretreatment with L. plantarum Amy 1 can increase storage stability of <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> a storage study with P. roqueforti J 9 was performed and also to ensure that any glucose released during pretreatment does not increase mould growth.

A branching variety (cv. Bordako) and a single-stemmed variety (cv. Borweta) were sown in spring. The crops were harvested for whole-crop silage at growth stage 4. 5 (green pod, septa split). Following a 24 h wilt and inoculant (Lactobacillus plantarum) application the forage was ensiled in 10 kg mini-silos for 90 days. The <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> was harvested when the crop reached a target grain DM of 700 g kg? 1. After crimping an acid additive was applied, and the grain ensiled in 10 kg mini-silos. The dry grain was harvested when the DM content of the grain had reached 850 g kg? 1. The chemical composition of the whole-crop silages was similar, with CP concentrations of over 190 g kg? 1 DM. However, the forage yield of Bordako (8446 kg DM ha? 1) {{was significantly higher than}} that of Borweta (6622 kg DM ha? 1). In contrast, the yields of moist and dry grain were higher for Borweta due to lodging of the Bordako stand (3666 kg DM ha? 1 versus 1707 kg DM ha? 1 and 2863 kg DM ha? 1 versus 1442 kg DM ha? 1 for moist and dry grain, respectively). The CP concentrations of the moist and dry grain produced by Bordako (both 360 g kg? 1 DM) were significantly higher than that produced by Borweta (300 g kg? 1 DM). The results suggest that while the branching variety Bordako is better suited to whole-crop production because of its substantially higher DM yield, the earlier ripening and more robust stand of the single-stemmed Borweta make this variety more appropriate for grain production.

Most grain is harvested, dried and then stored on farm or in silos for medium/long term storage. Cereal quality is influenced by a range of interacting abiotic and biotic factors. In the so-called stored grain ecosystem, factors include grain and contaminant mould respiration, insect pests, rodents and the key environmental factors of temperature, water availability and intergranular gas composition, and preservatives which are added to conserve <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> for animal feed. Thus knowledge of the key critical control points during harvesting, drying and storage stages in the cereal production chain are essential in developing effective prevention strategies post-harvest. Studies show that very small amounts of dry matter loss due to mould activity can be tolerated.

Of particular importance is the conservation of viability and ecological competence after application. With this in mind studies were conducted to develop formulations of P. anomala which would have these attributes. Cells were grown in molasses-based medium modified with proline to different water availability levels (0. 98 and 0. 96) which significantly increased (up to 50 %) the content of trehalose and arabitol in the yeast cells during liquid broth fermentation. The use of isotonic solutions for harvesting the yeast cells further increased the endogenous content of these compatible solutes as well as glycerol. Fluidised bed drying of cells at 30 - 80 °C was carried out for 10 and 20 min and showed that viability was significantly decreased at 70 - 80 °C. A temperature of 50 °C for 20 min was found to be best for viability (70 %) and moisture content of < 10 %. Several additives for conservation of viability showed that cotton seed flour+skimmed milk was the best treatment when dried at 50 °C.

Climatic variations make it difficult under practical farm conditions to harvest the grain at a moisture content (30 - 45 %), suitable to ensure fermentation. Therefore the yeast Pichia anomala J 121, previously found to prevent mould spoilage and improve preservation of <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> in malfunctioning air tight silos, was added to the storage of moist crimped cereal grain in big plastic tubes. Freshly harvested barley was rolled and inoculated with 105 colony-forming units (Cfu) g- 1 P. anomala, strain J 121. Due to the local weather conditions, harvest was delayed and moisture content in the cereal grain had decreased to only 16 - 18 %. Inoculation of P. anomala was done in 48 tons of barley, packed into three plastic tubes. Three additional sets of plastic tubes were packed with cereal grain without addition of P. anomala. The grain tubes were left closed for 5 months, after which feeding to cattle commenced. The population diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was very high both in the P. anomala inoculated barley and in the non-inoculated barley. A shift in the dominant LAB over the course of storage to Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus paracasei was discernible in inoculated and non-inoculated respectively. The yeast population in the inoculated barley was totally dominated by P. anomala during the entire storage period. In the non-inoculated grain, the yeast population was more diverse, displaying shifts in the dominant species during storage. Pichia burtonii was the dominant species at the last sampling occasion.

After 6 weeks of storage, four feed fermentations FM, FW, FWLAB, and FD, were initiated from M, W, WLAB and D, respectively, by mixing the grain with water to a dry matter content of 30 %. Each treatment was fermented in batch initially for 7 days and then kept in a continuous mode by adding new feed daily with 50 % back-slop. During the 6 week storage period, the average water activity decreased in M, W and WLAB from 0. 96 to 0. 85, and cereal pH decreased from approximately 6. 0 at harvest to 4. 5.

In the digestibility trial, 24 crossbred (Landrace X Large White) barrows with an initial weight of 18. 7 ± 1. 5 kg were used. They were kept in metabolic cages in a randomized block design using the factorial arrangement 2 X 2 (type of corn - dent and flint X type of storage - <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> silage and dry grain) and six replicates, with one animal as the experimental unit. The values of metabolizable energy (ME) obtained were 3841 kcal of ME/kg of dry matter (DM) from dry corn, 3912 kcal of ME/kg of DM from moist corn, 4022 kcal of DM from ensiled dry corn and 3928 kcal of ME/kg of DM from ensiled humidity corn. The ensilage process increases the digestibility coefficient of dry matter and crude protein and increases the digestible energy of the diets, independent of the process form. The type of corn did not influence these variables.

40|$|International audienceThe {{quality of}} {{harvested}} wheat grain can deteriorate markedly during the post-harvest management stages. The biotic {{factors such as}} grain type and ripeness, coupled with the prevailing abiotic factors such as water content and temperature, and also preservative concentration will influence the safe storage life {{and the level of}} contamination with mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) produced pre-harvest and zearalenone (ZEA) produced post-harvest by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium poae respectively, ochratoxin (OTA) produced by Penicillium verrucosum post-harvest in cool damp northern European climates, and perhaps T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins produced by Fusarium langsethiae. This review presents recent data on the relationship between dry matter losses caused by F. graminearum under different environmental regimes (water activities, temperatures) and the level of contamination with DON. This is important as poor post-harvest drying and storage management may exacerbate DON contamination already present pre-harvest. It is thus critical to relate the environmental factors in stored wheat grain during storage, especially of intergranular relative humidity (RH) and temperature, to safe storage periods without spoilage or risk from increased DON contamination. The growth/no growth and DON/no DON (F. graminearum) and OTA/no toxin production (P. verrucosum) have been used to build a model with a simple interface to link the temperature and RH values to the potential risk level which may allow growth or toxin production. This paper also considers the use of modified atmospheres, preservatives and biocontrol to minimise DON and OTA in <b>moist</b> wheat <b>grain.</b> These approaches together with clear monitoring criteria and hygiene could contribute to better post-harvest management of stored temperate cereals and ensure that mycotoxin contamination is minimised during this key phase in the food/feed chain...|$|R

Four diets, 6 pigs and 6 periods were arranged in a change-over design. The fermented liquid diets were fermented dry (FD), fermented control (FC), fermented inoculated with Wickerhamomyces anomalus (FW) and fermented inoculated with Wickerhamomyces anomalus and Starter culture (FWS). Water was added to the feed in a 3 : 1 ratio. All of the treatments were fermented during an initial 7 days. When feeding commenced 1 / 2 of the contents were replaced with fresh feed and water once a day in the afternoon. The pH of the treatments was around 4. 0. There were no Enterobacteriaceae found in the feed during the 6 periods. Cfu counts for yeast in all treatments slightly fluctuated around log 7. 5 Cfu/ g grain during the experiment. Cfu counts for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in Wickerhamomyces inoculated treatments tended to be lower than that in non-inoculated treatments. Cfu counts for mould in FW and FWS were lower (approximately log 1 for FW and log 3 for FWS) than in FC in the periods that they were detected. The apparent ileal digestibility of OM was different (P 0. 05) among treatments.

40|$|Today global {{agriculture}} is facing major challenges. The world's population is growing rapidly {{and we need}} to meet the increasing need for food with new strategies, including environmentally sustainable practices. Production must be enhanced with optimised resource utilisation and improved storage and distribution techniques. In addition, consumer demands for a reduction in artificial preservatives require innovative research thinking. The use of microorganisms as biopreservatives has many advantages. They often originate from environments similar to those where they will be used, making their presence natural. Bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria and dairy propionibacteria produce weak organic acids with good preserving capacity and several other antimicrobial compounds. Dairy propionibacteria possess additional advantageous features such as high production of vitamin b₁₂ and folic acid. Some strains also produce exopolysaccharides, useful for texture enhancement in dairy products. This thesis focuses on the antifungal properties of dairy propionibacteria. An important part of their antifungal capacity is due to the production of organic acids. The effect of these acids at different ph and different concentrations against eight spoilage fungi was investigated. A ph-dependent growth inhibition effect was detected, with Penicillium roqueforti being the most sensitive fungal species. In addition, dairy propionibacteria produce a number of other compounds with antifungal activity. Identification of 3 -phenyl lactic acid and several antifungal peptides present in the growth medium was made after separation with a solid phase extraction column and hplc. The antifungal activity was monitored by screening against Aspergillus fumigatus. Strong enhancement of the antifungal activity from dairy propionibacteria in combination with glycerol was demonstrated.

40|$|Post-harvest loss is a {{major problem}} for farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Substantial amounts of cereal grain are lost each year due to factors such as {{exposure}} to rain, extreme drought, physical damage and invasion of microorganisms. This decreases the availability of food/feed which in turn increases prices and the consumption of unsafe food. Therefore storage systems need to be developed to ensure a safe food supply with low losses. The project aimed to evaluate the inhibiting effects of Meyerozyma guilliermondii against mould growth on maize under local conditions in Cameroon. This was in order to determine if M. guilliermondii could be used for biocontrol storage of moist maize under airtight conditions. Previous studies have shown this system, together with the yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus as biocontrol, to be very effective for grain preservation. Mini silos were inoculated with different moulds and yeasts. W. anomalus was used as a control since it has previously been shown to have an inhibiting effect on mould growth. Furthermore the project aimed to study local post-harvest systems for maize in two different areas of Cameroon. This was done by means of visiting farms and interviewing farmers. The new biocontrol system of <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> was also explained to the farmers in order to introduce the idea to them and see if they were willing to try a new storage system. A hygiene study of the storages was also done by microbial quantification and calculation of colony forming units (CFU). No inhibition of mould growth was detected for either M. guilliermondii or W. anomalus. Several factors such as low moisture content, too much mould and the size and the material of the mini silos made the results questionable. More studies need to be made regarding the biocontrol activity of M. guilliermondii. The storage method and hygiene varied between different farms in the Nforya-Bamenda area. However none of the local storage systems seemed to have better hygienic status for yeasts and moulds. The biocontrol system seemed suitable for introduction in Nforya-Bamenda for several practical and socio-economic reasons. With current storage technology it would be no use increasing yield per hectare for maize in this region since farmers already produce more than they can store. Moreover, the change in maize storage technology could prove essential to improving women and children’s health in Cameroon, since many farmers smoke their maize indoors using fire-wood...|$|E
40|$|Deoxynivalenol (DON) {{contamination}} of grain destined for animal feeds {{is a major}} toxicological risk to monogastrics and is suspected of restricting productivity in ruminants. Whereas bacterial additives have been developed that can detoxify DON in the rumen and lower intestine, there are currently no commercial inoculants able to perform this task in crimped grain (CG) silage, a regionally important method of <b>moist</b> <b>grain</b> preservation based on homo- and heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria or chemical additives. Determining whether this ensiling process alongside the action of detoxifying bacteria {{has the potential to}} remove DON in CG prior to ingestion, was explored in mini-silo ensiling experiments. CG was heat treated (100 °C, 60 min) or ensiled fresh in triplicate 50 g silos, spiked with 5 mg/kg DON and inoculated with lactic acid bacteria derived from wild birds, natural epiphytic inoculants and commercially sourced silage additives (21 d). DON recovery was only significantly reduced (31. 2 ± 14. 4 % recovery, p< 0. 001, n= 30) by heat treatment, as determined by IAC-RP-HPLC-UV. Bacterial assemblage analysis by 16 S rRNA PCR-DGGE-SEQ identified Weissella cibaria, Pantoea agglomerans, Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis and Hafnia alvei as candidate detoxification agents, of which W. cibaria and H. alvei decreased DON recovery in vitro (11. 3 and 6. 2 % recovery respectively, p< 0. 05, n = 18), which translated to inoculated W. cibaria yielding a decrease in DON recovery (67. 2 ± 14. 4 %, 28 d) in naturally contaminated crimped wheat (13. 5 ± 1. 0 mg/kg, 35 - 40 % moisture, p< 0. 05, n = 15). As W. cibaria is a lactic acid bacteria already associated with fermented CG by default it has promise as a novel DON detoxification agent in CG silage. DON is however just one of many hepatotoxic co-contaminants. Retrorsine, a DNA-crosslinking pyrrolizidine alkaloid derived from Ragwort (Senecio sp.) was investigated for interactive toxicity with DON in an in vitro co-exposure experiment. HepG 2 cells were exposed to Log 10 multifactorial binary exposures for 48 h followed by a suite of assays to elucidate mechanisms of interactive cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and modulation of the proteome. Retrorsine was tentatively confirmed to form DNA/protein crosslinks in the comet, micronucleus and crosslinking assays, whilst DON was found to potently induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Co-exposure yielded a complex toxicity response, with low doses yielding antagonistic effects and high doses trending towards additive effects, although DON dose was generally the principle component. The difficulties associated with undertaking an interactive toxicity study where both toxins have multiple metabolic and cellular targets are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|The {{biocontrol}} yeast Pichia anomala prevents mould {{damage of}} <b>moist</b> cereal <b>grain</b> during malfunctioning airtight storage {{but it can}} also spoil food and feed. This thesis focuses on the physiology and metabolism of P. anomala, in particular during oxygen limitation, a condition relevant to airtight storage of cereal grain. P. anomala grew under strictly anaerobic conditions, at temperatures between 3 and 37 degrees, pH values between 2. 0 and 12. 4, low water activity (0. 85), and on many different nutrients. Accumulation of low-molecular compounds in living cells was analysed by HR MAS-NMR. Glycerol, arabitol, and trehalose accumulation increased with reduced oxygen availability, indicating a role during oxygen-limited growth. Regulation of the central aerobic and hypoxic metabolism of P. anomala was investigated under controlled fermentor conditions. Oxygen limitation induced alcoholic fermentation as well as activity of the key fermentative enzymes, ADH and PDC. Metabolic flux analysis revealed that the TCA pathway operated as a cycle during aerobic batch culture and as a two-branched pathway under oxygen limitation. Hypoxic conditions also increased the production of ethyl acetate, an ester involved in the biocontrol activity of P. anomala. Genes encoding the ADH and PDC enzymes were cloned, PaADH 1, PaADH 2, and PaPDC 1, and their expression was analysed with real-time RT-PCR. PaADH 1 and PaPDC 1 were expressed during aerobic growth on glucose and ethanol and were up-regulated in response to oxygen limitation. PaADH 2 expression was low during these growth conditions, i. e. < 1 % of the level of its isogene, PaADH 1. In cells grown on succinate, the expression of the two ADH isogenes was the opposite, high expression of PaADH 2 and low expression of PaADH 1. The up-regulation of gene expression and enzyme activity did not quantitatively correlate with glycolytic flux. Thus, additional regulatory phenomena at the posttranscriptional and posttranslational level are important in the distribution of carbon through the respiratory and fermentative pathways...|$|R
40|$|CSIRO 2008 Black {{point and}} kernel {{discoloration}} of barley both appear to occur {{under conditions of}} high humidity at grain fill. Both of these traits are likely to result from the enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds to quinones and the transformation of those oxidation products to brown or black pigments during high humidity. However, even though black point symptoms are quite distinct from other types of kernel discoloration, black point of barley has not previously been the sole focus of environmental studies or quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. We have evaluated black point tolerance in doubled haploid progeny of Alexis/Sloop and mapped QTLs on chromosomes 2 H and 3 H. We have also established that the occurrence of low vapour pressure deficit, high humidity, and low temperatures {{is associated with the}} formation of black point in susceptible varieties. These environmental conditions probably create a <b>moist</b> environment during <b>grain</b> development so that the developing grain cannot dry out. Stress or wounding to the embryo caused by this environment might then lead to black point formation. The results of this study will enable the use of comprehensive genetic and biochemical approaches to develop a more detailed understanding of this disorder. K. Ryan Walker, Jason A. Able, Diane E.

3000|$|The results {{presented}} in this work confirm general observations (Webb 1991; Juliano 2003) that high AAC {{is associated with a}} slender grain, whereas rices having an intermediate amylose content most often have bold grains. We clearly highlighted that the frequencies of genotypes having a low AAC (< 21.5 %) are skewed towards low L/W ratios while the frequencies of intermediate-high amylose genotypes (> 21.5 % AAC) are skewed towards high L/W ratios. These skewings can be imputed to selection for consumer preferences: for cooking and processing, rice are conventionally classified as short-, medium- and long-grain types, and an AAC[*]≥[*] 20 % is preferred for long-grain rice, whereas an AAC[*]<[*] 20 % is commonly favoured for short- and medium-grain types (Webb 1991). The width of the grain is as much, or even more, linked to the cooking application of rice than the L/W ratio: long, thin-grain rice is typically used in applications requiring distinct shape and texture, and high amylose ensures that cooked grains are firm and remain separate; on the other hand, medium- and short-grain rice are ideal for puddings, desserts, and similar applications, and low amylose content allows to obtain cooked grains that are soft, <b>moist</b> and sticky. <b>Grain</b> width and L/W ratio are more distinctive of the cooking application than grain length because long-grain rice with bold kernel are typically used to prepare ‘risotto’, {{and many of them are}} traditional varieties with intermediate AAC. In fact, the EU classification (see Ferrero and Nguyen, 2004 for a synoptic table of USA and EU grades) further distinguishes long-grain rice (length[*]>[*] 6.0  mm) into long A (2 [*]<[*]L/W[*]<[*] 3) and long B types (L/W[*]≥[*] 3). The former wide-grain type is used for ‘risotto’ and often has intermediate AAC, while the latter thin-grain type includes high amylose rice for oriental and side dishes, prepared entrees, rice salad and garnitures. Thus, grain width is more related to cooking applications than grain length, and then it has a better association with AAC. Further work is crucial to characterize the genetic basis of the two different modes observed for grain width in Wx [...]...|$|R
40|$|To produce {{commercial}} biocontrol agents (BCAs) successfully, it {{is important}} that cheap and economic substrates are used which support high numbers of good quality inoculum. Production of formulations conserving ecological competence and shelf-life should also be ensured. With this in mind, studies focusing on yeast ecophysiology were conducted to produce and formulate ecologically competent P. anomala cells for controlling spoilage of <b>moist</b> cereal <b>grain.</b> The liquid culture systems used were synthetic, nutrient yeast dextrose broth (NYDB), and a complex (industry byproduct, cane molasses) media. Manipulation of cultural conditions by means of imposing water-stress with several solute additions to the media had an impact on yield, cell water potentials (Ψc), viability and endogenous sugar/polyol accumulation. Glucose addition resulted in higher yeast yield (6. 15 and 3. 4 mg cell ml- 1 medium for NYDB and molasses, respectively). Water activity (aw) modifications of the media resulted in modification of Ψc so that Ψc ≤ Ψw (medium water potential). The change in yeast Ψc was attributed to the intracellular accumulation/synthesis of polyols, mostly glycerol and arabitol and sugars, mostly trehalose. In molasses-based medium cells accumulated/synthesized trehalose [32 mg g- 1 fresh weight (f. w.) yeast cell]. Higher amounts of endogenous trehalose (up to 140 mg g- 1 f. w. yeast cell) were retained intracellularly when modified yeast cells were isotonically washed compared to those subjected to hypo-osmotic shock by washing with water. The pattern was similar for endogenous arabitol. Trehalose retention doubled and quadrupled, and arabitol increased by 65 and 100 % in proline and NaCl treatments respectively. The molasses control medium gave high [> 1010 colony forming units (CFU) ml- 1] cell viability, which was further increased by addition of NaCl and proline (≈ 3 x 1010 CFU ml- 1). Fluidised bed drying of yeast cells showed that drying at 50 oC for 20 min resulted in high cell viability (67 %) and low moisture content (7 %). Osmoprotection and several carriers and adjuvants affected viability and moisture content. Cotton seed flour (CSF) + 10 % skimmed milk (SM) resulted in the highest cell protection (74 %) during the drying process, with a final moisture content of about 5 % and this was easy to resuspend. Storage stability of the formulation was 50 % at 4 oC and ambienta temperatures for up to 150 days. P. anomala cells grown in NaCl ii modified molasses-media, when osmoprotected, retained four times more trehalose and resulted in significantly increased survival after drying and storage stability for 150 days. When SM + sucrose at 10 % (w/v) was used as a protective solution, P. anomala cells were highly resistant to freezing, thawing and freeze drying processes. Storage stability at 4 oC of freeze dried P. anomala cells was particularly high (> 86 %) over a period of 150 days while storage at 22 oC resulted in a rapid decrease in cell viability to 2. 2 activity units), low chitinase (< 0. 9 activity units) and β-glucosidase (< 3 nmol 4 -nitrophenol min µg protein of specific enzyme activity) - 1 - 1 amounts. The role of the first hydrolase in biocontrol activity is possibly important while that of the other two is not clear for P. anomala. In lab-scale bioassays using wheat grain under aerobic conditions, populations of P. verrucosum 22625 were significantly reduced by formulated P. anomala cells at both 0. 93 and 0. 95 aw levels while OTA production was significantly reduced at 0. 93 aw only.

40|$|Black {{point of}} barley refers to {{discolouration}} of the embryo {{end of the}} grain. Downgrading of malting barley to feed grade due to black point results in significant economic loss to the Australian barley industry. Given that black point normally occurs in regions of Australia that experience high humidity during grain fill, humidity most probably contributes to the severity of black point in susceptible varieties. Previous studies have excluded fungal infection as a cause but enzymatic browning reaction has been recently hypothesised as responsible for black point. More specifically, a role for peroxidases has been proposed. The first major focus {{of this study was}} to confirm under what environmental conditions black point formation was likely to occur and whether there was genetic variation contributing to the phenotype. The occurrence of high humidity and low temperatures was associated with the formation of black point in susceptible varieties, with early maturing varieties being more susceptible to black point. These environmental conditions probably create a <b>moist</b> environment during <b>grain</b> development in which the developing grain cannot dry out, enabling stress or wounding to the embryo that subsequently results in black point formation. Analysis combining two South Australian sites (Hatherleigh and Port Wakefield, SA) identified QTL for black point formation on chromosomes 2 H (QBpt. AlSl- 2 H) and 3 H QBpt. AlSl- 3 H) at positions 83. 4 cM and 102. 6 cM respectively. Additive by environment effects were substantial at both QTL. Linkage of the QTL on chromosome 2 H with the earliness per se (eps 2) locus and the observation that early maturing varieties were usually more susceptible to black point established a probable association between earliness and black point susceptibility. When an early maturing(susceptible) variety was planted later so that it matured at the same time as a later maturing (tolerant) variety there was no significant difference in black point scores. The second focus {{of this study was to}} characterise a number of candidate genes more than likely linked to black point by investigating expression levels during grain fill and subsequently mapping the genomic regions responsible for those changes in expression. Candidate genes chosen were Quinone Reductase (HvQR), Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (HvPAL), Barley Peroxidase 1 (HvBP 1), stress-related Peroxidase (HvPrx 7) and Lipoxygenase A (HvLoxA). Differential expression as detected using northern analysis, between susceptible and tolerant varieties, was only observed for HvBP 1, HvPrx 7 and HvQR. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed that HvBP 1 and HvPrx 7 expression was up to two times higher in black point susceptible varieties during all stages of grain development, while HvQR expression was significantly higher in the hard dough and mature stages of grain fill in susceptible varieties. Increased expression for HvBP 1 and HvPrx 7 (approximately two-fold) was also apparent in the tolerant variety Alexis between symptomatic and asymptomatic grains. The qPCR data was then used as a quantitative trait, to score the expression of these candidate genes in an Alexis/Sloop double haploid (DH) mapping population. Areas of the genome potentially involved in the regulation of these candidates (expression QTL or eQTL) were mapped on chromosomes 2 H (for HvPrx 7 and HvBP 1) and 5 H (for HvQR and HvBP 1). The eQTL for HvPrx 7 and HvQR were located in the same regions as the corresponding genes, suggesting their expression is regulated via cis-acting factors. In contrast, while HvBP 1 is located on 3 H, eQTL were located on 2 H and 5 H suggesting trans-acting factors were involved. The use of comparative mapping studies between barley and rice identified a number of transcription factor genes within these eQTL. The final component of this study was to investigate how HvBP 1 and HvPrx 7 expression might be affected by examining their promoters and potential interactors with those promoters. Promoter regions for the susceptible variety Sloop and tolerant variety Alexis were isolated, compared and analysed for known motifs. Particular emphasis was placed on those elements that were associated with embryo and endosperm specific expression or responses to environmental stresses. Several regions containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the promoters from the tolerant and susceptible varieties were identified. A 160 bp region for HvBP 1 and 380 bp region for HvPrx 7 were used in Yeast One Hybrid (Y 1 H) screening to identify potential regulatory proteins. In particular, a potential bZIP-containing factor which interacted with the promoter of HvPrx 7 was further characterised. Interaction was confirmed by a gel shift assay and gene expression by northern analysis showed expression at the milk, soft dough and hard dough stages of grain development. Increased expression was apparent in the susceptible variety Sloop. The eQTL, Y 1 H and environmental studies have furthered our understanding of genes that could be involved in the regulation of black point formation under conditions of low temperature and high humidity. This information will contribute to assessing the roles these genes play in black point formation under certain environmental conditions, and more broadly, will assist in improving breeding for resistant barley varieties.
