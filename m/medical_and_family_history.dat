40|$|SummaryAim: To {{develop a}} {{screening}} {{in order to}} determine the more common syndromic and non-syndromic genetic SNHL, considering epidemiological data, information and the development of new technologies; clinical implications and bioethical issues. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the literature in order to develop a screening that includes: history, patterns of inheritance, physical evaluation, laboratory tests, image studies, multidisciplinary approaches and genetic tests. Conclusion: The epidemiologic data estimates that at least 50 % of prelingual HL can be determined by genetic alterations. <b>Medical</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> are extremely important to help one achieve a genetic-based SNHL diagnosis, and help determine inheritance patterns. Through a high suspicion index, syndromic cases can be diagnosed or excluded, with a careful evaluation and molecular basis tests used to better determine the hearing loss. Genetic tests and mitochondrial inheritance should be considered in any family with many affected individuals, except when the hearing loss was clearly transmitted by a male.

Smoking status, previous <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>histories,</b> height, weight, blood pressure, ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and non-fasting lipid profile were recorded.

There was a linear effect with increased levels of LDL cholesterol increasing the risk of having a small aneurysm (test for trend p= 0. 03). Conclusion. The highly significant association between LDL cholesterol and small aneurysms suggests that LDL, possibly acting via inflammatory mediated matrix degeneration, could be an initiating factor in the development of AAA.
