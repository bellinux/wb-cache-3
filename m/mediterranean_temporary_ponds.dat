Ponds in the three northernmost areas showed higher levels of species richness than ponds in the two southernmost areas. In the north, ponds were present at higher densities, spanned a broader hydroperiod range, and had lower conductivity levels; these features were associated with the presence of wet-meadow species and larger numbers of submerged and emergent species. In the south, alkaline waters were mainly associated with different charophyte species, and the predominance of long-hydroperiod ponds helped in increasing the number of floating species. Managed ponds, which had been artificially deepened, contributed to increase pond heterogeneity and hydroperiod breadth across the entire network.

In addition, a set of newly created experimental ponds were monitored on the Lizard to examine patterns of colonisation and evaluate the use of habitat creation in <b>temporary</b> <b>pond</b> conservation. The findings are synthesised {{into a number of}} management recommendations for ponds in the regions, with a particular focus on MTPs. MTPs equated to ephemeral, winter-flooded ponds occurring in shallow depressions on the Lizard, which had some floristic similarities to other western Atlantic fringe sites. They were dominated by low growing grasses, rushes and rare annual species of the Nanocyperion alliance along with a depauperate macroinvertebrate assemblage comprising Coleoptera (including characteristic rare taxa), Trichoptera and Chironomidae. The strength of physicochemical and spatial pattern in assemblage composition varied between the regions. Lizard macroinvertebrate assemblage similarity was spatially autocorrelated and related to water chemistry and pond area but New Forest macroinvertebrate similarity was not related to any of the measured physicochemical parameters. Plant assemblage composition was only weakly related to wet phase physicochemistry. Pond vegetation structured macroinvertebrate assemblages in different ways at different spatial scales. At large-scales, macrophyte richness and composition affected macroinvertebrate assemblage composition in both regions, whereas, at smaller-scales, macrophyte structural complexity (measured using fractals) influenced body size scaling and overall biomass of macroinvertebrates. Assemblages in both regions were significantly nested, indicating that species-poor sites tended to be subsets of rich sites. Macroinvertebrate nesting, on the Lizard, was not due to passive sampling, and was best explained by pond area, with habitat parameters and isolation being of secondary importance. Nested and idiosyncratic taxa differed in their spatial response to factors which structured assemblage-level nestedness; idiosyncratic taxa tended to possess broad ecological tolerance and good dispersal capacity, whilst nested species had narrower tolerance or limited powers of dispersal. Experimental pond macroinvertebrate assemblage similarity converged with pond age, despite continued variation in physicochemistry, and the assemblages that developed were not significantly different from small natural ponds in the region. Augmentation of current MTP habitat could therefore be achieved by creating new sites in close proximity to existing water bodies.

The relative quantification of the hetero and autotrophic biomass at the base of the food web in each pond was derived from the polar fatty acid (PLFA) composition of seston through the application of the matrix factorization program CHEMTAX that used specific PLFA and their relative proportion as markers for e. g., classes of bacteria, algae and fungi. The species composition of the culturable microbial communities was identified through their fatty acid profiles. The biomass in the lower trophic level of some ponds presented an even proportion of auto to heterotrophic organisms whilst either bacteria or algae dominated in others. In a selected subset of ponds, the incorporation of bacterial fatty acids was observed to occur in potentially herbivorous zooplankton crustacean.

This habitat and its flora have been poorly studied and documented {{because of the}} ephemeral character of the flora, the changeable annual weather that has a great effect on the small, herbaceous taxa and the declining abundance of temporary ponds. The objectives of this study are: (a) to define plant community diversity in terms of floristic composition of ephemeral wetlands in SW Portugal, (b) to identify temporary pond types according to their vegetation composition and (c) to identify those ponds that configure the European community priority habitat (3170 * – <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds).</b> Vegetation sampling was conducted in 29 ponds, identifying 168 species grouped among 15 plant communities. Soil texture, pH, organic C and N content were measured, but only N and percent of clay appear to be related with the distribution of each community type. The results showed that ephemeral wetlands could be classified into four type: vernal pools, marshlands, deep ponds and disturbed wetlands.

We compared the bryoflora composition of temporary ponds in Sardinia (Italy) with the available bibliographical data on temporary ponds in the Mediterranean (Spain, France and main Mediterranean islands such as Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sicily) to define their characteristic floristic composition. A total of 212 bryophyte species, which included 166 Bryophyta, 44 Marchantiophyta and 2 Antocerothophyta are reported. Among these species, those most typically connected with such habitats are: Archidium alternifolium, Bryum dichotomum, Imbrybryum alpinum, Fossombronia caespitiformis, Ptychostomum capillare, Ptychostomum pseudotriquetrum, Riccia beyrichiana, Tortella squarrosa and Trichostomum brachydontium. In particular, Archidium alterifolium and Bryum dichotomum are the most common species found in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds,</b> being surveyed in more that 83 % of the investigated ponds.

40|$|The {{persistence}} and abundance {{of most of}} the species in an area are the result of a dynamic balance between the duration of the habitat and the ability of species to colonize such environments through the production and dispersion of spores. This study presents a preliminary analysis of bryophyte’s spores from the pauli of the Giara of Gesturi (C Sardinia). The Giare (average altitude 550 m a. s. l.) are basaltic plateaus that rise unexpectedly from the plain of the country, as huge natural fortresses. Several authors have studied the population dynamics of some bryophytes confined to fragmented and temporary habitat (1, 2, 3) and, in particular, studies conducted by Herben & Söderström (4) show that the most important factor that regulates the survival of the species is the ability to form new colonies on substrates fragmented.

Thirthy soil samples were collected in November (rainy season) in three ponds until the depths of 7 cm. The samples were taken and subdivided in seven portions, which were collected for obtaining an ex situ germination of spores, at the Botanical Garden of University of Cagliari. The results showed the capacity of some genus and two species to germinate in ex-situ conditions: Bryum sp., Pohlia sp., Tortula sp., Fossombronia sp., Riccia canaliculata Hoffm. and Archidium alternifolium (Hedw.)

40|$|The {{characterization}} of complex biodiversity patterns across ecosystems requires substantial effort, expertise, and financial resources. An approach to limit these challenges {{is offered by}} choosing proper indicators or surrogates as a shortcut to predict biodiversity changes in poorly investigated groups from groups where adequate information is available. Surrogate identification is primarily based on cross-taxon congruence analysis, and the surrogate strength depends on the taxonomic groups studied and the scale of analysis. Cross-taxon congruence analysis between vascular plants and bryophytes generated variable responses. The object {{of this research was}} to contribute to this debate comparing the patterns of vascular plant and bryophyte richness in an almost unknown habitat, i. e. <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> at a small spatial scale, i. e. Sardinia. Vascular plant and bryophyte richness was assessed in 14 temporary ponds located on different substrata and under different climatic conditions. The Pearson correlation analysis was performed to compare the patterns of richness. Overall 137 vascular plants and 97 bryophytes were detected. Pearson coefficient was not significant. In the specific case vascular plant and bryophyte richness presented different patterns of distribution. As a consequence each taxa needs to be evaluated independently to address conservation issues. ...|$|E
40|$|Several insect species seem {{to persist}} {{not only in}} {{permanent}} but also in <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> where they face particularly harsh conditions and frequent extinctions. Under such conditions, gene flow may prevent local adaptation to <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> and may promote phenotypic plasticity, or maintain apparent population persistence. The few empirical studies on insects suggest the latter mechanism, but no studies so far quantified gene flow including both pond types. We investigated the effects of pond type and temporal variation on population genetic differentiation and gene flow in the damselfly Lestes viridis in northern Belgium. We report a survey of two allozyme loci (Gpi, Pgm) with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 14 populations from permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds,</b> and compared these results with similar data from the same permanent populations one year before. The data suggested that neither pond-drying regime, nor temporal variation have a substantial effect on population genetic structuring and did not provide evidence for stable population differentiation in L. viridis in northern Belgium. Gene flow estimates were high within permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds,</b> and between pond types. Our data are consistent with a source-sink metapopulation system where <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> act as sinks in dry years, and are quickly recolonized after local population extinction. This may create a pattern of apparent population persistence of this species in permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> without clear local adaptation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. In {{this study}} we present {{the start of the}} {{breeding}} season and the long term population fluctuations of amphibians in a permanent pond and a number of <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> in a human modified landscape in the middle section of the Târnava Mare basin. The start of breeding was strongly influenced by temperature in spring. The populations of Hyla arborea and R. temporaria were in decline whereas Pelobates fuscus and Bufo bufo were stable during this time. Pelobates fuscus is represented by a small population and is probably maintained by immigration from other areas. Bufo bufo and P. fuscus use only the permanent pond for reproduction. More egg masses of R. temporaria were found in the <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> than in the permanent pond. The reproductive success was yearly observed in the <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> but not in the permanent pond. We assume that the permanent pond is a source habitat for B. bufo and represents sink for R. temporaria whereas the <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> from the forest represent source habitats for the last species. This and the previous studies on this community suggest that in this landscape, both the permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>ponds</b> and the landscape connectivity are crucial for the maintenance of rich amphibian communities...|$|R
