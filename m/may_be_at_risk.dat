5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive deficits {{that can}} follow TBI include {{impaired}} attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive {{functions such as}} abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. People who have suffered TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language, or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language. Post-concussion syndrome, a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect. A young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow, with debilitating or deadly results. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, the severe form of CTBI, affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career. It commonly manifests as dementia, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination).|$|E

25|$|Though {{there is}} no {{clear-cut}} way to prevent dysthymia from occurring, some suggestions have been made. Since dysthymia will often first occur in childhood, {{it is important to}} identify children who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> It may be beneficial to work with children in helping to control their stress, increase resilience, boost self-esteem, and provide strong networks of social support. These tactics may be helpful in warding off or delaying dysthymic symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Globally, {{symptomatic}} HAV {{infections are}} believed to occur in around 1.4 million people a year. About 114 million infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) occurred all together in 2015. Acute hepatitis A resulted in 11,200 deaths in 2015. Developed countries have low circulating levels of hepatovirus A, while developing countries {{have higher levels of}} circulation. Most adolescents and adults in developing countries have already had the disease, thus are immune. Adults in midlevel countries <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of disease with the potential of being exposed.|$|E
25|$|Baby is {{considered}} {{at risk for}} malnutrition: In certain circumstances infants <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for malnutrition, such as due to iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies (e.g. vitamin D which may be less present in breastmilk than needed at high latitudes where there is less sun exposure), or inadequate nutrition during transition to solid foods. Risks can often be mitigated with improved diet and education of mothers and caregivers, including availability of macro and micronutrients. For example, in Canada, marketed infant formulas are fortified with vitamin D, but Health Canada also recommends breastfed infants receive extra vitamin D {{in the form of}} a supplement.|$|E
25|$|His father Guru Tegh Bahadur was petitioned by Kashmiri Pandits in 1675 for {{protection}} from the fanatic persecution by Iftikar Khan, an Islamic satrap of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Tegh Bahadur considered a peaceful resolution by meeting Aurangzeb, but was cautioned by his advisors that his life <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> The young Gobind Rai – {{to be known as}} Gobind Singh after 1699 – advised his father that no one was more worthy to lead and make a sacrifice than him. His father made the attempt, but was arrested then publicly beheaded in Delhi on 11 November 1675 under the orders of Aurangzeb for refusing to convert to Islam and the ongoing conflicts between Sikhism and the Islamic Empire. After this martyrdom, the young Gobind Rai was installed by the Sikhs as the tenth Sikh Guru on Vaisakhi on 29 March 1676.|$|E

25|$|Experimental warming {{has been}} shown to start {{flowering}} substantially earlier than control cushions experiencing ambient temperature. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs and capsules (fruits) matured earlier, and the cushions produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio contributing to an overall positive reproductive response. However, a study on four populations across a latitudinal gradient in North America showed that southern populations of moss campion had lower survival and recruitment, but higher individual growth rates than more northern populations. Furthermore, vital rates such as growth, survival, and fruits per area were shown to increase in moderately warmer years yet declined in the very warmest years, suggesting that a change in climate into warmer conditions or more frequent unusually warm summers may eventually lead to negative impacts. Another study showed that while the short term responses were positive, they turned negative on medium-term, suggestion that moss campion <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> in future global warming.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} battle, Meretskov placed {{the blame on}} the {{captured}} 2nd Shock Army commander, Andrey Vlasov, whom he himself recommended to the post in April, a claim that was echoed in his post-war memoirs. Since Vlasov went on to collaborate with the German forces, there were few attempts to revisit this claim during the Soviet era. However, David Glantz points out that, irrespective of Vlasov's decision to collaborate with German forces, his level of command in May and June 1942 was not different from most other army commanders. Furthermore, Meretskov does bear some responsibility for the defeat as {{the commander of the}} front who planned the operation and carried it out. Khosin, the commander of the Leningrad Front, was removed from command on June 8, reduced in rank and never commanded a front again, humiliatingly assigned from March 1944 to the rear line Volga Military District. Meretskov, who was arrested less than a year earlier, knew that his life <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> if he accepted responsibility for the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Some clinicians {{suggest that}} {{assessment}} of the construct of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to violence risk assessment. A large systematic review and meta-regression found that the PCL performed the poorest out of nine tools for predicting violence. In addition, studies conducted by the authors or translators of violence prediction measures, including the PCL, show on average more positive results than those conducted by more independent investigators. There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R {{and some of these}} are considerably easier, quicker, and less expensive to administer. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these assessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term management, identify more specific kinds of violence that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores. Nonetheless, the PCL-R may continue to be popular for risk assessment because of its pioneering role and the large amount of research done using it.|$|E
50|$|Alcohol has cross {{tolerance}} with GABAA receptor positive modulators {{such as the}} benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine drugs. For this reason, alcoholics or recovering alcoholics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> increased <b>risk</b> {{of physical}} dependency on zolpidem. Also, alcoholics and drug abusers <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> increased <b>risk</b> of abusing and or becoming psychologically dependent on zolpidem. It should be avoided in those {{with a history of}} alcoholism, drug misuse, physical dependency, or psychological dependency on sedative-hypnotic drugs. Zolpidem has rarely been associated with drug-seeking behavior, the risk of which is amplified in patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.|$|R
30|$|Sports teams <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> {{increased}} <b>risk</b> {{of infectious}} diseases due to their close physical interactions, exposing them to both point-source and person-to-person transmission [3, 4, 12]. Teams <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of foodborne illness because of mass catering at training, events or functions. Furthermore, when food is prepared for specific dietary circumstances or needs of sportspersons, adherence to strict food safety principles is required. Large-scale sporting events will often have risk management plans which include food safety as a significant area for risk mitigation [14]. However, when catering is on a smaller, more routine scale, such plans or consideration of food safety <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> a particular priority.|$|R

25|$|The {{frequency}} of physical aggression in humans peaks at around 2–3 years of age. It then declines gradually on average. These observations suggest that physical aggression {{is not only}} a learned behavior but that development provides opportunities for the learning and biological development of self-regulation. However, a small subset of children fail to acquire all the necessary self-regulatory abilities and tend to show atypical levels of physical aggression across development. These <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for later violent behavior or, conversely, lack of aggression that may be considered necessary within society. Some findings suggest that early aggression does not necessarily lead to aggression later on, however, although the course through early childhood is an important predictor of outcomes in middle childhood. In addition, physical aggression that continues is likely occurring in the context of family adversity, including socioeconomic factors. Moreover, 'opposition' and 'status violations' in childhood appear to be more strongly linked to social problems in adulthood than simply aggressive antisocial behavior. Social learning through interactions in early childhood has been seen as a building block for levels of aggression which {{play a crucial role in}} the development of peer relationships in middle childhood. Overall, an interplay of biological, social and environmental factors can be considered.|$|E
500|$|Misuse, problem use, abuse, {{and heavy}} {{use of alcohol}} refer to {{improper}} use of alcohol which may cause physical, social, or moral harm to the drinker. Moderate use is defined by The Dietary Guidelines for Americans as {{no more than two}} alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women. Some drinkers may drink more than 600 ml of alcohol per day during a heavy drinking period. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a two-hour period. According to the NIAAA, men <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 standard drinks per week or 4 drinks per day, and women <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5ounces of distilled spirits. Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either [...] "heavy drinkers" [...] or [...] "binge drinkers" [...] defined according to the above criteria also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met the criteria. An inference drawn from this study is that evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases.|$|E
500|$|The Iago sparrow is {{endemic to}} the {{archipelago}} of Cape Verde. It is common on most islands, excluding Fogo (from {{which it is}} absent) and Santa Luzia, Branco and Sal (on which it is scarce). The Iago sparrow is found commonly {{in a variety of}} habitats, including flat lava plains, coastal cliffs, gorges, and the edges of farmland, at altitudes of up to [...] It also occurs in settled areas and gardens, where it may overlap somewhat with the house sparrow, but usually not with the Spanish sparrow. The Spanish sparrow occurs in richer cultivated land with larger trees and villages, restricting the Iago sparrow to more arid cultivated land with smaller trees. In settlements where both the house sparrow and Iago sparrow occur, house sparrows tend to occupy the denser areas, while Iago sparrows are found primarily around trees and open spaces. In agricultural areas the Iago sparrow may do some damage to crops, mostly by eating buds and shoots. The Iago sparrow is highly common within its limited range, though its exact population is not known. Though the size of its range means it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> to unpredicted changes in its environment, it is assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.|$|E
