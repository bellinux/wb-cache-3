30|$|The use of {{micro-electro-mechanical system}} (MEMS) {{microphones}} {{as a replacement}} for ordinary microphone capsules has gained interest in [12 – 14], especially for the application of directive beamforming [15, 16] due to its reduced size and cost compared with an ordinary <b>microphone</b> <b>capsule.</b> However, differential microphone arrays are not ideal in the presence of wind noise. The directional beam pattern may lead to a significant amplification of the wind noise due to the correlation properties of the noise terms [17]. The required first-order low-pass filter for the equalization regarding the speech signal makes this behavior even worse. One proposed solution for a differential microphone array is to switch to a single microphone with an omnidirectional response if wind noise is detected [17].|$|E

40|$|Interference in {{three-dimensional}} audio {{systems is}} a problematic issue. Eliminating noise, {{or any other}} disturbing source, without affecting the spatial audio rendering, is challenging, indeed.

This technique allows shaping cardioid-like virtual microphones pointing to a jamming source. This disturbing signal {{can be used to}} feed an adaptive noise canceller and kill noise from the 3 D recording. Evidently, a 4 -capsule array extracts cardioids up to first order. The final result can be improved if microphones with higher directivity are employed.

50|$|In 2006 Røde was {{approached}} by sound engineer Bruce Jackson to design a microphone system {{that could be used}} as the primary podium microphone for the Asian Games that year in Doha. The microphone has since appeared at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver,2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore, 2011 Pan-Arab Games in Doha, 2011 Rugby World Cup in Auckland, 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in London, and at the Olympics and Paralympics in Rio in 2016. Røde’s engineers designed the microphone system with two discrete <b>microphone</b> <b>capsules</b> in order to offer a high level of redundancy. The first <b>capsule</b> in the <b>microphone</b> stem sends audio directly to the broadcaster’s main digital audio network, using Røde designed preamps that are fed phantom power from an Optocore fibre network device. The second capsule is connected to a custom wireless system that is housed inside the actual lectern. This wireless system contains an RF transmitter, phantom power supply and transformer coupling amongst other components. The output is available both in analogue form, and sent to the analogue backup portion of the main audio system. It is also available in modulated RF format that is received by a radio mic receiver (or receivers) beneath the stage, and at the front-of-house (FOH) position. Originally three microphones were built, with one of these later being converted to a floor-standing unit.|$|R
30|$|This work studies a {{wind noise}} {{reduction}} approach for communication applications {{in a car}} environment. An endfire array consisting of two microphones is considered {{as a substitute for}} an ordinary cardioid <b>microphone</b> <b>capsule</b> of the same size. Using the decomposition of the multichannel Wiener filter (MWF), a suitable beamformer and a single-channel post filter are derived. Due to the known array geometry and the location of the speech source, assumptions about the signal properties can be made to simplify the MWF beamformer and to estimate the speech and noise power spectral densities required for the post filter. Even for closely spaced microphones, the different signal properties at the microphones can be exploited to achieve a significant reduction of wind noise. The proposed beamformer approach results in an improved speech signal regarding the signal-to-noise-ratio and keeps the linear speech distortion low. The derived post filter shows equal performance compared to known approaches but reduces the effort for noise estimation.|$|E

30|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a wind noise {{reduction}} approach for a closely spaced microphone array {{consisting of two}} MEMS microphones, which is considered {{as a substitute for}} an ordinary cardioid <b>microphone</b> <b>capsule.</b> The decomposition of the MWF in a beamformer and a single-channel post filter is used similar to [29] as well as the assumption that the wind noise is uncorrelated at the microphones. But in contrast to [29], we assume that the noise powers at the microphones may differ. Since the geometry of the microphone array and the location of the desired speech source are known, additional assumptions about the speech and noise signal properties can be made to design a low-complexity wind noise reduction algorithm. Even for distances of only a few centimeters, the variation in the microphone signals can be used to reduce wind noise significantly. The coherence properties of speech and wind noise signals are exploited to form a beamformer, as well as to obtain estimates of the speech and noise PSDs for the post filter. Simulations with recorded wind noise show that the proposed approach improves the signal-to-noise-ratio, while keeping the linear distortion of the speech signal low.|$|E

40|$|So-called “coincident ” {{microphone}} arrays {{are often}} used for recording stereo or surround sound. Experience has shown {{that two of the}} main causes of poor image localisation and of spurious secondary images are: (i) the usual capsule spacing of 3 to 10 cm, and (ii) poor polar diagrams and polar phase responses in the treble. These defects also cause a significant degradation in the tonal quality if a stereo or surround sound recording is mixed down to mono or matrixed either to modify the recording’s stereo effect or for 2 -channel quadraphonic encoding. Because there are practical limits on the smallness of low-noise directional <b>microphone</b> <b>capsules,</b> it has not hitherto been possible to design precisely co-incident microphone arrays. Such precise coincidence (ideally to better than 5 mm) is necessary whenever signals are to be mixed or matrixed, in order to avoid high-frequency cancellation effects. We describe the use of a tetrahedral array of capsules with electronic spacing compensation to ensure effective coincidence of all outputs. Let the polar diagram of an individual capsule in an array (with respect to the capsule’s notional centre) be f (x,y,z), where (x,y,z) are the direction cosines of the direction from which a sound arrives, with the x-axis forward, y to the left side, and z upward, and with x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1.

As well, the Venue mixing system {{was chosen for}} its integration with Pro Tools hardware and software, to make 128-channel hard disk recordings of the concerts directly from the three Digidesign consoles: one to mix strings, one to mix brass, reeds and percussion, and one under Jackson's control out in the audience, with Streisand's microphone inputs and stems (submixes of other microphones) from the other consoles. The recordings made in New York City and Washington, D.C. were remixed into the album Live In Concert 2006—Jackson was listed as sound designer. Sharing sound designer and FOH mixing duties with Chris Carlton, Jackson made certain that the custom soft dome monitor wedges were positioned correctly aiming up from under the stage to cover everywhere Streisand might walk. Clair Brothers supplied 18 Dolby Lake Processors for the tour, the majority used by Jackson to tune the main sound system, and the rest for control of monitor wedges used by Streisand and by the supporting artist, Il Divo. For Streisand's voice, Jackson auditioned several wireless microphones and ended up using a Sennheiser SKM 5200 transmitter equipped with a Neumann KK 105 S supercardioid capsule. He used the vocal microphone to test the sound system from different locations around the arena. When the tour hit the UK and continental Europe, Jackson changed from a Neumann to a Røde <b>Microphones</b> <b>capsule,</b> custom made to his requirements; one that Røde called the [...] "Jackson Special".
