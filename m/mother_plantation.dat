As far as these Virginians were concerned, the central issue was the right of its commonwealth to govern itself as it had from the beginning. As the war progresses, Edward found it necessary to load his family's necessities into wagons for a series of journeys, ever more southward. At each stage he rented a house. Finally he moved to [...] "Buena Vista," [...] near Roanoke, where his brother George Plater Tayloe lived in a fine home he had built a few years earlier. Though Edward was able to make several trips back to [...] "Powhatan" [...] to check on crops tended by the slaves he left in charge, it was not enough. At the war's end, scarcely any of the furniture was left. On these returns, he also had to stop at the [...] "Dogue," [...] the landed estate given to his son Bladen Tasker Tayloe, to check on that farm. Throughout his years as a farmer, he kept a journal now given to the University of Virginia Archives. [...] "Unlike his earlier, more literary journal on Mexico, this one is lean and spare, mostly a painstakingly accurate record of crops and rainfall. Its silence is eloquent, as if mere words could no longer serve him as they did when he was young and ready to conquer the world of diplomacy... there is a constant attention to the details of the land: on a three hundred mile ride back to Powhatan to check on the <b>mother</b> <b>plantation</b> and on the homes he'd given his sons, he could write, 'the dogwood is early this year and very beautiful,' and leave it at that." ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Determination of optimum dozes of foliar fee­ding {{for each}} {{cultivar}} {{that will provide}} the highest output of standard rootstocks. Methods. Field, analytical and statistical ones. Results. The author {{presents the results of}} study of the hazelnut plant foliar feeding in the <b>mother</b> <b>plantation</b> for vegetative propagation with applying different carba­mide concentration combined with 0. 1 % potassium sulfate (1. 5  0. 4 m) in case of horizontal method of growing. Biometric indices of hazelnut layers were analyzed; the influence of each factor on their height and diameter was determined. The rootstocks output per 1 linear meter for each cultivar as well as optimum foliar feeding doze was defined (0. 5 % carbamide with 0. 1 % potassium sulfate). Conclusions. The highest output of standard rootstocks in the <b>mother</b> <b>plantation</b> for horizontal vegetative propagation was achieved when applying the foliar feeding with 0. 5 % carbamide combined with 0. 1 % potassium sulfate, particularly (thousand rootstocks per 1 ha) for the cultivars: ‘Sviatkovyi’ – 66. 7, ‘Dolynskyi’ – 62. 1 and ‘Darunok Yunnatam’ – 50. 7. For ‘Koronchatyi’ cultivar, the use of 3 % carbamide was the most efficient...|$|E
40|$|In {{the fruit}} growing of humid and humid {{continental}} climate, strawberry represents an important fruit {{species in the}} group of berry fruit cultures. Permanent efforts of science and practice for improvement in production of strawberries, with a special emphasis on improving the quality of its fruits, gave special attention to the production of rosettes. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the possibility of producing fresh rosettes of strawberries in the <b>mother</b> <b>plantation</b> in a sand substrate. Planting material, suitable for planting in summer, is provided by direct rooting of rosettes in the sand substrate. Vegetative growth and the quality of rosettes were examined in six cultivars of the June-bearing garden strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) : ‘Honeoye’, ‘Chandler’, ‘Cortina’, ‘Marmolada’, ‘Idea ’ and ‘Senga Sengana’. The highest number of runners and rosettes per plant was recorded by ‘Honeoye’. The lowest vigor and the lowest number of rosettes per plant were recorded by ‘Senga Sengana’. The highest quality of primary and secondary rosettes was recorded by ‘Senga Sengana’. The 3 rd node rosettes are not used for summer planting of fresh strawberries due to low quality. This way of production, by direct rooting in the <b>mother</b> <b>plantation</b> in a sand substrate, allows obtaining seedlings with developed root system, prepared for planting during the summer months. Therewith, it is more economical and less expensiv...|$|E

He learned that Cooke had become a recluse nearby at her <b>mother's</b> <b>plantation</b> after her public disgrace. Having heard from a mutual friend about her beauty and accomplishments, he decided to meet Cooke. At first, she rejected all attention, but gradually received Beauchamp under his guise of borrowing books from her library. The two eventually became friends, and, in 1821, began courting. Beauchamp was eighteen years old; Cooke was at least thirty-four.|$|R

He and his wife moved to Africa, where he lived for 25 years. [...] Patrick lived {{for much of his}} life in Tanganyika where he ran a safari expedition company; served as a white hunter to wealthy patrons; and as an honorary game warden in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. He started his safari business, called Tanganyika Safari Business, near Mt. Kilimanjaro in 1955, which he gave up in the early 1960s when his wife was ill.|$|R

By 1860, the Littlefields had {{moved closer to the}} town of Gonzales, living in the fertile bottomlands at the confluence of the Guadalupe and San Marcos rivers. At the age of eighteen, Littlefield was listed in the census as the manager of his <b>mother's</b> <b>plantation.</b> The real estate was valued at over $23,000 with personal property valued at $30,000. The personal estate included thirty slaves.|$|R
5|$|Jereboam Beauchamp {{was born}} in Barren County, Kentucky, in 1802. Educated {{in the school of}} Dr. Benjamin Thurston, he {{resolved}} to study law at age eighteen. While observing the lawyers practicing in Glasgow and Bowling Green, Beauchamp was particularly impressed with the abilities of Solomon P. Sharp. Sharp had twice been elected to the state legislature and had served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Beauchamp became disenchanted with Sharp when, in 1820, a planter's daughter named Anna Cooke claimed Sharp was the father of her child, who was stillborn. Sharp denied paternity, and public opinion favored him. The disgraced Cooke became a recluse at her <b>mother's</b> <b>plantation</b> outside Bowling Green.|$|R
50|$|Unlike William Clark, {{who brought}} his slave York on the westward expedition, Lewis {{did not have}} a {{personal}} valet slave. Although Lewis attempted to supervise enslaved people while running his <b>mother's</b> <b>plantation</b> before the expedition, he left that post and had no valet during the expedition. Lewis made assignments to York but allowed Clark to supervise him; Lewis also granted York and Sacagewea votes during expedition meetings. Later, Lewis hired a free African-American man as his valet, John Pernia. Pernia accompanied Lewis during his final journey, although his wages were considerably in arrears. After Lewis' death, Pernia continued to Monticello and asked Jefferson to pay the $240 owed him, but was refused. Pernia later committed suicide.|$|R

40|$|Crown gall, {{produced}} by Agrobacterium vitis and Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{is a very}} dangerous disease that significantly reduces the growersƍ income. The pathogen attacks the roots, trunks and arms of vines, reduces plant vigour and finally decreases yield. Systemic survival of bacteria in vines and its spread into tissues plants represent the main difficulties to control this disease in vineyards. The aim of this review was to present the main feature of this pathogen and preventive measures recommended to be applied in vineyards and grapevine nurseries aiming to reduce its spread. In order to avoid bacteria invasion by grafting or cuttings is compulsory to detect and identify the presence of the pathogen in plants and soil (nurseries, plantations). The phytosanitary inspection in <b>mother</b> <b>plantations</b> is the safest procedure {{to prevent the spread of}} crown galls of grapevines. After removing the infected plants and their burning, is absolutely necessary to disinfect the soil to destroy the survival bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Forest genetic {{resources}} comprise an enormous pool of positive activities {{that can provide}} sustainable development and a high standard of life. Up to date, both Republic of Macedonia and Greece do not exploit their local forest resources {{to meet their needs}} in forest fruit food but mostly import them from abroad. As it is well known, the Balkan Peninsula is the heart of biodiversity in Europe and with this project we intend to capture the variability coming from well adapted forest plants that provide forest fruit food and can also be used for other purposes (eg. chemical and pharmacy industry) in a sustainable way. The basic steps of the project are the following: 1) Selection of the suitable forest species from Balkan Peninsula (indigenous and naturalized exotic species and varieties) that fruit in accordance to their quality, quantity and adaptability. 2) Conservation / Protection: all selected species will be transferred to Food Forest Parks (gene banks) as <b>mother</b> <b>plantations</b> in order to test the cloning technique and their pathogen resistance. 3) Promotion: a) by creating a protocol of cloning of the selected species and varieties; and a profile of their pathogen resistance in industrial plantations and b) by exhibiting the selected species with the establishment of two Food Forest Parks, one for each country placed in central spots also easily accessible to the communities, to attract the interest and sensitivity of public opinion to forests and their products...|$|R

60|$|Robert Browning, the poet, was {{the third}} of that name. The first Robert Browning, a man of energy and ability, held an {{important}} post in the Bank of England. His wife, Margaret Tittle, was a Creole from the West Indies, {{and at the time}} of her marriage her property was still in the estates owned by her father near St. Kitts. When their son, the second Robert, was seven years of age, his mother died, and his father afterwards married again. The second wife's ascendency over her husband was unfortunately exerted against the best interests of the son. His desire to become an artist, his wish for a university training, were disregarded, and he was sent instead to St. Kitts, where he was given employment on his <b>mother's</b> sugar <b>plantations.</b> The breach between Robert and his father became absolute when the boy defied local prejudice by teaching a negro to read, and when, because of what his father considered a sentimental objection to slavery, he finally refused to remain in the West Indies. The young man returned to England and at twenty-two started on an independent career as a clerk in the Bank of England. In 1811 he married Sarah Anne Wiedemann. They settled in Camberwell, London, where Robert, the poet, was born, May 7, 1812, and his sister Sarianna in 1814.|$|R
5|$|Blackwell and {{her parents}} lived in Lula, until 1936 when she was three years old; Blackwell's father left the {{plantation}} on which he worked, and fled to Memphis, Tennessee, fearing for his life after he confronted his boss about speaking to his wife. Soon afterwards, Blackwell and her <b>mother</b> left the <b>plantation</b> to live with him. Blackwell's family traveled frequently in search of work. On June 20, 1938, Blackwell's parents separated due to religious differences. Blackwell and her mother went to West Helena, Arkansas, to live with Blackwell's great aunt so {{that she had the}} opportunity to receive an education. A quality education in Mississippi was not an option for Blackwell because the schools there were centered on the cultivation of crops and the plantation system. While living in West Helena, Blackwell often visited her father in Memphis. During the summer months she would leave West Helena and live with her grandfather and grandmother in Lula, where she helped plant and harvest cotton. Blackwell spent a majority of her early years chopping cotton in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee and peeling tomatoes in Florida. She was 14 when she finished the eighth grade, the final year of school at Westside, a school in West Helena for black children. Blackwell had to quit school to earn for her family.|$|R
