50|$|Marv Wolfman briefly wrote Batman and co-created the Electrocutioner in issue #331 (Jan. 1981). Roy Thomas {{had a brief}} sting on {{the series}} as well. Writer Gerry Conway and artist Don Newton {{introduced}} Jason Todd in Batman #357 (March 1983). Todd would assume the costumed identity of Robin in issue #368 (February 1984). Writer Doug Moench began his run on the title with issue #360 and he and artist Tom Mandrake created the Black <b>Mask</b> <b>character</b> in Batman #386 (August 1985). Moench's longtime collaborator, artist Paul Gulacy made his DC Comics debut with a two-part story in issues #393 and #394. The title reached its 400th issue in October 1986 and featured work by several popular comics artists and included an introduction by novelist Stephen King.|$|E
50|$|Still, the {{production}} of a sweet, frothy red wine from this region has long tradition. In the Italian theater tradition of Commedia dell'arte, the <b>mask</b> <b>character</b> of Gianduja da Gioan d'laduja or Giovanni of the Jug, which represented Turin and Piedmont is said to have preferred Brachetto d'Acqui among all others. Even prior, in the times of Ancient Rome, writers were describing a wine Gallia Cisalpina (northern Italy) known as vinum acquense (wine of the Acqui) that was a favorite among patricians with its sweet flavors and high aromatics. Legend also had it that Julius Caesar and Marc Antony presented Cleopatra several gourds of vinum acquense as a gift. Also, according to legend, the Pharaoh believed that the wine had the power to unleash the passions of her lovers.|$|E

He has a beautiful wife, Tonya, and a best friend, Jorge. On a tropical island, Loki is relaxing until Odin confronts him and orders his son to find the mask. Loki asks Odin to help him, but Odin tells Loki that this is his mess and he has to clean it up. Later that night, Tim puts on the mask for a Halloween party, transforming into a party animal similar to the <b>mask</b> <b>character</b> from the first film. When the company party turns out to be a bore, Tim uses his mask powers to perform a remix of [...] "Can't Take My Eyes Off You", making the party a success, and giving Tim's boss the idea for a new cartoon, resulting in his promotion the next day.|$|E

40|$|This {{pilot project}} {{demonstrates}} how Henderson's (2005) method of mask and clown can be effectively {{adapted to the}} practice of drama therapy through a practical application with 10 adolescent high school students in a brief drama therapy series. Research was conducted in a phenomenological framework to reveal the authentic meaning of the experience of the participants in their own narrative and arts-based documentation. Narrative data was collected from participant-observer notes, participants' journals, responses to a questionnaire, and video transcription. Arts-based data was collected from photographs and film footage of the mask-making and <b>mask</b> <b>character</b> exploration, clown discovery, and the participants' public clown performance. Qualitative coding of the data, analysis of the outcome, implications for clinical practice, and suggestions for further research, are presented...|$|E
40|$|Recent deep {{learning}} models have demonstrated strong capabilities for classifying text and non-text components in natural images. They extract a high-level feature computed globally from a whole image component (patch), where the cluttered background information may dominate true text {{features in the}} deep representation. This leads to less discriminative power and poorer robustness. In this work, we present a new system for scene text detection by proposing a novel Text-Attentional Convolutional Neural Network (Text-CNN) that particularly focuses on extracting text-related regions and features from the image components. We develop a new learning mechanism to train the Text-CNN with multi-level and rich supervised information, including text region <b>mask,</b> <b>character</b> label, and binary text/nontext information. The rich supervision information enables the Text-CNN with a strong capability for discriminating ambiguous texts, and also increases its robustness against complicated background components. The training process is formulated as a multi-task learning problem, where low-level supervised information greatly facilitates main task of text/non-text classification. In addition, a powerful low-level detector called Contrast- Enhancement Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (CE-MSERs) is developed, which extends the widely-used MSERs by enhancing intensity contrast between text patterns and background. This allows it to detect highly challenging text patterns, resulting in a higher recall. Our approach achieved promising results on the ICDAR 2013 dataset, with a F-measure of 0. 82, improving the state-of-the-art results substantially.

Playing a <b>masked</b> <b>character</b> he was able to work two separate characters, the heel (wrestling term for those that play the [...] "bad guy" [...] role) Mr. X and the face ("Good guy") character Cyclone Mackey without the public being aware that they were one and the same. In 1940 Mackey was unmasked, taking off the Mr. X mask as a result of losing a match to Gil LaCross and Paul Orth. After he was unmasked he resumed using the Cyclone Mackey ring name.|$|R
