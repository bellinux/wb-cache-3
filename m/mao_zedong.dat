5|$|As the Cultural Revolution {{erupted in}} 1966, Chairman <b>Mao</b> <b>Zedong</b> {{called for the}} {{destruction}} of the Four Olds, and teenage Red Guards rampaged through people's homes to destroy relics of pre-Communist China.

5|$|After <b>Mao</b> <b>Zedong</b> purged Peng in 1959, Mao {{appointed}} Marshal He Long to {{the head}} of an office to investigate Peng's past in order to find additional reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E

5|$|In February 1972, Nixon {{announced}} a stunning rapprochement with Mao's China by traveling to Beijing and meeting with <b>Mao</b> <b>Zedong</b> and Zhou Enlai.

5|$|Sun Tzu's Art of War has {{influenced}} many notable figures.

The work strongly influenced Mao's writings about guerrilla warfare, which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.|$|E

Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, and most other senior CCP members present quickly agreed, and it {{was removed from the}} final version of the 1956 Party Constitution. At the Congress, Peng was re-appointed to the Politburo and as a full member of the Central Committee.|$|E

5|$|The {{early life}} of Chinese revolutionary and {{politician}} <b>Mao</b> <b>Zedong</b> covered the first 27 {{years of his}} life, from 1893 to 1919. Born in Shaoshanchong, Shaoshan in Hunan province, Mao grew up {{as the son of}} Mao Yichang, a wealthy farmer and landowner. Sent to the local Shaoshan Primary School, Mao was brought up in an environment of Confucianism, but reacted against this from an early age, developing political ideas from modern literature.

5|$|Alarmed by {{the rapid}} {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's Chairman <b>Mao</b> <b>Zedong</b> ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts {{on the ability of}} the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces. Under strict secrecy, the PVA entered Korea on 19 October.|$|E
