Because the Keduang river flow enters Wonogiri reservoir, this river is chosen to make the flood disaster controlling in Solo area runs smoothly. This research used Nakayasu method. The data needed was the data of rainfall for 1999 - 2000 period viewed from repeated term flow rate compared with the 2 -days annually and <b>monthly</b> <b>flood</b> flow rates so that the potential flood can be detected. In writing this final project, the result of data and calculation of flood flow rate based on the repeated terms 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 1000 were as follows: 388. 856 m 3 /s, 541. 874 m 3 /s, 690. 347 m 3 /s, 851. 048 m 3 /s, 1195. 229 m 3 /s, 1509. 666 m 3 /s, 1904. 774 m 3 /s, and 3254. 336 m 3 /s.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a methodological {{approach}} based on a comparative analysis of floods that occurred in a wide region {{over a long period}} and the climatic data characterising the same period, focusing on the climate trend. The method simplifies the comparative analysis of several time series by defining some indexes (e. g. the monthly, bi-monthly, and [...] . m-monthly indexes of precipitation, temperature, wet days and precipitation intensity and the <b>monthly</b> <b>flood</b> number) {{that can be used to}} study phenomena such as floods that are characterised by spatial and temporal variability. The analysis was used to investigate the potential effect of climate variation on the damaging floods trend. The approach was tested for the Calabria region (Italy) using historical flood and climatic data from 1880 to 2007. The results showed that the number of floods was correlated with the monthly indexes of precipitation, wet days, and daily precipitation intensity. The following trends were recognised: decreasing precipitation and wet days, almost constant precipitation intensity, increasing temperature, and linearly increasing floods. A second-order polynomial trend analysis showed a slight decrease in floods since the seventies, which might be explained by the favourable climatic conditions during the period and/or the effect of increasing awareness of flood vulnerability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Anticipated future {{temperature}} {{changes in}} the mountainous U. S. Pacific Northwest will cause reduced spring snow pack, earlier melt, earlier spring peak flow and lower summer flow in transient rain-snow and snowmelt dominant river basins. In the context of managed flood control, these systematic changes are likely to disrupt the balance between flood control and reservoir refill in existing reservoir systems. To adapt to these hydrologic changes, refill timing and evacuation requirements for flood control need to be modified. This work poses a significant systems engineering problem, especially for large, multiobjective water systems. An existing optimization/ simulation procedure is refined for rebalancing flood control and refill objectives for the Columbia River Basin for anticipated global warming. To calibrate the optimization model for the 20 th century flow, the objective function is tuned to reproduce the current reliability of reservoir refill, while providing comparable levels of flood control to those produced by current flood control practices. After the optimization model is calibrated using the 20 th century flow the same objective function is used to develop flood control curves for a global warming scenario which assumes an approximately 2 °C increase in air temperature. Robust decreases in system storage deficits are simulated for the climate change scenario when optimized flood rule curves replace the current flood control curves, without increasing <b>monthly</b> <b>flood</b> risks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Chobe River, {{characterized}} by an un-usual flood pulsing regime and shared between Botswana and Namibia, {{lies at the heart}} of the world’s largest transfrontier conservation area (the Kavango– Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area). Signifi-cant ecological changes and vegetation conversions are occurring along its floodplains. Various scenarios for agricultural and urban water use are currently being proposed by the government of Botswana. However, the understanding of the river’s annual flow regime and timing of the relative contributions of water from three different sources is relatively poor. In light of past and future climate change and variabil-ity, this means that allocating water between ecologi-cal flows and economic and domestic uses will become increasingly challenging. We reconstruct the inundation history in this basin to help ease this chal-lenge. This paper presents a spatiotemporal approach to estimate the contribution of water from various sources and the magnitude of changes in the flooding extent in the basin between 1985 and 2010. We used time series analysis of bimonthly NOAA AVHRR and NASA MODIS data and climatologic and hydrologic records to determine the flooding timing and extent. The results indicate that between 12 and 62 % of the basin is flooded on an annual basis and that the spatial extent of the flooding varies throughout the year as a function of the timing of peak discharge in two larger basins. A 30 -year trend analysis indicates a consistent decline in the average <b>monthly</b> <b>flooded</b> area in the basin. The results may prove useful in future water utilization feasibility studies, in determining measures for protecting ecological flows and levels, and in eco-system dynamics studies in the context of current and future climate change and variability...|$|R
40|$|Floodplain forests, {{namely the}} Várzea and Igapó, cover {{an area of}} more than 97 000 km 2. A key factor for their {{function}} and diversity is annual flooding. Increasing air temperature and higher precipitation variability caused by climate change are expected to shift the flooding regime during this century, and thereby impact floodplain ecosystems, their biodiversity and riverine ecosystem services. To assess the {{effects of climate change}} on the flooding regime, we use the Dynamic Global Vegetation and Hydrology Model LPJmL, enhanced by a scheme that realistically simulates <b>monthly</b> <b>flooded</b> area. Simulation results of discharge and inundation under contemporary conditions compare well against site-level measurements and observations. The changes of calculated inundation duration and area under climate change projections from 24 IPCC AR 4 climate models differ regionally {{towards the end of the}} 21 st century. In all, 70 % of the 24 climate projections agree on an increase of flooded area in about one third of the basin. Inundation duration increases dramatically by on average three months in western and around one month in eastern Amazonia. The time of high- and low-water peak shifts by up to three months. Additionally, we find a decrease in the number of extremely dry years and in the probability of the occurrence of three consecutive extremely dry years. The total number of extremely wet years does not change drastically but the probability of three consecutive extremely wet years decreases by up to 30 % in the east and increases by up to 25 % in the west. These changes implicate significant shifts in regional vegetation and climate, and will dramatically alter carbon and water cycles...|$|R

Over the GRACE record length, instances of repeated maxima in water storage anomaly that fall short of variable maxima in cumulative precipitation suggest an effective storage capacity for a given region, beyond which additional precipitation must be met by marked increases in runoff or evaporation. These saturation periods indicate the possible transition to a flood-prone situation.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} the role of {{uncertainty}} in climate change impact studies, with particular focus on the impacts of climate change on UK flooding. Methods are developed to quantify the uncertainty associated with climate variability, hydrological model parameters and flood frequency estimation. Each is evaluated independently, before being combined to assess {{the relative importance of}} the different sources of uncertainty in the ‘top down’ impact study framework over multiple time horizons. The uncertainty from climate variability is addressed through the creation of a resampling methodology to be applied to global climate model outputs. Through resampling model precipitation, the direction of change for both mean <b>monthly</b> flows and <b>flood</b> quantiles are found to be uncertain with large possible ranges. Hydrological model parameter uncertainty is quantified using Monte Carlo methods to sample the model parameter space. Through sensitivity experiments, individual hydrological model parameters are shown to influence the magnitude of simulated flood quantile changes.

40|$|Abstract The {{response}} of monthly 7 -day low flow, monthly instantaneous peak flow, and <b>monthly</b> frequency of <b>flood</b> events to El Nino and La Nina episodes is investigated for 18 rivers that represent a {{diverse range of}} climatic types throughout New Zealand. A significant positive or negative deviation from the long-term average was observed in over half the possible combinations of river, streamflow index, and type of ENSO episode; significant deviations were most frequent {{in the case of}} low flow, especially during La Nina episodes. Patterns of streamflow response differ widely between rivers, and the {{response of}} a given river to individual ENSO episodes is very variable. The patterns of streamflow response to ENSO are consistent to some extent with the climatic effects of ENSO already identified by meteorologists. Two core regions can be defined in which streamflow tends to respond in the same way. These are in the northeast of the North Island, and in the axial ranges of the South Island, where there are significant effects of ENSO on the frequency and duration of rain-bearing northeasterly and westerly winds respectively. The patterns of response strongly reflect topography, and the exposur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{tradeoffs}} between floodplain {{agriculture and fisheries}} production in the Brahmaputra river basin of Bangladesh, where both sectors are simultaneously affected by floodplain development policies. Current policies primarily include structural changes in the floodplain {{in the form of}} flood control, drainage and irrigation projects. Such development programs typically ignore the effects on floodplain fisheries, which is an important natural resource sector and a source of subsistence for the rural poor. This paper develops a floodplain land-use model, where net returns to agriculture and fisheries are jointly maximized. Special attention is paid to the tradeoffs between agriculture and fisheries production and the dynamics of the fishery. The model accounts explicitly for the effect of floodplain area on fisheries production. Productivity {{is a function of the}} flood land type, which is based on the average <b>monthly</b> depth of <b>flooding.</b> Numerical results from solving a simple version of the model are presented. These early results show that a combination of agriculture and fisheries production in the floodplain provides higher returns than agriculture production alone. This has implications for floodplain management policies, which to date have the stated goal of increasing agricultural productivity only. The effects of floodplain development policies on both agriculture and fisheries need to be studied in further detail to understand the long-term implications of such policies...|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{the impact}} of climate change on streamflow is {{critical}} to understanding the changes to water resources and to improve water resource management. The use of hydrological models is a common practice to quantify and assess water resources in such situations. In this study, two hydrological models with different structures, e. g., a physically-based distributed model Liuxihe (LXH) and a lumped conceptual model Xinanjiang (XAJ) are employed to simulate the daily runoff in the Xijiang basin in South China, under historical (1964 – 2013) and future (2014 – 2099) climate conditions. The future climate series are downscaled from a global climate model (Beijing Climate Centre-Climate System Model, BCC-CSM version 1. 1) by a high-resolution regional climate model under two representative concentration pathways—RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5. The hydrological responses to climate change via the two rainfall–runoff models with different mathematical structures are compared, {{in relation to the}} uncertainties in hydrology and meteorology. It is found that the two rainfall–runoff models successfully simulate the historical runoff for the Xijiang basin, with a daily runoff Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0. 80 for the LXH model and 0. 89 for the XAJ model. The characteristics of high flow in the future are also analysed including their frequency (magnitude–return-period relationship). It shows that the distributed model could produce more streamflow and peak flow than the lumped model under the climate change scenarios. However the difference of the impact from the two climate scenarios is marginal on median <b>monthly</b> streamflow. The <b>flood</b> frequency analysis under climate change suggests that flood magnitudes in the future will be more severe than the historical floods with the same return period. Overall, the study reveals how uncertain it can be to quantify water resources with two different but well calibrated hydrological models...|$|R

40|$|Traditional flood-frequency {{techniques}} {{are based on}} the assumption that the observed flood record represents a sample that has been drawn from a single climatically homogeneous population of floods. A hydroclimatic approach was used to evaluate this assumption by identifying the circulation patterns and atmospheric flood-generating mechanisms which control the temporal and spatial variability of <b>flooding.</b> Mean <b>monthly</b> discharges and instantaneous peak flows of the partial duration series were analyzed for thirty gaging stations in the climatically sensitive, semiarid, Gila River basin for the period 1950 to 1980. Correlation fields and composite maps were constructed to define the relationship between 700 mb height circulation anomalies and mean <b>monthly</b> streamflow. Individual <b>flood</b> events were linked to climate by analyzing daily synoptic weather maps and classifying each flood event into one of eight hydroclimatic categories on the basis of the atmospheric mechanisms which generated each flow. The analysis demonstrated that floods and anomalously high streamflow in the Gila River basin originate from a variety of atmospheric processes which vary spatially, seasonally, and from year-to-year. The mechanisms most important for generating floods included winter fronts, cutoff lows, tropical storms, snowmelt, and widespread and localized summer monsoon-related circulation patterns. When flood discharges were grouped into hydroclimatically homogeneous categories, histogram plots of their frequency distributions exhibited means and variances that differed from those of the overall frequency distribution of the entire flood series. The means of the discharges generated by frontal precipitation and tropical storms tended to plot above the mean of the overall series, while the means of floods generated by snowmelt tended to plot below the overall mean. Flood estimates computed from a series containing mixed distributions were not the same as flood estimates computed from climatically homogeneous subsets of the same series. These results have implications for traditional flood-frequency analysis and other stochastic methods of analyzing hydrologic time series. The hydroclimatically-defined subgroups in the flood series of the Gila River basin indicate that nonhomogeneity and nonstationarity can be imparted to a hydrologic time series by differing atmospheric mechanisms alone...|$|R
40|$|Long-term hydrologic records provide crucial {{reference}} baselines {{of natural}} variability {{that can be}} used to evaluate potential changes in hydrologic regimes and their impacts. However, there is a dearth of studies of the hydrologic regimes for tropical drylands where intraseasonal and interannual variability in magnitude and frequency of precipitation are extreme. Here, we sought to identify the main hydroclimatic determinants of the strongly episodic flood regime of a large catchment in the semi-arid, subtropical northwest of Australia and to establish the background of hydrologic variability for the region over the last century. We used a monthly sequence of satellite images to quantify surface water expression on the Fortescue Marsh, the largest water feature of inland northwest Australia, from 1988 to 2012. We used this sequence together with instrumental rainfall data to build a statistical model with multiple linear regression and reconstruct <b>monthly</b> history of <b>floods</b> and droughts since 1912. We found that severe and intense regional rainfall events, as well as the sequence of recharge events both within and between years, determine surface water expression on the floodplain (i. e. total rainfall, number of rain days and carried-over inundated area; R 2 adj = 0. 79; p value E RMSP = 56 km 2). The most severe reconstructed inundation over the last century was in March 2000 (1000 km 2), which is less than the 1300 km 2 area required to overflow to the adjacent catchment. The Fortescue Marsh was completely dry for 32 % of all years, for periods of up to four consecutive years. Extremely wet years (seven of the 100 years) caused the Marsh to remain inundated for up to 12 months; only 25 % of years (9 % of all months) had floods of greater than 300 km 2. The prolonged, severe and consecutive yearly inundations between 1999 and 2006 were unprecedented compared to the last century. While there is high inter-annual variability in the system, if the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events for the region were to increase (or be similar to 1999 – 2006), surface water on the Marsh will become more persistent, in turn impacting its structure and functioning as a wetland...|$|R
