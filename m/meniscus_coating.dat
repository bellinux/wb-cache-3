40|$|A two-roll {{apparatus}} is used {{to explore}} experimentally the detailed fluid mechanics of meniscus roll coating in which inlets are starved and flow rates are small. Both forward and reverse modes of operation (with contra- and co-rotating rolls) are investigated using optical sectioning combined with dye injection and particle imaging techniques. That part of parameter space where <b>meniscus</b> <b>coating</b> occurs is identied by varying the roll separation and roll speeds and hence flow rate and capillary number. Key features of the flow structures identied in the forward mode include two large eddies (each with saddle point, separatrix and sub-eddies), a primary fluid transfer jet {{and the existence of}} two critical flow rates associated with the switching-on of a second fluid transfer jet and the switching-o of the primary transfer jet followed by a change in the flow structure. In the reverse mode, the key features are a single large eddy consisting of two sub-eddies, a saddle point and separatrix, a primary fluid transfer jet and once again two critical flow rates. These correspond to (i) the switching-on of a secondary transfer jet and (ii) the disappearance of a saddle point at the nip resulting in the merger of the primary and secondary transfer jets. Measurements of lm thickness and meniscus location made over a range of speed ratios and capillary numbers are compared with theoretical predictions. A plate{roll apparatus {{is used to}} conrm the presence, for very small flow rates, of a sub-ambient, almost linear, pressure prole across the bead. Investigated also is the transition from inlet-starved to fully flooded roll coating as flow rate is increased and the changes in flow structure and pressure prole are observed. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} account of an {{extensive}} experimental investigation of the operation of a twin roll coater. Two distinct modes of operation are identified: Classical (fullyflooded inlet) and Meniscus (ultra-starved inlet). The former {{has been the subject}} of investigation for a number of years; the latter is less well known and would appear to have escaped the attention of the Coating Community at large prior to the research work reported here being carried out. A detailed description of how the key features of an industrial roll coater can be reproduced using a piece of simple but well designed experimental apparatus, which encapsulates all the necessary elements for an in-depth study of the flow, is presented. Various methods are used to visualise the flow. These include dye injection and novel computerised particle tracking techniques, coupled with state-of-the-art image processing and High Speed Video photography. Experiments reveal that the flow associated with the Classical mode of operation is essentially one-dimensional throughout the nip; <b>Meniscus</b> <b>coating</b> flow, on the other hand, is uniquely two-dimensional, containing large vortical structures. Also the pressure distributions are found to be quite distinct. A fully-flooded nip results in a pressure profile which exhibits a characteristic maximum and minimum, while an ultra-starved nip produces one which is linear and entirely sub-ambient. The transformation of the flow from one mode of operation to the other is then considered, a key feature of which is the behaviour of the upstream free surface which movesin to a minimum point and then out again as the flux is reduced, giving a non-singular result, that is, there are two non-dimensional values of the flux for each free surface position. Finally, the subject of instability in roll coating is addressed, for both the Classical and Meniscus regimes. A number of new instabilities were observed using High Speed Video photography and tentative explanations for their occurrence are given...|$|E
40|$|The <b>meniscus</b> {{chemical}} <b>coating</b> technology {{becomes a}} very promising new chemical thin-film coating technology after traditional coating {{technologies such as}} spin-coating and spray coating due to its merits of large area, low-cost and high efficiency. To {{meet the requirements of}} one national major projects on the meter-scale chemical thin film coating of optical component surface, based on the systematical research of the <b>meniscus</b> chemical film <b>coating</b> principal, static and dynamic gluing experiments were respectively conducted, and the relationships among the gluing pressure, the gap between substrate and slit, the material hydrophobicity and the morphology of meniscus were analyzed, then the fine tuning of the meniscus could be achieved and equipment based on the meniscus chemical thin film coating technology was developed. The coating uniformity of photo-resist was realized using this equipment on the glass substrate sizing 1400 mm× 420 mm, making overall coating thickness error less than 4 % and satisfying coating requirements of meter-scale chemical precision thin film coating of optical component surface. © 2017, Science Press.

40|$|Organic {{thin film}} {{transistors}} (OTFTs) based on single crystalline thin films of organic semiconductors have seen considerable {{development in the}} recent years. The most successful method for the fabrication of single crystalline films are solution-based <b>meniscus</b> guided <b>coating</b> techniques such as dip-coating, solution shearing or zone casting. These upscalable methods enable rapid and efficient film formation without additional processing steps. The single-crystalline film quality {{is strongly dependent on}} solvent choice, substrate temperature and coating speed. So far, however, process optimization has been conducted by trial and error methods, involving, for example, the variation of coating speeds over several orders of magnitude. Through a systematic study of solvent phase change dynamics in the meniscus region, we develop a theoretical framework that links the optimal coating speed to the solvent choice and the substrate temperature. In this way, we can accurately predict an optimal processing window, enabling fast process optimization. Our approach is verified through systematic OTFT fabrication based on films grown with different semiconductors, solvents and substrate temperatures. The use of best predicted coating speeds delivers state of the art devices. In the case of C 8 BTBT, OTFTs show well-behaved characteristics with mobilities up to 7 cm 2 /Vs and onset voltages close to 0 V. Our approach also explains well optimal recipes published in the literature. This route considerably accelerates parameter screening for all <b>meniscus</b> guided <b>coating</b> techniques and unveils the physics of single crystalline film formation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{selective}} deposition of a Newtonian liquid on the hydrophilic domains of chemically patterned substrates. We present experiments and numerical simulations of the dip-coating and self-metered die-coating of compact, geometrically convex patterns such as squares and diamonds. The coating of such patterns is intrinsically an instationary process. Nevertheless, the maximum film thickness entrained on diamonds {{that are either}} much smaller or larger than the lengthscale governing the coating process follows the theoretical predictions derived for steady-state coating of either narrow hydrophilic stripes or chemically homogeneous surfaces. The transition between these two regimes {{is determined by the}} ratio of the pattern dimensions and the characteristic length of the reservoir meniscus, i. e. the capillary length for dip-coating and the die-gap for die-coating processes. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eWhile the film thickness entrained on diamonds scales with the coating speed as a powerlaw, the entrained thickness on squares with sides oriented parallel and perpendicular to the coating direction appears to saturate for small coating speeds. This influence of the azimuthal pattern orientation is related to the capillary break-up of the <b>coating</b> <b>meniscus.</b> Residual satellite droplets observed underneath the hydrophilic patterns after coating are a consequence either of the break-up or the subsequent retraction of the <b>coating</b> <b>meniscus...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{investigations into}} a number of coating processes using experimental, analytical and computational techniques. The first problem, considered experimentally, is that of reverse roll coating with a liquid reservoir positioned directly above horizontally aligned rollers. Measurements of the film thickness {{as a function of the}} height of fluid in the reservoir and speed ratio are presented. When the wetting line is located downstream of the nip, either a decrease in the height of the associated hydrostatic head or an increase in the speed ratio causes a reduction in the thickness of the outgoing film. However, when the wetting line is located upstream of the nip the opposite is found to be true. The bead-break instability in forward <b>meniscus</b> <b>coating</b> is considered both experimentally and analytically. Agreement between predictions from a simple mathematical model of the stable bead and experimentally determined meniscus positions is seen to be excellent. A perturbation hypothesis is used to predict the onset of the bead-break instability, at which the upstream meniscus accelerates rapidly towards the downstream one, so the two collide and the bead collapses. The results from the model compare well with experiments. An outline of a method for using the bead-break instability as a design criterion is also presented. Typically in a slot, blade or knife coater the downstream meniscus is assumed to pin at a corner of the coating device. In chapter 5, a series of experiments and a corresponding computational study, are presented which illustrate that the meniscus can advance up the face of such coating devices (in this case a roll-flat plate system). Reducing the corner angle is seen to reduce the size of the climb region and the associated recirculation at this point at the downstream meniscus. It is also shown that the meniscus can detach from the corner and retreat into the gap, which can in turn give rise to the ribbing instability. An offset gravure coating arrangement is considered in chapter 6. The coating arrangement is split into two areas of study - the offset gravure nip and the kiss coating bead. An experimental investigation of the offset nip with the two rolls vertically aligned and running at the same speed in forward mode reveals two ways in which the metered film thickness can be influenced. Either increasing the nip force by pressing the two rolls together or decreasing the roll speeds causes a reduction in the metered film thickness. At higher speeds the metered film thickness is observed to asymptote to a limiting value, the value of which depends on the gravure pattern. The reverse mode kiss coating bead operating at speed ratios greater than one is also investigated. Experiments reveal that under these conditions, all the fluid is transferred from the roll surface to the web and the two make contact due to the generation of a sub-ambient pressure field within the bead. Two models based on lubrication theory are derived, one assuming an infinitely tensioned web and a second that incorporates the effect of web flexibility. The latter is found to give much better agreement with the experimental data. Finally a perturbation hypothesis is applied to these to models in order to predict the onset of the ribbing instability, both of which are found to give reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the results of a systematic experimental investigation of reverse mode direct gravure coating is reported, where the web runs directly over a gravure roll surface. This wide ranging parametric study illustrates the effect of the operating parameters on the final film thickness. Key findings are that speed ratio, fluid properties and cell shape and size can significantly influence the final film thickness. For a fixed roll speed it is observed that as the web speed is increased the gravure bead becomes unstable. This results in streaking on the web, and gives an upper limit to the speed ratio. ...|$|E
40|$|Continuous convective-sedimentation {{assembly}} (CCSA) is {{a deposition}} method that constantly supplies the coating suspension to the <b>meniscus</b> behind the <b>coating</b> knife by inline injection, allowing for steady-state deposition of ordered colloids (which may include particles or cells or live cell-particle blends) by water evaporation. The constant inflow of suspended particles available for transport to the drying front yields colloidal arrays with significantly larger surface areas than previously described and thus expands {{the ability of}} convective assembly to deposit monolayers or very thin films of multiple sizes of particles on large surfaces. Using sulfated polystyrene microspheres as a model system, this study shows how tunable process parameters, namely particle concentration, fluid sonication, and fluid density, influence coating homogeneity when the meniscus is continuously supplied. Fluid density and fluid flow-path sonication affect particle sedimentation and distribution. Coating microstructure, analyzed in terms of void space, does not vary significantly with relative humidity or suspended particle concentration. This study evaluated two configurations of the continuous convective assembly method in terms of ability to control coating microstructure by varying the number of suspended polymer particles available for transport to the coating drying front through variations in the meniscus volume...|$|R
40|$|In multiple-roll coaters thin liquid {{films are}} {{transferred}} from roll to roll {{by means of}} liquid ‘beads’ which occupy the small gaps between adjacent rolls. Double-Film-Fed (DFF) beads are those which feature two ingoing films {{instead of the usual}} one, and arise in the intermediate stages of certain types of roll coater. One of the ingoing films, h 1, is supplied from the previous inter-roll gap while the other, h 2, ‘returns’ from the subsequent gap. Such a flow is investigated here under the conditions of low flow rate, small capillary number and negligible gravity and inertia, using lubrication theory and finite element analysis. The thickness of film h 1 is fixed independently, while that of h 2 is specified as a fraction, [zeta], of the film output on the same roll. This simple approach allows a degree of feedback between the output and input of the bead, and enables one to simulate different conditions in the subsequent gap. Predictions of outgoing film thicknesses made using the two models agree extremely well and show that, for each value of [zeta] < 1, one outgoing film thickness decreases monotonically with speed ratio, S, while the other features a maximum. Good agreement is also seen in the pressure profiles, which are entirely sub-ambient in keeping with the small capillary number conditions. The finite element solutions reveal that in the ‘zero-flux’ case (when [zeta] = 1) the flow structures are very similar to those seen in an idealized cavity problem. In the more general ([zeta] < 1) situation, as in single-film-fed <b>meniscus</b> roll <b>coating,</b> several liquid transfer-jets occur by which liquid is conveyed through the bead from one roll to the other. The lubrication model is used to calculate several critical flow rates at which the flow is transformed, and it is shown that when the total dimensionless flow rate through the bead exceeds 1 / 3, the downstream flow structure is independent of the relative sizes of the ingoing films...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} understand the atomization process in the specialized printing method which consists of the high frequency oscillating motion of a needle and a micro air jet. Highly viscous liquids, such as glycerin and acrylic paint were successfully printed with this printing method within the line width of 1 mm. High-speed imaging technique was used to observe the evolution and mechanical perturbation of a liquid <b>meniscus</b> which is <b>coated</b> on the oscillating needle. Various parameters which affect print patterns were identified to understand and control the atomization process occurring at the oscillating needle. For time-controlled atomization or printing, a pulse air jet system was implemented to print liquids only when it is demanded, and it was shown that the period of atomization can be controlled by the air jet on-and-off. The inertial coating process was studied to explain the dynamic meniscus profile, compared with static meniscus. Kinematic analysis of the needle motion was performed, which shows that the needle motion is a sinusoidal one undergoing inertial coating. Liquid sheet breakup mechanism {{in the presence of}} the air stream was also studied in conjunction with the principle of the air- blast atomizer. Performing as a printing device or a droplet generator, the reciprocating needle printing method studied here can be applied to printing or coating processes which utilize high viscosity media. by Heejin Lee.
