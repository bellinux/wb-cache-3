5|$|In prokaryotes endomembranes are rare, {{although}} in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded {{and most of}} the cell cytoplasm is filled with layers of light-gathering membrane.

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Bede's work, {{because it was so}} widely copied, {{discouraged}} others from writing histories and <b>may</b> <b>even</b> have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.|$|E

5|$|The {{spectral}} {{properties of}} the halo ring {{are different from the}} main ring. The flux distribution in the range 0.5–2.5μm is flatter than in the main ring; the halo is not red and <b>may</b> <b>even</b> be blue.|$|E
5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration {{can be very}} detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow one party to own {{the right to use}} a mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the other party owns the right to use the same mark everywhere else in the country. It <b>may</b> <b>even</b> divide the rights to use a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E

5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish <b>may</b> <b>even</b> help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is that male orangutans display sexual attraction to human women, and <b>may</b> <b>even</b> forcibly copulate with them. The only serious, but anecdotal, report {{of such an}} incident taking place, is primatologist Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan. This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity and may have suffered from a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it <b>may</b> <b>even</b> be reduced to a small shrub.|$|E

5|$|Evidence from {{daughter}} {{products of}} short-lived radioactive isotopes {{shows that a}} nearby supernova helped determine {{the composition of the}} Solar System 4.5billion years ago, and <b>may</b> <b>even</b> have triggered the formation of this system. Supernova production of heavy elements over astronomic periods of time ultimately made the chemistry of life on Earth possible.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{responsible}} for several unique volcanological objects. Small volcanic particles are carried and formed by the wind, chilling quickly into teardrop-shaped glassy fragments known as Pele's tears (after Pele, the Hawaiian volcano deity). During especially high winds these chunks <b>may</b> <b>even</b> {{take the form of}} long drawn-out strands, known as Pele's hair. Sometimes basalt aerates into reticulite, the lowest density rock type on earth.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stars are}} between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. Some stars <b>may</b> <b>even</b> {{be close to}} 13.8 billion years old—the {{observed}} age of the universe. The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years old. (Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star does not conflict with {{the age of the}} Universe, determined by the Planck satellite as 13.799 ± 0.021).|$|E

5|$|On {{the basis}} of Zenobia's Palmyrene name, Bat Zabbai, her father may have been called Zabbai; alternatively, Zabbai {{may have been the}} name of a more distant ancestor.

5|$|Presumably as a {{consequence}} of the Roman advance, various hill forts such as Dun Mor in Perthshire, which had been abandoned by the natives long ago, were re-occupied.

5|$|Since its {{original}} discovery in the rabbit hippocampus, LTP {{has been observed}} {{in a variety of}} other neural structures, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, amygdala, and many others.

5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{was probably}} not discovered by Euclid, who compiled results from earlier mathematicians in his Elements. The mathematician and historian B. L. van der Waerden suggests that Book VII derives from a textbook on number theory written by mathematicians {{in the school of}} Pythagoras. The algorithm was probably known by Eudoxus of Cnidus (about 375 BC). The algorithm <b>may</b> <b>even</b> pre-date Eudoxus, judging from the use of the technical term ἀνθυφαίρεσις (anthyphairesis, reciprocal subtraction) in works by Euclid and Aristotle.|$|E
5|$|The fictionalized {{character}} {{was created by}} a German writer, scientist, and con artist, Rudolf Erich Raspe. Raspe probably met Hieronymus von Münchhausen while studying at the University of Göttingen, and <b>may</b> <b>even</b> {{have been invited to}} dine with him at the mansion at Bodenwerder. Raspe's later career mixed writing and scientific scholarship with theft and swindling; when the German police issued advertisements for his arrest in 1775, he fled continental Europe and settled in England.|$|E
5|$|The genus Gymnogyps is {{an example}} of a relict distribution. During the Pleistocene epoch, this genus was {{widespread}} across the Americas. From fossils, the Floridan Gymnogyps kofordi from the Early Pleistocene and the Peruvian Gymnogyps howardae from the Late Pleistocene have been described. A condor found in Late Pleistocene deposits on Cuba was initially described as Antillovultur varonai, but has since been recognized as another member of Gymnogyps, Gymnogyps varonai. It <b>may</b> <b>even</b> have derived from a founder population of California condors.|$|E
