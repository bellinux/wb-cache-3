40|$|Screen {{printing}}, {{unlike other}} printing processes, requires ink {{to be pushed}} through the image carrier to the substrate. When the <b>mesh</b> <b>threads</b> and their intersections cross the image area, they act as obstructions to the ink flow. In large image areas, the effect of mesh interference is minimal. In fine detail screen printing, mesh interference is a primary cause of poor or inaccurate resolution. The trend in screen printing has been toward more and finer fine line, halftone and four-color process printing. Researching methods to minimize mesh interference will enable screen printers to gain greater control over the printing process and better utilize technologies currently available for fine detail reproduction. Previous experiments had shown that the angle of a fine line image relative to the <b>mesh</b> <b>threads</b> will {{have an effect on}} resolution quality. This thesis developed a theoretical model for hypothesizing that image angle may also affect resolution in halftone screen printing. A fine line test image was developed to attempt to reproduce the results of experiments indicating a critical angle exists for fine lines, and to determine if the direction of the squeegee motion is also a factor. Halftone gray scales screened at all of the common four-color and black and white reproduction angles, {{as well as at the}} aforementioned hypothesized fine line critical angle, were used to determine if image angle has an effect on reproduceable tonal range and on the accuracy of resolution in halftone screen printing. Exposure and squeegee conditions were optimized, and the test images were printed. Data on fine line and halftone resolution was collected and statistically analyzed to determine if image angle had an effect on the resolution. In all cases, angle was found to have an effect on image resolution. However, no one angle or small range of angles was found to provide significantly better resolution than another. In the fine line test, it appeared that a relationship does exist between image resolution and the direction of squeegee motion. This was not evident in the halftone resolution data. The halftone data, however, does indicate a relationship exists between loss of percent dot area and tonal range. Further investigation of these factors in screen printing is recommended...|$|R

50|$|These {{problems}} with gas lighting {{led to the}} rapid adoption of electric lighting. By 1881, the Savoy Theatre in London was using incandescent lighting.” As electric lighting was being introduced to theatre stages, people who still were using gas theatre lighting developed the gas mantle in 1885. “This was a beehive-shaped <b>mesh</b> of knitted <b>thread</b> impregnated with lime that, in miniature, converted the naked gas flame into in effect, a lime-light.” Electric lighting would slowly take over theatre lighting. In the twentieth century, electric lighting would lead to even better and safer theater productions.

50|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} an all-fabric inflatable aircraft was based on Taylor McDaniel inflatable rubber glider experiments in 1931. Designed and built in only 12 weeks, the Goodyear Inflatoplane was built in 1956, {{with the idea that}} it could be used by the military as a rescue plane to be dropped in a hardened container behind enemy lines. The 44 cubic ft (1.25 cubic meter) container could also be transported by truck, jeep trailer or aircraft. The inflatable surface of this aircraft was actually a sandwich of two rubber-type materials connected by a <b>mesh</b> of nylon <b>threads,</b> forming an I-beam. When the nylon was exposed to air, it absorbed and repelled water as it stiffened, giving the aircraft its shape and rigidity. Structural integrity was retained in flight with forced air being continually circulated by the aircraft's motor.|$|R

40|$|The {{printing}} plate and its characteristics {{in the conventional}} printing techniques {{have a significant impact}} on print quality and image appearance. In screen printing, a weave of screen mesh i. e. a number of threads per cm, is the most important characteristic of the {{printing plate}}, hence the most relevant factor which defines printing quality. Print quality itself is a complex term that includes desired colour reproduction and satisfactory reproduction of image elements. In this paper focus was centred upon the reproduction of text and basic image elements (lines and dot structure) when printing on non-absorbent and absorbent substrates with different screen thread counts. The image element analysis led to the conclusion that using <b>mesh</b> with higher <b>thread</b> count does not significantly improve the reproduction of image elements. However, it is a very important parameter for text reproduction since low thread count may result in poor readability...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} arose {{out of a}} desire to test the {{assumption}} that in order to obtain direct stencils with good edge definition, one either had to use fine screens or. If using a relatively coarse screen, apply multiple coatings of emulsion to the screen before making the stencil. Neither alternative seemed satisfactory, since the first did not allow optimal use of the scope of screens available, and the second entailed an expenditure of time and supplies that could possibly be shown to be unnecessary. It was therefore determined to carry on an experiment that would show whether direct stencils with good edge definition can be obtained on relatively coarse screens with only one, or at most two applications of emulsion. The experiment thus envisioned also provided an opportunity to observe the influence on two other factors on stencil edge definition, besides those of mesh count and emulsion thickness: namely, screen thread diameter and coater blade thick ness. What finally evolved was a three-factor, three-levelled factorial experiment, in which the variables under study were* screen <b>mesh</b> count, <b>thread</b> diameter and emulsion thick ness. The fourth factor came into play when the experiment was run once for emulsions applied with a thick-bladed coater, and once for those applied with a thin-bladed coater. The specific question under study was: in the direct stencil system, is there a difference in the quality of edge definition obtainable with variations in screen <b>mesh</b> count, screen <b>thread</b> diameter, coater blade thickness and the number of emulsion coatings applied? Eighteen screens were stretched expressly for the experiment, representing three different mesh counts and three different thread diameters for each mesh count. Each screen was prepared {{in such a way as}} to receive three stencils of varying thickness per screen. All stencils were exposed to a test target designed to allow for the observation of diagonal and parallel stencil edges (i. e., diagonal or parallel with relation to screen thread direction). After the stencils were made, they were visually inspected, and the data obtained thereby was subjected to an analysis of variance. The results obtained showed that of the four factors studied, mesh count was the only one that made a clear difference in the quality of stencil edge definition. What the experiment did not conclusively show was whether or not coater blade thickness had any influence on that quality. Nevertheless, what is perhaps of greater significance to the printer in Industry Is that the experiment did show that on a coarse screen a stencil with good parallel edge definition could be obtained with only one coating of emulsion (as one coating was defined in the experiment) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{classical}} reticello {{pattern is}} a small uniform <b>mesh</b> of white <b>threads</b> in clear glass, with a tiny air bubble in every mesh rectangle. To make an object in this pattern, the glassblower first uses white single-thread vetro a fili [...] canes to blow a cylindrical cup shape, twisting as he forms it so the canes are in a spiral, and using care not to totally smooth the inside ribbing that remains from the canes. Setting this cup aside (usually keeping it warm in a furnace, below its softening point), he then makes another closed cylinder in the same pattern, but twisted in the opposite direction, and retaining some of the ribbing on the cylinder’s outside. When this cylinder is the right size, the glassblower plunges it into the warm cup, without touching any of the sides until it is inserted all the way. Air is trapped in the spaces between the ribs of the two pieces, forming the uniformly spaced air bubbles. The piece may then be blown out and shaped as desired. The term reticello is often loosely applied to any criss-cross pattern, whether vetro a fili [...] or vetro a retorti , white or colored, and with or without air bubbles.|$|R
50|$|A {{landmark}} development {{came from}} Camillo Golgi who invented a silver staining technique in 1873 {{which he called}} la reazione nera (black reaction), but more popularly known as Golgi stain or Golgi method, in his honour. Using this technique nerve cells with their highly branched dendrites and axon could be clearly visualised against a yellow background. Unfortunately Golgi described the nervous system as a continuous single network, {{in support of a}} notion called reticular theory. It was reasonable at the time because under light microscope the nerve cells are merely a <b>mesh</b> of single <b>thread.</b> Santiago Ramón y Cajal started investigating nervous system in 1887 using Golgi stain. In the first issue of the Revista Trimestral de Histología Normal y Patológica (May, 1888) Cajal reported that the nerve cells were not continuous in the brain of birds. Cajal's discovery was the decisive evidence for the discontinuity of nervous system and the presence of large number of individual nerve cells. Golgi and Cajal were jointly awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, that resulted in a lasting conflicting ideas and controversies between the two scientists. The matter was finally resolved in 1950s with the development of electron microscopy by which it was unambiguously demonstrated that nerve cells were individual cells interconnected through synapses to form a nervous system, thereby validating the neuron theory.|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{coupling}} two bodies together and for transmitting torque from one body to another with mechanical timing and sequencing is reported. The mechanical timing and sequencing is handled {{so that the}} following criteria are met: (1) the bodies are handled in a safe manner and nothing floats loose in space, (2) electrical connectors are engaged {{as long as possible}} so that the internal processes can be monitored throughout by sensors, and (3) electrical and mechanical power and signals are coupled. The first body has a splined driver for providing the input torque. The second body has a threaded drive member capable of rotation and limited translation. The embedded drive member will mate with and fasten to the splined driver. The second body has an embedded bevel gear member capable of rotation and limited translation. This bevel gear member is coaxial with the threaded drive member. A compression spring provides a preload on the rotating threaded member, and a thrust bearing is used for limiting the translation of the bevel gear member so that when the bevel gear member reaches the upward limit of its translation the two bodies are fully coupled and the bevel gear member then rotates due to the input torque transmitted from the splined driver through the threaded drive member to the bevel gear member. An output bevel gear with an attached output drive shaft is embedded in the second body and <b>meshes</b> with the <b>threaded</b> rotating bevel gear member to transmit the input torque to the output drive shaft...|$|R

It had a gravity which checked his wife's quick emotion; the {{resolution}} with which she had entered the room found itself caught in a <b>mesh</b> of fine <b>threads.</b> His last words were not a command, they constituted a kind of appeal; and, though she felt that any expression of respect on his part could only be a refinement of egotism, they represented something transcendent and absolute, like {{the sign of the cross}} or the flag of one's country.

40|$|A bioeroding sponge {{was found}} in a sabellariid worm reef in Florida, USA. The sponge was {{investigated}} with standard techniques for species identification (tissue digestion, microscopy techniques, examination of spicules) and was identified as the clionid Pione lampa (De Laubenfels, 1950). This species is extremely similar to Pione vastifica (Hancock, 1849). Morphological and ecological similarities and possible dissimilarities are discussed. Arguments for conspecifity were found to be weaker than evidence of P. lampa and P. vastifica being separate species. The sampled sponge contained asexual reproductive elements: superficial buds and internal gemmules. Buds were very delicate, consisting mainly of a radially- oriented <b>mesh</b> of collageneous <b>threads.</b> They further comprised abundant granular material and acanthose microrhabds. Numerous choanosomal gemmules were found in the sponge body attached to erosion chamber walls. They were subspherical to lenticular and had an aspicular, unstructured, smooth and rigid coat. It enclosed dense cell material and various spicule types. Whereas buds are interpreted to function as dispersal elements, gemmules will primarily ensure survival under adverse conditions such as smothering, exposure to air and high temperatures. Gemmules from this site might occasionally be freed and scattered, since the Florida reef can suffer heavy damage during periods of increased wave activity such as that created during hurricane season. Bioerosion activity of the sponge increases the chance to free gemmules, as the sponge not only etches into calcareous particles cemented into the matrix produced by the worms, but also into the matrix itself. This ability enables the sponge to utilise the reef as substrate. Within the Clionidae, Cliona annulifera and three species of the genus Pione are the only species known to produce typical gemmules. Possible reasons are: (1) reproduction of bioeroding sponges is understudied and asexual bodies may have been overlooked in other species, and (2) clionid gemmules are an adaptation to survive life in risky environments. Sponges of the genus Pione are comparatively successful in environments in which they are close to their physical limits or in potentially unstable or mobile substrates...|$|R
