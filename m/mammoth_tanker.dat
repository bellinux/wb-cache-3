A model is a representation of and is supposed to be analogous to a different, more complex system. If the physics of the system is well understood and the boundary conditions are well defined, a model can be used as an analogous computer. Thus can the sailing characteristics of a <b>mammoth</b> <b>tanker</b> be de-signed by studies on a model no longer than a few meters. Unfortunately, in coronary physiology, there is as yet a dramatic lack in knowledge of anatomy and mechanical behavior of the microcirculation. Hence, models are used to test whether hypothe-tized mechanisms may indeed be operative at loca...|$|E
