25|$|In {{decision}} theory, and {{in particular}} in choice under uncertainty, an agent is described as making an optimal choice {{in the context of}} incomplete information. For risk neutral agents, the choice involves using the expected values of uncertain quantities, while for risk averse agents it involves maximizing the expected value of some objective function such as a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function. One example of using expected value in reaching optimal decisions is the Gordon–Loeb <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> security investment. According to the model, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be {{only a small fraction of}} the expected loss (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber/information security breach).|$|E
25|$|The {{brain is}} an ever-changing, plastic, <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> sharing and processing. In {{order for the}} brain to {{incorporate}} new experiences into a refined schema it has to undergo specific modifications to consolidate and assimilate all new information. Synaptic plasticity {{can be described as}} the changing in strength between two related neurons. Neuroplasticity is most clearly seen in the instances of REM sleep deprivation during brain maturation. Regional brain measurements in neo-natal REM sleep deprived rats displayed a significant size reduction in areas such as the cerebral cortex and the brain stem. The rats were deprived during critical periods after birth and thus anatomical size reduction is observed. Using a pursuit task (used to test visuomotor capabilities) in combination with an fMRI, Maquet et al., 2003, found that increases in activation were seen in the supplementary eye field and right dentate nucleus of subjects who were allowed to sleep as compared to sleep deprived individuals. The right superior temporal sulcus was also noticed to have higher activation levels. When functional connectivity was analyzed {{it was found that the}} dentate nucleus was more closely involved with the functions of the superior temporal sulcus. The results suggest that performance on the pursuit task relies on the subject's ability to comprehend appropriate movement patterns in order for recreation of the optimal movements. Sleep deprivation was found to interrupt the slow processes that lead to learning of this procedural skill and alter connectivity changes that would have normally been seen after a night of rest. Neuroplasticity has been thoroughly researched over the past few decades and results have shown that significant changes that occur in our cortical processing areas have the power to modulate neuronal firing to both new and previously experienced stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|Bad faith {{negotiations}} {{are often used}} in political science and political psychology to refer to negotiating strategies {{in which there is}} no real intention to reach compromise, or a <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> processing. [...] The [...] "inherent bad faith model" [...] of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by Ole Holsti to explain the relationship between John Foster Dulles' beliefs and his <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> processing. It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent. [...] A state is presumed implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. [...] They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. [...] Examples are John Foster Dulles' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Hamas's position on the state of Israel.|$|E

2500|$|Social {{movement}} {{media has}} {{a rich and}} storied history (see Agitprop) that has changed at a rapid rate since New Media became widely used. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation of Chiapas, Mexico were the first major movement to make widely recognized and effective use of New Media for communiques and organizing in 1994. Since then, New Media has been used extensively by social movements to educate, organize, share cultural products of movements, communicate, coalition build, and more. The WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity was another landmark {{in the use of}} New Media as a tool for social change. The WTO protests used media to organize the original action, communicate with and educate participants, and was used as an alternative media source. The Indymedia movement also developed out of this action, and has been a great tool in the democratization of information, which is another widely discussed aspect of new media movement. Some scholars even view this democratization as an indication of the creation of a [...] "radical, socio-technical paradigm to challenge the dominant, neoliberal and technologically determinist <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and communication technologies." [...] A less radical view along these same lines is that people are taking advantage of the Internet to produce a grassroots globalization, one that is anti-neoliberal and centered on people rather than the flow of capital. Chanelle Adams, a feminist blogger for the Bi-Weekly webpaper The Media says that in her [...] "commitment to anti-oppressive feminist work, it seems obligatory for her to stay in the know just to remain relevant to the struggle." [...] In order for Adams and other feminists who work towards spreading their messages to the public, new media becomes crucial towards completing this task, allowing people to access a movement's information instantaneously. Of course, some are also skeptical of the role of New Media in Social Movements. Many scholars point out unequal access to new media as a hindrance to broad-based movements, sometimes even oppressing some within a movement. Others are skeptical about how democratic or useful it really is for social movements, even for those with access.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this review}} is to discuss how {{existing}} <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> behaviour may help to improve provision <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to carers <b>of</b> people with dementia. The article analyses existing <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> behaviour derived from information science, describes studies that have examined these models in relation to health and discusses {{ways in which they}} help to understand the <b>information</b> behaviours <b>of</b> carers of people with dementia. Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature on studies <b>of</b> <b>information</b> needs and a critical examination <b>of</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> behaviours in relation to health were undertaken. Results: Two dominant paradigms in information science research were identified, involving system-centred and user-centred approaches. System-centred approaches and studies are limited in that they have made assumptions on the types <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that people may require, the way in which information should be provided, the timing <b>of</b> <b>information</b> provision and have homogenous treated groups, failing to take account of individual preferences. In contrast, user-centred approaches recognise the unique needs of individuals and that information needs are subjective and affected by a variety <b>of</b> factors. User-centred <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> behaviour, particularly Dervin's sense-making theory and Wilson's Information Seeking Behaviour Models, could be useful in developing a better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>information</b> behaviours <b>of</b> carers of people with dementia. Conclusion: Adopting a user-centred approach to study the <b>information</b> behaviours <b>of</b> carers of people with dementia will take account of individual needs. Testing existing <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> behaviour within this group may help to develop interventions {{to meet the needs of}} individual carers and people with dementia. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the paper}} is to review <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> {{behaviour}} and to propose new models that extend the concept beyond simply information seeking to consider other modes <b>of</b> behaviour. The <b>models</b> chiefly explored are those of Wilson and Dervin. Argument A shortcoming <b>of</b> some <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> behaviour is that they present a sequence of stages in that behaviour and {{it is evident that}} actual behaviour is not always explained effectively by stages in a sequence. Development. A <b>model</b> <b>of</b> 'multi-directionality' is explored, to overcome the notion of sequential stages and, using Dervin's concept of 'the gap', modes <b>of</b> <b>information</b> behaviour are developed that include, for example, creating, destroying and avoiding information as well as seeking it. Conclusion. New <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> behaviour are presented that: replace the notion of 'barriers' with the concept of 'gap', as a means of integrating the views of Wilson and Dervin; incorporate the notion of multi-directionality; and identify ways in which an individual may navigate 'the gap' using different modes <b>of</b> <b>information</b> behaviour...|$|R
