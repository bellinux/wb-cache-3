5|$|Following the Mexican Revolution, the new {{government}} began persecuting the Church. To destroy the Church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics {{that resulted in the}} deaths of thousands, including several priests who were also knights of Columbus. Known as the Mexican martyrs, these <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> canonized.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Gallipoli dead have {{no known}} grave. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery, {{constructed}} {{on the site}} where the Turks buried Allied war dead after the evacuation, has 632 graves of which only ten <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> identified. Similarly, the nearby Hill 60 Cemetery has another 788 graves, of which only seventy-six were identified.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in <b>men,</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tested {{for their ability}} to increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done in women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, three {{civil rights}} workers (two white and one black) who {{organize}} a voter registry for African Americans in Jessup County, Mississippi go missing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sends two agents, Rupert Anderson—a former Mississippi sheriff—and Alan Ward, to investigate. The pair {{find it difficult}} to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies exert influence over the public and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> murdered. Their bodies are later found buried in an earthen dam. Stuckey deduces Mrs Pell's confession to the FBI and informs Pell, who brutally beats his wife in retribution.|$|E

5|$|Prose follows {{after this}} stanza, stating that a burial-mound {{was made for}} Helgi, and that when Helgi arrived in Valhalla, he was asked by Odin to manage things with him. In stanza 39, Helgi, now in Valhalla, has his former enemy Hunding—also in Valhalla—do menial tasks; {{fetching}} foot-baths {{for all of the}} men there, kindling fire, tying dogs, keeping watch of horses, and feeding the pigs before he can get any sleep. In stanzas 40 to 42, Helgi has returned to Midgard from Valhalla with a host of men. An unnamed maid of Sigrún, Helgi's valkyrie wife, sees Helgi and his large host of men riding into the mound. The maid asks if she is experiencing a delusion, if Ragnarök has begun, or if Helgi and his <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> allowed to return.|$|E
5|$|Records of men {{meeting for}} sex {{with other men}} in bathhouses {{date back to the}} 15th century. A {{tradition}} of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of homosexual activity in Greece. In the West, gay <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting cruising areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, movie theatres, public lavatories (cottages or tearooms), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex between patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four African American <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> kidnapped in Philadelphia. One {{of them has}} been found dead exhibiting depigmentation. A {{specialist}} from the CDC believes that the men have died from a disease, and has requested Scully to investigate the case. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) joins Scully and {{has some of the}} evidence samples from Sanders' autopsy analyzed by Agent Pendrell, who finds a seed from a rare West African passionflower. Mulder takes the seed to his UN informant Marita Covarrubias and asks for her help; she provides him with information on the incident on the plane.|$|E

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{surprised}} that <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> noticing her, instead of resenting or ignoring {{her as they}} usually do. Her friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells Liz that she is coming off as more confident since starting {{her relationship with her}} boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). Liz decides to use her new-found confidence to help TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) with a problem he has had with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti). Liz visits him in the editing room and hopes to convince him to get TGSs show's opener footage finished as soon as possible in which she is successful after flirting with Ritchie. Later, Liz learns that Ritchie is spreading a rumor that the two are sleeping together. She confronts Ritchie about it, he admits to starting the rumor {{in order to get the}} attention of his assistant editor Donna (Joanna Adler). Later, Liz and Ritchie have a pretend break-up in front of Donna, and Donna becomes interested in Ritchie.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle for}} No.3 Post cost the New Zealanders forty-two dead and 109 wounded. The brigade fought another two battles at Gallipoli: the Battle of Chunuk Bair, and the Battle of Hill 60. Their {{involvement}} in these battles proved costly, and in September 1915, with a strength of only 249 men, {{they left the}} peninsula for the rest camp {{on the island of}} Lemnos. During the campaign, 4,000 men served in the brigade; 727 of those were killed and 1,239 wounded, which equates to a casualty rate of almost fifty per cent. Amongst the dead were Chambers– the commander of the 9th Squadron– and Elmslie of the 6th Squadron. Both survived the battle for No.3 Post, but not the campaign, and were killed in action in August 1915 during the Battle of Chunuk Bair. Like many other New Zealanders, neither have a known grave, and they are therefore commemorated on the Chunuk Bair Memorial. The adjacent Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery has 632 graves of which only ten <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> identified. During the 260 days of the Gallipoli Campaign, a total of 2,721 New Zealand soldiers were killed and another 4,852 wounded, out of the total 8,556 New Zealanders who took part. The exact number of Turkish casualties at Gallipoli is not known, but has been estimated at 87,000 dead, from a total of around 250,000 casualties.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, Aaron Gillego, a {{columnist}} for The Advocate, criticized the series for having never cast an Asian man in the then-13 years of its existence, opining that Asian women have been cast on the show because heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> socialized by the media {{to think of them}} as exotic beauties or sex objects, but that Asian <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> largely invisible in popular media. As of 2017, an Asian man has never been cast in the 25 years of the show's existence.|$|E
