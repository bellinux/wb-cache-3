500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in <b>my</b> <b>shoes.</b> <b>My</b> <b>shoes</b> were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E
500|$|Killin' Time was {{certified}} platinum in 1990. [...] Black's second album, Put Yourself in <b>My</b> <b>Shoes,</b> {{was released}} in November 1990. [...] It reached number two on the country chart {{and was in the}} top 20 on the pop album charts. This success on the pop charts resulted from a change in the way Billboard calculated album sales; a new reliance on Nielsen SoundScan instead of information from selected record stores showed that sales of country albums had previously been under counted. The album did not meet with as much critical acclaim as his debut, but nonetheless still included several hit singles. He began touring with Alabama.|$|E

500|$|However, Tarasouleas {{argues that}} no {{contemporary}} press reports in Greek newspapers mention Melpomene by name, while the name Revithi appears many times; Tarasouleas suggests that Melpomene and Revithi {{are the same}} person, and Martin and Green argue that [...] "a contemporary account referring to Revithi as a well-known marathon runner could explain the earlier run by a woman over the marathon course—this was by Revithi herself, not Melpomene".O.S. 23March]}}, and Asti of April11 [...] The daily Athens newspaper Estia of 4April [...] 1896 refers to [...] "the strange woman, who, having run {{a few days ago}} in the Marathon as a try-out, intends to compete the day after tomorrow.

[...] Moreover, Tarasouleas notes that on 13March [...] 1896, another local newspaper indicated that a woman and her baby had registered to run the marathon, but again her name is not mentioned. Trying to resolve the mystery, Tarasouleas asserts that [...] "perhaps Revithi had two names, or perhaps for reasons unknown she was attributed the name of the Muse Melpomene".|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by <b>my</b> <b>shoes,</b> if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E

500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of <b>my</b> <b>shoes</b> and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though she}} was {{familiar}} with the road, Hazel quickly became disoriented due to the blinding, blowing white snow, which made it impossible to see more than a few feet in front of her. She was dressed in warm coat, hat, gloves and sturdy, one-buckle overshoes, but the clothing was insufficient protection against the wind and freezing temperatures, and her hands and feet became numb in the cold. When the sleigh hit a coulee, Hazel slid from the sleigh into waist-deep, mushy snow. She said, [...] "Oh, my!
