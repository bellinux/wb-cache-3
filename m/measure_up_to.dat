5|$|Upon release, Return of Saturn {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, although {{several of them}} were divided over its different sound to its predecessor. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 {{but was unable to}} <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the sales of Tragic Kingdom. The album spawned four singles, only one of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 43rd Grammy Awards, Return of Saturn was nominated for Best Rock Album.|$|E
5|$|John Elwood Shepherd, {{referred}} to more commonly as Elwood, is a 13-year-old pickpocket who joins up with powder hunters Gamma and Smith {{in an effort}} to resurrect his dead sister Sheryl Ann Shepherd. He is introduced in the first chapter of the series. His character is named after Gotee Records co-founder Joey Elwood, a real-life music producer whose name Kubo thought fit Elwood's character design perfectly. Elwood has great talent with throwing knives, and is ingenious in combat, but struggles to overcome his sidekick status and <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the abilities of his superhuman partners. Smith and Gamma both see Elwood as a younger version of Gamma, which fills Gamma with hope and pride, but also the fear that Elwood may turn to evil. This concern prompts Smith and Gamma to leave Elwood behind at Gemini Laboratory {{at the end of the}} manga, so that he can find his own way without Gamma's influence. Whether Elwood decides to follow the pair or not is left ambiguous.|$|E
5|$|The spores are white, smooth, roughly elliptical, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 7–8.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 17–23 by 7.5–10μm, and four-spored with sterigmata around 3 μm long. The paraphyses are 5–8μm wide, {{shorter than the}} basidia, more abundant and form a somewhat gelatinous layer. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the cap edge) are 60 by 7–21μm, hyaline, conical or ventricose (inflated). The tips of the cheilocystidia are drawn out to a point, or have a short appendage measuring 15 by 2–3μm, which is sometimes branched, and is thin or slightly thick-walled. There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Pileocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of}} the cap) are club-shaped, measuring 25–60 by 13–25μm. They are somewhat thick-walled, and spiny on the exposed surface with short simple outgrowths extending up to 3μm long. The pileocystidia are joined together and form a continuous layer over the young cap, but break up as the cap expands. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are conical or lance-shaped, hyaline, and smooth, with walls that are thin or slightly thickened. They <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 300 by 10–25μm, but are shorter in the upper regions of the stem. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E

25|$|After the 1965 War, the Indian Air Force {{went through}} an intense phase of {{modernisation}} and consolidation. With newly acquired HF-24, MiG-21 and Sukhoi Su-7BM (though the versions of these acquired between 1965 and 1971 {{did not have}} night-fight capability) aircraft, the IAF was able to <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the most powerful air forces in the world.|$|E
25|$|Apophysomyces variabilis {{resembles the}} other {{three members of the}} genus Apophysomyces but is {{characterized}} by the variable appearance of its sporangiospores and sporangiophores which range from club-shaped to trapezoidal to flattened spheres. The sporangiophore can <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 400μm in length and has a funnel-shaped apophysis or swelling below the columella. Hyphae are smooth-walled, aseptate, and branched.|$|E

25|$|After Pantera's breakup, Darrell and Vinnie {{formed a}} new band, Damageplan, with vocalist Pat Lachman and bassist Bob Zilla. The group {{released}} their first album, New Found Power, on February 10, 2004. The album was a commercial success; over 44,000 copies {{were sold in}} its first week alone and within a year over 100,000 copies were sold. However, some fans felt that Damageplan's material did not <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that of Pantera.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option is}} {{probability}} proportional to size ('PPS') sampling, {{in which the}} selection probability for each element is set to be proportional to its size <b>measure,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a maximum of 1. In a simple PPS design, these selection probabilities can then {{be used as the}} basis for Poisson sampling. However, this has the drawback of variable sample size, and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections.|$|E

The program, a juvenile version of the ABC series Lost, concerned a group of teenagers stranded on a tropical island after their plane crashes. Bleu played as Nathan McHugh, a Boy Scout whose leadership skills do not quite <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his self-confidence.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the bombing was mixed. The German towns being hit {{suffered}} from severe destruction. German communications after the bombing were heavily impaired, {{and there was a}} considerable effect on the morale, especially on units consisting of more younger and inexperienced troops. However, the direct damage dealt to the German frontline troops was low, and casualties were few. Allied air commanders admitted that the bombing did not <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> expectations. About 12 aircraft were shot down during the initial bombing by meager anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} {{significance of}} the West German film industry of the 1950s could no longer <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that of France, Italy, or Japan. German films were only rarely distributed internationally as they were perceived as provincial. International co-productions of the kind which were becoming common in France and Italy tended to be rejected by German producers (Schneider 1990:43). However a few German films and film-makers did achieve international recognition at this time, among them Bernhard Wicki's Oscar-nominated Die Brücke (The Bridge) (1959), and the actresses Hildegard Knef and Romy Schneider.|$|E

25|$|Bairam Khan led {{the army}} through the Punjab {{virtually}} unopposed. The fort of Rohtas, {{which was built}} in 1541–43 by Sher Shah Suri to crush the Gakhars who were loyal to Humayun, was surrendered without a shot by a treacherous commander. The walls of the Rohtas Fort <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 12.5 meters in thickness and up to 18.28 meters in height. They extend for 4km and feature 68 semi-circular bastions. Its sandstone gates, both massive and ornate, {{are thought to have}} exerted a profound influence on Mughal military architecture.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 Kelly began {{regularly}} making large-scale outdoor sculpture. Kelly gave up painted surfaces, instead choosing unvarnished steel, aluminum or bronze, {{often in}} totem-like configurations such as Curve XXIII (1981). While the totemic forms of his freestanding sculptures can <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 15 feet tall, his wall reliefs can span more than 14 feet wide. Kelly’s sculpture “is founded on its adherence to absolute simplicity and clarity of form.” For his 1980s sculptures, {{during this period}} of his time in Spencertown, the artist devoted {{for the first time as}} much energy to his sculptures as to his painting, and in the process producing over sixty percent of his total 140 sculptures.|$|E
25|$|Singaporean {{officials}} {{protested that}} the report did not present a full account of the incident and was incomplete, as responsibility for the accident {{appeared to have been}} placed mainly on the flight crew of SQ006, while other equally valid contributing factors had been played down. The team from Singapore that participated in the investigation felt that the lighting and signage at the airport did not <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> international standards. Some critical lights were missing or not working. No barriers or markings were put up {{at the start of the}} closed runway, which would have alerted the flight crew that they were on the wrong runway. The Singapore team felt that these two factors were given less weight than was proper, as another flight crew had almost made the same mistake of using runway 05R to take off days before the accident.|$|E

25|$|The Conservatives {{remained}} the dominant party after the 1975 and 1977 elections {{due to the}} inability of either the New Democrats and the Liberals to become the clear alternative. The Conservatives were {{able to stay in}} power due to the competition between both opposition parties. As there was no serious consideration of a Liberal-NDP alliance after both campaigns, Davis was able to avoid defeat in the legislature by appealing to other parties for support on particular initiatives. His government often moved {{to the left of the}} rural-based Liberals on policy issues. The opposition parties had also undergone leadership changes; Nixon and Lewis, who had posed a strong challenge to Davis, resigned after the 1975 and 1977 elections, respectively. Nixon's successor Stuart Lyon Smith proved unable to increase Liberal support, while new NDP leader Michael Cassidy lacked the support of the party establishment and could not <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Lewis's charismatic and dynamic figure.|$|E
25|$|On 18 October 2011 a hot-spot in {{a public}} square {{was found in the}} city of Kashiwa, Chiba in the Nedokoyadai district, by a {{resident}} walking with a dosimeter. He informed the city council. Their first readings were off the scale, as their Geiger-counter could <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10 microsieverts per hour. Later measurements by the Chiba environment foundation reported a final result of 57.5 microsieverts per hour. On 21 October the roads around the place were sealed off, and the place was covered with sandbags three meters thick. Further investigations and check-ups were planned on 24 October 2011. These investigations showed on 23 October levels up to 276,000 becquerels radioactive cesium per kilogram of soil, 30 centimeters below the surface. The first comments of town officials on the find of 57.7 microsieverts per hour were that there could not be a link with the Fukushima disaster, but after the find of this large amount of cesium, officials of the Science Ministry could not deny the possibility that the cause could be found at the Fukushima-site.|$|E
