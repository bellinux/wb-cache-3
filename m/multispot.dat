40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} that {{peptide nucleic acids}} (PNAs) are excellent probes able to detect the W 1282 X point mutation of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene when biospecific interaction analysis (BIA) by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biosensor technologies is performed. The results reported here suggest that BIA is an easy, fast, and automatable approach for detecting mutations of CF, allowing real-time monitoring of hybridization between 9 -mer CF PNA probes and target biotinylated PCR products generated from healthy, heterozygous subjects and homozygous W 1282 X samples and immobilized on streptavidin-coated sensor chips. This method is, to our knowledge, the first application of PNAs, BIA, and SPR to a human hereditary mutation, and demonstrates the feasibility of these approaches for discriminating between normal and mutated target DNA. We {{like to point out}} that the procedure described in this paper is rapid and informative; results are obtained within a few minutes. This could be of great interest for molecular pre-implantation diagnosis to discriminate homozygous CF embryos from heterozygous and healthy embryos. Other advantages of the methodology described in the present paper are (a) that it is a nonradioactive methodology and (b) that gel electrophoresis and/or dot-spot analysis are not required. More importantly, the demonstration that SPR-based BIA could be associated with microarray technology allows us to hypothesize that the method described in the present paper could be used for the development of a protocol employing <b>multispotting</b> on SPR biosensors of many CF-PCR products and a real-time simultaneous analysis of hybridization to PNA probes. These results are in line with the concept that SPR could be an integral part of a fully automated diagnostic system based on the use of laboratory workstations, biosensors, and arrayed biosensors for DNA isolation, preparation of PCR reactions, and identification of point mutations...|$|R

The <b>Multispot</b> HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test is currently the only FDA approved method for such differentiation between the two viruses. Recommendations for the screening and diagnosis of HIV {{has always been to}} use enzyme immunoassays that detect HIV-1, HIV-1 group O, and HIV-2. When screening the combination, if the test is positive followed by an indeterminate HIV-1 western blot, a follow up test, such as amino acid testing, must be performed to distinguish which infection is present. According to the NIH, a differential diagnosis of HIV-2 should be considered when a person is of West African descent or has had sexual contact or shared needles with such a person. West Africa is at the highest risk as it is the origin of the virus.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundA new HIV {{diagnostic}} algorithm {{has been}} proposed which replaces {{the use of the}} HIV- 1 Western blot and HIV- 1 immunofluorescence assays (IFA) as the supplemental test with an HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 antibody differentiation assay. ObjectivesTo compare an FDA-approved HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 antibody differentiation test (<b>Multispot)</b> as a confirmatory test with the HIV- 1 Western blot and IFA. Study designParticipants were screened with an HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 combination Antigen/Antibody (Ag/Ab) screening assay. Specimens with repeatedly reactive results were tested with <b>Multispot</b> and either Western blot or IFA. Specimens with discordant screening and confirmatory results were resolved with HIV- 1 RNA testing. ResultsIndividuals (37, 876) were screened for HIV infection and 654 (1. 7 %) had a repeatedly reactive Ag/Ab assay result. On <b>Multispot,</b> 554 (84. 7 %) were HIV- 1 reactive, 0 (0 %) were HIV- 2 reactive, 1 (0. 2 %) was reactive for both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 (undifferentiated), 9 (1. 4 %) were HIV- 1 indeterminate, and 90 (13. 8 %) were non-reactive. HIV- 1 RNA was detected in 47 / 90 <b>Multispot</b> non-reactive (52. 2 %) specimens. Among specimens confirmed to have HIV infection (true positives), <b>Multispot</b> and Western blot detected HIV- 1 antibody in a similar proportion of cases (93. 7 % vs. 94. 4 % respectively) while <b>Multispot</b> and IFA also detected HIV- 1 antibody in a similar proportion of cases (84. 5 % vs. 83. 4 % respectively). ConclusionsIn this study, <b>Multispot</b> confirmed HIV infections at a similar proportion to Western blot and IFA. <b>Multispot,</b> Western blot, and IFA, however, did not confirm all of the reactive Ag/Ab assay results and underscores the importance of HIV NAT testing to resolve discordant screening and confirmatory results...|$|E

Changes in central macular thickness and BCVA at 4 - and 12 -week follow-up were compared to baseline measurements. Results. Each eye received a mean (SD) of 2, 750 (686. 7) laser spots. At 4 -week follow-up, there was a statistically significant 24. 0 [*]μm increase in mean CSF thickness (P= 0. 001), with a 17. 4 [*]μm increase from baseline at 12 -week follow-up (P= 0. 002).

40|$|As one of {{the powder}} bed fusion {{additive}} manufacturing technologies, electron beam melting (EBM) is gaining more and more attention due to its near-net-shape production capacity with low residual stress and good mechanical properties. These characteristics also allow EBM built parts {{to be used as}} produced without post-processing. However, the as-built rough surface introduces a detrimental influence on the mechanical properties of metallic alloys. Thereafter, understanding the effects of processing parameters on the part’s surface roughness, in turn, becomes critical. This paper has focused on varying the processing parameters of two types of contouring scanning strategies namely, <b>multispot</b> and non-multispot, in EBM. The results suggest that the beam current and speed function are the most significant processing parameters for non-multispot contouring scanning strategy. While for <b>multispot</b> contouring scanning strategy, the number of spots, spot time, and spot overlap have greater effects than focus offset and beam current. The improved surface roughness has been obtained in both contouring scanning strategies.

Protocol was completed in 24 patients, all with LBBB (QRS width 171 ± 20 ms) and 58 % ischemic aetiology. The percentage change in LV+dP/dtmax for MSP pacing was 31. 0 ± 3. 3 % (Mean±SE), which was not significantly superior to any BiV pacing configuration: 28. 9 ± 3. 2 % (LV-distal), 28. 3 ± 2. 7 % (LV-mid), and 29. 5 ± 3. 0 % (LV-prox), respectively.

CLSI M 53 -A guideline no longer recommends using Western Blot for confirmation of HIV reactive results due {{to the number of}} false-negative and indeterminate results it yields. The objective of this literature review is to systematically review the performance and operational characteristics of HIV confirmatory assays that meet the CLSI M 53 -A guidelines. Method: “PubMed” and “EMBASE” databases were used to conduct a systematic literature review and identified the potential relevant publications after June 2011.

MethodsThis study used reference samples submitted to the Canadian – NLHRS and samples from commercial sources. Data was tabulated in 2 × 2 tables for statistical analysis; sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, kappa and likelihood ratios. ResultsThe overall performance of the Geenius and <b>Multispot</b> was very high; sensitivity (100 %, 100 %), specificity (96. 3 %, 99. 1 %), positive (45. 3, 181) and negative (0, 0) likelihood ratios respectively, high kappa (0. 96) and low bias index (0. 0068). The ability to differentiate HIV- 1 (99. 2 %, 100 %) and HIV- 2 (98. 1 %, 98. 1 %) Ab was also very high.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies have}} shown that a multibeam {{reflector}} antenna could be illuminated by a multifeed electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure, in order to achieve a high gain <b>multispot</b> coverage with the simple "one feed by beam" concept and only one aperture. This letter deals with the design of a metallic EBG antenna in the Ka band, feeding a side-fed offset cassegrain antenna (SFOCA) for a European <b>multispot</b> coverage. This reflector presents a high focal-length-to-diameter ratio limiting the defocusing effects for multibeam applications. It, therefore, requires focal feeds with a high directivity and a good radiation pattern quality. The well-known drawbacks of an EBG antenna are the narrow radiation bandwidth for high directivities and also the high sidelobes level reducing the reflector antenna efficiency. Consequently, the work presented in this letter consisted in improving the EBG antenna performances by using a more efficient feed. The replacement of the usual microstrip patch by a horn allowed to double the radiation bandwidth while decreasing the sidelobes level (- 15 dB) of a 24 -dB EBG antenna.

A cocktail of peptides from gp 41 and C 2 V 3 (M-O) detected all HIV- 1 group M and O sera and showed cross-reactivity with SIVcpz sera. Further, a mixture of C 2 V 3 peptides (GAB 1 -ANT) failed to detect HIV- 1 infections but reacted with all SIVcpz sera, allowing discrimination of SIVcpz from HIV- 1 infections.

In this research contact bonds were made and compared of isotropic conductive adhesives from three suppliers. The 1 /f noise of the contact resistance can be interpreted in terms of a <b>multispot</b> contact behavior. We investigated the relative noise C versus contact resistance R in two ways: (1) after an increasing number of thermo-cycles; (2) after increasing mechanical stress. The results often show an increase in relative noise of three orders of magnitude for poor quality polymer bonds. A maximum increase of one order of magnitude is observed for the best quality conductive adhesive. The contact resistance increases by a factor 1. 7 and not more than 1. 14 for the poor and best quality bonds, respectively. From the analysis based on a noise model for <b>multispot</b> contact, the onset of delamination can be characterized as a reduction in electrical contact area Ae. The relative noise is proportional to Ae- 5 / 2. The surprising result is that samples submitted to a mechanical stress show pictures similar to thermocycled samples. Thermo-cycling with less than 200 cycles leads to less noise, an increase in electrical contact area, and hence a contact improvement. This behavior is understood. Noise analysis under mechanical stress on nondegraded or slightly cycled bonds is a fast diagnostic tool for reliability characterization. The degree of delamination is expressed quantitatively by the D-factor D=Aemax /Aemin¿(Cmax/Cmin) 2 / 5...|$|E
40|$|A genetic {{algorithm}} controlled <b>multispot</b> transmitter is demonstrated {{to be capable}} of optimizing the received power distribution for single element receivers in fully diffuse mobile indoor optical wireless systems. By dynamically modifying the intensity of individual diffusion spots, the transmitter is capable of compensating for changes in receiver alignment, user movement and surface reflectivity characteristics, with negligible impact to bandwidth and RMS delay spread. The dynamic range, referenced against the peak received power, can be reduced by up to 27 % when the room is empty, and up to 26 % with user movement and variable receiver alignment. Furthermore, received power perturbation, induced by user movement, is reduced from 10 % to 2. 5 %. This method shows potential for providing a highly adaptable solution of overcoming channel variability whilst also reducing receiver complexity...|$|E
40|$|Femtosecond laser {{processing}} of bulk transparent materials can generate localized {{increase of the}} refractive index. Thus, translation of the laser spot give potential access to three dimensionnal photowriting of waveguiding structures. Increasing the number of machining foci can considerably reduce the processing efforts when complex photonic structures are envisaged such as waveguide arrays. The present report presents a technique of dynamic ultrafast laser beam spatial tailoring for parallel writing of photonic devices. The wavefront of the beam is modulated by a periodical binary (0 -π) phase mask of variable pattern to achieve dynamic <b>multispot</b> operation. The parallel photoinscription of multiple waveguides is demonstrated in fused silica. Using this method, light dividers in three dimensions relying on evanescent coupling are reported and wavelength-division demultiplexing (WDD) devices were achieved in single sample scan...|$|E
40|$|Solution-based single-molecule {{spectroscopy}} and {{fluorescence correlation spectroscopy}} (FCS) are powerful techniques to access a variety of molecular properties such as size, brightness, conformation, and binding constants. However, this is limited to low concentrations, which results in long acquisition times {{in order to achieve}} good statistical accuracy. Data can be acquired more quickly by using parallelization. We present a new approach using a <b>multispot</b> excitation and detection geometry made possible by the combination of three powerful new technologies: (i) a liquid crystal spatial light modulator to produce multiple diffraction- limited excitation spots; (ii) a multipixel detector array matching the excitation pattern and (iii) a low-cost reconfigurable multichannel counting board. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by reporting FCS measurements of various calibrated samples as well as single-molecule burst measurements...|$|E
