5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} is physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is wet or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (<b>mitigation)</b> <b>measures</b> employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E

The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures.</b> A wider stairway would be installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of this part of the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle. The cost of this part of the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E

30|$|Implementing {{reforestation}} in {{a timely}} manner as a <b>mitigation</b> <b>measure</b> after a wildfire is only a means to avoid infiltration-type debris flows due to increased susceptibility attributable to fire. The natural, or pre-fire, susceptibility to infiltration-initiated debris flows within a forested terrain will exist in the future because this <b>mitigation</b> <b>measure</b> only returns the forest to a pre-fire susceptibility level. Therefore, any future studies of the effectiveness of this <b>mitigation</b> <b>measure</b> will need a basis for discriminating whether later infiltration-type debris flows are a consequence of changes attributable to the wildfire or to those other conditions influencing susceptibility of such debris flows.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{studies the}} {{efficiency}} of subgrade stiffening next to the track as a <b>mitigation</b> <b>measure</b> for railway induced vibrations {{by means of a}} two-and-a-halfdimensional coupled finite element – boundary element methodology. The pyhsical mechanism is interpreted in the frequency–wavenumber domain, illustrating that the stiffened block of soil next to the track can act as a wave impeding barrier. The existence of a critical frequency from which this <b>mitigation</b> <b>measure</b> starts to be effective, as well as a critical angle delimiting the area where the vibration levels are reduced, is demonstrated in this paper. Two realistic case studies are discussed to indicate that the effectiveness of the proposed <b>mitigation</b> <b>measure</b> depends on the stiffness contrast between the soil and the stiffened block of soil...|$|R
