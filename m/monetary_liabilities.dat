Members of this class include search engines, social networks, internet service providers, website operators, hosts, and payment gateways, which together exert a critical and growing influence upon national and global economies, governments and cultures. This research examines who should face legal responsibility when wrongdoers utilise these services tortiously to cause harm to others. It has three parts. Part 1 seeks {{to understand the nature of}} an intermediary and how its liability differs from the liability of primary defendants. It classifies intermediaries according to a new layered, functional taxonomy and argues that many instances of secondary liability in English private law reflect shared features and underlying policies, including optimal loss-avoidance and derivative liability premised on an assumption of responsibility. Part 2 analyses intermediaries’ <b>monetary</b> <b>liability</b> for secondary wrongdoing in two areas of English law: defamation and copyright. It traces the historical evolution of these doctrines at successive junctures in communications technology, before identifying and defending limits on that liability which derive from three main sources: (i) in-built limits contained in definitions of secondary wrongdoing; (ii) European safe harbours and general limits on remedies; and (iii) statutory defences and exceptions. Part 3 examines intermediaries’ non-monetary liability, in particular their obligations to disclose information about alleged primary wrongdoers and to cease facilitating wrongdoing where it is necessary and proportionate to do so. It proposes a new suite of non-facilitation remedies designed to restrict access to tortious internet materials, remove such materials from search engines, and reduce the profitability of wrongdoing. It concludes with several recommendations to improve the effectiveness and proportionality of remedies by reference to considerations of architecture, anonymity, efficient procedures, and fundamental rights.

It is mandatory to {{the sense that there}} is a legal document giving the government the mandate to collect such contribution. Imposition of tax, therefore, creates a tax liability upon those who are liable to pay the imposed tax. A tax liability is always expressed in monetary terms, and it is worth noting here that any <b>monetary</b> <b>liability</b> creates burden. Although it is said that the only things certain in life are death and taxes it is unmistakable that taxes are far from inevitable. Individuals do not like paying taxes and they take variety of actions to reduce their tax liabilities. The problem of tax compliance is as old as taxes themselves. Therefore this explains that tax non compliance started when taxes started. Non tax compliance is a serious problem that cannot be studied and understood by simple analysis. This was the basis for the researcher to investigate how social norms and tax system influence the level of tax compliance among small and medium taxpayers in Tanzania Specifically in Tanga city using descriptive and correlation analysis.
