The museum {{acquired}} much of the original Underwood tooling and currently (sporadically) Richard Jordan <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> 100 different Fun Ho! models there in the function of museum support.

25|$|The {{secondary}} sector (manufacturing) includes shipbuilding in Vigo and Ferrol, textiles and granite work in A Coruña. A Coruña also manufactures automobiles, {{but not nearly}} {{on the scale of}} the French automobile manufacturing in Vigo. The Centro de Vigo de PSA Peugeot Citroën, founded in 1958, <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> 450,000 vehicles annually (455,430 in 2006); a Citroën C4 Picasso made in 2007 was their nine-millionth vehicle.|$|E

A letter or symbol is stamped on the sole of custom-ordered shoes to indicate the cobbler who made them.|$|E

25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> the whole affair (and he is right in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E
25|$|February Shadows can be {{categorized}} as a psychological novel. The entire narration is told through first person stream of consciousness, and the plot builds through the unearthing of new memories as they emerge in Hilde's mind. The story is told in a mix {{of past and present}} and the narration switches fluidly {{back and forth between the}} two. The manner of the flashbacks and the inner comments Hilde <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> each informs the reader that she wishes to repress the horrific memories of 2 February 1945. Hilde constantly reminds herself to forget the past as if her survival and sanity depended on doing so.|$|E

500|$|Brown-colored {{diamonds}} {{constituted a}} significant part of the diamond production, and were predominantly used for industrial purposes. They were seen as worthless for jewelry (not even being assessed on the diamond color scale). After the development of Argyle diamond mine in Australia in 1986, and marketing, brown diamonds have become acceptable gems. The change was mostly due to the numbers: the Argyle mine, with its [...] of diamonds per year, <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> one-third of global production of natural diamonds; 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown.|$|E
500|$|The {{first edition}} {{sold out in}} six weeks. It was only some months {{afterward}} that the voice of Francis Jeffrey, the highly respected editor of The Edinburgh Review, was heard. Jeffrey began by expressing reservations: {{this is not a}} book of great learning and less a book of criticism than of appreciation. And yet, Jeffrey concedes, the [...] "appreciation" [...] is of the highest kind, and he is [...] "not [...] much inclined to disagree with" [...] Hazlitt [...] "after reading his eloquent exposition" [...] of the points he <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> Shakespeare. [...] "The book [...] is written less to tell the reader what Mr. H. knows about Shakespeare or his writings, than to explain to them what he feels about them—and why he feels so—and thinks that all who profess to love poetry should feel so likewise." [...] While Characters does not [...] "show extraordinary knowledge of [...] production" [...] it nevertheless shows [...] "very considerable originality and genius." ...|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, the book's utility as textual {{scholarship}} {{is limited by}} Havelock's methods. His account of orality is based almost entirely on Homer, but {{the history of the}} Homeric text is not known, which forces Havelock to make claims based on assumptions that cannot fully be tested. Later classicists argue that the poetic nature of Homer's language works against the very arguments Havelock <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> the intellectual nature of oral poetry. What he asserts as a definitive use of language can never be conclusively demonstrated not to be an accident of [...] "metrical convenience." [...] Homerists, like Platonists, found the book to be less than useful for the precise work of their own discipline; many classicists rejected outright Havelock's essential thesis that oral culture predominated through the 5th century. At the same time, though, Havelock's influence, particularly in literary theory, was growing enormously. He is the most cited writer in Walter J. Ong's influential Orality and Literacy other than Ong himself. His work has been cited in studies of orality and literacy in African culture and the implications of modern literacy theory for library science. Preface to Plato has remained continuously in print since its initial publication.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{has what}} scholar Cora Kaplan {{labelled}} in 2002 a [...] "curious" [...] legacy that {{has evolved over}} time: [...] "for an author-activist adept in many genres... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecraft's life has been read much more closely than her writing". After the devastating effect of Godwin's Memoirs, Wollstonecraft's reputation lay in tatters for a century; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth, who patterned the [...] "freakish" [...] Harriet Freke in Belinda (1801) after her. Other novelists such as Mary Hays, Charlotte Turner Smith, Fanny Burney, and Jane West created similar figures, all to teach a [...] "moral lesson" [...] to their readers. (Hays had been a close friend, and helped nurse her in her dying days.) One writer who never mentioned Wollstonecraft by name, but whose novels often contain allusions to her was Jane Austen. The American scholar Anne Mellor noted as example that the character of Wickham in Pride and Prejudice seems to be based upon {{the sort of man}} that Wollstonecraft claimed that standing armies produce while the sarcastic remarks that Elizabeth Bennet <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> [...] "female accomplishments" [...] in the same novel closely echo Wollstonecraft's condemnation of [...] "female accomplishments" [...] in A Vindication of the Rights of Women; the balance between a woman must strike between feelings and reason in Sense and Sensibility follows what Wollstonecraft had recommended in her novel Mary; the moral equivalence that Austen drew between slavery and the treatment of women in British society in Mansfield Park follows one of Wollstonecraft's favorite arguments; and presentation of Anne Eliot in Persuasion as better qualified to manage her family estate than her father also echoes a thesis of Wollstonecraft.|$|E

As [...] "The Writing Person" [...] she is depicting herself as {{she was in the}} early 1920s, over 40 years of age and going to the folk dance classes run by the English Folk Dance Society in London. Once Mary-Dorothy Devine, first introduced in The Abbey Girls Again, becomes a writer, statements she <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> the writing experience must logically be those of Oxenham herself. She talks of [...] "finding" [...] the books, and of [...] "listening in to [...] private wireless".

2500|$|Griffin is {{sometimes}} {{the object of}} her own humor, {{particularly with regard to}} her D-list status. While Griffin paints herself as a Hollywood outsider, she has a group of close celebrity friends such as Rosie O'Donnell, Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Gloria Estefan, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel True, Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Anderson Cooper, Cher and Lance Bass. Griffin's longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between her and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, in which Griffin expressed anger over Hilton's [...] "outing" [...] of Bass on his website, calling Hilton's attacks on Bass [...] "mean" [...] and [...] "unfunny". Hilton responded by saying that Griffin's anger was hypocritical, considering all of the gay jokes she <b>makes</b> <b>about</b> Clay Aiken in her stand-up routines. In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends by saying, [...] "There's nothing I won't do, {{but on the other hand}} I'm full of shit because that changes. For example, you know Lance Bass from 'N Sync and how he's gay now? All those years that I knew he was gay, he and I were friends, I would never say, 'Hey, by the way, did you know that Lance Bass is gay?'" [...] Griffin and Hilton ended their feud after the death of Griffin's father, and Hilton appeared on an episode of her show in 2007. Yet in July 2008, he asserted that Griffin's assistant Jessica Zajicek had quit because she could not take Griffin's now hectic career. Griffin dismissed these statements as false as Zajicek is still working for Griffin. However, the season premiere of The D-List depicted that Zajicek was no longer working for Griffin; Griffin explained early in the episode that Zajicek [...] "has decided to move on".|$|E
