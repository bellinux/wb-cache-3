50|$|Gold {{showed that}} any {{language}} which {{is defined by}} a Turing <b>machine</b> <b>program</b> can be learned in the limit by another Turing-complete machine using enumeration. This {{is done by the}} learner testing all possible Turing machine programs in turn until one is found which is correct so far - this forms the hypothesis for the current step. Eventually, the correct program will be reached, after which the hypothesis will never change again (but note that the learner does not know that it won't need to change).|$|E
50|$|Language {{identification}} in {{the limit}} {{is a highly}} abstract model. It {{does not allow for}} limits of runtime or computer memory which can occur in practice, and the enumeration method may fail if there are errors in the input. However the framework is very powerful, because if these strict conditions are maintained, it allows the learning of any program known to be computable. This is because a Turing <b>machine</b> <b>program</b> can be written to mimic any program in any conventional programming language. See Church-Turing thesis.|$|E
5000|$|The above phrase {{computation}} as {{an evolution}} of the state differs markedly from the definition of Knuth and Stone—the [...] "algorithm" [...] as a Turing <b>machine</b> <b>program.</b> Rather, it corresponds to what Turing called the complete configuration (cf Turing's definition in Undecidable, p. 118) -- and includes both the current instruction (state) {{and the status of}} the tape. Kleene (1952) p. 375 where he shows an example of a tape with 6 symbols on it—all other squares are blank—and how to Gödelize its combined table-tape status.|$|E

50|$|Usually seen as {{the more}} extreme element of the Machine organization, Cypherites follow in the {{footsteps}} of Cypher, wanting to be reinserted into the Matrix as bluepills so that they may be blissfully unaware of the true nature of the Matrix as a computer program. The name of their hovercraft, Blue Dreamer, reflects this philosophy. They are currently led by Cryptos and his second-in-command, the Zion traitor, Veil. During the time that Cryptos was revealed to be a <b>Machine</b> <b>Program</b> inhabiting a redpill's body, Veil assumed control of the organization.|$|E
50|$|J9 is a Java Virtual <b>Machine</b> <b>program</b> {{developed}} by IBM. The J9 VM {{is the basis}} of multiple IBM Java offerings, including WebSphere Micro Edition, as well as the basis of all IBM Java Development kits since version 5. IBM has also made the J9 VM available to the Apache Harmony project for use in running their class libraries. However, while IBM previously provided JRE binaries for download for Windows, it stopped offering Windows versions of its Java JDK. As of IBM's current Java 8 versions, it is only packaging Win32/Win64 builds with WebSphere fixpaks. The only platforms for which IBM offers standalone JRE/JDK downloads are AIX, Linux, z/OS and IBM i (AS400).|$|E
50|$|The Human Race Machine (HRM) is a {{computerized}} console composed of four different programs. The Human Race <b>Machine</b> <b>program</b> allows participants {{to see themselves}} with the facial characteristics of six different races: Asian, White, African, Middle Eastern, and Indian, mapped onto their own face. The Age Machine allows viewers see an aged version {{of his or her}} face. A version of this methodology has been used for over twenty years by the FBI and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to help locate kidnap victims and missing children. The Couples Machine combines photographs of two people in different percentages to show the appearance of their child. The Anomaly Machine lets viewers see themselves with facial anomalies. The HRM was created by artist Nancy Burson and David Kramlich; it uses morphing technology. It was shown on Oprah on 2006-02-16.|$|E

5000|$|Iwrestledabearonce {{was formed}} during 2007 in Shreveport, Louisiana. The origin of this band's name was {{inspired}} by a comment made by Gary Busey on Comedy Central. They self-released Iwrestledabearonce EP in 2007 and later re-released it through Tragic Hero Records. The release gained the band a small cult following due to their highly experimental musical style. It also granted the band enough attention to acquire drummer, Ryan Pearson. Due to the band lacking a drummer during the EP's recording, all percussion was done in a drum <b>machine</b> <b>program.</b> Iwrestledabearonce signed to Century Media by 2008 after their inclusion on tours supporting the EP. The group then recorded and released their debut full-length album It's All Happening on June 2, 2009 in the USA and August 31, 2009 in European stores. In June through September 2008, their single, [...] "Tastes Like Kevin Bacon" [...] appeared on the Sirius Hard Attack radio station [...] "Devils Dozen" [...] list as high as No. 4 in the 12 most requested songs.|$|E
5000|$|CP-40 design: Pugh et al. write that: [...] "In 1964...IBM Research were recommending {{the use of}} virtual-machine {{principles}} to time-sharing planners...were {{picked up by the}} Cambridge CSC team, who wanted, among other things, a system capable of testing operating systems." [...] A key design decision, made by Creasy and Comeau at the end of 1964, was to base CP-40 not just on virtual memory but on virtual machines (at first called pseudo-machines, until the later term was appropriated from the IBM M44/44X project - which Creasy describes as having [...] "similar but independent ideas." [...] Creasy provides a clear description of CP's virtualization strategy, based on the S/360 instruction set, which consisted of privileged 'supervisor state' instructions distinct from normal 'problem state' instructions: [...] "Each CP virtual <b>machine</b> <b>program</b> is actually executed entirely in problem state.... Privileged instructions...are reproduced by CP within the virtual machines...." [...] By running an OS in problem state, all the 'tricky' instructions would automatically be intercepted by the hardware. This left just one main virtualization problem: memory references. [...] "Experience CTSS...suggested the need for dynamic program relocation...to break programs into pieces which could be moved into, out of, and within the memory independently of each other." ...|$|E
50|$|Psychologist Felipe de Brigard {{says that}} our intuitions about the {{experience}} machine may be affected by status quo bias, and suggests reformulating the thought experiment in a form which counters this. According to his version: {{you wake up in}} a plain white room. You are seated in a reclining chair with a steel contraption on your head. A woman in a white coat is standing over you. 'The year is 2659,' she explains, 'The life with which you are familiar is an experience <b>machine</b> <b>program</b> selected by you some forty years ago. We at IEM interrupt our client's programs at ten-year intervals to ensure client satisfaction. Our records indicate that at your three previous interruptions you deemed your program satisfactory and chose to continue. As before, if you choose to continue with your program you will return to your life as you know it with no recollection of this interruption. Your friends, loved ones, and projects will all be there. Of course, you may choose to terminate your program at this point if you are unsatisfied for any reason. Do you intend to continue with your program?If we feel differently about this version of the story compared to the form that Nozick offers, according to de Brigard this is due to status quo bias.|$|E
