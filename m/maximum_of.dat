40|$|We suggest two {{efficient}} algorithms for {{the detection}} of `perceptual significance' among the local <b>maxima</b> <b>of</b> a 1 -d signal. For an input function f(x) and an integer n, the first algorithm finds the n most significant <b>maxima</b> <b>of</b> f(x). The second algorithm finds all significant <b>maxima</b> <b>of</b> f(x), irrespective of their number. We represent an input signalf(x) as a G-graphG(f(x)), the vertices of which represent the `lumps' of the graph of f(x). G(f(x)) is gradually reduced via a `small leaf' trimming procedure, resulting in a sequence of graphs that give a hierarchy of representations of f(x) such that the leaves of `deeper' graphs correspond to more significant <b>maxima</b> <b>of</b> f(x). Based on this hierarchy, we introduce a measure of `perceptual significance' among the <b>maxima</b> <b>of</b> f(x). Experimental results are presented. 1.
