5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the <b>microfilming</b> of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E

50|$|Libraries {{began using}} {{microfilm}} in the mid-20th {{century as a}} preservation strategy for deteriorating newspaper collections. Books and newspapers that were deemed in danger of decay could be preserved on film and thus access and use could be increased. <b>Microfilming</b> was also a space-saving measure. In his 1945 book, The Scholar and the Future of the Research Library, Fremont Rider calculated that research libraries were doubling in space every sixteen years. His suggested solution was <b>microfilming,</b> specifically with his invention, the microcard. Once items were put onto film, they could be removed from circulation and additional shelf space would be made available for rapidly expanding collections. The microcard was superseded by microfiche. By the 1960s, <b>microfilming</b> had become standard policy.|$|E
