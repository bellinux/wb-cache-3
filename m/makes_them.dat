5|$|Starfish {{also have}} an unusual ability to expel foreign objects from their bodies, which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> {{difficult}} to tag for research tracking purposes.|$|E
5|$|Swimming {{bacteria}} frequently move near 10 body lengths {{per second}} {{and a few}} as fast as 100. This <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> at least as fast as fish, on a relative scale.|$|E
5|$|Their {{habit of}} preying on bees <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> a {{nuisance}} to bee-keepers, but farmers attract {{them to their}} fields using artificial perches in fields {{to encourage them to}} feed on pest insects.|$|E

5|$|Any form {{of muscle}} damage of {{sufficient}} severity can cause rhabdomyolysis. Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. Some have an underlying muscle condition, usually hereditary in nature, that <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> {{more prone to}} rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|Coal balls often {{preserve}} a remarkable {{record of the}} microscopic tissue structure of Carboniferous swamp and mire plants, which {{would otherwise have been}} completely destroyed. Their unique preservation of Carboniferous plants <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> valuable to scientists, who cut and peel the coal balls to research the geological past.|$|E
5|$|Disability sport's major {{classification}} body, the IPC, {{is working}} on improving classification {{to be more of}} an evidence-based system, as opposed to a performance-based system, so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> appear in a higher class compared to competitors who train less.|$|E
50|$|They Don't <b>Make</b> <b>Them</b> Like They Used To (also {{referred}} to as They Don't <b>Make</b> <b>'Em...)</b> is the nineteenth studio album by country superstar Kenny Rogers.|$|R

5|$|Five sculptors {{executed}} {{a total of}} thirteen such scenes, {{not only on the}} front and back walls of zoo buildings, but also on all four sides of both brick entrance shelters at Flatbush Avenue. However, the positioning of some of the bas-reliefs <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> less accessible than others.|$|E
5|$|Glass fibers {{are useful}} thermal {{insulators}} {{because of their}} high ratio of surface area to weight. However, the increased surface area <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> much more susceptible to chemical attack. By trapping air within them, blocks of glass fiber make good thermal insulation, with a thermal conductivity {{of the order of}} 0.05 W/(mÂ·K).|$|E
5|$|Group 3 {{elements}} are generally hard metals with low aqueous solubility, and have low availability to the biosphere. No group 3 element has any documented biological role in living organisms. The radioactivity of the actinides generally <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> highly toxic to living cells, causing radiation poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Sporterising, sporterisation, or sporterization {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of modifying military-type firearms either to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> suitable for civilian sporting use or to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> legal under the law.|$|R

5|$|In China, {{cockroaches}} {{have become}} popular as medicine and cockroach farming is rising. The cockroaches are fried {{twice in a}} wok of hot oil, which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> crispy with soft innards that are like cottage cheese. Fried cockroaches are ground and sold as pills for stomach, heart and liver diseases.|$|E
5|$|Rodents have {{advanced}} cognitive abilities. They can quickly learn to avoid poisoned baits, which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> difficult pests to deal with. Guinea pigs can learn and remember complex pathways to food. Squirrels and kangaroo rats {{are able to}} locate caches of food by spatial memory, rather than just by smell.|$|E
5|$|Some American {{alligators}} {{are missing}} an inhibited gene for melanin, which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> albino. These American alligators are extremely rare and {{almost impossible to}} find in the wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} is {{the production}} of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments. For example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often iridescent.|$|E
5|$|The puffbirds {{are related}} to the jacamars and have the same range, but lack the {{iridescent}} colors of that family. They are mainly brown, rufous, or gray, with large heads and flattened bills with hooked tips. The loose abundant plumage and short tails <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> look stout and puffy, giving rise to the English common name of the family.|$|E
5|$|Their {{reproduction}} is both rapid and profuse. The {{combination of a}} high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer ability <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> highly adaptable, and able to survive in new environments, including outer space. They form {{an essential part of}} the planetary ecosystem. However, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.|$|E
60|$|As {{to their}} height, {{they were both}} alike; but {{equality}} in height can no more <b>make</b> <b>them</b> the same, than can a twenty years' age in two, <b>make</b> <b>them</b> {{one and the same}} person.|$|R

5|$|Their {{sensitivity}} to water quality also <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> suitable for bioassays.

5|$|There {{are various}} {{other types of}} geysers which are {{different}} in nature compared to the normal steam-driven geysers. These geysers differ not only in their style of eruption {{but also in the}} cause that <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> erupt.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory that}} they were {{descendants}} of a 2nd-century chieftain called Kandachaliki Remmanaka, a feudatory of the Andhra Ikshvaku (from an Ikshvaku inscription of the 2nd century) was put forward. This according to Kamath has failed to explain the difference in lineage. The Kandachaliki feudatory call themselves Vashisthiputras of the Hiranyakagotra. The Chalukyas, however, address themselves as Harithiputras of Manavyasagotra in their inscriptions, {{which is the same}} lineage as their early overlords, the Kadambas of Banavasi. This <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> descendants of the Kadambas. The Chalukyas took control of the territory formerly ruled by the Kadambas.|$|E
