500|$|The Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum, [...] ) is {{a species}} of venomous lizard native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexican state of Sonora. A heavy, {{typically}} slow-moving lizard, up to [...] long, the Gila monster is the only venomous lizard native to the United States and {{one of only two}} known species of venomous lizards in North America, the other being its close relative, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (H. horridum). Though the Gila monster is venomous, its sluggish nature means it represents little threat to humans. However, it has earned a fearsome reputation and is sometimes killed despite being protected by state law in Arizona.|$|E
500|$|Though the Gila monster is venomous, its laggard {{movement}} {{means it}} poses little threat to humans. However, it {{has earned a}} fearsome reputation and is often killed by humans because of fear. Among Native American tribes, the Gila monster had a mixed standing. The Apache believed its breath could kill a man, and the Tohono O'Odham and the Pima believed it possessed a spiritual power that could cause sickness. In contrast, the Seri and the Yaqui believed the Gila monster's hide had healing properties. The Gila monster has even starred as a monster in a B movie, The Giant Gila Monster (though the titular monster was actually portrayed by a <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard).</b> It played a minor role in the motion picture The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. [...] Myths about the animal include that the animal's breath is toxic enough to kill humans, that it can spit venom and that it can leap several {{feet in the air}} to attack. Another myth held that the Gila monster did not have an anus and therefore expelled waste from its mouth, the source of its venom and [...] "fetid breath". The official mascot of [...] Eastern Arizona College located in Thatcher, Arizona, is Gila Hank, a gun-toting, cowboy-hat-wearing Gila monster. A similar character as an old western outlaw was seen in 2011 animated film Rango, called Bad Bill; the character was voiced by Ray Winstone.|$|E

40|$|Seasonal {{resource}} scarcity {{in the tropical}} deciduous forest (TDF) forces many animals, including <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards,</b> to take refuge in the soil for extended periods of time. To investigate which characteristics may be ideal when resources are less abundant, we measured soil characteristics in habitats used by <b>Mexican</b> <b>Beaded</b> <b>Lizardâ€™s</b> (Heloderma horridum) in the TDF of Jalisco, Mexico. Utilizing a Brownian Bridge Kernel Density Estimation to identify activity centers in both wet and dry season sites, fourteen soil samples were collected in areas where <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> have been observed or had a high probability of being observed. The soil characteristics measured include soil permeability, percent water content, sediment size distribution, and color. Measured habitat characteristics include percent canopy cover, slope, and height of primary vegetation. All samples were collected and measured in the dry season, March 2014. Results indicate that dry and wet season soils differ in sediment size, slope, percent water, and color indicating that soil used in the dry season is different from soil used in the wet. Another notable observation was that all dry season sites had oxidized soil (determined by red color), whereas the wet season sites showed no pattern with respect to soil color...|$|R

40|$|Although adenoviruses (AdVs) {{have been}} found {{in a wide variety of}} reptiles, {{including}} numerous squamate species, turtles, and crocodiles, the number of reptilian adenovirus isolates is still scarce. The only fully sequenced reptilian adenovirus, snake adenovirus 1 (SnAdV- 1), belongs to the Atadenovirus genus. Recently, two new atadenoviruses were isolated from a captive Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> (Heloderma horridum). Here we report the full genomic and proteomic characterization of the latter, designated lizard adenovirus 2 (LAdV- 2). The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome of LAdV- 2 is 32, 965 bp long, with an average G+C content of 44. 16 %. The overall arrangement and gene content of the LAdV- 2 genome were largely concordant with those in other atadenoviruses, except for four novel open reading frames (ORFs) at the right end of the genome. Phylogeny reconstructions and plesiomorphic traits shared with SnAdV- 1 further supported the assignment of LAdV- 2 to the Atadenovirus genus. Surprisingly, two fiber genes were found for the first time in an atadenovirus. After optimizing the production of LAdV- 2 in cell culture, we determined the protein compositions of the virions. The two fiber genes produce two fiber proteins of different sizes that are incorporated into the viral particles. Interestingly, the two different fiber proteins assemble as either one short or three long fiber projections per vertex. Stoichiometry estimations indicate that the long fiber triplet is present at only one or two vertices per virion. Neither triple fibers nor a mixed number of fibers per vertex had previously been reported for adenoviruses or any other virus...|$|R
40|$|Although {{reptiles}} {{are well}} known for their low energy requirements and high efficiencies of biomass conversion, few studies have addressed the ecology and energetics of species with very low activity levels. I investigated the ecology and energetics of two such reptilian groups: helodermatid lizards, and viperid snakes. I radiotracked <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> and three rattlesnake species in their natural environments to determine their activity patterns, the time and energy they invest in activity, home ranges, thermal biology, habitat and other resource use, and behavior. I measured metabolic rates in the laboratory to determine rates of energy use. <b>Beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> had a mean home range of 21. 6 ha, an activity peak at 1800 hrs and traveled, on average, 25. 3 km during approximately 121 h of surface activity over the year. They had very low metabolic rates during rest. However, helodermatids had maximal rates of oxygen consumption that were among the highest of any lizard measured, a trait that may be adaptive during their intensive male-male agonistic behaviors. Males had significantly higher capacities for aerobic activity than did females. Heloderma horridum can fulfill its annual maintenance energy requirements with a quantity of prey equivalent to approximately 1. 4 times its body mass. Rattlesnakes had a mean home range size of 4. 6 hectares and traveled, on average, 12. 4 km over approximately 95 hours of annual surface activity. Rattlesnakes spent considerable time inactive on the surface, whereas Heloderma spent {{the vast majority of}} their time resting in shelters. Heloderma and Crotalus had similar body temperature preferences for activity (around 30 C). Like Heloderma, Crotalus had very low rates of metabolism during rest. A 300 -g rattlesnake had a standard metabolic rate only 40 % that of other squamate reptiles of similar mass, and could fulfill its yearly maintenance energy requirements with a prey quantity equivalent to 0. 93 x its body mass, which could be met with 2 - 3 large meals. After feeding, free-ranging rattlesnakes exhibited thermophilic responses that varied, in part, due to their reclusive behavior, and thermal constraints in the environment. The temperatures selected for digesting and activity are apparently similar in rattlesnakes...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (Heloderma horridum) is {{the most}} famous of the four species of venomous beaded lizards found principally in Mexico and {{southern}} Guatemala. They and their congener (member of the same genus) the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) are the only lizards known to have evolved an overt venom delivery system. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is larger than the Gila monster, with duller coloration, black with yellowish bands. As it is a specialized predator that feeds primarily upon eggs, the primary use of its venom is still a source of debate among scientists. However, this venom has been found to contain several enzymes useful for manufacturing drugs in the treatment of diabetes, and research on the pharmacological use of its venom is ongoing.|$|E

The effects included a live <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (not an actual Gila monster) filmed on a scaled-down model landscape. The movie is considered a cult classic.|$|E
50|$|Until 2006 it {{was thought}} that among lizards, only the Gila monster and the <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> were venomous. However, several species of monitor lizards, {{including}} the Komodo dragon, produce powerful venom in their oral glands. Lace monitor venom, for instance, causes swift loss of consciousness and extensive bleeding through its pharmacological effects, both lowering blood pressure and preventing blood clotting. Nine classes of toxin known from snakes are produced by lizards. The range of actions provides the potential for new medicinal drugs based on lizard venom proteins.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> {{have one}} close living relative, the Gila monster (H. suspectum), {{as well as}} many extinct {{relatives}} in the Helodermatidae, whose genetic history may {{be traced back to the}} Cretaceous period.

[...] Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia, and Australia, the wide geographical separation and unique features not found in the varanids indicate the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is better placed in a separate family.|$|R

50|$|The saliva of the {{northern}} short-tailed shrew contains a kallikrein-like protease, used to paralyze and subdue its prey. The toxin {{is strong enough to}} kill small animals, up to sizes somewhat larger than the shrew itself, and results in painful bites to humans who attempt to handle the shrew. The venomous saliva is secreted from submaxillary glands, through a duct which opens {{at the base of the}} lower incisors, where the saliva flows along the groove formed by the two incisors, and into the prey. The toxin is very similar in structure to the one produced by the <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (Heloderma horridum) which independently developed its toxin from the same precursor protein.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> H. horridum {{is found}} in Mexico, from Sonora to Oaxaca. The Rio Fuerte beaded lizard (H. exasperatum) is found from {{southern}} Sonora to northern Sinaloa. The Chiapan beaded lizard (H. alvarezi) {{is found in}} the northern Chiapas and the depression of the RÃ­o Lagartero in Huehuetenango to northwestern Guatemala. The ranges of these three species overlap, making them sympatric. The Guatemalan beaded lizard (H. charlesbogerti) is the only allopatric one, separated from the nearest population (H. alvarezi) by 250 km of unsuitable habitat. The Guatemalan beaded lizard is the most endangered of the species, if not of all lizards; it is found only in the dry valley of the RÃ­o Motagua in northeastern Guatemala; less than 200 are believed to exist in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The venom glands of the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> are {{modified}} {{salivary glands}} {{located in the}} reptile's lower jaw. Each gland has a separate duct leading {{to the base of}} its grooved teeth. When biting, the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> hangs on its victim and chews to get its venomous saliva into the wound. Although its jaw grip is strong, its unsocketed teeth are easily broken off at their bases. The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard's</b> venom is a weak hemotoxin, and although human deaths are rare, it can cause respiratory failure. It consists of a number of components, including L-amino acid oxidase, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A, serotonin, and highly active kallikreins that release vasoactive kinins. The venom contains no enzymes that significantly affect coagulation. Almost all documented human bites (eight in the past century) have resulted from prodding captive lizards with a finger or bare foot.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is a {{specialized}} vertebrate nest predator, feeding primarily on bird and reptile eggs.

Unlike many other lizards, this tail does not autotomize and cannot grow back if broken. The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> has a forked, black tongue which it uses to smell, {{with the help of a}} Jacobson's organ; it sticks its tongue out to gather scents and touches it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted.|$|R
