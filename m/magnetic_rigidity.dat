It is found that the intensity ratios vary markedly from event to event, particularly during the time history of the individual events. This implies that the ratios have no simple relationship to 'solar abundances' in the usual sense of the term. The pattern of the variability of each ratio is established; the ratio of He to ions with Z not smaller than 3 starts with a low value and increases as the event proceeds. The H/He ratio exhibits a qualitatively similar time history with marked relative enhancement of He early in an event.

Cosmogenic nuclides are used to study the histories of meteorites and lunar samples.

In almost all of these cases, the spectra of incident GCR particles are fairly similar, with only some modulation by the Sun over an 11 -year cycle. Strong magnetic fields can seriously affect the energy spectrum of GCR particles hitting the surface of objects inside the magnetic fields.

40|$|A heavy-ion {{storage ring}} can be {{operated}} as an isochronous mass spectrometer {{with a particular}} ion-optical setting. However, the isochronism condition cannot be fulfilled for all the stored ions due to the large momentum acceptance of the ring, which restricts the measurement precision. Although this anisochronism effect can be corrected for by measuring the velocity of each ion with two time-of-flight detectors, the number of admissible ions is severely limited by this detection technique. As a complementary approach, it is proposed to measure the <b>magnetic</b> <b>rigidities</b> of the circulating ions non-interceptively with an intensity-sensitive and a position-resolving cavity jointly to overcome this limitation. Moreover, this approach also enables simultaneous lifetime measurements of the stored ions. In this dissertation, the correction method for the anisochronism effect with a cavity doublet is outlined. An innovative design of the position cavity is then introduced, which offsets the cavity from the central orbit and exploits the resonant monopole mode. Based on this concept, a rectangular and an elliptic cavity are investigated by analytic and numerical means {{in compliance with the}} machine parameters of the Collector Ring. Afterwards, two scaled prototypes are tested on an automatic test bench with great efficiency and accuracy. The results are then compared with the simulations and found to be in good agreement...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{separation}} of short-lived isotopes produced in heavy-ion-induced fusion reactions {{is a powerful}} and well know method and often applied in investigations of the heaviest elements, called the transactinides (Z>= 104). By extracting these isotopes from a recoil separator, they can be made available for transport to setups located outside the heavily shielded irradiation position such as chemistry setups. This physical preseparation technique overcomes many limitations currently faced in the chemical investigation of transactinides. Here we describe the basic principle using relatively short-lived isotopes of the lighter group 4 elements zirconium (Zr) and hafnium (Hf) that are used as analogs of the lightest transactinide element, rutherfordium (Rf, element 104). The Zr and Hf isotopes were produced at the LBNL 88 -Inch Cyclotron using a cocktail of 18 O and 50 Ti beams and the appropriate targets.
