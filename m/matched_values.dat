The speed of sound, acoustic attenuation, and optical reduced scattering coefficients were measured on specimens sampled at various locations in a large phantom. In general, the properties <b>matched</b> <b>values</b> quoted for breast tissue. But while acoustic properties were relatively homogeneous, the reduced scattering was substantially different at the surface compared with the interior.

Among the important findings are: The moving bolt heads generate much of the heat in a coupling guard; Properly placed outlet ports can use the bolt heads as a blower, increasing air flow through the coupling guard and lowering the temperature; Small reductions in exhaust pressure can lower the coupling guard surface temperature significantly.

This study hypothesized that the different actions of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) anti-bodies, both stimulating and blocking activities in Graves ’ disease patients might oppositely impact bone turnover. Newly diagnosed premenopausal Graves ’ disease patients were enrolled (n = 93) and divided into two groups: patients with TSHR antibodies with thyroid-stimulating activity (stimulating activity group, n = 83) and patients with TSHR antibodies with thyroid-stimulating activity combined with blocking activity (blocking activity group, n = 10). From the stimulating activity group, patients who had <b>matched</b> <b>values</b> for free T 4 and TSH binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII) to the blocking activity group were further clas-sified as stimulating activity-matched control (n = 11). Bone turnover markers BS-ALP, Osteocalcin, and C-telopeptide were significantly lower in the blocking activity group than in the stimulating activity or stimulating activity-matched control groups. The TBII level showed positive correlations with BS-ALP and osteocalcin levels in the stimulating activity group, while it had a negative correlation with the osteocalcin level in the blocking activity group. In conclusion, the activation of TSHR antibody-activated TSH signaling contributes to high bone turnover, independent of the actions of thyroid hormone, and thyroid-stimulation block-ing antibody has protective effects against bone metabolism in Graves ’ disease...|$|E

40|$|Coarse-grained {{theories}} of dense polymer liquids such as block copolymer melts predict a universal dependence of equilibrium properties {{on a few}} dimensionless parameters. For symmetric diblock copolymer melts, such theories predict a universal dependence on only chi N and Nbar, where chi is an effective interaction parameter, N is a degree of polymerization, and Nbar {{is a measure of}} overlap. We test whether simulation results for the structure factor S(q) obtained from several different simulation models are consistent with this two-parameter scaling hypothesis. We compare results from three models: (1) a lattice Monte Carlo model, the bond-fluctuation model, (2) a bead-spring model with harsh repulsive interactions, similar to that of Kremer and Grest, and (3) a bead-spring model with very soft repulsion between beads, and strongly overlapping beads. We compare results from pairs of simulations of different models that have been designed to have <b>matched</b> <b>values</b> of Nbar, over a range of values of chi N and N, and devise methods to test the scaling hypothesis without relying on any prediction for how the phenomenological interaction parameter chi depends on more microscopic parameters.

40|$|The {{photosphere}} {{provides an}} important boundary condition for prominence support. The conservation of photospheric flux (sometimes called line tying) sets a serious constraint {{on the evolution}} of coronal magnetic fields. This boundary condition can only be communicated to the prominence by Alfvén and magneto-acoustic waves. As a result, the boundary condition as experienced by the prominence at height h lags behind a time h/υA (υA: Alfvénspeed) as compared to the instantaneous situation at the location of the photosphere. In this paper I study vertical oscillations and stability of prominences, taking retardation effects into account. An equation of motion for a Kuperus-Raadu prominence is derived, describing the prominence as a line current and the photosphere as a perfectly conducting plate. Solving this equation of motion implies solving the full time-dependent Maxwell equations, thus guaranteeing a realistic field evolution under the assumption of photospheric line tying. In terms of the currents that flow, such a description is equivalent to the corresponding MHD picture. The results indicate that the travel time h/υA is an important parameter of the system as it influences the decay or growth times of prominence oscillations greatly. A new kind of instability is found, whereby the prominence experiences oscillations growing in time, even in the nonlinear regime. This instability occurs when the travel time h/υA is comparable to or greater than the oscillation period. Also, forced oscillations can only be significant for rather precisely <b>matched</b> <b>values</b> of h/υA and the driving period...|$|E
40|$|Seedbanks are {{expected}} to buffer populations against disturbances, such as fire, that could alter the genetic composition of smaller, ephemeral adult populations. However, seedling genotypes {{may be influenced by}} the spatially heterogeneous nature of both the seedbank and the disturbance (for example, germination may vary with local disturbance) and also by selection acting on germination and post-germination performance. We used microsatellite-DNA surveys of seedlings emerging from the soil-stored seedbanks of Grevillea macleayana after wildfire to compare diversity and spatial structure in seedlings and adults, and through resampling of the seedling data set, to determine whether the resultant adult population reflected the effects of selection or random seedling mortality. The large post-fire seedling cohorts captured the full allelic diversity of the pre-fire adult population. However, we found a mismatch in the genotypic structure of adults and seedlings. Seedlings displayed larger heterozygous deficits than adults; however, over the ensuing 11 years, seedling heterozygosity eventually <b>matched</b> <b>values</b> for the pre-fire adults. Increasing heterozygosity among adults has generally been attributed to heterosis and/or reduction in Wahlund effects via self-thinning. Resampling of early post-fire seedlings to generate samples of equivalent size to survivors at 11 years showed that increases in heterozygosity must be driven by selection favouring outcrossed seed. This finding is important in an evolutionary context but also has implications for the restoration of natural or managed populations where a seedbank is a viable source of recruits...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Gluten-free diet (GFD) {{presents}} {{the basis of}} coeliac disease (CD) treatment. If strictly applied, the disorders of the small bowel mucosa and other disease signs rapidly resolve. Objective. The goal {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of GFD on the growth and nutritional status of children with the classical form of CD. In addition, we analyzed the differences between these parameters with the duration and the patients' compliance with GFD. Methods. The study goals were achieved on a sample of 90 children, 56 female and 34 male, aged 0. 5 - 7. 5 (1. 53 ± 1. 05) years, with the classic CD diagnosed on the basis of typical pathohistological findings of the small bowel mucosa and clinical recovery of patients on GFD. The duration of the patients' follow-up was 1. 08 - 8. 75 (3. 03 ± 1. 14) years, i. e. until the age of 2. 5 - 15 (4. 59 ± 1. 78) years. The initial and control values of body height (BH) in relation to <b>matched</b> <b>values</b> for age and gender were expressed in percentiles, while the deviation in body weight (BW) for the <b>matched</b> <b>values</b> of height and gender was expressed in percentages. The referent haemoglobin (Hb) rate in blood, as a laboratory indicator of nutritional status in children aged up to 5 years was ≥ 110 g/L, and for those aged above 5 years it was ≥ 115 g/L. Compliance with GFD was based on the pathohistological findings of the small bowel mucosa or determination of tissue transglutaminase. Results. Over the studied period, the effect of GFD was highly significant, both on the increase of BH percentiles (37. 62 ± 26. 26 vs. 57. 22 ± 25. 29; p< 0. 001), and on the decrease of BW deficit 11. 58 ± 10. 80 vs. 0. 89 ± 8. 194; p< 0. 001). After the treatment period, none of the children showed slowed growth rate or BW deficit above 20 %, while BW deviation ranging between 10 - 20 % in relation to the referent values was registered in 17 (18. 19 %) and the excess of over 20 % in 2 patients. In 86 (95. 56 %) patients, control Hb values in blood were normal, while mild anaemia was registered in 4 patients, all compliant with GFD. The difference between the compliant and non-compliant patients with GFD was not detected either in BH percentiles (p= 0. 586) or in BW percentage deviation as compared to standard values (p= 0. 516) or in blood Hb values (p= 0. 445). In addition, differences between the children on GFD lasting over and below 3 years were not detected either in BH percentiles (p= 0. 915) or in BW deviation percentages in relation to the ideal rate (p= 0. 476). Conclusion. GFD applied for 1 - 3 years has a highly significant effect on the growth rate and nutritional status of children with the classical form of CD. Significant differences in these parameters of the disease were not detected between strictly compliant and non-compliant patients on GFD...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To explore {{musculoskeletal}} {{findings in}} patients with cervicogenic dizziness and how these findings relate to pain and dizziness. To study treatment effects and long-term symptom progress. Method. Twenty-two patients (20 women, 2 men; mean age 37 years) with suspected cervicogenic dizziness underwent a structured physical examination before and after physiotherapy guided by the musculoskeletal findings. Questionnaires {{were sent to the}} patients six months and two years after treatment. Results. Dorsal neck muscle tenderness and tightness was found in a majority of the patients. Zygapophyseal joint tenderness was found at all cervical levels. Cervical range of motion was equal to or larger than expected age and gender <b>matched</b> <b>values.</b> The cervico-thoracic region was often hypomobile. Most patients had postural imbalance. Dynamic stabilization capacity was reduced. Suboccipital muscles tightness correlated with posture imbalance and poor neck stability. The treatment resulted in reduced tenderness in levator scapula, high and middle paraspinal and temporalis muscles and zygapophyseal joints at C 4 -C 7 and increased cervico-thoracic mobility. Reduction of middle paraspinal muscle tenderness correlated with neck pain relief. Postural alignment improved, as did dynamic stabilization in trunk, neck and shoulders. After 6 months, 13 of the 17 patients had still no or less neck pain and 14 had no or less dizziness. After 2 years, 7 patients had no or less neck pain and 11 no or less dizziness. Conclusion. Patients with suspected cervicogenic dizziness have some musculoskeletal findings in common.

40|$|At {{a former}} wood {{preservation}} plant severely contaminated with coal tar oil, in situ bulk attenuation and biodegradation rate constants for several monoaromatic (BTEX) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were determined using (1) classical first order decay models, (2) Michaelis–Menten degradation kinetics (MM), and (3) stable carbon isotopes, for o -xylene and naphthalene. The first order bulk attenuation rate constant for o -xylene was calculated to be 0. 0025 d − 1 and a novel stable isotope-based first order model, which also {{accounted for the}} respective redox conditions, resulted in a slightly smaller biodegradation rate constant of 0. 0019 d − 1. Based on MM-kinetics, the o -xylene concentration decreased with a maximum rate of k max = 0. 1 μg/L/d. The bulk attenuation rate constant of naphthalene retrieved from the classical first order decay model was 0. 0038 d − 1. The stable isotope-based biodegradation rate constant of 0. 0027 d − 1 was smaller in the reduced zone, while residual naphthalene in the oxic part of the plume further downgradient was degraded {{at a higher rate}} of 0. 0038 d − 1. With MM-kinetics a maximum degradation rate of k max = 12 μg/L/d was determined. Although best fits were obtained by MM-kinetics, we consider the carbon stable isotope-based approach more appropriate as it is specific for biodegradation (not overall attenuation) {{and at the same time}} accounts for the dominant electron-accepting process.

Following Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, we assessed the analytical performances of the Pathfast (R) (Mitsubishi, Japan) cTnI method. Methods: We evaluated different sample types. Control materials and lithium heparin plasma pools were used to determine: limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), imprecision and linearity. The effects of potential endogenous interfering substances {{and the possibility of}} falsely increased cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations attributable to the presence of heterophilic antibodies (HA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) in high concentrations were evaluated. The 99 th percentile limit of the cTnI value distribution was determined from 320 Caucasian reference individuals. Results: No significant differences were found when cTnI concentrations of 40 lithium-heparin plasma samples were compared with the <b>matched</b> <b>values</b> of K(2) -EDTA plasma, whole blood and serum samples. The LoB and the LoD of the cTnI method were 0. 0048 and 0. 0066 mu g/L, respectively. cTnI mean values from 0. 66 to 6. 0 mu g/L showed a total CV% from 6. 0 to 6. 4. cTnI at a concentration of 0. 02 mu g/L was associated with a total CV of 9. 6 %. The method gave a linear response for cTnI concentrations within the measurement range. In six of 12 samples containing HA, a positive interference was demonstrated.

To produce smooth and detailed disparity maps, two assumptions that were originally proposed by Marr and Poggio are adopted: uniqueness and continuity. That is, the disparity maps {{have a unique}} value per pixel and are continuous almost everywhere. These assumptions are enforced within a three-dimensional array of <b>match</b> <b>values</b> in disparity space. Each <b>match</b> <b>value</b> corresponds to a pixel in an image and a disparity relative to another image. An iterative algorithm updates the <b>match</b> <b>values</b> by diffusing support among neighboring values and inhibiting others along similar lines of sight. By applying the uniqueness assumption, occluded regions can be explicitly identified. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} algorithm, we present the processing results from synthetic and real image pairs, including ones with ground-truth values for quantitative comparison with other methods.

30|$|This {{subsection}} {{explains a}} generalized algorithm that combines <b>matching</b> and missing <b>values</b> globally. It consists of Match and Miss algorithms. The Match algorithm computes the <b>matching</b> <b>value</b> between two taxonomy trees by traversing {{from top to}} bottom and computes from bottom to top recursively. However, Miss algorithm computes missing value as average simplicity values of missing trees between two taxonomy trees. Finally, the <b>matching</b> and missing <b>values</b> are combined globally using the generalized formula.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} model of data {{provision}} and data pricing. A single data provider controls a large database that contains information about the <b>match</b> <b>value</b> between individual consumers and individual 8 ̆ 5 rms (advertisers). Advertisers seek to tailor their spending to the individual <b>match</b> <b>value.</b> The data provider prices queries about individual consumers characteristics (cookies). We determine the equilibrium data acquisition and pricing policies. Advertisers choose positive and/or negative target-ing policies. The optimal query price inuences {{the composition of the}} targeted set. The price of data decreases with the reach of the database and increases with the fragmentation of data sales...|$|R
