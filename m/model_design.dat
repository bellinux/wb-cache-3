These models provide archaeologists with valuable information regarding seafaring technology and the sociological and economic importance of seafaring. In spite of how helpful ancient boat and ship models are to archaeologists, they are not always easily or correctly interpreted due to artists’ mistakes, ambiguity in the <b>model</b> <b>design,</b> and wear and tear over the centuries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since the <b>modeling</b> <b>design</b> {{of table}} lamp is ignored {{for a long}} time, this paper {{analyzes}} the significance of <b>modeling</b> <b>design</b> of table lamp. In view of the existing design problems of traditional table lamp, this paper states the function of <b>modeling</b> <b>design</b> of table lamp, the color of table lamp, the shape and texture effect of table lamp, among them the function mainly expounds its using function and artistic function, the color emphasizes the harmonization, and the shape and texture effect indicates {{that it should be}} different according to the different target people. Furthermore, the Era characteristics of <b>modeling</b> <b>design</b> of table lamp are analyzed. At last, the corresponding summary is made...|$|R

25|$|The United States' {{entry into}} World War II impeded Baldwin's Diesel {{development}} program when the War Production Board dictated that Alco and Baldwin produce only steamers and Diesel-electric yard switching engines. Electro-Motive Division (EMD) was assigned {{the task of}} producing road freight Diesels (namely, the FT series). EMD's distinct advantage over its competitors in that product line {{in the years that}} followed World War II, due to the head start in diesel R and production, is beyond doubt, however, assigning it solely to WPB directives is questionable. Longtime GM chairman Alfred P. Sloan presented a timeline in his memoir that belies this assumption, saying that GM's diesel-engine R efforts of the 1920s and 1930s, and its application of <b>model</b> <b>design</b> standardization (yielding lower unit costs) and marketing lessons learned in the automotive industry, were the principal reason for EMD's competitive advantage in the late 1940s and afterward (clearly implying that the wartime production assignments were merely nails in a coffin that Baldwin and Lima had already built for themselves before the war). In his telling, the R needed to adapt earlier Diesels (best suited to marine and stationary use) to locomotive use (smaller; higher power-to-weight ratio; more reliable given more vibration and less maintenance) was a capital-intensive project that almost no one among the railroad owners or locomotive builders was willing (latter) or able (former) to invest in during the 1920s and 1930s, save the people of Winton, Electro-Motive, and Charles F. Kettering of the GM Research Corporation.|$|E
500|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) was {{responsible}} for The Voyage Homes <b>model</b> <b>design</b> and optical effects. The alien probe was the responsibility of ILM's model shop, which brought in outside help like illustrator Ralph McQuarrie for concept art. The modelmakers started with art director Nilo Rodis' basic design, a simple cylinder with whalelike qualities. The prototype was covered with barnacles and colored. The ball-shaped antenna that juts out {{from the bottom of}} the probe was created out of a piece of irrigation pipe; internal machinery turned the device. Three sizes of the [...] "whale probe" [...] were created; the primary [...] probe model was supplemented by a smaller model for wide shots and a large [...] model that used forced perspective to give the probe the illusion of massive dimensions.|$|E
2500|$|Wren's design {{developed}} through five general stages. The first survives {{only as a}} single drawing {{and part of a}} model. The scheme (usually called the First <b>Model</b> <b>Design)</b> appears to have consisted of a circular domed vestibule (possibly based on the Pantheon in Rome) and a rectangular church of basilica form. The plan may have been influenced by the Temple Church. It was rejected because it was not thought [...] "stately enough" [...] Wren's second design was a Greek cross, which was thought by the clerics not to fulfil the requirements of Anglican liturgy.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{incarnation}} of the Tumbler was proposed by Nolan after he built a proof-of-concept <b>model</b> <b>design</b> out of Play-Doh - a model he admitted looked [...] "very very crude, more like a croissant than a car". Nathan Crowley, one of the production designers for Batman Begins, then started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by model bashing based on that shape. One of the parts that Crowley used to create the vehicle was the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the car's jet engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Andy Smith, carved a full-size replica of the vehicle out of a large block of Styrofoam, which was a process that lasted two months.|$|E
2500|$|In {{analog circuit}} design, the current-control view is {{sometimes}} used {{because it is}} approximately linear. That is, the collector current is approximately [...] times the base current. Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the emitter–base voltage is approximately constant, and that collector current is beta times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control (for example, Ebers–Moll) model is required. The voltage-control model requires an exponential function {{to be taken into}} account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the Ebers–Moll <b>model,</b> <b>design</b> for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For translinear circuits, in which the exponential I–V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose transconductance is proportional to their collector current. In general, transistor-level circuit design is performed using SPICE or a comparable analog circuit simulator, so model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer.|$|E
