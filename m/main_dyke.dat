40|$|Monzonorites, {{members of}} the anorthositic suite of rocks, are usually {{considered}} as residual after the formation of massif-type anorthosites. In Rogaland (S. W. Norway) they occur as large dykes, intrusions and chilled margins to differentiated massifs, emplaced during and soon after the main anorthosite massifs, in granulite facies conditions. Ti, P and Fe are enriched in monzonorites and steadily decrease towards quartz mangerites, the FeO/FeO+MgO ratios varying slightly during alkali enrichment (Bowen trend). Trace element spidergrams show deep troughs in Rb, Th, Nb-Ta, Sr, Zr-Hf and Ti. The REE slightly decrease in the evolution with (La/Yb) N ratios about 9 and neutral to positive Eu anomalies. Several occurrences, however, show highly contrasted trace element features. Sr isotope ratios (ISr) show a wide interval of variation (0. 704 - 0. 710) between the various dykes and intrusions without any correlation with the elements indicative of crustal contamination. In the Tellnes <b>main</b> <b>dyke,</b> evolution towards acidic rocks occurs without contamination and variation in ISr. Fractional crystallization with subtraction of apatite-bearing noritic cumulates can account for the major and trace element evolution from monzonorite to quartz mangerite, but is unable to explain the large differences between occurrences. It is concluded that monzonorites cannot be comagmatic (though coeval) with massif-type anorthosites. They result from the crystallization of distinct magma batches, possibly formed through partial melting of basic to intermediate rocks in the lower crust. © 1989.

Geochemical and Sr–Nd isotopic data {{indicate}} variable scales of mantle heterogeneity, caused by recurrent metasomatic effects since Archean times. The main processes are attributed to the action of slab fluids from recycling of oceanic crust and overlying sediments on the sub-lithospheric mantle in continental settings, and by upwelling of OIB-like material. These processes are consistent with the protracted geologic history of the country rocks, given by episodic juvenile accretion and successive continental amalgamations from Archean to ca. 2. 0 Ga.

40|$|The southeastern {{margin of}} the anorthositic Kunene Intrusive Complex, NW Namibia, has been {{subsequently}} invaded by Mesoproterozoic syenite, nepheline syenite and ferrocarbonatite dykes along NE- and SE-trending faults. The first generation of carbonatite intrusions frequently contains fenitized anorthositic wall-rock frag-ments set in a ferrocarbonatite matrix; later, subordinate veins of massive ferrocarbonatite are almost xenolith-free and cut through the <b>main</b> carbonatite <b>dykes.</b> A mantle source for both carbonatite genera-tions is constrained by their respective oxygen and carbon isotope com-positions of ankerite (d 18 OSMOW 891 – 973 ‰; d 13 CPDB 698 to 676 %). Na-rich fluids, released from the melt parental to the ferrocarbonatites, caused the fenitization of both the incorporated anorthosite xenoliths and the bordering anorthosite, syenite and nephe-line syenite. This process is mainly characterized by the progressive transformation of Ca-rich plagioclase, K-feldspar and nepheline into albite and/or sodalite.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} data on petrology, bulk {{rock and}} mineral compositions, and textural classification of the Middle Jurassic Jericho kimberlite (Slave craton, Canada). The kimberlite was emplaced as three steep-sided pipes in granite that was overlain by limestones and minor soft sediments. The pipes are infilled with hypabyssal and pyroclastic kimberlites {{and connected to}} a satellite pipe by a dyke. The Jericho kimberlite is classified as a Group Ia, lacking groundmass tetraferriphlogopite and containing monticellite pseudomorphs. The kimberlite formed, during several consecutive emplacement events of compositionally different batches of kimberlite magma. Core-logging and thin-section observations identified at least two phases of hypabyssal kimberlites and three phases of pyroclastic kimberlites. Hypabyssal kimberlites intruded as a <b>main</b> <b>dyke</b> (HK 1) and as late small-volume aphanitic and vesicular dykes. Massive pyroclastic kimberlite (MPK 1) predominantly filled {{the northern and southern}} lobes of the pipe and formed from magma different from the HK 1 magma. The MPK 1 magma crystallized Ti-, Fe-, and Cr-rich phlogopite without rims of barian phlogopite, and clinopyroxene and spinel without atoll structures. MPK 1 textures, superficially reminiscent of tuffisitic kimberlite, are caused by pervasive contamination by granite xenoliths. The next explosive events filled the central lobe with two varieties of pyroclastic kimberlite: (1) massive and (2) weakly bedded, normally graded pyroclastic kimberlite. The geology of the Jericho pipe differs from the geology of South African or the Prairie kimberlites, but may resemble Lac de Gras pipes, in which deeper erosion removed upper fades of resedimented kimberlites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Two {{examples}} of blunt-ended dykes from the Rooi Rand dyke swarm in South Africa are examined {{in order to}} determine the mechanism by which such features form. Although other interpretations of blunt-ended dykes have been proposed, evidence in the Rooi Rand examples suggests that dilation was transferred along a zone of shear at the dyke tip oriented at a high angle to the dyke plane. Microscopic analysis of samples from blunt-ended tip regions reveals cataclasis and mineral straining in the dyke walls in the zone of dyke linkage. The indication is that adjacent, blunt-ended, en Cchelon dyke segments dilate along a shear zone, producing cataclasis of the host rock. Both segments dilate in this manner and are blunt-ended prior to linkage. Horns may develop at the outer corners of the blunt tips so that, subsequent to linkage, the overall geometry resembles that predicted by the conventional model of bridge failure between overlapped en tchelon dykes. However, permanently strained bridges predicted by that model are not necessary for the model described here. In addition, blunt-ended dykes that dilate along a cross-linking shear zone do not need to overlap in order to link together, in contrast to existing model predictions. Dilation adjacent to a blunt-ended dyke may also be accommodated by intrusion of magma into shear zone fractures that vary in orientation with respect to the <b>main</b> <b>dyke.</b> Near the dyke, the near-tip stress field overrides the remote stress field and generates magma-filled shear-related fractures at high angles to the dyke plane. With increasing distance from the dyke, the remote stress field becomes dominant and resultant shear-related fractures are oriented at successively lesser angles to the dyke plane...|$|E
40|$|The channel {{boundary}} conditions along the Lower Yellow River (LYR) have been altered significantly since the 1950 s with the continual reinforcement {{and construction of}} both <b>main</b> and secondary <b>dykes</b> and river training works. To evaluate how the confined complex channel-floodplain system of the LYR responds to floods, this study presents a detailed investigation {{of the relationship between}} the tempo-spatial distribution of sedimentation/erosion and overbank floods occurred in the LYR. For large overbank floods, we found that when the sediment transport coefficient (ratio of sediment concentration of flow to flow discharge) is less than 0. 034, the bankfull channel is subject to significant erosion, while the main and secondary floodplains both accumulate sediment. The amount of sediment deposited on the main and secondary floodplains is closely related to the ratio ofpeak discharge to bankfull discharge, volume of water flowing over the floodplains and sediment concentration of overbank flow, while the degree of erosion in the bankfull channel is related to the amount of sediment deposited on the main and secondary floodplains, water volume and sediment load in flood season. The significant increase in erosion in the bankfull channel is due to the construction of the <b>main</b> and secondary <b>dykes</b> and river training works, which are largely in a wide and narrow alternated pattern along the LYR such that the water flowing over wider floodplains returns to the channel downstream after it drops sediment. For small overbank floods, the bankfull channel is subject to erosion when the sediment transport coefficient is less than 0. 028, while the amount of sediment deposited on the secondary floodplain is associated closely with the sediment concentration of flow. Over the entire length of the LYR, the situation of erosion in the bankfull channel and sediment deposition on the main and secondary floodplains occurred mainly in the upper reach of the LYR, in which a channel wandering in planform has been well developed...|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} the petrogenesis of layered ultramafic- gabbro bodies from the Scourian and the metamorphic {{evolution of the}} Assynt district of Sutherland. The layered bodies comprise ultramafic rocks (amphibole-spinel- lherzolites) and garnetiferous gabbros derived from the same tholeiitic magma which had about 15 - 20 MgO. The ultramafic rocks are partial cumulates formed by olivine and orthopyroxene after settling; with the gabbros being derivative liquids. The flat to LREE enriched patterns and trace element levels suggest the magma formed by 30 - 40 % partial melting of undepleted mantle. The bodies are fragments of Archaean oceanic crust invaded by tonalitic magma generated at a convergent plate boundary followed by ductile deformation and metamorphism to granulite facies. The gabbros show evidence of two periods of granulite facies mineral growth, the first producing a clinopyroxene-garnet plagioclase assemblage at about 12 - 15 kb and 1000 C. Uplift caused partial breakdown of the garnet to orthopyroxene-plagioclase spinel amphibole symplectites at about 800 - 900 C and 9 - 14 kb. Garnet stability depends on both P-T conditions and whole rock Fe/Mg ratio. The Lewisian complex in Assynt suffered widespread retrogression during the Inverian caused by the influx of large volumes of mantle- derived hydrous fluids associated {{with the development of}} NW-trending monoclinal folds. During retrogression the development of a uniform hornblende-plagioclase quartz assemblage in mafic and intermediate gneisses caused a redistribution of elements. Hornblende and biotite compositions depend on whole-rock composition and paragenesis. The assemblages developed suggest retrogression occurred with falling temperatures in the range 700 - 500 C remaining above 500 C {{for the duration of the}} Inverian and Laxfordian events. The style of deformation became more brittle with time as the complex was uplifted. Amphibolite dykes from Clashnessie Bay are tholeiitic andesites formed from a tholeiitic magma by hornblende fractionation.

40|$|Many lava dome {{building}} eruptions show periodic {{to complex}} non-periodic pulsatory activity. Typical time-scales {{associated with this}} activity range from hours to decades. Previous studies modelled the ascent of magma using a set of transient 1 -D transport equations, accounting for degassing induced crystallization kinetics, gas exsolution and viscosity increase due to crystal growth. These models assumed flow in a cylindrical conduit with a fixed cross-section area. Since several observations suggest that extrusions are mainly fed by dykes, with cylindrical geometries developing only at shallow levels, here we generalised the model to the flow geometry represented by an elliptical dyke with major and minor semi-axes changing with depth. Quasi-static elastic deformation of the dyke is accounted by an analytical solution that couples cross-section area with the magmatic overpressure. The effects of the <b>main</b> <b>dyke</b> geometrical parameters and boundary conditions on the eruption dynamics were investigated. The presence of a deformable dyke {{can lead to a}} more complex periodic behaviour with a wider range of time-scales and cyclicity patterns with respect to a uniform cylindrical conduit. There is a regime where the period of pulsations is controlled by the elasticity of the dyke and a regime where the period is controlled by the volume of the magma chamber. Intermediate regimes are possible. Periodic variations in discharge rate are also possible for both fixed pressure in dyke source region and fixed influx rate into the dyke. Our study emphasizes the strong nonlinearities and complex behaviours of lava dome eruptions. From a forecasting and hazard perspective, intrinsic uncertainties in governing parameters may make volcanic systems in some circumstances unpredictable. On the other hand, lava dome systems may also develop episodic and systematic behaviours so that behaviour becomes predictable for a while...|$|E

The dykes and sills have vertical and horizontal lengths of up to and over 100 m and 1 km, respectively. Outcrop observations show that the architecture and morphology of the sand injectites in the marls is governed by the local stress field during injection, pre–existing faults, the host–rock lithology, compaction, and distance to the potential sand source(s). The <b>main</b> set of <b>dykes</b> is oriented N 50 – 60 ° perpendicular to the minimum compressive stress σ 3 during sand injection.

Sills and dykes thin laterally away from their potential sand sources and thin laterally away from them. The vertical thickness variations of the dykes and wings are more complex, as thinning away from the sand sources is often compensated by thickening toward the palaeo–surface.

The Gannakouriep {{dyke swarm}} {{comprises}} a linear swarm of north to northeast striking mafic dykes emplaced during late Proterozoic rifting in the Gariep belt. The swarm has a strike length of over 300 km crossing terrane {{boundaries of the}} Gordonia sub-province, Richtersveld igneous sub-province and 8 ushmanland sub-province of the Namaqua Mobile Province. The <b>main</b> axis of <b>dyke</b> intrusion is centred within the 2. 0 Ga Richtersveld igneous sub-province where the density of dyking increases westwards across strike towards the Gariep belt, prior to disappearing within the sediment/basement contact of the para-autochthonous Port Nolloth Assemblage. An internal Rb-Sr mineral isochron, together with pyroxene K-Ar plateau and whole rock model TCHUR ages, indicate that the dyke swarm was intruded around 720 Ma. The majority of the dykes comprise subophitic relict gabbros and dolerites of alkali affinities replaced by metamorphic minerals of both greenschist and amphibolite facies. The greenstones are encountered within the NE striking eastern sector of the dyke swarm which records the original tensile stress field, whilst amphibolites are encountered in the northerly striking western sector of the swarm which has been rotated 26 ° anticlockwise during Pan-African (500 - 550 Ma) deformation in the Gariep belt. The latter age of regional metamorphism and deformation is supported by available K-Ar age data on whole rock samples and amphibole mineral separates. Integrated field relationships, continuum mechanics modelling and geochemical {{studies suggest that the}} swarm was initiated as a series of low level crustal magma chambers which subsequently gave rise to a series of dyke complexes that comprise the Gannakouriep dyke swarm. The geochemical variability between individual dyke complexes across the entire swarm is negligible; only slight differences being recorded by their high-field-strength element concentrations. The latter suggests that all dykes are genetically linked to a single mantle diapir, with only slight source characteristic heterogeneities. All dykes are ferro-tholeiites with no primitive (picritic) member being present. Geochemical trends recorded by the swarm are easily reconcilable in terms of fractionation of the phenocryst assemblage olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, (ilmenite and Ti-magnetite). However an earlier phase of fractionation of essentially olivine and plagioclase {{at the base of the}} crust is suggested since constraints on the degree of partial melting (3 - 6 %) imposed by REE patterns would derive an alkali basalt parental melt. The geodynamic relationship between the Gannakouriep dyke swarm and rifting in the Gariep belt is accounted for by a lithospheric plate model containing non-coincidental crustal and mantle weaknesses represented by late Namaquan D 4 n extensional faults and a mantle weakness possibly resulting from crustal thickening within the Richtersveld igneous sub-province during Namaquan tectonics...|$|R
