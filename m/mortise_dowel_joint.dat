Such parameter, at non <b>dowelled</b> <b>joints,</b> present a large variation along day hours {{as well as}} along the seasons (winter and summer); while <b>dowelled</b> <b>joints</b> disclosed little variation for LTE with values ranging from 90 to 100 %, non <b>dowelled</b> <b>joints</b> have reduced trans-fer efficiency between 50 % (winter) to 60 % (summer).

40|$|Abstract. The {{study on}} tension {{behavior}} of casing and <b>dowel</b> <b>joint</b> of square steel tube {{was carried out}} by using finite element analysis software ANSYS/LS-DYNA with consideration of geometric nonlinearity, material nonlinearity and contact nonlinearity. On this basis, the effects of inside tube wall thickness, main tube wall thickness, and inserting depth on failure mode, ultimate tensile load and deformation of casing and <b>dowel</b> <b>joint</b> of square steel tube was discussed. The results show that there are three types of failure modes, i. e., bolt failure, inside tube failure and main tube failure, when the joints are subjected to axial tension force. Compare to the joint with the same wall thickness of inside tube and main tube, the reduction of wall thickness of inside tube or main tube will weaken greatly the ultimate tensile load of the joint. The ultimate tensile load of casing and <b>dowel</b> <b>joints</b> is proportional to bolt shear strength, tube wall thickness, inserting depth, and tube edge length. The fruits are useful to the design and application of casing and <b>dowel</b> <b>joints</b> of square steel tube...|$|R

25|$|This {{produces}} a joint {{which is much}} stronger than a butt joint without reinforcement. The dowels offer some holding strength even after the glue has deteriorated. Over time, dowels may shrink and become loose. They take on an oval shape in section owing to the different rate at which wood moves with different orientations of the grain. Loose <b>dowels</b> allow the <b>joint</b> to flex, although it may not fall apart. This phenomenon is evident in creaking chairs and wobbling book cases. For this reason, <b>dowel</b> <b>joints</b> are not preferred for high-quality furniture.|$|R
30|$|Chemical changes {{occurred}} in the wood components including the depolymerization and pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin during welding. According to the research of Karl-Christian, acid-catalyzed cleavage of carbohydrates {{and the formation of}} formaldehyde, furfural, and other aldehydes occurred with the elevated temperature. In addition, lignin was cleaved and began auto-condensation [24]. With the changes in the wood components, the free phenolic hydroxyl groups increased and formed the hydrogen bonds with the cellulose to strengthen the stability of the interface [25, 26], and the hydroxyl benzene propane unit decreased [27]. Water vapor and carbon dioxide were the primary components of the volatile gas in the welding process [28 – 30]. The wood <b>dowel</b> welding <b>joints</b> showed improved pullout resistance [31, 32]. The pullout resistance property of the wood <b>dowel</b> welding <b>joints</b> is equivalent to that of wood <b>dowel</b> <b>joints</b> with adhesives, and better than that of nailed <b>joints</b> [33]. Wood <b>dowel</b> welding may also be used to enhance the mortise and tenon interference fit connection [34]. Novel full-scale multi-layered timber beams with welded-through wood dowels obtained considerable bending strength [35].|$|R

30|$|A quasi-non-linear {{fracture}} mechanics model based on beam on elastic foundation theory is applied {{for analysis of}} the splitting failure of <b>dowel</b> <b>joints</b> loaded perpendicular to grain. Simply supported beams symmetrically loaded by two dowels are considered, {{and the effects of}} edge distance, dowel spacing, and distance between dowels and supports are accounted for. The foundation modulus used in the beam on elastic foundation model is chosen so that the perpendicular-to-grain tensile strength and fracture energy properties of the wood are correctly represented. This ensures that a conventional stress analysis and failure criterion lead to the same solution as the compliance method of {{fracture mechanics}}. A semiempirical efficiency factor is proposed to account for the influence of the total beam depth, which does not enter the beam on elastic foundation model, but the effect of which is evident from tests. It is shown that the so-called Van der Put/Leijten model, which recently has been adopted in Eurocode 5, appears as a special case of the model presented. Tests on simply supported beams with a single <b>dowel</b> <b>joint</b> at midspan are compared with the theoretical predictions. Various edge distances, beam depths, and spans were tested.|$|R

40|$|Traditional timber {{engineering}} design approaches use for simple geometries stress- or strain-based criteria for strength analyses. For more complex cases purely empirical methods are also used. Although practical, purely empirical methods are not general, and {{could lead to}} estimations on the unsafe side, if extrapolated outside their original scope. It is furthermore known that stress- or strain-based methods are not useful in situations where large stress or strain concentrations arise, such as close to holes or notches, in <b>dowel</b> <b>joints</b> or in glued joints. Furthermore, such phenomena like size effects cannot be predicted, unless stochastic methods are introduced. The paper discusses some fracture mechanics strength analysis methods {{that in recent years}} have been proposed in relation to timber engineering strength design. The methods discussed ran e from simple hand calculations based on linear elastic fracture mechanics and useful for simple geometries to finite element analyses for general cases taking into account non-linear performance of the material during fracture. Fracture mechanics results in rational strength design, which is based on mechanics, as opposed to purely empirical methods, and with parameters with a clear physical meaning. In order to obtain material characteristics needed for this approach examples of test methods are discussed.

50|$|Dowel Bar Retrofit (DBR) is {{a process}} that re-establishes load {{transfer}} capability on <b>doweled</b> <b>joints</b> and cracks by installing epoxy-coated, round steel dowels into existing concrete pavement across transverse joints and/or cracks.

The entire road is often diamond ground to remove bumps or dips and provide a safe, quiet riding surface.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of diamond-shaped <b>dowel</b> <b>joints</b> in concrete slabs on ground under static loads. Diamond-shaped dowels have been in common use in concrete slab construction since 1996. A comprehensive literature review revealed that published studies regarding laboratory tests and finite element modelling of diamond-shaped dowel performance were limited to primary experiments and simple numerical analysis. Importantly, the limited finite element modelling has not been verified against test data, and the scant published test data lacks clarity. The results were inconclusive, unclear and there exists different recommendations for joint stability. Some recommended design data are not based on any testing, but on inferred or extrapolated data from smaller slabs with smaller dowel thicknesses. Hence, this research provides the opportunity to enlighten the design community with real data on {{the performance of}} diamond-shaped <b>dowel</b> <b>joint</b> behaviour. The research program includes experimental, numerical modelling and parametric evaluations. In the experimental investigation, testing facilities were designed and developed {{in the course of this}} research. A total of one trial and six cast-in-place slabs encompassing two slab thicknesses, two diamond-shaped dowel thicknesses, and two dowel spacing, were tested in the structures laboratory of the Division of Civil Engineering at the University of Queensland. Joint gaps of 10 or 15 mm were used to simulate typical slab contraction causing by the shrinkage of concrete slabs. All tests were subjected to static loading to failure. This enabled slab joint response to be evaluated in terms of relative deflection, load transfer efficiency, load transfer, ultimate load and crack geometry. In addition to the experiments, numerical models were developed using the LUSAS finite element program. The model dimensions corresponded to those of the laboratory test specimens. The concrete slabs were modelled using a “multi-crack concrete model 94 ”. The test rig, diamond-shaped dowels and other materials were modelled as elastic materials. Results from the laboratory experiments were compared to the finite element results in order to validate the model. These models were then used to undertake a preliminary parametric study of diamond-shaped dowel performance. Criteria such as <b>joint</b> gap widths, <b>dowel</b> spacing, concrete property reduction, and dowel and slab thickness were investigated.
