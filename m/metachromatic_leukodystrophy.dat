25|$|However, how {{sulfatide}} buildup causes demyelination and neural degeneration {{is still}} mostly unknown. <b>Metachromatic</b> <b>Leukodystrophy</b> results in neurological manifestations that are {{centered on the}} impairment of {{the central nervous system}} and the peripheral nervous system, including the following: seizures, progressive coordination and speech problems, and behavioral disturbances. Treatment is still being studied and evaluated, but mice studies indicate that treatments, including gene therapy, cell-based therapies using oligodendrocyte progenitors cells, enzyme replacement therapy, or adeno-associated viral and lentiviral mediated gene therapy may prove to be effective in reducing the effects of <b>Metachromatic</b> <b>Leukodystrophy.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy,</b> {{also known}} as MLD, is a {{recessive}} lysosomal storage disorder. It {{is believed to be}} caused by a deficiency in arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A is a lysosomal sulfatase that is able to hydrolyze the 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide and 3-O-sulfolactosylceramide. Both 3-O-sulfolactosylceramide and 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide can be located mainly in the central nervous system {{as well as in the}} peripheral nervous system. When lacking the lysosomal enzyme or mutations in the gene coding for saposin B occur, this can lead to the accumulation of lysosomal sulfatide, which then develops into <b>metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{has been}} shown to play a role or have some {{association}} with several diseases and infections. This includes diabetes mellitus, cancer and tumors, <b>metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy,</b> various bacterial infections, and viruses, including HIV-1, Hepatitis C, influenza A virus, and vaccinia virus.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the myelin. Myelin acts as an insulating sheath that surrounds many nerve fibers and increases the speed at which impulses are conducted. When sulfatide is not distributed properly, it can affect the normal physiological conduction of electrical impulses between nerve cells. This then results in demyelination because of the buildup of sulfatide and is the main cause of <b>Metachromatic</b> <b>Leukodystrophy.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{abnormal}} metabolism {{or change}} in the expression of sulfatide has also been associated with various pathologies, including neuropathologies, such as <b>metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy,</b> Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Sulfatide is also associated with diabetes mellitus, cancer metastasis, and viruses, including HIV-1, influenza A virus, hepatitis C and vaccinia virus. Additionally, overexpression of sulfatide {{has been linked to}} epilepsy and audiogenic seizures as well as other pathological states in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|In July {{researchers}} reported promising results for six children with two severe hereditary diseases {{had been treated}} with a partially deactivated lentivirus to replace a faulty gene and after 7–32 months. Three of the children had <b>metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy,</b> which causes children to lose cognitive and motor skills. The other children had Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which leaves them to open to infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Follow up trials with gene therapy on another six children with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome were also reported as promising.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{degradation}} {{occurs in}} the lysosomes. Here, arylsulfatase A hydrolyzes the sulfate group. However, in order for this reaction to be carried out, a sphingolipid activator protein such as saposin B must be present. Saposin B extracts sulfatide from the membrane, which makes it accessible to arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A can then hydrolyze the sulfate group. Accumulation of sulfatide can cause <b>metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy,</b> a lysosomal storage disease and may be caused because of a defect in arylsulfatase A, leading to an inability to degrade sulfatide.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{expression}} of sulfatide {{is linked to}} several neurological disorders. As stated before, {{one of the major}} neurological disorders is <b>Metachromatic</b> <b>Leukodystrophy,</b> which is caused by elevated levels of sulfatide, leading to the progressive loss of myelin as a result of sulfatide accumulation. High levels of sulfatide in the gray matter in the cerebellum and in the superior frontal lobe have been associated with Parkinson's disease. Additionally, accumulation of sulfatide in neurons causes audiogenic seizures, which {{have been shown to be}} lethal in mouse models. On the other hand, reduced levels of sulfatide in the cerebral gray and white matter have been associated with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy.</b> Low arylsulphatase A {{activity}} {{can occur in}} healthy individuals.

5000|$|<b>Metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy</b> [...] (MLD, {{also called}} {{arylsulfatase}} A deficiency) is a lysosomal storage disease which is commonly {{listed in the}} family of leukodystrophies as well as among the sphingolipidoses as it affects the metabolism of sphingolipids. Leukodystrophies affect the growth and/or development of myelin, the fatty covering which acts as an insulator around nerve fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. MLD involves cerebroside sulfate accumulation. <b>Metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy,</b> like most enzyme deficiencies, has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.|$|E

50|$|The {{first of}} Bachhawat's major {{research}} findings {{came when he}} was working with Minor J. Coon at the University of Michigan. Both the scientists together discovered HMG-CoA lyase, an intermediate in the mevalonate and ketogenesis pathway, thus broadening the understanding of the formation of ketone bodies in mammals, which was later elucidated further in his article Enzymic cleavage of p-Hydroxy-f3-Methyl-Glutaryl coenzyme A 10 acetoacctate and acetyl coenzyme A., published in 1995. On his return to India, he focused his studies on amino acids and inorganic sulphate metabolism, as well as glycosaminoglycan. His researches revealed, for the first time, that <b>Metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy,</b> an autosomal recessive disease, was caused by the absence of Arylsulfatase A, an enzyme responsible for the breaking down on sulfatides. This discovery assisted other scientists in the elucidation of similar glycolipid storage diseases such as Gaucher's disease and Tay-Sachs disease and in their prenatal diagnosis. His proposals on the biosynthesis and degradation of cerebroside-3-sulfate, a lipid found in high concentrations in patients afflicted with <b>Metachromatic</b> <b>leukodystrophy</b> were known to have helped in the later-day therapeutic protocols.|$|E
