25|$|One of {{the major}} points of {{contention}} with the U.S. was oil. Calles quickly rejected the Bucareli Agreements of 1923 between the U.S. and Mexico, when Álvaro Obregón was president, and began drafting a new oil law that would strictly enforce article 27 of the Mexican constitution. The oil problem stemmed from article 27 of the Mexican Constitution of 1917, which re-stated a law from Spanish origin that <b>made</b> <b>everything</b> under the soil property of the state. The language of article 27 threatened the oil possession of U.S. and European oil companies, especially if the article was applied retroactively. A Mexican Supreme Court decision had ruled that foreign-owned fields could not be seized {{as long as they}} were already in operation before the constitution went into effect. The Bucareli Agreements stated that Mexico would agree to respect the Mexican Supreme Court decision in exchange for official recognition from Washington of the presidency of Álvaro Obregón.|$|E

25|$|The Apocalypse of Abraham {{told that}} Abraham argued {{to his father}} Terah that fire is more worthy of honor than idols, because its flames mock {{perishable}} things. Even more worthy of honor was water, because it conquers the fire and satisfies the earth. He called the earth more worthy of honor, because it overpowers {{the nature of the}} water. He called the sun more worthy of honor, because its rays illumine the whole world. But even the sun Abraham did not call god, because at night and by clouds it is obscured. Nor did Abraham call the moon or the stars god, because they also in their season obscure their light. Abraham argued to his father that they should worship the God who <b>made</b> <b>everything,</b> including the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth. And while Abraham thus spoke to his father in the court of his house, the voice of God came down from heaven in a fiery cloudburst, crying to Abraham to leave his father's house so that he would not also die in his father's sins.|$|E

It has a dominating two-part ritornello. Hofmann observes that the organ, this time the only partner of the voice, is [...] "rich in coloratura" [...] and has a theme, [...] "heard throughout the movement, sometimes {{in the manner of}} an ostinato, sometimes freely developed; in its figuration and motoric drive it is stylized just like Bach’s writing for the violoncello piccolo". Gardiner notes that not only the tessitura but also [...] "characteristic string-crossing patterns" [...] are reminiscent of violoncello piccolo use.|$|E

Critics also noticed similarities between some melodies and Mitsuda's previous work Chrono Trigger, though reviewers felt that those of Xenogears were more [...] "widely based" [...] and had a distinctive Celtic sound.

Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife; [...] "Cute but psycho. Things even out." [...] According to Hathaway, [...] "She comes from the same gene pool as the Red Queen. She really likes the dark side, but she's so scared of going too far into it that she's <b>made</b> <b>everything</b> appear very light and happy. But she's living in that place {{out of fear that}} she won't be able to control herself." [...] Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as [...] "a punk-rock vegan pacifist", with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry, Greta Garbo, and the artwork of Dan Flavin. Burton said that the White Queen's appearance was inspired by Nigella Lawson.|$|E
500|$|D'Oliveira, {{who learned}} of his {{omission}} {{over the radio}} in the Worcestershire dressing room having just scored 128 runs against Sussex, was deeply upset and faced intense press attention. Insole and Griffith defended the decision to omit D'Oliveira to the press, saying {{that there had been}} no pressure from South Africa and that the chosen team simply included better players than D'Oliveira. Oborne writes that Insole considered the events surrounding the selection meeting as among the worst of his life, but that [...] "he and the other selectors were victims of the decision, reached on the advice of Alec Douglas-Home early in 1968, not to press for an answer to the MCC demand there should be 'no preconditions' for the tour. Once that decision had been <b>made,</b> <b>everything</b> else followed: the bribery attempt, the secret pressure and the nobbling of the MCC. Had the matter been dealt with...

While historically the Portuguese wine industry was seemingly split into two: the producers who made Port and those who <b>made</b> <b>everything</b> else, {{the distinction between the}} two sides of the industry is now blurred. Many Port producers are now making premium dry wines from grapes grown in the Douro and producers in other areas of Portugal have been experimenting with making fortified wine in the style of Port (though it can not legally be called Port).

Wines from Portuguese regions such as Dão, Vinho Verde and Alentejo have been exported around the globe and garnered attention from wine critics.|$|E
