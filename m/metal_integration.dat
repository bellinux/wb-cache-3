As a result, MRI studies may have up to 30% more false positives, which may have undesirable financial and psychological costs on the patient. Also, MRI procedures are expensive and include an intravenous injection of a gadolinium contrast, which has been implicated in a rare reaction called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NFS). Although NSF is uncommon, other patients {{with a history of}} renal failure/disease {{would not be able to}} undergo an MRI scan. Breast MRI is not recommended for screening all breast cancer patients, yet limited to patients with high risk of developing breast cancer that may have high familial risk or mutations in BCRA1/2 genes. Breast MRI is not a perfect tool despite its increased sensitivity for detecting breast cancer masses when compared to mammography. This due to the ability of MRIs to miss some cancers that would have been detected with conventional mammography, as a result, MRI screening for breast cancer is most affective as a combination with other tests and for certain breast cancer patients. In contrast, the use of MRIs are often limiting to patients with any body <b>metal</b> <b>integration</b> such as patients with tattoos, pacemakers, tissue expanders, and so on.|$|E

40|$|As optical, active, {{semiconductor}} devices are miniaturized to the wavelength scale, many applications of cavities, lasers, and detectors become possible. In {{order to make}} such devices useful in real-world applications one must first understand how these devices behave when they are reduced in size and what technological barriers must be overcome. In this dissertation several thrusts are presented toward the investigation and application of microscale active semiconductor cavities. Work is divided into four thrusts: fluid sensing based on surface sensitive quantum cascade lasers, hybridization of surface plasmon modes and waveguide modes as well as lasing in near-infrared subwavelength microdisks, quantum dot based cavities for strong coupling, and nascent work on optomechanical tuning of active cavities. In all four thrusts design and fabrication techniques are used to overcome challenges and capitalize on reduced scale. Progress in fabrication, design, and testing of surface sensitive quantum cascade lasers is presented. Work focuses on increasing surface sensitivity by modifying the metal contacts on top of active material originally intended {{to be used with}} a surface plasmon waveguide. An experiment where isopropyl and ethyl alcohol is differentiated based on laser behavior is carried out. Work toward integration of semiconductor lasers with fluidic delivery systems is explored. Work then turns to the intimate and advantageous inclusion of metal into subwavelength strained quantum well microdisk lasers in the near-infrared. Optical and thermal characteristics are simulated. Hybridization of surface plasmon mode and waveguide whispering-gallery modes is simulated and experimentally verified. Lasing behavior of such small devices is investigated. In parallel, work toward improving the probability of achieving a strongly coupled quantum dot microdisk cavity system is carried out. Improvements in fabrication techniques and potential <b>metal</b> <b>integration</b> makes this project a natural extension of the subwavelength microdisk laser project. Finally, a new project is discussed where the above projects are combined with investigation of optomechanical systems currently ongoing in our lab.

40|$|The {{substantial}} pollution {{threat to}} the South African environment from acid mine drainage (AMD) effluents has been well documented. Due to the juvenile nature of acidity in these flows, any remediation strategies implemented will need to function effectively and at low cost {{for long periods of}} time. The widespread use of sulphate reducing biological systems for the treatment of such effluents, and in particular large volume flows, has been limited. The supply of inexpensive electron donor and carbon sources, as well as appropriate reactor designs capable of handling large volume flows, have been identified as among the principal factors limiting development of this technology. The broad aim of the research programme reported here was to undertake an evaluation of the feasibility of an algal-bacterial integrated ponding system for the treatment of AMD, and the waste stabilisation pond (WSP) as an appropriate reactor design for this application. The study attempted to demonstrate the feasibility of individual unit operations in a proposed process train using complex organic carbon serving as the electron donor source for the sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). Studies were undertaken as laboratory and pilot-scale investigations. Tannery effluent was shown to be a functional carbon source for biological sulphate reduction, with effective removal of sulphate and organics being recorded. In turn, the use of biological sulphate reduction for the treatment of tannery effluent was demonstrated. Algal biomass was shown in laboratory studies to function as an effective carbon source for biological sulphate reduction. It is known that micro-algae produce large quantities of photosynthate which is released to the growth medium under conditions of physiological stress. The potential for the use of photosynthate production in high rate algal ponding systems and its manipulation and use as a sustainable carbon source for sulphate reduction was investigated. Growth of a mixed culture of Dunaliella under conditions of light, temperature and salinity stress demonstrated production of large quantities of organic carbon. However, growth was inhibited at high temperatures. An elevation of salinity levels led to a decrease in growth of Dunaliella, but to increased organic carbon production. Spirulina spp., on the other hand, grew well at higher temperatures but showed the highest organic carbon production, and release to the medium, under low light conditions. These results led to a proposed process for the integration of algal ponding into an integrated system for the treatment of AMD. The algal biomass may be fed into the anaerobic digester as a carbon source, or it may be passed into a High Rate Algal Pond (HRAP) where it is stressed to enhance the organic carbon content. This can then be fed into the anaerobic digester as a carbon source. The impact of high levels of sulphide in the water feeding to the algal growth compartment was investigated. Spirulina spp. isolated from a tannery waste stabilisation pond was shown to be a sulphidophilic strain of cyanobacterium, capable of being adapted to high concentrations of sulphide. Dunaliella salina on the other hand was less tolerant. These results demonstrated the practical use of algal biomass providing an oxygen-rich cap for odour control {{on the surface of the}} facultative pond as well for the secondary treatment of sulphide-rich overflow to the High Rate Algal Pond. The ability of micro-algae to elevate the pH of their surrounding environment was evaluated as a functional precipitant and neutralisation reagent for acidic metal containing wastewater. Spirulina spp. was shown to perform effectively. D. salina was less functional in this environment. Anacystis spp. was effective in elevating the pH of a defined medium as well as a zinc-rich effluent. These results indicated the practicality of a neutralising function for algal ponds in the treatment of AMD. Metal removal in the system was found to be a combined function of sulphide precipitation, removal by binding to micro-algal biomass and extracellular polymeric substances. The feasibility of waste stabilisation ponding technology use for the treatment of large volume AMD effluents was provisionally demonstrated. It was shown that complex carbon sources would be used as efficient electron donors for sulphate reduction. The integration of algal ponding into the system provides for the generation of a sustainable carbon source, odour control with the recycling of oxygen-rich water onto the top of the facultative pond, secondary treatment of the anaerobic digester overflow, and the neutralisation of the incoming acidic effluents and removal of heavy <b>metals.</b> <b>Integration</b> of the individual unit operations, the feasibility of which has been provisionally demonstrated in this study, into a continuous process train is being investigated in follow-upstudies...|$|R

The model is suitable to represent the isothermal, anisotropic, large deformation of polycrystalline metals. The formulation {{is an extension of}} a rigid viscoplastic model to account for elasticity effects, and incorporates a number of changes with respect to a previous formulation [Marin & Dawson, 1998]. This extension is formally derived using the well-known multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and plastic components, where the elastic part is additionally decomposed into the elastic stretch V{sup e} and the proper orthogonal R{sup e} tensors. The constitutive equations are written in the intermediate, stress-free configuration obtained by unloading the deformed crystal through the elastic stretch V{sup e-}. The model is framed in a thermodynamic setting, and developed initially for large elastic strains.

Rig home ranges were 2 – 7 km 2, suggesting that an effective MPA would need to cover the entire Porirua Harbour. They moved to outer harbour sites following some high river flow rates, and most left the harbour permanently during or soon after a river spike, suggesting that they were avoiding low salinity water. Rig showed strong diel movements during summer, although the diel pattern weakened in autumn. Persistent use of the same day and night sites indicates that diel movements are directed rather than random. Further research is required to determine the sizes of rig home ranges in larger harbours where nursery habitat is more extensive.

40|$|Charge coupled devices (CCDs) are {{semiconductor}} devices which can transfer information, {{represented by a}} quantity of electrical charge, from one physical location of the semiconductor substrate to another {{in a controlled manner}} with the use of properly sequenced clock pulses. These devices can be applied to imaging, signal processing, logic, and digital storage applications. In this thesis, the design of an electrically stimulated CCD analog delay line, using the design tools currently available at the Naval Postgraduate School, is reported on. The major issues addressed are the electrode gate structure and composition, charge confinement techniques, and clocking schemes. Additionally, techniques for inpuning and detecting charge packets from the CCD register are examined. The <b>Metal</b> Oxide Semiconductor <b>Integration</b> Service (MOSIS) design rules only permit Bulk Channel Charge Couple Devices (BCCDs) to be lald out, and not Surface Channel Charge Coupled Devices (SCCDs). Restricted to a die size of 2. 24 mm length, the electrode gates were chosen to be polysilicon polysilicon 8 micron length with 2 micron overlap and 20 micron width, giving the BCCD 64 stages. An on chip four phase clocking circuit with output drivers on each phase provides the control voltage for the gate electrodes. The small width of the BCCD delay line utilizes {{only a small portion of}} the available 2. 22 mm die width. Therefore, four different BCCDs were designed in the layout. Two of the BCCDs have a p-diffusion stop to contain the charge laterally as it propagates along the channel while two BCCDs do not. Additionally, two of the BCCDs utilize the charge partition input technique with three control gates and two BCCDs use the dynamic current injection with one control gate. U. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|Environmental context. The {{speciation}} {{of metals}} in soils {{is controlled by}} the equilibrium between the solid and aqueous phases and by several parameters such as pH and total <b>metal</b> concentrations. The <b>integration</b> of affinity constants between several cations and active soil surfaces of different soils in the chemical equilibrium modelling software MINEQL+ allows a good evaluation of the chemical speciation of the metals. Abstract. A new approach, derived from the concept of the biotic ligand model, was used for the determination of the affinity constants of Ca, Cu, Cd and H to the active surfaces of different kinds of soils. This approach allowed us to obtain consistent data and to integrate these values in the chemical equilibrium modelling software MINEQL+ and eventually into a solid phase-controlled soil ligand model. This could then very easily be transformed into a terrestrial biotic ligand model by adding constants for biological components. We obtained the chemical speciation of the metals of interest by integrating the initial characteristics of the soil (pH; cation exchange capacity, CEC; total metal concentrations in soil extracts; ionic strength; and CO 2 pressure). Comparison of the predicted and measured values of free Cu 2 + is excellent using soil-specific affinity constants as well as average values. The average affinity constants between the active soil surfaces (S) and the target cations are log KCa–S =− 0. 84 (± 0. 01), log KCu–S = 5. 3 (± 0. 1), log KCd–S = 4. 4 (± 0. 2) and log KH–S = 4. 1 (± 0. 2). External soils have been used to validate the conceptual model and the results show a very good correlation between the predicted and the measured free Cu (pCu) except for an acidic soil (pH < 5. 2), highlighting the importance of integrating Al into the model...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, graphene, a {{two-dimensional}} monolayer of carbon atoms, has rapidly attracted great attention in high-speed electronics. The promising property {{such as the}} high intrinsic carrier mobility as well as high carrier saturation velocity make graphene a potential candidate for high-speed transistors operating in the millimeter wave and the terahertz frequency ranges. In this thesis, a 200 GHz subharmonic resistive mixer and a microwave amplifier based on graphene FET (GFET) are presented. The mixer is designed to down convert 200 GHz to 1 GHz with LO frequency of 100. 5 GHz, and the amplifier is operating at 1 GHz. A large-signal GFET model is {{set up in a}} standard circuit simulator for the mixer and amplifier device optimisation as well as circuit-device integrative simulation. The device of the amplifier has a gate length 1 μm and a width 2 x 120 μm, and the mixer GFET is designed as Lg · Wg = 0. 5 · 80 μm 2. An array of bow-tie structured graphene nanoconstructions is applied in the mixer GFET channel to obtain simultaneously a right impedance level as well as a higher current on-off ratio. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is utilised for graphene preparation, and the mixer and amplifier circuit are realised in coplanar waveguide (CPW) technology on a 100 μm thick high resistive silicon substrate. A planar inductor is applied in the amplifier design for the purpose of input matching as well as circuit’s <b>integration.</b> <b>Metal</b> air-bridges are added in final layout for reducing circuit discontinuities and parasitic mode propagation at the circuit T junction. Full-wave EM simulations are used for the passive circuits design. The first version of integrated receiver circuit including the designed mixer and amplifier is also fabricated. The conversion loss (CL) of the mixer over the RF frequencies from 190 to 210 GHz is measured to be 34 dB ± 3 dB, with the minimum CL of 31. 5 dB at 190 GHz and 10 dBm LO pump power.
