5|$|Active solar {{techniques}} use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, {{solar thermal}} collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing {{the position of}} a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.|$|E
5|$|George Tillson, his sons, and his {{brother-in-law}} Benjamin Van Norman were the principal stockholders of the Ingersoll and Port Burwell Road Company, which they formed along with approximately 200 shareholders in September1849. Proceeding quickly, the company established eight toll booths along the new route, which {{became known as}} the Plank and Gravel Road due to the <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> which it was constructed.|$|E

5|$|In April 1999, Sullivan {{scholars}} Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry {{announced that}} they had discovered a nearly complete orchestration – lacking only the second violin part – in a private collection of early band parts. These <b>materials,</b> <b>with</b> a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part, were later published and professionally recorded. This piece has now been performed {{a number of times}} by amateur and professional companies, although it has not become a standard addition to the traditional scores or recordings.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and skylights, the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of stainless steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, the areas leading into the elevators have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent <b>materials,</b> <b>with</b> the steps made of gray slate. The exterior ribbons of stainless steel also extend into the lobby of the building.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{important}} source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.|$|E
5000|$|For example, a <b>material</b> <b>with</b> a tan(delta) {{greater than}} one will exhibit more {{dampening}} than a <b>material</b> <b>with</b> a [...] less than one. The reason that a <b>material</b> <b>with</b> a [...] greater than one shows more dampening {{is because the}} loss {{modulus of the material}} is greater than the storage modulus, which means the energy dissipating, viscous component of the complex modulus dominates the material behavior.|$|R
50|$|The Kirkendall effect {{arises when}} two {{distinct}} materials are placed {{next to each}} other and diffusion is allowed to take place between them. In general, the diffusion coefficients of the two materials in each other are not the same. This is only possible if diffusion occurs by a vacancy mechanism; with an exchange mechanism, atoms will cross the interface in pairs, so the diffusion rates will be identical. The <b>material</b> <b>with</b> the higher diffusion coefficient will have a larger associated atomic flux into it, so the net movement of atoms will be from the <b>material</b> <b>with</b> the lower diffusion coefficient into the <b>material</b> <b>with</b> the higher diffusion coefficient, therefore vacancies will diffuse from the <b>material</b> <b>with</b> the lower diffusion coefficient into the <b>material</b> <b>with</b> the higher diffusion coefficient.|$|R
50|$|If a {{piece of}} <b>material</b> <b>with</b> large {{dielectric}} constant {{is surrounded by a}} <b>material</b> <b>with</b> much lower dielectric constant, then this abrupt change in dielectric constant can cause confinement of an electromagnetic wave, which leads to a resonator that acts similarly to a cavity resonator.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> high thermal {{conductivity}} are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high {{thermal conductivity}}, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials. Wooden {{fences and}} gates, paths covered with locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look and feel to a cottage garden. Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> traditional finishes—everything is chosen {{to give the}} impression of an old-fashioned country garden.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} AS-204 fire in 1967, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Spaceflight, Dr. George Mueller, {{announced}} the mission would be officially designated as Apollo 1. The capsule underwent a significant redesign {{as a result}} of the mishap. The atmosphere in the cabin was changed from 100% oxygen to a 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen environment at launch. The astronauts' spacesuits, originally made of nylon, were changed to beta cloth, a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from fiberglass and coated with ]. There were other changes, including replacing flammable cabin <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> self extinguishing ones, and covering plumbing and wiring with protective insulation.|$|E

5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{earliest}} buildings were simple gabled rectangles, a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century. Examples include Dunnottar Castle in the 1580s, Greenock (1591) and Durness (1619), These new buildings often had windows on the south wall and none on the north, which became a unique feature of Reformation kirks. There were continuities with pre-Reformation <b>materials,</b> <b>with</b> some churches using rubble, as at Kemback in Fife (1582). Others employed stone and a few added wooden steeples, as at Burntisland (1592). The church of Greyfriars, Edinburgh, built between 1602 and 1620, used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form, but that at Dirleton (1612), had a more sophisticated classical style.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{like the}} Kibble balance also permit more {{flexibility}} in choosing <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt10Ir could continue to be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards {{would be the same}} as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these new alloys.|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the strain hardening rate on {{the size and shape}} of the Si particles, dendrite arm spacing and Mg content has been studied using monotonic tensile testing and Bauschinger effect. At low strains, the hardening rate is higher for <b>material</b> <b>with</b> elongated Si particles and higher Mg content. At large strains, the hardening rate is higher for <b>material</b> <b>with</b> small dendrites. The internal stresses increase rapidly at small strains, saturating at large strains. The saturation value is higher for <b>material</b> <b>with</b> elongated Si particles, small dendrites or higher Mg content...|$|R
50|$|The cable {{would need}} to be made of a <b>material</b> <b>with</b> a large tensile strength/density ratio. For example, the Edwards space {{elevator}} design assumes a cable <b>material</b> <b>with</b> a specific strength of at least 100,000 kN/(kg/m). This value takes into consideration the entire weight of the space elevator. An untapered space elevator cable would need a material capable of sustaining a length of 4,960 km of its own weight at sea level to reach a geostationary altitude of 35786 km without yielding. Therefore, a <b>material</b> <b>with</b> very high strength and lightness is needed.|$|R

5|$|The Sun, which {{comprises}} {{nearly all}} the matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise {{nearly all the}} remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> lower melting points. The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense {{is known as the}} frost line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} of Category 3 {{and higher}} {{are described as}} major hurricanes in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific basins. These storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, particularly those of wood frame or manufactured <b>materials</b> <b>with</b> minor curtain wall failures. Buildings that lack a solid foundation, such as mobile homes, are usually destroyed, and gable-end roofs are peeled off. Manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, while larger structures are struck by floating debris. A large number of trees are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. Additionally, terrain may be flooded well inland. Near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks and water will likely also be lost or contaminated.|$|E
