5000|$|During {{pipefish}} copulation, {{which signifies}} {{the termination of}} the courtship dance, the female transfers her eggs through a small ovipositor into the <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> pouch or onto the special patch of skin on the male’s ventral body surface. While the eggs are being transferred, the mating pair rises through the water until copulation is complete. At this point, the male assumes an S-shaped posture and fertilizes the eggs, all the while travelling back down the water column. [...] Males possessing brood pouches release their sperm directly into them; the pouches are then vigorously shaken. The ventral seams are not opened until weeks later when the male pipefish give birth.|$|E
5000|$|The Syngnathidae {{family of}} fish has the unique {{characteristic}} of a highly derived form of <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> care referred to as [...] "male pregnancy".

5000|$|There is {{apparently}} no information on larval development, though larvae are initially retained within the <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> pouch. S. louisianae males {{give birth to}} live young from eggs transferred from the female to a specialized marsupium called a brood pouch. Unlike most seahorses, pipefishes of the genus Syngnathus incubate eggs in an inverted pouch. Fertilization occurs after the female transfers the eggs, and incubation lasts until embryos develop into juveniles. Based on the occurrence of brooding males and newly hatched larvae, reproduction occurs primarily during the {{spring and early summer}} (April - July), but continues through most months in Mississippi, except December and February. Brooding males are more commonly found offshore.|$|E
50|$|During mating, {{the females}} deposit eggs into the <b>male's</b> <b>brooding</b> pouch, which located on its underside. The pouch has a lining that {{supplies}} the eggs with oxygen {{as well as}} nutrients.|$|R
50|$|These fishes feed on live mysids {{and small}} prawns. They are {{ovoviviparous}} and reproduce usually theree times each year. A few females deposit partial clutches under the tail into the <b>male’s</b> <b>brood</b> pouch, that may contain up to 400 eggs.|$|R
50|$|The sexes can {{generally}} be differentiated {{by the number}} of bands on the body. Males have a larger number of colored bands than females do. During mating, the fish intertwine as part of a courtship dance. The female transfers the eggs to the <b>male's</b> <b>brooding</b> pouch through her long ovipositor. The brooding pouch is located near the anus of the pipefish. The eggs stay in the <b>male's</b> <b>brooding</b> pouch until the young are developed enough to be independent. At this point, the young exit the pouch with the help of muscular contractions of the male's body. If the young sense danger or feel threatened, they are able to re-enter the brooding pouch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of offspring {{produced in the}} first brood are female, ranging from 74-81% of the offspring. Only about 50% of foundresses survive {{to the production of}} the second brood. This means that some unmated workers will produce offspring, which leads to more male offspring being produced in the second brood than in the first. Therefore, the ratio of males produced in the second brood most likely depends upon whether the foundress does or does not survive. Very rarely, foundresses will not mate and thus produce an all <b>male</b> <b>brood,</b> which therefore means they will not produce a second brood. Less pollen is needed in order to produce males, because they are smaller than gynes. When resources are scarce, the sex ratio may be shifted towards males.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{other species}} of {{pipefish}}, the broadnosed pipefish is sex-role reversed: males brood the eggs and because of their increased investment in offspring are the choosier sex, whereas females compete more intensely than males for access to mates. [...] Females can produce eggs faster than males can brood them, and are limited {{by the size of}} the male's brood pouch, which cannot carry all the eggs of a female similar to himself in size.   <b>Male</b> <b>brood</b> time is approximately four to six weeks, during which time the male provides oxygen and nutrients to the developing embryos until they hatch.   One to six females contribute to each brood clutch, which is the highest rate of multiple maternity in all of the pipefish species.|$|E

50|$|Uniquely, after syngnathid females {{lay their}} eggs, the male then fertilizes and carries the eggs during incubation, {{using one of}} several methods. Male {{seahorses}} have a specialized ventral pouch to carry the eggs, male sea dragons attach the eggs to their tails, and male pipefish may do either, depending on their species. The most fundamental difference between the different lineages of the Syngnathidae family is the location of <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> pouch. The two locations are on the tail (Urophori) and on the abdomen (Gastrophori). There is also variation in Syngnathid pouch complexity with brood pouches ranging from simple ventral gluing areas to fully enclosed pouches. In species with more developed, enclosed pouches it has been demonstrated that males directly provide their brood with not only nutrients but also immunity to pathogens. Syngnathids with more developed brood pouches are also known {{to be able to}} partially or completely abort a brood from a female with low fitness.|$|E
50|$|These birds exhibit many mating patterns, {{most notably}} monogamy and {{sequential}} and simultaneous polyandry; however, social monogamy {{is the most}} abundant mating pattern. The frequencies of these various mating patterns most likely vary with numerous ecological and social factors. Many {{studies have shown that}} both males and females prefer a mate with a larger yellow patch. It has also been shown that <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> defence behaviours increase with greater female ornamentation. Males also differentially allocate parental investment according to female ornamentation; this behaviour is not observed in females. In alpine colonies of Petronia petronia, females perform most of the provisioning. In Asian colonies, both males and females contribute equally to the care of the young. Males of larger sizes feed their young at higher rates, which suggests that larger males occupy better territories and/or are better fathers. Studies have found a positive correlation between male yellow breast patch size and nestling tarsus length, which suggests that more ornamented males are also better parents. Females increase the number of non-feeding visits to their nest as the season progresses, suggesting that because females have lesser opportunities to lay other clutches, it is most advantageous to support the survival of their current offspring. A positive relationship between the number of deserting females and the number of available males has been recorded.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{study on}} C. floridanum 24% of the members in the polymorula, of either sex, develop in to {{soldiers}} and when the host is killed in its final instar these soldiers die too while their siblings consume the host and pupate to emerge as adults around two weeks later. Like other Hymenoptera the females are produced from fertilised eggs and the males from unfertilised eggs, female eggs produce a higher number of soldiers throughout development while male eggs produce fewer and only in the later stages of the cycle. Where {{there is more than}} one brood, where more than one egg has been laid in a host the soldier caste from the first female brood will kill all any larvae from subsequent eggs laid, except that if a <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> is older and from a different mother then the females will co-exist with the males. It appears that the early emerging female soldiers purpose is inter-specific competition, they ensure that the first female brood has the host to themselves by killing other non related and females and related and younger males, while the later soldiers are produced to defend the host from intra-specific competitors and are produced by both sexes, although male soldiers of C. floridanum lack aggression and their production may be a trait which is being selected against.|$|E
40|$|The {{long-snouted seahorse}} (Hippocampus guttulatus) (Cuvier, 1829), {{was used to}} {{validate}} the pre-dictive accuracy of three progressively realistic models for estimating the realized annual fecundity of asyn-chronous, indeterminate, multiple spawners.

The most realistic model, a generalization of the spawning fraction method, produced unbiased estimates of <b>male</b> <b>brooding</b> frequency (mean ±standard deviation [SD]= 4. 2 ± 1. 6 broods/year). Mean batch fecundity and realized annual fecundity were 213. 9 (± 110. 9) and 903. 6 (± 522. 4), respectively. However, females prepared significantly more clutches than the number of <b>broods</b> produced by <b>males.</b> Thus, methods that infer spawning frequency from patterns in female egg production may lead to significant overestimates of realized annual fecundity. The spawning fraction method is broadly applicable to many taxa that exhibit parental care and can be applied nondestructively to species for which conservation is a concern. ...|$|R

40|$|In many insect societies, {{workers can}} {{manipulate}} the reproductive output of their colony by killing kin of lesser value to them. For instance, {{workers of the}} mound-building Formica exsecta eliminate <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> in colonies headed by a single-mated queen. By combining an inclusive fitness model and empirical data, we investigated the selective causes underlying these fratricides. Our model examines until which threshold stage in <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> development do the workers benefit from eliminating males to rear extra females instead. We then determined the minimal developmental stage reached by male larvae before elimination in F. exsecta field colonies. Surprisingly, many male larvae were kept until they were close to pupation, and only then eliminated. According to our model, part of the eliminated males were so large that workers would not benefit from replacing them with new females. Moreover, males were eliminated late in the season, so that new females {{could no longer be}} initiated, because matings take place synchronously during a short period. Together, these results indicate that workers did not replace <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> with new females, but rather reduced total brood size during late larval development. Male destruction was probably triggered by resource limitation, and the timing of brood elimination suggests that males may have been fed to females when these start to grow exponentially during the final larval stage. Hence, the evolution of fratricides in ants is best explained by a combination of ecological, demographic and genetic parameters...|$|E
50|$|As {{the genus}} Hippocampus {{consists}} of two morphologically distinct forms, {{it has been suggested}} that it should be split into two distinct genera, Hippocampus and a new genus comprising the pygmy seahorses. Pygmy seahorses have a single gill opening on the back of the head (instead of two on the sides as in normal seahorses), and the <b>males</b> <b>brood</b> their young inside their trunk, instead of in a pouch on the tail. A molecular phylogeny confirms that the pygmy seahorses are a monophyletic sister lineage of all other seahorses.|$|R
50|$|Like {{with other}} seahorses, the male lined seahorse is the caregiver. During intercourse, the female sprays her eggs into the <b>male's</b> <b>brood</b> pouch where the eggs will {{incubate}} for 20-21 days.

5000|$|Males {{and females}} both {{actively}} court {{one another for}} mating, but courting is more frequent in females.  Courtship and copulation follow a stereotyped pattern, beginning when one fish identifies a prospective mate nearby and performs the ritualized dance.  If the other is receptive, the two align and continue the dance together until the female delivers her eggs into the <b>male's</b> <b>brood</b> pouch via an ovipositor.

40|$|Sex {{allocation}} {{in social}} insects {{has become a}} general model in tests of inclusive fitness theory sex-ratio theory, and parent-offspring conflict. Several {{studies have shown that}} colony sex ratios are often bimodally distributed, with some colonies producing mainly females and others mainly males. Sex specialization may result from workers assessing their relatedness to <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> versus female brood, relative to the average worker relatedness asymmetry in other colonies of their population. Workers then adjust the sex ratio in their own interest. This hypothesis assumes that workers can recognize the sex of the brood in their colony and selectively eliminate males. We compared the primary sex ratio (at the egg stage) and secondary sex ratio (reproductive pupae and adults) of colonies in the ant Pheidole pallidula. There was a strong bimodal distribution of secondary sex ratios, with most colonies producing mainly reproductives of one sex. In contrast, {{there was no evidence of}} a bimodal distribution of primary sex ratios. The proportion of haploid eggs produced by queens was 0. 35 in early spring and decreased to about 0. 1 in summer. Male eggs also were present in virtually all field colonies sampled in July, although eggs laid at this time of year never give rise to males. All <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> is, therefore, selectively eliminated beginning in July and continue to be eliminated through the rest of the year. Finally the population sex-ratio investment was female-biased. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that workers control the secondary sex ratio by selectively eliminating <b>male</b> <b>brood</b> in about half the colonies, perhaps those with high relatedness asymmetry...|$|E

25|$|When {{the male}} accepts female courting, the female expels eggs from the urogenitial papilla. Female Banggai {{cardinalfish}} produce {{a relatively small}} clutch, consisting {{of no more than}} ninety eggs that are two to three millimeters in diameter. Once approximately three-fourths of the egg mass protrudes from the female, the male takes the eggs from her. This process is immediate, taking no more than two seconds. Eggs may be lost in the process if the male drops them, as it is usually immediately consumed by other fish in the area. Males also have the ability to detect dead eggs and expel them from his mouth. The <b>male</b> <b>broods</b> the eggs in his mouth for up to 30 days, during which it does not feed. After spawning, the female stays with the <b>brooding</b> <b>male</b> for at least few days. Females aggressively defend its territory by immediately chasing any intruders that approach the <b>brooding</b> <b>male.</b> They also exhibit relaxed form of ‘side by side trembling’, and confine the male to a small space.|$|R
40|$|From an {{evolutionary}} and adaptive perspective, the occurrence {{and extent of}} parental care in animals (investment in offspring beyond the genetic contribution) is expected to depend on an optimal (fitness-maximizing) balance of its costs and benefits. Males of the sex-role reversed broad-nosed pipefish, Syngnathus typhle, which care for eggs and embryos and may perform brood reduction, are particularly interesting in this respect. In this thesis, I explore paternal care in the broad-nosed pipefish with special focus on the causes and consequences of brood reduction. Firstly, I demonstrate that <b>brooding</b> <b>males</b> absorb nutrients from reduced embryos in their brood pouch, presumably benefiting their own nutrition. This indicates that brood reduction in this species is similar to filial cannibalism (eating of own young), found in many other fish species with paternal care. Furthermore, as the embryos did not absorb nutrients originating from siblings in the same pouch, there is no support for ‘nurse eggs’ in this pipefish species (paper I). When comparing <b>brooding</b> <b>males</b> with non-brooding <b>males,</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>males</b> were on average in better condition, as measured by hepatosomatic index (HSI). This {{is contrary to the}} expectation that the metabolic and other costs of <b>brooding</b> <b>males</b> should deplete their energy reserves. However, given the results above (paper I), the higher HSI in <b>brooding</b> <b>males</b> may to some extent stem from nutrients acquired through brood reduction (paper V). This uptake is, however, unlikely to fully compensate for the costs of paternal care since another experiment (paper IV) showed that <b>males</b> <b>brooding</b> full broods had lower survival, despite a larger relative brood reduction, compared to <b>males</b> with half-sized <b>broods</b> (paper V). Furthermore, the more eggs a male received, the more eggs were reduced, which supports the indication that the cost of brooding is related to brood size (paper II and IV). This clearly indicates that embryos are competing over paternal care and that paternal care is a costly and limiting resource. Costs of paternal care in terms of reduced energy reserves (HSI) and lower survival (paper IV) suggests that males in poor condition (low HSI) should have a lower optimal brood size and thus show a larger relative brood reduction, as found in paper III. Also, males with low HSI received fewer eggs at mating and were more likely to suffer mortality from an infection (paper III). When comparing monogynously and polygynously mated males, only monogynous <b>males</b> showed significant <b>brood</b> reduction, whereas polygynous males did not (paper II). This may be caused by either increased paternal provision or less competition due to less overlapping needs within half-sib than full-sib broods. Also, broods from larger females survived better than broods from smaller females (paper III and V). This may show that large eggs have certain qualities which allow them to survive better, or that males provide better care to eggs from larger females, reflecting the sexual conflict of embryo competition and cryptic male choice that may be operating in this species. In summary, I have found that several factors influence the process of brood reduction (filial cannibalism) in the broad-nosed pipefish. These factors include the number of female mating partners, brood size, egg size and male condition. Consequently, these factors are important in parental conflicts and parent-offspring conflicts over the level of parental care and brood reduction...|$|R
40|$|A parent's {{nutritional}} state may influence {{its ability to}} provide care to offspring and ability to handle infections. In the broad-nosed pipefish, Syngnathus typhle, males care for their offspring by brooding the developing embryos in a brood pouch, providing nutrients and oxygen, resembling a pregnancy. Here, we demonstrate that the {{nutritional state}} of pregnant males covaries with their own survival during a selective event. <b>Brooding</b> <b>males</b> surviving a Vibrio sp. infection were in a significantly better nutritional state, as estimated by their hepatosomatic index. Furthermore, a higher nutritional state of the <b>brooding</b> <b>male</b> correlated with a lower embryo mortality, while feeding treatment (low vs. high) {{had no effect on}} male survival, nutritional state or embryo mortality. Finally, <b>males</b> <b>brooding</b> heavier embryos also showed a lower embryo mortality. This may reflect a maternal effect (if large eggs result in higher embryo survival), a paternal effect (if higher provisioning of male care promotes both embryo growth and survival), or a combination thereof (males caring more for large embryos). The results demonstrate the importance of a good nutritional state for a caring parent when their immunity is challenged...|$|R
