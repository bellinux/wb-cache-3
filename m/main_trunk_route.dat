5|$|In 1825 the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) {{established}} Fort Vancouver on {{the bank}} of the Columbia, in what is now Vancouver, Washington, as the headquarters of the company's Columbia District, which encompassed everything west of the Rocky Mountains. John McLoughlin, a physician, was appointed Chief Factor of the Columbia District. The HBC reoriented its Columbia District operations toward the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia, which became the region's <b>main</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>route.</b> In the early 1840s Americans began to colonize the Oregon country in large numbers via the Oregon Trail, despite the HBC's efforts to discourage American settlement in the region. For many the final leg of the journey involved travel down the lower Columbia River to Fort Vancouver. This part of the Oregon Trail, from The Dalles to Fort Vancouver, was the trail's most treacherous stretch, which prompted the 1846 construction of the Barlow Road.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the {{disadvantages}} of the East Coast <b>Main</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>route</b> through the Karangahake and Athenree gorges became starkly apparent. The capacity of the line was constrained by several factors; its length, severe grades of up to 1:50, sharp curves of up to 6 chains radius, and light 55lb per yard rail which prohibited the use of the more powerful diesel locomotives. It was also an unreliable route, with frequent disruptions caused by slips.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, British Railways drew up its 'Modernisation Plan'. This mainly {{concerned}} {{itself with the}} planned withdrawal of steam locomotives and the electrification of its <b>main</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>routes.</b> However, the plan also listed several lines that could be closed either because they were redundant in a nationalised, competition-free network or because they were unsustainable to operate. The Meon Valley Railway fell into both these categories.|$|R

A variety of other major roads run through the region, maintained by county councils.|$|R
50|$|Limited expresses {{were rare}} beyond the <b>main</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>routes</b> and the regular provincial expresses were {{typically}} augmented with even slower mixed trains. However, when the Rotorua Express schedule was accelerated in 1930 and its carriages upgraded, it was rebranded as the Rotorua Limited. Due to the Great Depression and rising car ownership levels, {{it did not}} achieve the level of success intended, thus in 1937 it reverted to the status and service pattern of a regular express.|$|R

25|$|It was in 1966 {{that the}} Network for Development Plans were issued by Barbara Castle, the Labour Minister of Transport, {{following}} a study. Lines that were remunerative, {{such as the}} <b>main</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>routes</b> and some secondary lines, would be developed. Those that {{failed to meet the}} financial criterion but served a social need were to be retained and subsidised under the 1968 Transport Act. The problem would be for lines that were not in the above categories, which could be candidates for closure as they did not form part of the basic railway network. The Hurst Green to Lewes line was one of those that fell into this category. It was a line that carried considerable traffic, and perhaps made a small profit, but it did not meet the Government's social, economic and commercial criteria for retention.|$|R
