40|$|A {{new type}} of {{antiallergic}} drug, oxatomide (60 mg daily), was compared with the antihistaminic, <b>mequitazine</b> (10 mg daily), in a 5 -week double-blind randomized study involving 26 patients with chronic urticaria. In the 13 oxatomide-treated patients, papules, erythema and pruritus were significantly suppressed after 2 weeks, which was markedly more rapid than with <b>mequitazine.</b> Slight somnolence was reported by 3 patients on oxatomide and 1 on mequitazine; in the latter case, severe urine retention was also reported. Another patient on <b>mequitazine</b> had to discontinue treatment because of severe drowsiness. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mequitazine</b> {{is a new}} {{phenothiazine}} derivative with potent antihistaminic activity {{developed by}} Pharmuka, Co. Ltd., in France. Although the action of this drug on central nervous system {{is reported to be}} very weak in the dose range used as antihistaminics, the CNS action cannot be neglected when the huge amount is applied. In order to predict the safety use of this drug in clinical therapy the ability to develop barbital-type physical dependence was investigated. In conclusion, a single dose suppression test and substitution test in barbital dependent mice, and also the primary dependence liability test after repeated administration of the drug in rats revealed that <b>Mequitazine</b> has no physical dependence liability even in the toxic dose...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid method for {{isolation}} of ketotifen and <b>mequitazine</b> with Sep-Pak C 18 cartridges from {{human whole blood}} and urine is presented. The detection of the drugs was made by a non-polar capillary gas chromatography with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector. The drug containing samples, after mixing with slightly alkaline buffer solution, were directly applied to the cartridges and eluted with chloroform/methanol (9 : 1). The recoveries of ketotifen were close to 100 % for both whole blood and urine samples, and those of <b>mequitazine</b> were 50. 0 % and 70. 7 %, respectively. Both drugs could be separated from impurities on the gas chromatograms. The detection limit of each drug was about 400 pg in an injected volume. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|Background: : Exacerbations of {{bronchial}} asthma usually {{occur in the}} autumn. To our knowledge, however, the effectiveness of drugs for preventing exacerbations of asthma in the autumn has not been studied previously, except for leukotriene receptor antagonists and Omalizmab. Methods: : This study compared the prophylactic effectiveness of suplatast tosilate with that of <b>mequitazine</b> in children with asthma symptoms, which is usually exacerbated in the autumn. The study group comprised 27 children aged 2 to 15 years who required treatment for asthmatic attacks {{during the past year}} and tested positive at least for mite allergen in the preceding autumn. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either suplatast or <b>mequitazine.</b> The primary endpoint of this study was the number of days without symptoms during the 8 weeks of treatment. In addition, the Japanese Pediatric Asthma Control Program (JPAC) scores were also recorded every 2 weeks in each group. Results: : Overall, 14 patients received suplatast, and 13 received <b>mequitazine</b> for 8 weeks from September through early October. During follow-up, the number of days without symptoms and the total JPAC scores did not differ significantly between the groups. However, as compared with weeks 1 to 2 of treatment, the mean number of days without symptoms during weeks 7 to 8 increased significantly in only the suplatast group (8. 6 vs. 11. 5 days; p = 0. 004). Conclusions: : Our results suggest that short-term additional treatment with suplatast is useful for preventing asthma symptoms in children with asthma, which is usually exacerbated in the autumn...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundRecent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that allergic rhinitis is closely related to bronchial asthma, reflecting the "one airway-one disease" hypothesis. It is unclear if the effects of pranlukast, a leukotriene-receptor antagonist, are consistent with this hypothesis. ObjectiveThe goal {{of the study was to}} determine if pranlukast has effects on the upper and lower airways through a comparison of the effects of fexofenadine and pranlukast on airway hyperresponsiveness in non-asthmatic patients with cedar pollinosis before the Japanese cedar pollen season and during the peak pollen season. MethodsPatients received fexofenadine hydrochloride plus oral <b>mequitazine</b> (fexofenadine group) or pranlukast hydrate plus oral <b>mequitazine</b> (pranlukast group) as an initial treatment. Subsequent changes in airway responsiveness to acetylcholine were measured. ResultsAmong patients in whom coughing developed during the peak pollen season, airway responsiveness significantly increased in the fexofenadine group. In the pranlukast group, airway responsiveness did not increase significantly, regardless of the presence or absence of coughing. ConclusionsThe results indicate that pranlukast hydrate inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness in non-asthmatic patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis. In turn, this suggests that cysteinyl leukotrienes have a role in increased airway responsiveness...|$|E

40|$|Antihistaminics {{are widely}} used for various {{indications}} during microbial infection. Hence, this paper investigates the antimicrobial activities of 10 antihistaminics belonging to both old and new generations using multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. The bacteriostatic activity of antihistaminics was investigated by determining their MIC both by broth and agar dilution techniques against 29 bacterial strains. Azelastine, cyproheptadine, <b>mequitazine</b> and promethazine were the most active among the tested drugs. Diphenhydramine and cetirizine possessed weaker activity whereas doxylamine, fexofenadine and loratadine were inactive even at the highest tested concentration (1 mg/ml). The MIC of meclozine could not be determined as it precipitated with the used culture media. The MBC values of antihistaminics were almost identical to the corresponding MIC values. The bactericidal activity of antihistaminics was also studied by the viable count technique in sterile saline solution. Evident killing effects were exerted by <b>mequitazine,</b> meclozine, azelastine and cyproheptadine. Moreover, the dynamics of bactericidal activity of azelastine were studied by the viable count technique in nutrient broth. This activity {{was found to be}} concentration-dependant. This effect was reduced on increasing the inoculum size while it was increased on raising the pH. The post-antimicrobial effect of 100 fg/ml azelastine was also determined and reached up to 3. 36 h...|$|E
40|$|Intravenous {{administration}} of mequitamium iodide (LG 30435) prevented {{the increase of}} tracheobronchial vascular permeability induced either by antigen challenge or by exogenous histamine in the guinea-pig, while it was ineffective against PAF, serotonin or capsaicin. These findings indicate that mequitamium iodide selectively interferes with the effect of histamine on airway microvascular leakage, mediated by histamine H 1 receptors, and is more potent than diphenhydramine, <b>mequitazine</b> or astemizole. Histamine receptor antagonism {{is likely to be}} a major determinant of the antiallergic activity of the compound, although additional mechanisms may be involved...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Second-generation antihistamines (AHs) have, in general, fewer {{sedative}} effects {{than the}} first-generation. However, important inter-drug differences {{remain in the}} degree of cognitive and/or psychomotor impairment. The extent to which a particular compound causes disruption can be conveniently compared, to all other AHs, using the Proportional Impairment Ratio (PIR). Although the PIR can differentiate the relative impairment caused by individual drugs, there is no indication of the reliability of the ratios obtained. OBJECTIVE: To calculate the PIRs -together with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), as an index of reliability- and compare AHs currently, or soon to be, available in Japan, with respect to their intrinsic capacity to cause impairment. METHODS: Results from studies of cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, <b>mequitazine,</b> and olopatadine were included in the PIR calculations. All data utilised came from crossover studies in healthy volunteers which were randomised and placebo and positive-internal controlled. Existing databases from studies reporting the sedative effects of AHs on objective (speed, accuracy, memory) and subjective (feeling) psychometrics were augmented, via results from suitable studies published after the previous reviews. The null value for a PIR was one. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies were finally included for this review. Of the AHs assessed, fexofenadine, ebastine, and levocetirizine showed a PIR for objective tests of 0. However, only fexofenadine (PIR =  0. 49) had an upper limit of the 95 % CI of less than 1. Fexofenadine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, olopatadine, loratadine, and <b>mequitazine</b> all had a PIR for subjective ratings of 0, but the upper limits of the 95 % CIs were all in excess of 1, although fexofenadine (PIR =  2. 57) was the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that there are differences between second-generation AHs in the extent of sedation produced. However, subjective ratings indicate that patients may not necessarily be aware of this...|$|E

40|$|Background: Since all antihistamines {{are capable}} of {{crossing}} the blood-brain barrier, they may also cause sedation which may impair daily activities such as driving a car. The purpose of this review {{was to examine the}} effects of antihistamines on driving ability. Method: A literature search revealed 18 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials that applied the on-road highway driving test. In this test, subjects are instructed to drive 100 -km on a public highway with a steady lateral position and a constant speed (95 km/h). Primary outcome measure is the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP, cm), i. e. the weaving of the car. Results: The literature search yielded 18 clinical trials. At therapeutic doses, a single dose of diphenhydramine, emedastine and hydroxizine impaired driving comparable or greater than the effects of BAC 0. 08 %. Clemastine, triprolidine, mizolastine, acrivastine, dexchlorpheniramine CR and <b>mequitazine</b> impaired driving performance to the same extent as BAC 0. 05 %. For mizolastine significant impairment was only seen after higher than therapeutic doses. Results for cetirizine were mixed, illustrating the drug has the potential to impair driving performance, especially in sensitive subjects. Terfenadine, loratadine levocetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, bilastine fexofenadine and rupatadine showed no driving impairment in the standard driving test after acute administration of their recommended dose. Several studies examined subchronic effects of antihistamines on driving performance. After 4 days of daily treatment significant driving impairment was found for emedastine (2 and 4 mg bid), diphenhydramine (50 mg), clemastine (2 mg bid), triprolidine (5 mg bid), after 5 days of ebastine (30 mg), and after 8 days of hydroxyzine (50 mg). Mixed results were found for cetirizine (10 mg), terfenadine (120 mg) and loratadine (20 mg). No significant differences from placebo were observed after 4 days of subchronic treatment with triprolidine (10 mg), levocetirizine (5 mg), fexofenadine (up to 120 mg), and after 8 days of daily treatment with dexchlorpheniramine (6 mg), bilastine (20 and 40 mg), and <b>mequitazine</b> (10 mg). Conclusion: First- and second-generation antihistamines may significantly impair driving performance. The newer antihistamines such as levocetirizine and fexofenadine that cross to blood brain barrier to a much lesser degree do not show clinically relevant sedation or driving impairment...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{series of}} {{comparative}} trials on nine popular and pharmacologically distinct regimens {{for the treatment}} of hay fever was undertaken in the course of normal general practice in the pollen seasons of 1981 - 83. One hundred and forty doctors recruited 640 patients to assess the overall usefulness of the treatments on daily diaries. 'Usefulness' was scored on a linear analogue scale weighing up the degree of hay fever symptoms during treatment, side effects and ease of use of the preparation. The regimen with the highest overall usefulness score was beclomethasone diproprionate with sodium cromoglycate eye drops (Beconase and Opticrom). Although the score was not significantly higher than those for methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrone), astemizole (Hismanal) or terfenadine (Triludan), Beconase/Opticrom scored signif-icantly better than <b>mequitazine</b> (Primalan), chlorpheniramine maleate (Piriton), sodium cromoglycate nasal insufflation with xylometazoline/antazoline eye drops (Rynacrom and Otrivine-Antistin) and azatadine maleate (Optimine). Beconase/Opticrom was first in rank order with respect to all the other regimens {{for the treatment of}} both mild and severe hay fever. Dimethothiazine (Banistyl), also shown to be useful, has since been withdrawn from prescription...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} from the large monopolar cells (LMCs), which are the cells postsynaptic to photoreceptors, in the housefly Musca domestica. A multi-barrelled ionophoretic pipette glued to the recording electrode was used to apply a variety of cholinergic and histaminergic antagonists onto the recorded neurones. All substances which blocked the physiological response to light also antagonized the response to ionophoretically applied histamine, supporting the hypothesis that histamine is the neurotransmitter released by insect photoreceptors. In order of potency, the following drugs were found to block or reduce the LMCs responses to light: benzoquinonium 3 = gallamine> ranitidine 3 = atropine ~ cimetidine> metiamide~SK&F 93479 ^ mepyramine. Mecamyl-amine, scopolamine, dexetimide, nicotine, <b>mequitazine,</b> chlorpheniramine and clemastine were ineffective. Two other cholinergic ligands, hexamethonium and decamethonium, were much more potent than even benzoquinonium, but {{had the effect of}} facilitating and greatly slowing down the responses to light. Responses evoked by acetylchol-ine showed a different pharmacology, being blocked by mecamylamine but unaffected by hexamethonium. Despite testing a number of known cholinergic and histaminergic agents, no effective agonist for histamine was found. The results indicate the existence of a novel class of histamine-sensitive receptor with nicotinic features. In addition the unusual effects of a traditional HI agonist, 2 -thiazolylethylamine, suggested the presence of a second, distinct class of histamine receptor...|$|E
40|$|In {{pharmacotherapy}} for bronchitis and asthma, anti-hista-mines and anti-allergic {{drugs can}} be used concomitantly with theophylline (TP) to avoid induction of bronchoconstriction and inflammation in the respiratory tract. Some anti-hista-mines such as azelastine, ketotifen, <b>mequitazine,</b> mizolastine, pemiropast potassium, picumast dihydrochloride, repirinast, temelastine and terfenadine have been reported not to inter-act adversely with TP. 1) However, doqualast accelerated elim-ination of TP by increasing the free fraction in blood, and ke-totifen also decreased the serum level of TP. 2) TP has a nar-row therapeutic range in serum level of 10 — 20 mg/ml and can interact with other drugs in its metabolic process. 1, 3) Since many kinds of anti-allergic drugs have been developed and are commercially available, pharmacokinetic evaluation of the possible interaction between anti-allergic drugs and TP is important. Suplatast (ST), () -[2 -[4 -(3 -ethoxy- 2 -hydroxypropoxy) -phenylcarbamoyl]ethyl]dimethylsulfonium p-toluenesulfo-nate, is a novel anti-allergic drug and can inhibit not only production of IgE antibody but also type I allergic reaction. 4) That means ST can block both {{the first and second}} steps in an allergic reaction. In clinical practice, ST has been used for the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhini-tis. Anti-allergic drugs can be administered in association with TP, however, no interaction between ST and TP has been reported. In this study, we investigated the effect of ST on pharmacokinetics of TP in rats. A pharmacokinetic study in vivo was performed, and TP metabolism was also exam-ined in rat-liver microsomes in vitro. Finally, the inhibitory effect of ST and its main metabolite, M 1, on TP metabolism was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Background: H 1 antihistamines {{are widely}} used as {{therapeutics}} for allergic diseases. Sedation is a well-known side effect of H 1 antihistamines and sometimes it is life-threatening for patients. Thus {{it is important to}} evaluate the sedative properties of H 1 antihistamines to avoid side effects. For this purpose, histamine H 1 receptor (H 1 R) occupancy and proportional impairment ratios (PIR) are now being used. However, {{it is not easy to}} obtain these parameters. Here, we sought to evaluate the sedative properties of H 1 antihistamines by means of a large-scale surveillance at health insurance pharmacies. Methods: The survey was conducted at 37 health insurance pharmacies. The therapeutic efficacy and the degree of sleepiness were quantified through a questionnaire using the visual analog scale (VAS) directly from 1742 patients who received H 1 antihistamines. Results: The degree of sleepiness caused by the first-generation antihistamines was significantly higher than that of the second-generation antihistamines. The high VAS score in case of efficacy was found in d-chlorpheniramine, olopatadine, and ebastine. Among the mean values of efficacy, all second-generation antihistamines except for loratadine, bepotastine, and <b>mequitazine</b> were significantly higher than that of clemastine. Regarding the degree of sleepiness, clemastine scored the highest VAS score, and significantly lower scores were obtained in all second-generation antihistamines. Conclusions: The sedative properties of the H 1 antihistamines obtained from VAS analysis were very similar to those of H 1 R occupancy from positron emission tomography (PET) studies and PIR from meta-analysis. Our results indicate that large-scale surveillance using VAS might be useful to evaluate the profiles of H 1 antihistamines...|$|E
