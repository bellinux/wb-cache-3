50|$|Liquid {{silicone}} rubbers are supplied in barrels. Because {{of their}} low viscosity, these rubbers can be pumped through pipelines and tubes to the vulcanization equipment. The two components are pumped through a static mixer by a metering pump. One {{of the components}} contains the catalyst, typically platinum based. A coloring paste {{as well as other}} additives can also be added before the material enters the static mixer section. In the static mixer the components are well mixed and are transferred to the cooled <b>metering</b> <b>section</b> of the injection molding machine. The static mixer renders a very homogeneous material that results in products that are not only very consistent throughout the part, but also from part to part. This is in contrast to solid silicone rubber materials that are purchased pre-mixed and partially vulcanized. In contrast, hard silicone rubbers are processed by transfer molding and result in less material consistency and control, leading to higher part variability. Additionally, solid silicone rubber materials are processed at higher temperatures and require longer vulcanization times.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} of the flow through the <b>metering</b> <b>section</b> of hydraulic components plays {{a fundamental role in}} the design and optimization processes. In this paper the flow through a closed center directional control valve for load –sensing application is studied by means of a multidimensional CFD approach. In the analysis, an open source fluid-dynamics code is used and both cavitation and turbulence are accounted for in the modeling. A cavitation model based on a barotropic equation of state and homogeneous equilibrium assumption, including gas absorption and dissolution in the liquid medium, is adopted and coupled to a two equation turbulence approach. Both direct and inverse flows through the <b>metering</b> <b>section</b> of the control valve are investigated, and the differences in terms of fluid – dynamics behavior are addressed In particular, the discharge coefficient, the recirculating regions, the flow acceleration angle and the pressure and velocity fields are investigated and compared...|$|E

40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} processes rely on accurate flow metering, and ultrasonic flow meters are well established in this area. Most ultrasonic flow meters use piezoelectric transducers {{which are not}} very efficient at generating ultrasound in gases, and tend to be highly resonant which then limits their application. Capacitive ultrasonic transducers are an alternative device technology that can generate and detect ultrasound very efficiently in air and other gases, and produce transducers that are inherently broadband, meaning that additional frequency information may then be utilised. Of critical importance is the meter correction factor k, which correlates the ultrasonically measured flow rate with the actual flow rate in the <b>metering</b> <b>section.</b> Most flow meters require at least 15 diameters of straight pipe upstream and 5 diameters downstream, to allow the flow profile to become fully developed before it enters the <b>metering</b> <b>section.</b> This means that on-site calibration is usually a necessity. The k-factor varies depending on the specific installation of the flow meter, and also the flow regime, as it {{is related to the}} fluid flow profile.
