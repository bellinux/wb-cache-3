5|$|On 25 December 1978, Sjumandjaja {{announced}} his return {{with a new}} film, Kabut Sutra Ungu (<b>Mist</b> <b>of</b> Purple Silk), an adaptation of the novel by Ike Soepomo. Kabut Sutra Ungu was followed by several more films, including Bukan Sandiwara (Not a Play; 1980), the biopic of female emancipation figure Kartini R. A. Kartini (1981), and Budak Nafsu (Slave to Lust; 1983), {{which was based on}} the novel Fatimah by Titie Said. Sjumandjaja's last film before his death, Kerikil-Kerikil Tajam (Sharp Pebbles) was released in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) funded Drinker to {{investigate}} the 1948 Donora smog, as the company {{had an interest in}} showing that its primary pollutants (sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide) had not significantly contributed to the damage it caused. In the middle of 1953, Amdur and her husband developed a method of spraying a combination <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide into humid chambers containing guinea pigs {{to investigate}} the damage that it would cause to their lungs. Guinea pigs were used as they breathe more deeply through their mouths than smaller rodents which breathe through their noses. The Amdurs bought their own guinea pigs for the mini project, and spent a holiday weekend doing the investigation.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{the mining}} {{establishment}} of Delamar Ghost Town, Nevada was ruined by a dry-mining process {{that produced a}} silicosis-causing dust. After hundreds of deaths from silicosis, the town was nicknamed The Widowmaker. The problem {{in those days was}} somewhat resolved with an addition of a nozzle to the drill which sprayed a <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> water, turning dust raised by drilling into mud, but this inhibited mining work.|$|E
25|$|Female smokers in film {{were also}} early on {{associated}} with a type of sensuous and seductive sexuality, most notably personified by German film star Marlene Dietrich. Similarly, actors like Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn have been closely identified with their smoker persona, {{and some of their}} most famous portraits and roles have involved them being haloed by a <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> cigarette smoke. Hepburn often enhanced the glamor with a cigarette holder, most notably in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Smoking could also be used as a means to subvert censorship, as two cigarettes burning unattended in an ashtray were often used to suggest sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|About 1900 {{there was}} a high {{incidence}} of scrotal cancer detected in former mule spinners. It was limited to cotton mule spinners and did not affect woollen or condenser mule spinners. The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and mineral oils used to lubricate the spindles. The spindles when running threw out a <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s much attention was given to this problem. Mules had used this mixture since the 1880s, and cotton mules ran faster and hotter than the other mules, and needed more frequent oiling. The solution was to make it a statutory requirement to only use vegetable oil or white mineral oils, which were believed to be non-carcinogens. By then cotton mules had been superseded by the ring frame and the industry was contracting, so it was never established whether these measures were effective.|$|E

500|$|After about 20years, {{the tree}} begins to develop fertile cones. Buds form where auxins accumulate; these become either new needles or cones. The buds remain {{undifferentiated}} until July {{and continue to}} develop throughout the fall and winter. The next year, some buds will open in mid-May exposing {{a new set of}} needles. The cone buds on {{the lower end of the}} tree [...] while other buds burst open in April releasing a <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> pollen. The cones at the top of the tree open their scales for wind-borne pollen to enter. Within the cone, the pollen fertilizes a seed which is released in September. The quantity and quality of seed production varies year-to-year but a particularly effective crop is produced about every 10years. Less than 0.1% of seeds survive Douglas squirrels, dark-eyed juncos, and other seed-eating animals.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{foundation}} of Newton Heath LYR F.C., {{at the request of}} the employees of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) company's Carriage and Wagon Works, the club needed a pitch to play on. The chosen site was owned by the Manchester Cathedral authorities, but although conveniently sited next to the wagon works it was a [...] "bumpy, stony patch in summer, [...] a muddy, heavy swamp in the rainy months". The railway company agreed to pay a nominal rent to the authorities and to lease the ground to the football club. As it was next to the railway line operated by the LYR, the ground was often clouded in a thick <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> steam from passing trains. Players had to get changed in TheThreeCrowns public house, a few hundred yards away on Oldham Road, as there were no facilities nearby. There may have been some kind of refreshment offered to supporters at the eastern end of the site.|$|E

500|$|Khalil Gibran {{was a great}} {{admirer of}} Marrash, whose works he had read at al-Hikmah school in Beirut. According to Shmuel Moreh, Gibran's own works echo Marrash's style and [...] "many of [...] ideas on enslavement, education, women's liberation, truth, the natural {{goodness}} of man, and the corrupted morals of society". Khalil Hawi has referred to Marrash's aforementioned philosophy of universal love as having left a deep impression on Gibran. Moreover, Khalil Hawi has stated that many of Marrash's recurring expressions became stock images for Arab writers of the 20th century: he has mentioned, for example, [...] "the valleys of mental contemplation", [...] "the wings of thoughts", [...] "solicitudes and dreams", [...] "the veils of history", [...] "the Kingdom of the Spirit", [...] "the nymphs of the forest, the spring and the dawn", [...] "golden diadems", [...] "the jewels of light", [...] "the storms of days and nights", and [...] "the smoke of revenge and the <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> anger". Poet and journalist Khalil Mutran dedicated poems to Marrash and others of his contemporaries.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the term [...] "heavy metal" [...] in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase {{has been used for}} centuries in {{chemistry}} and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both light and heavy metals (e.g., uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs. His 1962 novel The Soft Machine includes a character known as [...] "Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid". Burroughs' next novel, Nova Express (1964), develops the theme, using heavy metal as a metaphor for addictive drugs: [...] "With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms—Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> vaporized bank notes—And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music". Inspired by Burroughs' novels, the term was used in the title of the 1967 album Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids by Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music. The phrase was later lifted by Sandy Pearlman, who used the term to describe The Byrds for their supposed [...] "aluminium style of context and effect", particularly on their album The Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968).|$|E
500|$|Kindt {{was drafted}} into the United States Army in 1943 while at Wisconsin, in the <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> World War II. He {{reported}} to active duty on February 1, 1944, receiving basic training at Fort Wolters, Texas. After training, Kindt {{was assigned to the}} Army's 10th Mountain Division. He missed the 1944 season and half of the 1945 season while participating in the Italian Campaign. He was rewarded with two Bronze Stars, and a Victory Medal for his actions in Italy. Kindt returned to play for the Badgers in October 1945. [...] In his return, Kindt shared the halfback position with Ben Bendrick, and Jerry Thompson. Kindt only managed to play three games that season, mainly because of a late release he received while returning from the Army. When Kindt returned to the squad, one journalist took it as far as hailing Kindt's return as a [...] "godsend" [...] who inspired the Badgers with his [...] "inspirational play". He scored two touchdowns against Iowa upon his return. In the season finale on November 24 against the Minnesota Golden Gophers, Kindt scored three touchdowns despite being used as a [...] "blocking back" [...] in a 26–12 win. The Badgers finished the season with a 3–4–2 record.|$|E

500|$|During {{the night}} of 27/28 March, patrols of the 47th Battalion had {{observed}} German troops on the Albert–Dernancourt road, on the open flats just [...] across the railway line, but the night passed without obvious signs of attack. Early in the morning, the German artillery fell heavily on the support lines and rear area, but initially was very light along the railway line. In the thick <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> early dawn, the commander of a small post of the 47th Battalion, stationed behind the embankment immediately north of the level crossing, {{heard the sound of}} bayonet scabbards flapping on the thighs of marching troops. Sergeant Stanley McDougall woke his comrades and they ran to alert nearby elements of the battalion. McDougall, running {{along the top of the}} embankment, saw German troops of II/229 RIR advancing along the whole front through the mist. Returning with a handful of men, he planned to deploy them behind the ungarrisoned bank to the south. By this time, Germans were throwing hand grenades over the embankment, and one exploded near a Lewis machine gun team in front of McDougall, badly wounding the two man crew. McDougall, who had previously been a Lewis gunner, grabbed the gun and began to fire it from the hip as he went. First he shot down two German light machine gun teams as they tried to cross the rails, then, running along the enemy edge of the embankment, saw about 20 Germans waiting for the signal to assault. He hosed them down with the gun, then as they ran, followed them with its fire. By this time, several of his comrades had been killed or wounded.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a warning saying [...] "no men were harmed {{in the making of}} this video". In the opening, it shows Aguilera playing 1980's {{computer}} games on her computer when she gets an incoming message from an occult fortune teller. Opening the message, she asks [...] "Hey Oranum, what's my week look like?" [...] to which the occult fortune teller responds [...] "You're gonna have a killer week!". Aguilera coyly smiles to the camera and images are shown of Aguilera writhing around seductively on a bed and eating cereal whilst on the couch watching cartoons. In the clip, Aguilera plays a killer who kills men after seducing them. She goes on a ride with the first man and seduces him leading to a make-out session between the two, then after he falls asleep, she blows up his car in electric-pink flames. Next, she goes to a bar and seduces the second man in a bathroom stall, where she bludgeons him to death, leaving spatters of blue paint dripping from the walls. Finally, she seduces a third unlucky suitor (who was foretold by the same occult fortune teller that it was his unlucky day) by inviting him to a motel and then uses a baseball bat to kill him, [...] "showering the room in a <b>mist</b> <b>of</b> red confetti". The video ends with Aguilera washing off the red confetti splattered all over herself while looking in the mirror at her reflection and as the confetti goes down the drain, shows Aguilera in her trailer eating cereal while changing channels on her television set, settling on [...] "The Lucy Show" [...] before smiling and turning off her television. The video features several cultural influences, including the old NES Advantage, the psychic site Oranum.com, and short films of The Lucy Show featuring American actress Lucille Ball.|$|E
