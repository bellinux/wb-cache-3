40|$|AbstractOn-line {{estimation}} of workpiece height {{is essential for}} wire breaking prevention in WEDM process. In addition, it can provide the reference of machining parameters setting for increasing <b>machining</b> <b>speed</b> and stability. A new on-line WEDM workpiece height estimation system for the iso-energy type wire EDM machine is presented. Based on the proposed specific discharge energy (SDE), a mathematical model relating workpiece height, feed rate and discharging frequency by a proportional constant is derived. This constant coined thickness identification coefficient (TIC) is found a function of workpiece height. Hence, a simplified approach is proposed. The value of TIC of a known workpiece height is taken to estimate the workpiece height during the WEDM process. The actual workpiece height is obtained by multiplying the estimated value by the correction factor of the associated workpiece height. Experimental {{results show that the}} system works satisfactorily. The estimation error of workpiece height is within 1 mm while the response time is less than 1 second in general. In the practical application of machining a workpiece with dynamic variations in thickness, a model relating optimum servo voltage and workpiece height that leads to maximum <b>machining</b> <b>speed</b> is established in advance.

Since, the first commercialization of SACE, future customers’ needs have to be taken in account: the initial cost of the machine, the process cost, the <b>machining</b> <b>speed,</b> the reproducibility, the quality of the machining.

40|$|Abstract. Block {{electrode}} discharge grinding is {{an effective}} approach to produce micro rods. However, {{it is difficult to}} fabricate the rods into desired miniature and precision. To solve this problem, the tangential feeding method is proposed to control the finish size of micro rods. With this method, the micro rod is first fed in its radial direction, and then in the tangential direction for an enough distance. The wear of the block electrode decreases gradually from the start to the end, and the wear in the end can be neglected. Experiments indicate that the large capacitance or voltage can obtain high <b>machining</b> <b>speed,</b> while the small ones can gain thin micro rods. Based on this result, the policy of delaminating grinding is adopted to gain enough thin micro rods at a high <b>machining</b> <b>speed.</b> The Φ 5 µm micro rods can be ground with this method.

40|$|The wide {{application}} of NC technologies and the advance in integrated manufacturing have significantly improved productivity. This however also leads to complexity in shop floor planning, particularly in machine-level planing {{due to the}} increased flexibility {{in the selection of}} machining parameters, tools, and tool paths. Part sequencing, tool replacement and <b>machining</b> <b>speed</b> selection for metal cutting in general and tool set selection, <b>machining</b> <b>speed</b> specifications as well as path sequencing for hole making in particular have a direct impact on manufacturing economics and hence have drawn much attention of many researchers. However, these problems have been often solved in isolation to each other, thereby causing inconsistent and conflicting planning actions on the shop floor. As a result, the solutions obtained in such a way can not be used for real shop floor planning. At the best a lengthy process is needed to resolve the conflict between the separately obtained solutions. Such a decision process obviously does not meet the need of modern manufacturing environment where quick and consistent planning decisions are imperative. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to model and solve several combined planning problems facing today's manufacturing industry. These include (a) part sequencing and tool replacement with sequence-dependent setup times and probabilistic tool life; (b) Just-In-Time (JIT) part scheduling with variable processing times and sequence dependent setups; and (c) tool set selection, <b>machining</b> <b>speed</b> specification, operation sequencing and path selection for hole making operations. These problems are combinatorial in nature and are often classified as NP-complete. Consequently, optimal solutions may not be obtained within polynomial times. In this dissertation, tabu search technique has been employed to solve the above combined planning problems. The computational results have shown that these problems can be efficiently solved and consistent decisions can be made based on the solutions. The effects of some important parameters such as initial solutions, move selection, termination criteria, and tabu list size on the search performance have also been examined...|$|E
