5|$|Manchester United {{fashioned}} {{the first}} chance {{of the second half}} after just three <b>minutes,</b> <b>when</b> Rooney cut inside from the right along the face of the penalty area, but his left-footed shot was blocked away for a corner kick. Soon after, Van Nistelrooy received the ball {{on the edge of the}} penalty area and held it up before playing a through-ball to Keane, but the Irishman's low cross was diverted behind by Kolo Touré before it reached Rooney. United then had their third chance in the space of five <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> Ronaldo shot just wide from 25 yards, from the left corner of the penalty area.|$|E
5|$|A {{qualifying}} {{match for}} the 1995 King of the Ring tournament took place next as Mabel faced Adam Bomb in a standard match. The contest was one-sided and ended in two <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> Mabel pinned Bomb after he powerslamed {{him down to the}} mat. Mabel advanced to the next round of the tournament, beginning a push for the superstar.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{problems}} were discovered when the ride {{opened to the}} public. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland underwent repairs for just over a week when {{it was discovered that}} one of the 32 pairs of seats had been removed for an unstated reason. They were replaced and testing began shortly after. In another case at the same installation, riders were stuck {{at the top of the}} WindSeeker tower for 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> the swings did not come down. Since these incidents, ride operations are suspended during high winds or heavy rain.|$|E
50|$|Arsenal {{took the}} lead in the 20th <b>minute,</b> <b>when</b> Ian Wright headed in a cross. Sheffield Wednesday {{equalised}} in the 61st <b>minute,</b> <b>when</b> David Hirst turned in a low drive, past the advancing Arsenal goalkeeper, David Seaman.|$|R
50|$|Maximum rate of {{fire with}} all models is 30 bombs per <b>minute,</b> <b>when</b> loaded by two people alternately, or 12 bombs per <b>minute,</b> <b>when</b> loaded by only one person. Naturally, the maximum ranges differ {{depending}} on the ballistic barrel length and the maximal allowed charges.|$|R
50|$|Blackburn {{recorded}} {{their first}} {{victory of the}} season just three days later at Ewood Park, running out 3-0 winners against Leicester City. Chris Sutton got the first goal and his first for his new club in the 19th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> he headed in Shearer's delicately flighted chip. Henning Berg doubled the advantage in the 59th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> he knocked in Sutton's flick on from close range. The points were {{wrapped up in the}} 74th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> Robbie Slater's shot hit the post and fell straight to Shearer, who swept the ball home.|$|R
5|$|Building on {{his results}} on matrix games {{and on his}} model of an {{expanding}} economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after George Dantzig described his work in a few <b>minutes,</b> <b>when</b> an impatient von Neumann asked him {{to get to the}} point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.|$|E
5|$|Davies scored for Bolton on 21 <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> {{an error}} by Middlesbrough goalkeeper Schwarzer allowed his shot {{to go inside}} his near post. Bolton {{continued}} to attack, and Schwarzer made a double save from winger Per Frandsen and Djorkaeff. The latter had two more chances soon after, missing the target with the first. Boro pleaded for a second penalty when Nicky Hunt pulled Job, but referee Riley did not give it.|$|E
5|$|Liaising with NBN News {{director}} Jim Sullivan, NBN Late Edition News producer Matt Carden {{secured a}} live feed through the Nine Network of ABC America enabling first pictures to be aired of the New York attacks within <b>minutes.</b> <b>When</b> the program went on air {{a short time}} later, newsreader Jodi McKay handed over to ABC News America's coverage of events, anchored by Peter Jennings. The bulletin was extended until 1am when NBN handed over to TCN-9 {{for the start of}} almost five days of continuous national coverage.|$|E

50|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 83,179, Ajax {{took the lead in}} the 5th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> Dick van Dijk scored. Ajax {{extended}} their lead in the 87th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> a shot by Arie Haan deflected off defender Anthimos Kapsis and went into the Panathinaikos goal, giving Ajax its first European Cup victory by a score of 2-0.|$|R
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 74,500, the first half was goalless until Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the 39th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> midfielder Steven Gerrard scored. The score {{remained}} the same until the 86th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> striker Michael Owen scored to make the score 2–0 to Liverpool.

5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that glow {{in the presence of}} fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{deadlock}} {{was broken}} on 31 <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> Jürgen Kohler, who was playing his last game for Dortmund, pulled back Jon Dahl Tomasson in the Dortmund penalty area; Kohler was shown a straight red card, and Van Hooijdonk converted the subsequent penalty, dispatching it to Jens Lehmann's right hand side. Feyenoord made it 2–0 seven minutes later when Van Hooijdonk, scored a free kick {{from the edge}} of the area, his eighth goal over the course of the season's competition.|$|E
5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>when,</b> after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E
50|$|Embé got the {{equalizing}} {{goal for}} Cameroon in the 31st <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> he side-footed {{into an empty}} net from close range after a pass from the left.

50|$|Premier League team Tottenham Hotspur {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the third round. Birmingham {{took the lead in}} the match held at Tottenham's home ground, White Hart Lane, in the 15th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> Adebola scored. He scored again in the 28th minute and a goal from Mark Burchill in the 45th minute gave Birmingham a 3-0 lead at half-time. Tottenham pulled a goal back through a penalty-kick scored by Darren Anderton, but they were unable to level the match and Birmingham won 3-1. They faced Premier League team Newcastle United in the fourth round, with the match held at St Andrew's. Newcastle took the lead in the 14th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> Kieron Dyer scored, but Birmingham equalised in the 31st <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> Adebola scored. The match remained level until the final <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> Michael Johnson scored to give Birmingham a 2-1 victory. Fellow First Division team Sheffield Wednesday were the {{opposition in the}} quarter-finals. Birmingham won the match 2-0, courtesy of goals from Danny Sonner and Adebola.|$|R
5|$|This was {{a result}} of the attacks from Midway, {{as well as of the}} morning flight leader's {{recommendation}} of a second strike. Re-arming had been under way for about 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>when,</b> at 07:40, the delayed scout plane from Tone signaled that it had sighted a sizable American naval force to the east, but neglected to describe its composition. Later evidence suggests Nagumo did not receive the sighting report until 08:00.|$|E
5|$|While Sayid is gone, Daniel asks Regina (Zoë Bell), a {{colleague}} on the freighter {{to shoot a}} projectile onto the island. Regina does so, but the projectile does not arrive for thirty <b>minutes.</b> <b>When</b> it lands, Daniel extracts a clock from the payload and finds that the two times, that running {{on the island and}} that running outside, are not synchronized.|$|E
5|$|A popular workmen's train (one penny per journey) ran between Ludgate Hill and Victoria via Herne Hill from 1865. Trains {{left from}} both termini at 04:55 and {{returned}} at 18:15. The LCDR {{was compelled to}} operate this service by Parliament {{to compensate for the}} large number of working-class homes destroyed in Camberwell during the construction of the City Branch. Regular one-way fares to Ludgate Hill were eightpence, sixpence and fourpence for first, second and third class respectively (or return for one shilling, ninepence and sevenpence respectively), with journey times of 15 minutes on express trains and 26 <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> calling at all stops.|$|E
5|$|First Division side Leicester City {{were the}} {{opposition}} as United entered {{the competition in}} the third round, due to being in the Premier League. The match, held at United's home ground Old Trafford, was goalless until the 80th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> midfielder David Beckham scored from a penalty. They extended their lead in the 90th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> Kieran Richardson scored to win the match 2–0.|$|R
50|$|Adrian Heath {{opened the}} scoring for Everton in the 80th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> he ran in on goal to shoot right footed {{to the left}} of the goalkeeper from six yards.

5|$|As {{the winner}} of 2015–16 I-League, Bengaluru FC were paired against 8th ranked team Aizawl F.C. for the quarter-final round. On 30 April 2016, in {{the first leg of}} quarter finals, Bengaluru FC took an early lead in 15th minute with a goal from Eugeneson Lyngdoh, however Alfred Jaryan {{equalized}} for the home team in 38th minute. Aizawl struck the final blow in the dying <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> Joel Sunday scored the winner for the home team, leaving Bengaluru FC trailing after the first leg. Bengaluru FC suffered a shock defeat in the home leg as well, as the team went down 2–3 to Aizawl. C.K. Vineeth's first half equalizer and Sunil Chhetri's successful penalty proved insufficient as Bengaluru FC were ousted from the Federation cup on 3–5 aggregate loss.|$|E
5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{eventually}} bowled England out for 441, {{leaving them}} {{a target of}} 98 on the final day. Bradman’s openers progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, but Morris again lacked fluency. Australia reached 38 from 32 <b>minutes</b> <b>when</b> Bedser bowled Morris for nine, but the tourists steadied to reach their target with eight wickets in hand. After bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Following the match, Fingleton criticised Morris, feeling that he was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot.|$|E
50|$|BEC Tero Sasana {{took the}} lead in the 14th <b>minute</b> <b>when</b> Wuttichai Tathong headed home an {{inviting}} cross from Noppol Pitafai.
