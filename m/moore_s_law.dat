40|$|Current {{system design}} trends {{continue}} to magnify {{the disparity between}} processor and memory performance. Thus, as microprocessors perform increasingly better than the mem-ory systems supporting them, it is ever more important to bridge the performance gap to help translate the promise of <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> <b>law</b> into overall performance delivered to the end applica-tions. This gap in performance between the processor and the memory is further exacerbated {{in the context of}} modern processors with high-levels of instruction level parallelism (ILP), especially for data-intensive applications. In these processors, increased demands for data delivery lead to concomitant needs for higher memory bandwidth and cache sizes. In this paper we provide a fast compile-time data-remapping technique which helps in bridging the gap between the ILP processor and its memory system, by enhancing the spatial locality of data-access. Our strategy is the first automatic approach applicable to pointer-intensive dy-namic applications for which existing optimizations are mostly inadequate. We demonstrate an average performance improvement of 27 % for several data-intensive applications. This is attributed to enhanced data locality, resulting in lowered demand on the bandwidth between cache levels, as well as between the cache subsystem and main memory. We also show that with increasing levels of ILP and fixed memory bandwidth, our remapping technique enables very high levels of performance with smaller cache sizes. For example, as much as a factor of 15 reduction in multi-level caches can be tolerated without a loss in performance. Although we use cycle-accurate simulators to detail the benefits of our remapping, we also measure 24 % performance improvements for the Intel Pentium II and III processors, and a 9 % yield on the Sun UltraSparc-II...|$|E

To maintain the exponential increase in integration density in CMOS technology, which is also known as <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> <b>law,</b> there is a strong desire for ultrathin, well-ordered, epitaxial REOx layers with a precisely engineered interface, which is essential for reliable, ultrahigh-performance devices. So far this has been considerably impeded by RE-promoted silicon oxidation, leading to amorphous silicon oxide and RE silicon formation. By using complementary synchrotron radiation methods such as X-ray standing waves (XSW), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), structural and spectroscopic information are inferred simultaneously from ultrathin ceria and lanthana films grown on chlorine, silver and gallium passivated silicon(111). In general, it is revealed that the chemical and structural composition of the interface and the crystallinity of ultrathin REOx layers on silicon can be precisely controlled by adsorbate-mediated growth. This might represent a crucial step towards a perfectly engineered interface, eventually allowing for the integration of REOx as high-k gate oxides in microelectronics. In catalysis inverse model catalysts are studied with the aim of getting an in-depth understanding of the basic principles of catalysis. These model systems are employed to study, e. g., the nature of active sites and the reaction pathways in complex catalytic converters. However, a lot remains unknown about the chemical activity and selectivity {{as a function of the}} growth mechanism, structure and morphology of these model systems.

It is revealed that ceria on ruthemium(0001) forms a commensurate phase.

IC downscaling with <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> <b>law</b> and system miniaturization with System-On-Package (SOP) paradigm has resulted {{and will continue}} to result in ultraminiaturized systems with unprecedented functionality at reduced cost. The trend towards 3 D silicon system integration is expected to downscale IC I/O pad pitches from 40 µm to 1 - 5 µm in future. Device- to- system board interconnections are typically accomplished today with either wire bonding or solders. Both of these are incremental and run into either electrical or mechanical barriers as they are extended to higher density of interconnections. Alternate interconnection approaches such as compliant interconnects typically require lengthy connections and are therefore limited in terms of electrical properties, although expected to meet the mechanical requirements. As supply currents will increase upto 220 A by 2012, the current density will exceed the maximum allowable current density of solders. The intrinsic delay and electromigration in solders are other daunting issues that become critical at nanometer size technology nodes. In addition, formation of intermetallics is also a bottleneck that poses significant mechanical issues. Recently, many research groups have investigated various techniques for copper-copper direct bonding. Typically, bonding is carried out at 400 oC for 30 min followed by annealing for 30 min. High thermal budget in such process makes it less attractive for integrated systems because of the associated process incompatibilities. In the present study, copper-copper bonding at ultra fine-pitch using advanced nano-conductive and non-conductive adhesives is evaluated. The proposed copper-copper based interconnects using advanced conductive and non-conductive adhesives will be a new fundamental and comprehensive paradigm to solve all the four barriers: 1) I/O pitch 2) Electrical performance 3) Reliability and 4) Cost. This thesis investigates the mechanical integrity and reliability of copper-copper bonding using advanced adhesives through test vehicle fabrication and reliability testing. Test vehicles were fabricated using low cost electro-deposition techniques and assembled onto glass carrier. Experimental results show that proposed copper-copper bonding using advanced adhesives could potentially meet all the system performance requirements for the emerging micro/nano-systems. M. S.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this dissertation is {{the demonstration of}} the impact of a new emerging technology called 3 D-integration technology on conventional high-performance microprocessors. 3 D-integration technology stacks active devices in the vertical dimension in addition to the conventional horizontal dimension. The additional degree of connectivity in the vertical dimension enables circuit designers to replace long horizontal wires with short vertical interconnects, thus reducing delay, power consumption, and area. To adapt planar microarchitectures to 3 D-integrated designs, we study several building blocks that together comprise a substantial portion of a processor s total transistor count. In particular, we focus our attention on three basic circuit classes: static random access memory (SRAM) circuits, associative/CAM logic circuits, and data processing in conventional high-performance processors. We propose 2 -die-stacked and 4 -die-stacked 3 D-integrated circuits to deal with the constraints of the conventional planar technology. We propose high-performance 3 D-integrated microprocessors and evaluate the impact on performance, power, and temperature. We demonstrate two different approaches to improve performance: clock speed (3 D-integrated processors with identical microarchitectural configurations as the corresponding planar processor run at a higher clock frequency), and IPC (3 D-integrated processors accommodate larger-sized modules than the planar processors for the same frequency). We demonstrate the simultaneous benefits of the 3 D-integration and highlight the power density and thermal issues related to the 3 D-integration technology. Next, we propose microarchitectural techniques based on significance partitioning and data-width locality to effectively address the challenges of power density and temperature. We demonstrate that our microarchitecture-level techniques can effectively control the power density issues in the 3 D-integrated processors. The 3 D-integrated processors provide a significant performance benefit over the planar processors while simultaneously reducing the total power. The simultaneous benefits in multiple objectives make 3 D-integration a highly desirable technology for use in building future microprocessors. One of the key contributions of this dissertation is the temperature analysis that shows that the worst-case temperatures on the 3 D-integrated processors can be effectively controlled using microarchitecture level techniques. The 3 D-integration technology may extend the applicability of <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> <b>law</b> for a few more technology generations. Ph. D.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Facilitated {{by the development of}} various direct-write techniques and functional polymeric materials including polymer based conductors and semiconductors, printed electronics are flourishing both commercially and as a research topic. This is not only because of their simpler manufacturing routes and lower cost, but also as a result of lower processing temperatures and better compatibility with flexible substrates, compared with conventional electronics. The development of conventional electronics has been guided by <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> <b>Law,</b> the driver for which lies in the demand for electronic devices with better performance and portability at lower prices. Therefore, one can expect a similar trend for printed electronics to guide its development. Multi-layered printing can be adopted in printed electronics to achieve higher density integration, so that this development trend can be maintained. In such circumstances, creation of electrical connections between multiple layers emerges as an important issue for printed electronics. Inkjet-etched via holes are one potential solution to providing such electrical interconnections, and which can provide good integration with other inkjet-printed features simply by switching nozzles. This thesis aims to elicit {{a better understanding of the}} physics involved in inkjet etching and investigate the capability of the inkjet etching technique. In the thesis, the factors that can affect the size of via holes produced by inkjet etching are evaluated, which is significant for evaluating the capability of this technique to deliver industrially relevant features. Identified factors include droplet ejection frequency, droplet diameter, solvent properties and substrate temperature. Droplet ejection frequency, i. e. the reciprocal of the time interval between drops, determines the extent of evaporation of the solvent between two consecutive drop impacts. Droplet diameter determines the radius of the wetted area after the droplet I impacts on the surface and spreads into a sessile drop. Solvents with different evaporation properties result in different size evolution with the number of drops dispensed, as does droplet ejection frequency. Higher substrate temperatures can reduce the drop diameter during flight and decrease the evaporation time on polymer surfaces, which can shrink the size of via holes. Another important issue is achieving complete polymer penetration as residual polymer creates an electrical conduction barrier after such holes are subsequently filled with conductive materials or act as a barrier to filling by electroplating. Experiments have been carried out to test the effect of outer diameter and polymer thickness on polymer penetration. Electroplating is utilised to test the completeness of via hole penetration. A mechanism using the Marangoni effect to explain the protrusion drying pattern other than a hole in the polymer layer is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Ever growing {{demands for}} {{portability}} and functionality have always governed the electronic technology innovations. IC downscaling with <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> <b>law</b> at IC level and system miniaturization with System-On-Package (SOP) paradigm at system level, have resulted {{and will continue}} to result in ultraminiaturized systems with unprecedented functionality at reduced cost. However, system miniaturization poses several electrical and thermal challenges that demand innovative solutions including advanced materials, bonding and assembly techniques. Heterogeneous material and device integration for thermal structures and IC assembly are limited by the bonding technology and the electrical and thermal impedance of the bonding interfaces. Solder - based bonding technology that is prevalent today is a major limitation to future systems. The trend towards miniaturized systems is expected to drive downscaling of IC I/O pad pitches from 40 µm to 1 - 5 µm in future. Solder technology imposes several pitch, processability and cost restrictions at such fine pitches. Furthermore, according to International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS- 2006), the supply current in high performance microprocessors is expected to increase to 220 A by 2012. At such supply current, the current density will exceed the maximum allowable current density of solders. The intrinsic delay and electromigration in solders are other daunting issues that become critical at nanometer sized technology nodes. In addition, formation of intermetallics is also a bottleneck that poses significant mechanical issues. Similarly, thermal power dissipation is growing to unprecedented high with a projected power of 198 W by 2008 (ITRS 2006). Present thermal interfaces are not adequate for such high heat dissipation. Recently, copper based thin film bonding has become a promising approach to address the abovementioned challenges. However, copper-copper direct bonding without using solders has not been studied thoroughly. Typically, bonding is carried out at 400 oC for 30 min followed by annealing for 30 min. High thermal budget in such process makes it less attractive for integrated systems because of the associated process incompatibilities. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop a novel low temperature copper to copper bonding process. In the present study, nanomaterials - based copper-to-copper bonding is explored and developed as an alternative to solder-based bonding. To demonstrate fine pitch bonding, the patterning of these nanoparticles is crucial. Therefore, two novel self-patterning techniques based on: 1.) Selective wetting and 2.) Selective nanoparticle deposition, are developed to address this challenge. Nanoparticle active layer facilitates diffusion and, thus, a reliable bond can be achieved using less thermal budget. Quantitative characterization of the bonding revealed good metallurgical bonding with very high bond strength. This has been confirmed by several morphological and structural characterizations. A 30 -micron pitch IC assembly test vehicle is used to demonstrate fine pitch patternability and bonding. In conclusion, novel nanoparticle synthesis and patterning techniques were developed and demonstrated for low-impedance and low-cost electrical and thermal interfaces. M. S. Committee Chair: Rao R.

40|$|The Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) {{system has}} been {{designed}} to complement the tools created to sense the presence of water in nonconductive spacecraft materials, by helping to not only find the approximate location of moisture but also its quantity and depth. The ECVT {{system has been}} created for use with a new image reconstruction algorithm capable of imaging high-contrast dielectric distributions. Rather than relying solely on mutual capacitance readings as is done in traditional electrical capacitance tomography applications, this method reconstructs high-resolution images using only the self-capacitance measurements. The image reconstruction method assumes that the material under inspection consists of a binary dielectric distribution, with either a high relative dielectric value representing the water or a low dielectric value for the background material. By constraining the unknown dielectric material to one of two values, the inverse math problem that must be solved to generate the image is no longer ill-determined. The image resolution becomes limited only by the accuracy and resolution of the measurement circuitry. Images were reconstructed using this method with both synthetic and real data acquired using an aluminum structure inserted at different positions within the sensing region. The cuboid geometry of the system has two parallel planes of 16 conductors arranged in a 4 4 pattern. The electrode geometry consists of parallel planes of copper conductors, connected through custom-built switch electronics, to a commercially available capacitance to digital converter. The figure shows two 4 4 arrays of electrodes milled from square sections of copper-clad circuit-board material and mounted on two pieces of glass-filled plastic backing, which were cut to approximately square shapes, 10 cm on a side. Each electrode is placed on 2. 0 -cm centers. The parallel arrays were mounted with the electrode arrays approximately 3 cm apart. The open ends were surrounded by a metal guard to reduce the sensitivity of the electrodes to outside interference and to help maintain the spacing between the arrays. Other uses for this innovation potentially include quantifying the amount of commodity remaining in the fuel and oxidizer tanks while on-orbit without having to fire spacecraft engines. Another orbit application is moisture sensing in plant-growth experiments because microgravity causes moisture in soil to distribute itself in unusual ways. At the moment, the hardware and image reconstruction technique may only be of interest to people involved in nondestructive evaluation. The reconstructed image takes almost a full week to reproduce with existing computer power.

40|$|Transition {{metal oxides}} and {{chalcogenides}} are an ideal platform for demonstrating and investigating many interesting electronic phases of matter. These phases {{emerge as a}} result of collective many body interactions among the electrons. The omnipresent electron, depending on its interaction with other electrons and with the underlying lattice, can generate diverse phases of matter with exotic physical properties. The ultimate objective of Materials Science is to provide a complete microscopic understanding of these myriad electronic phases of matter. A proper understanding of the collective quant-tum behaviour of electrons in different system can also help in designing and tuning new electronic phases of matter that may have strong impact in the field of microelectronics, well beyond that predicted by <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> Strong electron correlation effects produce a wide spectrum of ground state prop-retires like superconductivity, Metal Insulator Transition (MIT), charge-orbital ordering and many more. Similarly, different spin interactions among electrons, essentially due to various kinds of exchange coupling, give rise to varying magnetic ground state prop-retires like ferromagnetism, anti-ferromagnetism, spin glass, among others. The main objective of this thesis is to understand and rationalize diverse electronic and magnetic phases of matter in some selected strongly correlated systems. In chapter 1 we have provided an overview of various electronic and magnetic phases of matter which are relevant and necessary for understanding the chapters that follow. The first part of this chapter describes the fundamental concepts of the so called Metal Insulator Transition (MIT). A small section is dedicated to the subtle interactions among electrons and lattice that actually drive a system from a highly conducting metallic state to a strongly resistive insulating state. The second part of this chapter offers a compilation of different magnetic ground states which are discussed in detail in the last two chapters. In Chapter 2, we have explained various methodologies and experimental tech-antiques that have been used in the work reported in this thesis. In Chapter 3, we have provided a detailed understanding of the MIT in different polymorphic forms of Vanadium dioxide (VO 2). Although VO 2 exhibits a number of polymorphic forms, only the rutile/monoclinic VO 2 phase has been studied extensively compared to other polymorphic forms. This phase shows a well-established MIT across ∼ 340 K, which has been extensively investigated {{in order to understand the}} relative importance of many body electron correlation effects arising primarily from on-site Coulomb interactions within the Vanadium 3 d manifold, and single electron effects flounced by the dimerization of Vanadium atoms. Unlike the rutile phase of VO 2, little is known about the MIT appearing across 212 K in the metastable B-phase of VO 2. This phase shows dimerization of only half of the Vanadium atoms in the insulating state, in contrast to rutile/monoclinic VO 2, which show complete dimerization. There is a long standing debate about the origin of the MIT in the rutile/monoclinic phase, that contrasts the role of the many-body Hubbard U term, with single particle effects of the dimerization. In light of this debate, the MIT in the B-phase offers a unique opportunity to understand and address the competition between many body and single particle effects, that has been unresolved over several decades. In this chapter we have investigated different polymorphs of VO 2 to understand the underlying electronic structure and the nature of the MIT in these polymorphic forms. The MIT in VO 2 B phase is very broad in nature. X-ray photoemission and optical conductivity data indicate that in case of VO 2 B phase both correlation effects and dimerization is necessary to drive the MIT. We have also established that the correlation effects are more prominent for VO 2 B phase compared to rutile/monoclinic phase. In Chapter 4, we have discussed the electronic structure of LaTiO 3 (LTO) -SrTiO 3 (STO) system. At the interface between polar LTO and non-polar (STO) oxides, an unique two dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) like state appears, that exhibits a phenomenal range of unexpected transport, magnetic, and electronic properties. Thus, this interface stands as a prospective candidate for not only fundamental scientific investigation, but also application in technological and ultimately commercial frontiers. In this chapter, using variable energy Hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), we have experimentally investigated the layer resolved evolution of electronic structure across the interface in LTO-STO system. HAXPES results suggest that the interface is more coherent in nature and the coherent to incoherent feature ratio changes significantly as we probe deeper into the layer In chapter 5, we have investigated the electronic structure of the chemically exfoliated trigonal phase of MoS 2. This elusive trigonal phase exists only as small patches on chemically exfoliated MoS 2, and is believed to control functioning of MoS 2 based devices. Its electronic structure is little understood, with total absence of any spec-troscopic data, and contradictory claims from theoretical investigations. We have ad-dressed this issue experimentally by studying the electronic structure of few layered chemically exfoliated MoS 2 systems using spatially resolved X-ray photoemission spec-otoscopy and micro Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with electronic structure calculations. We have established that the ground state of this unique trigonal phase is actually a small gap (∼ 90 meV) semiconductor. This is in contrast with most of the claims in existing literature. In chapter 6, we have re-examined and revaluated the electronic structure of the late 3 d transition metal monoxides (NiO, FeO, and CoO) using a combination of HAX-PES and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. We have observed a strong evolution in the valence band spectra as a function of excitation energy. Theoretical results show that a combined GW+LDA+DMFT scheme is essential for explaining the observed experimental findings. Additionally, variable temperature HAXPES measurement In chapter 8, we have differentiated the surface and the bulk electronic structure in Sr 2 FeMoO 6 and also have provided a new route to increase the Curie temperature of this material. Sr 2 FeMoO 6 is well known for its high Curie temperature (Tc ∼ 410 K), half-metallic ferromagnetism, and a spectacularly large tunnelling magnetoresistance. The surface electronic structure of Sr 2 FeMoO 6 is believed to be different from the bulk; leading to a Spin-Valve type Magnetoresistance. We have carried out variable energy HAXPES on Sr 2 FeMoO 6 to probe electronic structure as a function of surface depth. Our experimental results indicate that surface is more Mo 6 + rich. We have also demonstrated what we believe is the first direct experimental evidence of hard ferro-magnetism in the surface layer using X Ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) with dual detection mode. In the second part of this chapter we have designed a new route to increase the Curie temperature and have been successfully able to achieve a Curie temperature as high as 515 K...|$|E

40|$|Hack 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> is reviewed, {{emphasizing}} {{its implications}} for the elongation of river basins {{as well as its}} connections with their fractal characteristics. The relation between Hack 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> and the internal structure of river basins is investigated experimentally through digital elevation models. It is found that Hack 2 ̆ 7 s exponent, elongation, and some relevant fractal characters are closely related. The self-affine character of basin boundaries is shown to be connected to the power law decay of the probability of total contributing areas at any link and to Hack 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> An explanation for Hack 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> is derived from scaling arguments. From the results we suggest that a statistical framework referring to the scaling invariance of the entire basin structure should be used in the interpretation of Hack 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{takes an}} {{empirical}} {{approach to the}} issue of how the U. S. legal services market is responding to globalization. It begins by considering {{the ways in which the}} domestic legal services market has internationalized by focusing on changes in legal education and examines the disconnection between U. S. legal education and practice opportunities in the U. S. The article proceeds to consider the ways in which U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms have become global organizations by offshoring their international identities, through the staffing of their non-U. S. offices with non-U. S. lawyers. Based on a database of more than 5, 000 lawyers working in the offshore offices of 60 U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>law</b> firms, this article reveals this globalization strategy. Internationalization has been accomplished at local levels by most U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms. One consequence of this method of internationalization through offshoring is that the need for dual trained lawyers is minimal. While U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> schools attract increasing numbers of foreign lawyer students, U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms remain disinterested in hiring and training them. U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms have succeeded in going global by going local. As a result, the traditional power dynamics of most U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms, favoring domestic lawyers to the exclusion of those with foreign expertise and experience, has been preserved...|$|R
