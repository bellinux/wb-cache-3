500|$|The {{minimum flow}} through the {{pipeline}} is not as clearly defined as its <b>maximum.</b> <b>Operating</b> at lower <b>flows</b> will {{extend the life of}} the pipeline as well as increasing profit for its owners. The 2012 flow of 600,000 bbd is significantly less than what the pipeline was designed for. Low flowrates require that the oil move slower through the line, meaning that its temperature drops more than in high-flow situations. A freeze in the line would block a pig in the line, which would force a shutdown and repairs. A 2011 engineering report by Alyeska stated that, to avoid freezing, heaters would need to be installed at several pump stations. This report noted that these improvements could bring flow as low as 350,000 bbd, but it did not attempt to determine the absolute minimum. Other studies have suggested that the minimum is 70,000 100,000 bbd with the current pipeline. Alyeska could also replace the 48" [...] pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Fairbanks with a 20" [...] pipeline and use rail the rest of the way, which would allow as little as 45,000 bbd.|$|R

40|$|A silicon {{temperature}} sensor with a conventional resistor structure is fabricated on thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. The sensor has very promising characteristics. The <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> temperature can reach 550 °C {{even at a}} low current of 0. 1 mA. Experimental results support that the minority-carrier exclusion effect can be strong in the conventional resistor structure when the silicon film is sufficiently thin, thus significantly raising the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> temperature. Moreover, since {{the structure of the}} device on thin-film SOI wafer is not crucial in controlling the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> temperature, device layout can be varied according to the requirements of applications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

For all firms the results suggest the cost of debt has a significant negative association with both components of <b>operating</b> cash <b>flow,</b> however, the managed component is less negative. Also, when firms are likely to engage in cash flow management and bondholders have increased incentives to scrutinize firm information, the bond market positively prices managed <b>operating</b> cash <b>flow</b> information. Specifically, my findings report a positive association between managed <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> and the cost of debt when firms use cash flow management to meet the zero <b>operating</b> cash <b>flow</b> benchmark.

40|$|Cash flow {{prediction}} {{is an essential}} component of economic decision making, particularly in investment and credit evaluation. This paper examines the comparative predictive ability of earnings and <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> variables on future <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> within a developing economy’s setting. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method is used to develop regression models over the period of 2002 to 2012. Current <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows,</b> as proxy for future <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows,</b> are regressed on past one, two and three years of earnings and <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> as predictors. Results from the regression analysis reveals earnings and <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> are significant in predicting future <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> but have different predictive powers with earnings providing a superior comparative predictive ability on future cash flows. The paper therefore concludes that earnings are a better predictor of future <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> than historical <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> itself...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the comparative abilities of accrual-based and cash-based accounting information for future <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> prediction. It aimed to explain the extent earnings, accruals, EBITDA and <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> are able to predict listed Malaysian industrial products manufacturing corporations’ <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows.</b> Ordinary least squares method was used to develop fifteen multiple linear regression models in examining {{up to three years}} of prediction horizon. Current <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows,</b> as proxy for future <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows,</b> are regressed on past one, two and three years of earnings, <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows,</b> <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> combined with aggregated/disaggregated accruals and EBITDA as predictors. The sample was collected from annual financial statements of 97 listed corporations from 1999 to 2009 (11 years) and categorised into two subsamples; the within sample (1999 to 2008) to develop the models and the holdout sample (2009) to validate the robustness of the models. Results from the regression analyses revealed that all the accounting measures examined have significant predictive abilities but differing powers. Earnings are superior to <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> but EBITDA are stronger than both earnings and <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> while the <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> have the weakest predictive powers. The model comprising of both <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> and disaggregated accrual components have the strongest predictive abilities. This suggests that disaggregating earnings into <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> and accruals and further decomposing the aggregated accruals into the individual accrual components enhance the predictive abilities. These findings revealed that accruals have incremental explanatory powers beyond that contained in <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> and disaggregated accrual components provided incremental explanatory powers exceeding that provided by aggregated accruals. Aggregated earnings masked the contributions of each accrual component. Disaggregating earnings and further decomposing the aggregated accruals unmask the contributions and effects of each accrual component. As individual predictors, both earnings and accruals have the significant abilities to predict future <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> for only one year-ahead (short term), EBITDA can predict up to two years-ahead (medium term) and <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> can predict up to three years-ahead (long term) ...|$|R
