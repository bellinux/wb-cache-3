50|$|Recently the {{compound}} has found {{use as a}} <b>mineral</b> <b>stain</b> for wood and other substances. The mechanism of this action involves {{the application of a}} metal salt (such as iron(II) chloride) and the zinc peroxide to the substrate material (wood or wood-like material, i.e. bamboo, paper, cloths, and cellulose products). The metal salt is applied in solution and allowed to dry for up to 30 minutes. Next, zinc peroxide is applied, also in solution. Color change is immediately visible. The two solutions soak into the material, and react, thereby becoming ingrained in the matrix of the substrate. While these stains can produce a variety of colors ranging from a reddish brown to a yellow hue, they are generally used to mimic the look of endangered wood species in cheaper and more commonly available stock.|$|E

40|$|Thackeray 1 {{questions}} {{the hypothesis of}} deliberate body disposal in the Rising Star Cave by Homo naledi, as proposed by Dirks and colleagues 2. Thackeray proposes that lichens produced <b>mineral</b> <b>staining</b> on the skeletal remains of H. naledi. As lichens require some exposure to light, in Thackeray’s opinion, the presence of <b>mineral</b> <b>staining</b> necessitates either a direct entrance deep into the Rising Star Cave that once admitted light into the Dinaledi Chamber, or relocation of mineral-stained bones from a location exposed to light. Here we consider multiple lines of evidence that reject Thackeray’s hypothesis that lichens deposited <b>mineral</b> <b>staining</b> upon the surface of these skeletal remains. We welcome the opportunity to address the inferences presented by Thackeray, and further hope that this response may dispel misinterpretations of our research 2, and of {{other areas of the}} scientific literature that bear upon site formation processes at work within the Rising Star Cave system...|$|R

40|$|Growth and {{differentiation}} of osteoblasts are often studied in cell cultures. In vivo, however, osteoblasts are {{embedded within a}} complex three-dimensional (3 D) microenvironment, which bears little relation to standard culture flasks. Our study characterizes osteoblast-like cells cultured in 3 D collagen gels and compares them with cells in two-dimensional (2 D) cultures. Primary rat osteoblasts and MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were seeded within type I collagen gels, and differentiation was determined by <b>mineral</b> <b>staining</b> and gene expression analysis. Cells growing in 3 D gels showed positive <b>mineral</b> <b>staining</b> and induction of osteoblast marker genes earlier than cells growing in 2 D. A number of genes, including osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, alkaline phosphatase and dentin matrix protein 1, were already highly upregulated in 3 D cultures 24 [*]h after seeding. The early expression of osteoblast genes was dependent on the 3 D structure and was not induced in cells growing on collagen-coated dishes in 2 D. Comparison of thymidine incorporation between cells in 3 D and 2 D cultures treated with agents that induce proliferation-transforming growth factor β, platelet-derived growth factor and lactoferrin-showed a much greater response in 3 D gels. Cells in 3 D cultures were also much more sensitive to inhibition of proliferation by the protein kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. The 3 D collagen gels better represent the physiological bone environment and offer a number of technical advantages {{for the study of}} osteoblasts in vitro. These studies have additional practical implications as 3 D collagen gels are considered as a scaffold material in regenerative medicine for the repair of bone defects...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the effectiveness of bone mineral density measurement as a supplementary tool for evaluation of osteogenic potential in patients with spinal fusion. To this end, we correlated bone mineral density (BMD) with osteogenic potential from cultured mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Overview of Literature: Many studies have correlated osteogenic potential of in vitro cultured MSCs with aging or osteoporosis. Methods: We studied twenty-five individuals with harvested bone marrow from the ilium during lumbar spinal surgery. The BMD of the femoral neck was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry prior to bone marrow aspiration, and the osteoporotic group was classified as those with T-scores below- 2. 5. After MSCs were isolated from bone marrow, in vitro induction of osteogenesis was performed. We analyzed the patient’s osteogenic potential from cultured MSCs such as <b>mineral</b> deposition <b>stain,</b> bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteoblast-specific gene expression in RT-PCR. Results: On <b>mineral</b> <b>staining,</b> the osteoporotic group had a scanty matrix mineral deposition in contrast to the non-osteoporotic group. The expression of osteocalcin in the osteoporotic group was 1. 5 to 3 times less than in the non-osteoporotic group. At the 3 rd week after the induction of osteogenesis, the activity of ALP of cultured MSCs in the osteoporotic group was lower than in the control group (mean, 45 ± 19 u/L, in osteoporotic group vs 136 ± 7 u/L in non-osteoporotic), and there was a statistically significant and positive correlation between BMD & ALP (r= 0. 487, p= 0. 013). Conclusions: There is a positive correlation between BMD and osteogenic potential derived from MSCs. The measurement of BMD can provide supplementary data for evaluating osteogenic potential clinically. Key Words: Bone mineral density, Osteogenic potential, Mesenchymal stem cell...|$|R
40|$|Coronary {{atherosclerosis}} {{is frequently}} associated with calcification of arterial plaque. To understand the mechanisms {{responsible for the}} formation of atherosclerotic calcification, we examined human coronary arteries for the presence and extent of <b>mineral.</b> In sections <b>stained</b> specifically for <b>mineral,</b> <b>staining</b> was diffuse and present in all atherosclerotic plaques. Hydroxyapatite was not detected in normal coronary artery sections. Distribution of hydroxyapatite coincided with a similar distribution of calcium detected by a radiodense pattern using contact microradiography of the same sections before cytochemical staining. By energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis, the chemical composition of calcified sites was identical to hydroxyapatite (Ca 10 [PO 4] 6 [OH] 2), the major inorganic component of bone. Osteopontin is a phosphorylated glycoprotein with known involvement in the formation and calcification of bone and is regulated by local cytokines. Human coronary artery segments (14 normal and 34 atherosclerotic) obtained at autopsy were evaluated immunohistochemically using polyclonal antibodies generated against human osteopontin. Immunohistochemistry for osteopontin indicated intense, highly specific staining in the outer margins of all diseased segments at each calcification front; staining was evident throughout the entire plaque. Conversely, arterial segments free of atheroma and calcification and sections treated with nonimmune serum had no evidence of positive staining. Osteopontin, a protein involved in mineralization is specifically associated with calcific coronary atheroma and may {{play an important role in}} the onset and progression of this disease in human coronary arteries. The deposition of noncollagenous proteins such as osteopontin may regulate the presence or absence of calcification and ultimately alter vessel compliance...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand blackfoot abalone, Haliotis iris Gmelin, {{is among}} the few {{gastropods}} that precipitate both calcite and aragonite in their shells. The location, composition, and thickness of these mineral layers may affect color, luster, and strength of the shell, which is locally important in jewelry manufacture. Skeletal mineralogy and shell structure of H. iris from three southern New Zealand locations were determined using X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron micrography, and <b>mineral</b> <b>staining.</b> In H. iris an outer calcitic layer is separated from an inner aragonitic surface by both calcified and noncalcified organic layers running longitudinally through the shell. Skeletal mineralogy within individual shells varies from 29 to 98 % aragonite, with older shell having significantly higher aragonite content than young sections. Variation within populations ranges from 40 to 98 % aragonite, and among three populations from 34 to 98 % aragonite. Shell thickness, too, varies within individual shells from 0. 2 to 4. 2 mm, with a significant positive relationship with age. Within population variation in shell thickness ranges from 2. 1 to 5. 4 mm, with {{no significant difference in}} shell thickness variation among populations. The high degree of variability within and among individual shells suggests that it is essential to test replicate samples from individual mollusk shells, especially when they have complex bimineral structure...|$|R
40|$|Collagen {{glycosaminoglycan}} (CG) scaffolds {{have been}} clinically approved as {{an application for}} skin regeneration. The goal of this study has been to examine whether a CG scaffold is a suitable biomaterial for generating human bone tissue. Specifically, we have asked the following questions: (1) can the scaffold support human osteoblast growth and differentiation and (2) how might recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta(1)) enhance long-term in vitro bone formation? We show human osteoblast attachment, infiltration and uniform distribution throughout the construct, reaching the centre within 14 days of seeding. We have identified the fully differentiated osteoblast phenotype categorised by the temporal expression of alkaline phosphatase, collagen type 1, osteonectin, bone sialo protein, biglycan and osteocalcin. Mineralised bone formation has been identified at 35 days post-seeding by using von Kossa and Alizarin S Red staining. Both gene expression and <b>mineral</b> <b>staining</b> suggest the benefit of introducing an initial high treatment of TGF-beta(1) (10 ng/ml) followed by a low continuous treatment (0. 2 ng/ml) to enhance human osteogenesis on the scaffold. Osteogenesis coincides with a reduction in scaffold size and shape (up to 70 % that of original). A notable finding is core degradation at {{the centre of the}} tissue-engineered construct after 49 days of culture. This is not observed at earlier time points. Therefore, a maximum of 35 days in culture is appropriate for in vitro studies of these scaffolds. We conclude that the CG scaffold shows excellent potential as a biomaterial for human bone tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore how cell-matrix {{interactions}} and extrinsic mechanical signals interact to determine stem cell fate in response to transforming growth factor-? 3 (TGF-? 3). Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were seeded in agarose and fibrin hydrogels and subjected to dynamic compression in the presence of different concentrations of TGF-? 3. Markers of chondrogenic, myogenic and endochondral differentiation were assessed. MSCs embedded within agarose hydrogels adopted a spherical cell morphology, while cells directly adhered to the fibrin matrix and took on a spread morphology. Free-swelling agarose constructs stained positively for chondrogenic markers, with MSCs appearing to progress towards terminal differentiation as indicated by <b>mineral</b> <b>staining.</b> MSC seeded fibrin constructs progressed along an alternative myogenic pathway in long-term free-swelling culture. Dynamic compression suppressed differentiation toward any investigated lineage in both fibrin and agarose hydrogels in the short-term. Given that fibrin clots have been shown to support a chondrogenic phenotype in vivo within mechanically loaded joint defect environments, we next explored the influence of long term (42 days) dynamic compression on MSC differentiation. Mechanical signals generated by this extrinsic loading ultimately governed MSC fate, directing MSCs along a chondrogenic pathway as opposed to the default myogenic phenotype supported within unloaded fibrin clots. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that external cues such as the mechanical environment can override the influence specific substrates, scaffolds or hydrogels have on determining mesenchymal stem cell fate. The temporal data presented in this study highlights the importance of considering how MSCs respond to extrinsic mechanical signals in the long term...|$|R
40|$|M. J. Walker [et al. ]Cueva Negra del Estrecho del Río Quípar {{overlooking}} the Río Quípar, a Río Segura tributary, is an upland rock-shelter 75 km {{north of the}} Mediterranean coast and 110 km west of the Segura river-mouth. It contains undisturbed sediment 5 m deep assigned by magnetostratigraphy to > 0. 78 Ma (Matuyama magnetochron). Optically stimulated sediment luminescence dating implies ≥ 0. 5 Ma and mammalian biochronology (notably, of Arvicolid rodents) indicates > 0. 7 -< 1 Ma. Remains include an “Acheulian” limestone “hand-axe,” and small chert, limestone or quartzite artifacts, knapped on site, often by bipolar reduction or repetitive centripetal flaking of small discoidal cores. Secondarily-flaked (“retouched”) artifacts include small irregular chert fragments, resembling chert at an adjacent conglomerate outcrop according to laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry of 19 lanthanide elements, though some chert may have been obtained from up to 30 km away. Faunal remains and pollen are compatible with mild (plausibly MIS- 21), damp, fluvio-lacustrine environments. Evidence of fire in a deep, sealed layer includes thermally-altered, lustreless and shattered chert, and both charred and white calcined fragments of bone. Taphonomical analysis and electron microscopy of bone fragments attribute discolouration to burning, not to post-depositional <b>mineral</b> <b>staining.</b> Sediment geochemistry and thin-section micromorphology have been undertaken. FTIRS, TL and ESR analysis of chert and bone imply firing temperatures of about 500 ºC at least.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{caffeine}} exposure on bone formation were examined using a chick osteoblast culture system. Secondary cultures of normal diploid osteoblasts {{were exposed to}} chronic doses of 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, or 0. 4 mM caffeine beginning on day 0 through day 28. Neither the rate of cell proliferation nor cell number, as measured by total DNA, was decreased {{for any of the}} doses examined. In contrast, osteocalcin levels, alkaline phosphatase activity, and total calcium levels showed a dose-related decrease in cultures treated with caffeine. These parameters were significantly decreased at the highest dose of 0. 4 mM. The reduction in total protein levels ranged from 29 to 66 % of control values and was independent of dose. In contrast, total collagen levels were more affected by the dose of caffeine used. Inhibition of collagen levels was most apparent on days 17 and 21, time points during the period of active formation of the matrix immediately preceding the deposition of mineral. By day 28 collagen levels in cultures exposed to the lower doses of caffeine had returned to control levels, and only the cultures exposed to the highest dose (0. 4 mM) remained significantly inhibited with respect to both collagen and mineral. Histochemically, alkaline phosphatase and <b>mineral</b> <b>staining</b> of day 28 cultures mirrored the biochemical events with the 0. 4 mM caffeine exposure. The results indicate that one of the effects of caffeine on bone development is to inhibit the formation of a competent extracellular matrix during the osteoblast differentiation sequence, which results in the inhibition of mineralization analogous to the delayed ossification observed in fetal animals after prenatal caffeine exposure...|$|R
40|$|Multipotent stromal cells/mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) can {{differentiate}} into multiple lineages including osteogenic and adipogenic cells. Wnt signalling has {{been implicated in}} controlling MSC fate, but the mechanism is unclear and apparently conflicting data exists. Here I show that a glycogen synthase kinase 3 β inhibitor, AR 28, is a potent activator of canonical Wnt signalling using β-catenin translocation studies and TCF-reporter assays. AR 28 induced axis duplication and secondary regions of chordin expression in Xenopus laevis embryos, when injected into the ventral marginal zone, indicative of canonical Wnt signalling. When human MSCs were grown under adipogenic conditions, AR 28 caused a significant dose-dependent reduction in FABP 5 /BODIPY double-positive cells with a corresponding rescue of proliferation. In assays {{to determine the effects}} of AR 28 on MSC osteogenesis using standard differentiation inducers (β-glycerophosphate, L-ascorbic acid and dexamethasone), AR 28 caused a significant decrease in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity compared to vehicle controls, indicative of a reduced osteogenic response. However, when using mild osteogenic stimulation, excluding dexamethasone, increases in both ALP and Alizarin Red <b>mineral</b> <b>staining</b> were identified following AR 28 treatment, with corresponding increases in proliferation and cell number. This AR 28 -induced osteogenic response was blocked by mitomycin C, identifying cell proliferation as an important step in Wnt-induced osteogenesis under these conditions. Pre-treatment of MSCs with AR 28 for 7 days before osteogenic induction also increased ALP activity and mineralisation. BMP 2 treatment of MSCs was capable of inducing both osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, to which AR 28 caused a switch towards the osteogenic lineage, with synergistic increases in ALP. AR 28 simultaneously caused a decrease in the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs treated with BMP 2 through the down regulation of Sox 9 transcription. Together these results highlight the potential of GSK 3 β inhibitors as therapeutic modulators of canonical Wnt signalling, and there use to treat a multitude of bone related disorders...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} endogenous glucocorticoid signaling in bone, we previously developed Col 2. 3 -HSD 2 and Col 3. 6 -HSD 2 transgenic mice in which a 2. 3 -kb or 3. 6 -kb Colla 1 promoter fragment drives expression of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD 2) in mature and early osteoblasts, respectively. In the first study, we first characterized the bone phenotype of Col 3. 6 -HSD 2 mice. Col 3. 6 -HSD 2 mice had decreased trabecular bone in vertebra and decreased cortical bone in femur and tibia. Transgenic calvarial osteoblast and bone marrow stromal cultures had decreased alkaline phosphatase and <b>mineral</b> <b>staining,</b> and reduced Colla 1, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin mRNA expression. Cell growth and proliferation were decreased in transgenic cultures. Transgenic bone marrow cells showed more osteoclast formation in vitro. However, osteoclast resorptive activity was decreased in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis showed that multiple signaling pathways were affected in transgenic osteoblasts including cell cycle and integrin. These data suggest that endogenous glucocorticoid signaling is required for optimal bone mass acquisition by affecting both the osteoblast and osteoclast lineages. ^ Second, we studied whether murine osteoclast lineage cells express 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD 1). Osteoclast precursors from bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), RAW 264. 7 cells, and sorted precursors based on surface markers (CD 11 b- CD 45 R- CD 3 -CD 115 +) were treated with M-CSF and RANKL to induce osteoclast formation. HSD 1 was expressed in progenitor cells and significantly reduced in osteoclasts, while HSD 2 expression was not changed. When the progenitor cells were treated with M-CSF or up to 4 days, M-CSF caused a time- and dose-dependent reduction of HSD 1 mRNA, with the greatest reduction after only one day treatment. To study the function of HSD 1 in osteoclast formation, BMMs were treated with M-CSF and RANKL {{in the presence of}} 11 -DHC and its active metabolite corticosterone for up to 5 days. Both steroids caused a dose- and time-dependent suppression of osteoclast formation. The major inhibition of osteoclastogenesis occurred at the early stage of osteoclast formation, and the inhibition was blunted by pre-treatment with the HSD inhibitor carbenoxolone (CBX). These data show that osteoclast precursors express HSD 1 as a means of generating locally active glucocorticoids and this system declines during osteoclast formation in vitro. ...|$|R
40|$|Carbonate <b>minerals</b> are <b>stained</b> over a set {{period of}} time with {{alizarin}} red-S and potassium ferricyanide only if they will react with dilute hydrochloric acid solution, with which the stain is prepared. The rates of solution of carbonates in the acid control the intensity of color development. For calcite, the rate of solution varies with the optic orientation of the section. The speed of carbonate solution is changed if the acid concentration is altered, but only at concentrations of about 0. 1 N is the optic orientation of calcite differentiated by the stain. Etching reduces thin section thickness and clarifies rock texture. Staining with alizarin red-S differentiates carbonate minerals into two groups. Aragouite, calcite, witherlte t and cerussite, which dissolve rapidly in dilute hydrochloric acid, are stained, while dolomite, siderite, magnesite, and rhodochosite, which react much more slowly with the acid, remain unstained. The distribution of ferrous iron, as distinguished by staining with potassium ferricyanide, {{has proved to be}} highly significant in the genesis of cements. Ferrous iron can be introduced at any one stage in cementation, or repeatedly, forming zoned patterns. The paragenesis of zoned ferroan cements can be reconstructed after stain-ing. Solution of the more soluble original constituents can sometimes be dated in relation to cementation. Ferroan calcite can be secondary inorigin and is usually associated with replacement minerals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmong {{persisting}} {{questions on}} bone calcification, a major {{one is the}} link between protein expression and mineral deposition. A cell culture system is here proposed opening new integrative studies on biomineralization, improving our knowledge on {{the role played by}} non-collagenous proteins in bone. This experimental in vitro model consisted in human primary osteoblasts cultured for 60 days at the surface of a 3 D collagen scaffold mimicking an osteoid matrix. Various techniques were used to analyze the results at the cellular and molecular level (adhesion and viability tests, histology and electron microscopy, RT-and qPCR) and to characterize the <b>mineral</b> phase (histological <b>staining,</b> EDX, ATG, SAED and RMN). On long term cultures human bone cells seeded on the osteoid-like matrix displayed a clear osteoblast phenotype as revealed by the osteoblast-like morphology, expression of specific protein such as alkaline phosphatase and expression of eight genes classically considered as osteoblast markers, including BGLAP, COL 1 A 1, and BMP 2. Von Kossa and alizarine red allowed us to identify divalent calcium ions at the surface of the matrix, EDX revealed the correct Ca/P ratio, and SAED showed the apatite crystal diffraction pattern. In addition RMN led to the conclusion that contaminant phases were absent and that the hydration state of the mineral was similar to fresh bone. A temporal correlation was established between quantified gene expression of DMP 1 and IBSP, and the presence of hydroxyapatite, confirming the contribution of these proteins to the mineralization process. In parallel a difference was observed in the expression pattern of SPP 1 and BGLAP, which questioned their attributed role in the literature. The present model opens new experimental possibilities to study spatio-temporal relations between bone cells, dense collagen scaffolds, NCPs and hydroxyapatite mineral deposition. It also emphasizes the importance of high collagen density environment in bone cell physiology...|$|R
40|$|Taphonomic {{research}} of bones can provide additional insight into a site's formation and development, the burial environment and ongoing post-mortem processes. A total of 30 tortoise (Cylindraspis) femur bone {{samples from the}} Mare aux Songes site (Mauritius) were studied histologically, assessing parameters such as presence and type of microbial alteration, inclusions, staining/infiltrations, the degree of microcracking and birefringence. The absence of microbial attack in the 4200 year old Mare aux Songes bones suggests the animals rapidly entered the soil whole-bodied and were sealed anoxically, although they suffered from biological and chemical degradation (i. e. pyrite formation/oxidation, <b>mineral</b> dissolution and <b>staining)</b> related {{to changes in the}} site's hydrology. Additionally, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were analysed to obtain information on the animals' feeding behaviour. The results show narrowly distributed δ 13 C ratios, indicating a terrestrial C 3 plant-based diet, combined with a wide range in δ 15 N ratios. This is most likely related to the tortoises' drought-adaptive ability to change their metabolic processes, which can affect the δ 15 N ratios. Furthermore, ZooMS collagen fingerprinting analysis successfully identified two tortoise species (C. triserrata and C. inepta) in the bone assemblage, which, when combined with stable isotope data, revealed significantly different δ 15 N ratios between the two tortoise species. As climatic changes around this period resulted in increased aridity in the Mascarene Islands, this could explain the extremely elevated δ 15 N ratio in our dataset. The endemic fauna was able to endure the climatic changes 4200 years ago, although human arrival in the 17 th century changed the original habitat {{to such an extent that}} it resulted in the extinction of several species. Fortunately we are still able to study these extinct tortoises due to the beneficial conditions of their burial environment, resulting in excellent bone preservation...|$|R
40|$|Controlling lineage {{specific}} {{differentiation of}} stem cells is crucial for functional tissue engineering, and current methods have drawbacks and limitations. Histone deacetlyase (HDAC) proteins are key to cellular epigenetics, {{and a number of}} studies have shown that their inhibitors (HDACis) can control stem cell fate. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a novel HDAC 2 and HDAC 3 selective inhibitor, MI 192, on human adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), exploring the potential of utilising MI 192 in controlling the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs, with the long term goal of improving the efficacy of bone tissue engineering. MI 192 was synthesised in house and characterised with NMR analysis. The effect of MI 192 was explored on commercially (Life Technologies) available ADSCs. It was found that 1 µM to 100 µM MI 192 was cytotoxic and reduced ADSC viability, with a dose response observed. Using propidium iodide staining, it was demonstrated that MI 192 halted the cell cycle in the G 2 M phase. FACs analysis showed that MI 192 altered the stem cell marker expression profile of ADSCs; increasing expression of some markers (CD 34 and CD 146) and decreasing some (CD 29, CD 44, CD 73, CD 105, CD 166). When utilised in a pre-treatment strategy in 2 D models, MI 192 improved the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs, strongly increasing production of alkaline phosphatase protein, with 2 days of 30 µM pre-treatment being the optimal concentration and treatment length. MI 192 pre-treatment also increased ADSC mineralisation (calcium accumulation stained with Alizarin Red and <b>mineral</b> nodule formation <b>stained</b> with Von Kossa) and increased osteogenic gene expression (BMP 2, RUNX 2, COL 1 and ALP). The adipogenic differentiation of the ADSCs was inhibited by MI 192 pre-treatment, with reduced lipid droplet accumulation (stained with Oil Red O) and adipogenic gene (PPARγ and ADIPOQ) expression seen. Increased osteogenic differentiation was further demonstrated in 3 D models, using Am silk scaffolds. Cell attachment was assessed with live cell labelling, and collagen production, mineralisation and protein production analysed with histology and immunohistochemistry. Finally, TaqMan® Gene Expression Array Cards were utilised to investigate how two days of MI 192 treatment altered the expression of 96 different genes. Some key Wnt related genes, as well as other key osteogenic genes such as BMP 2 were up-regulated, providing some mechanistic explanation for the increase in osteogenic differentiation potential seen with MI 192 pre-treatment. This thesis demonstrates the potential of utilising MI 192 to improve bone tissue engineering strategies. ...|$|R
