Abrams already had a relationship after working together on the 2009 film Star Trek; Abrams stated {{in an interview that}} he called Nimoy and begged him to join Fringe, explaining the show and the character. Nimoy sounded interested but wanted to become more familiar with the show, so Abrams and the other producers sent him as much information as they could about Fringe, until Nimoy agreed. This exchange of phone calls, in which Nimoy responded with interest when pitched the idea, was also how Abrams was able to cast him in his Star Trek reboot. Nimoy later explained [...] "When they contacted me about working on Fringe -- the same people, the same attitude, the same creativity, the same creative team – it was very enticing".

[...] Billboard magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. Revolver editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon's, writing: [...] "What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson's lyrics.

However, Mark Madley of The National Post thought that this episode, along with the previous two, gave away too much plot detail, and compared the off-island storyline to [...] "that awful Stallone/Banderas movie Assassins". Don Williams of BuddyTV thought that the scene where Sayid disposes of his cellphone after calling Ben [...] "like an episode of Alias", and finished his recap by saying [...] "consider my mind blown again". MaryAnn Johanson of Film.com called the episode [...] "mind-blowing", and theorized that Sayid {{had been working for}} Ben before the crash, and that the crash of Oceanic 815 was deliberate.

Phares concluded her review with [...] "Sucker Punch is elaborate and sometimes overwrought, but it’s absolutely true to the film’s aesthetic." [...] Billboard reviewer Phil Gallo described the soundtrack as [...] "a rush of male-targeted female power" [...] which de Vries and Bates scored with [...] "dark, eerie and violent soundscapes". Gallo found Yoav's contribution to [...] "Where Is My Mind" [...] to be [...] "the soundtrack's most tender moment". Writing for Empire, Danny Graydon highlighted Browning's songs as [...] "seductive takes", and praised both Gugino and Isaac for [...] "an exuberant version of Roxy Music’s 'Love Is The Drug'" [...] and considering Björk's collaboration [...] "magnificently reversions 'Army Of Me' with Skunk Anansie".
