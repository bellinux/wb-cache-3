40|$|<b>Millimicrosecond</b> Pulse Techniques, Second Edition {{focuses on}} <b>millimicrosecond</b> pulse {{techniques}} {{and the development}} of devices of large bandwidth, extending down to comparatively low frequencies (1 Mc/s). Emphasis is on basic circuit elements and pieces of equipment of universal application. Specific applications, mostly in the field of nuclear physics instrumentation, are considered. This book consists of eight chapters and opens with an introduction to some of the terminology employed by circuit engineers as well as theoretical concepts, including the laws of circuit analysis, Fourier analys...|$|E
40|$|From {{ferromagnetic}} resonance experiments and from calculations {{based on the}} modified Landau-Lifschitz equa-tion, switching times for the coherent rotation of the magnetization in thin, permalloy-type films have been predicted to lie {{in the range of}} 1 mi 1 limicrosecond. l First measurements by D. 0. Smith et a 1, 2 utilizing a travelling-wave oscilloscope with a response time of 2 mpec, indi-cated switching times of about 3 mpec. In this com-munication, first results of advanced <b>millimicrosecond</b> measurements are reported. These were obtained by using special pulse equipment including a sampling oscillo-scope, 324 with an over-all response time of about 0. 5 mpsec. Flux changes as fast as 1. 5 mpec could be ob-served, for not only the longitudinal flux component, 5 but also, for the first time, the transverse one. Figure I Strip transmission with longitudinal (a) and transverse (b) pick-ups. Short Communicate Experimental techniques A pulsed magnetic field is generated in a 50 -f 2 shortcircuited strip transmission line by discharging a 50 - 0 coaxial cable over a coaxial mercury relay. The end of the cable is matched for the reflected wave by diodes and RC-compensating networks. Two pairs of Helmholtz coils provide the premagnetization and reset fields in the plane of the film. The longitudinal magnetic flux change of the magnetic film is picked up by a wire placed in the symmetry axis of the strip line. The end of this wire is matched by four balancing resistors (Fig. la). By this means the voltage induced by the air flux is cancelled out. The transverse flux change of the film is picked up by a wire placed normal to the axis of the strip line (Fig. 1 b) ...|$|E
