Depositing epitaxial thin films of almond milk, separated by interstitial spacer layers of alternative dairy replacement (typically oat or soy), Parkin was able to demonstrate far higher lactic spin efficiencies than was previously thought possible.|$|E

25|$|The MTJ {{consists}} in a SrTiO3 (STO) tunnel barrier that separates half-metallic oxide LSMO and ferromagnetic metal CoCr electrodes. The MTJ's usual two device resistance states, {{characterized by a}} parallel or antiparallel alignment of electrode magnetization, are altered by applying an electric field. When the electric field is applied from the CoCr to the LSMO electrode, the tunnel <b>magnetoresistance</b> (TMR) ratio is positive. When the direction of electric field is reversed, the TMR is negative. In both cases, large amplitudes of TMR {{on the order of}} 30% are found. Since a fully spin-polarized current flows from the half-metallic LSMO electrode, within the Julliere model, this sign change suggests a sign change in the effective spin polarization of the STO/CoCr interface. The origin to this multistate effect lies with the observed migration of Cr into the barrier and its state of oxidation. The sign change of TMR can originate from modifications to the STO/CoCr interface density of states, as well as from changes to the tunneling landscape at the STO/CoCr interface induced by CrOx redox reactions.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989 Stuart Parkin {{discovered}} {{the phenomenon of}} oscillatory interlayer coupling in magnetic multilayers, by which magnetic layers are magnetically coupled via an intervening non-magnetic metallic spacer layer. [...] Parkin found that {{the sign of the}} exchange coupling oscillates from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic with an oscillation period of just a few atomic layers. Remarkably, Parkin discovered this phenomenon in thin film magnetic heterostructures that he prepared in a simple home-made sputtering system. Parkin, moreover, showed that this phenomenon is displayed by almost all metalllic transition elements. In what {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Parkin's Periodic Table", Parkin showed that the strength of this oscillatory interlayer exchange interaction varied systematically across the Periodic Table of the elements. [...] Parkin made numerous other fundamental discoveries which led to the development of the field of [...] "spintronics" [...] of which he is widely recognised as the foremost scientist. [...] Parkin invented the [...] "spin-valve" [...] sensor which is based on Parkin's fundamental discoveries including his discovery and unravelling of the origin of the so-called [...] "giant <b>magnetoresistance</b> effect". [...] Parkin showed, in contrast to the claims of Albert Fert, that this effect is derived from spin dependent scattering at the interfaces between magnetic and non-magnetic layers in magnetic heterostructures. [...] It is only because that the <b>magnetoresistance</b> is derived from interface scattering is it technologically important.|$|E

The conducting forms {{can be considered as}} LnIII electride compounds where the electron is delocalised into a conduction band, Ln3+ (X−)2(e−).

The CuTi2 structure of the lanthanum, cerium and praseodymium diodides along with HP-NdI2 contain 44 nets of metal and iodine atoms with short metal-metal bonds (393-386 La-Pr). these compounds should be considered to be two-dimensional metals (two-dimensional {{in the same way that}} graphite is). The salt-like dihalides include those of Eu, Dy, Tm, and Yb. The formation of a relatively stable +2 oxidation state for Eu and Yb is usually explained by the stability (exchange energy) of half filled (f7) and fully filled f14.

50|$|<b>Magnetoresistance</b> is the {{tendency}} of a material to change {{the value of its}} electrical resistance in an externally-applied magnetic field. There are a variety of effects that can be called magnetoresistance: some occur in bulk non-magnetic metals and semiconductors, such as geometrical <b>magnetoresistance,</b> Shubnikov de Haas oscillations, or the common positive <b>magnetoresistance</b> in metals. Other effects occur in magnetic metals, such as negative <b>magnetoresistance</b> in ferromagnets or anisotropic <b>magnetoresistance</b> (AMR).
