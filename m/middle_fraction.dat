In 1943, Tomašić participated on the session of the immediate HSS leadership where they refused the suggestion of the Prime Minister of the Independent State of Croatia, Nikola Mandić, about the coalition government. While Maček was transferred to his apartment while he was under house arrest, Tomašević delivered him reports on Mladen Lorković's and Ante Vokić's initiative about the coup. He was also one of the immediate negotiators with the Yugoslav Partisans. Because of his involvement in the Lorković-Vokić coup, Tomašić was arrested on 31 August 1944 and imprisoned in Lepoglava. He was killed on 24 or 25 April 1945. During the time of communist Yugoslavia he was falsely put on the list of the Jasenovac concentration camp victims as a part of communist propaganda.|$|E

To answer these questions, we use 47 Dutch national population sample surveys with detailed occupation codes collected between 1970 and 2006 (N = 60, 978).

This study focused on hydrocracking process of atmospheric distillable residue of Mongolian crude oil in the first time compared {{to those of other}} countries. Residue samples were hydrocracked with a commercial catalyst at 450 °C, 460 °C, 470 °C for 2 h under hydrogen pressure of 10 MPa. The amount of residual fraction (350 °C<BP) decreased to 9. 4 wt% by the hydrocracking of atmospheric distillable residue from Tamsagbulag crude oil. When the ME-AR was hydrocracked, the high consumption of hydrogen was related to the lowest H/C atomic ratio of feed atmospheric residue. The amount of liquid fractions (BP< 350 °C) including gaseous products increased from 45. 4 wt% to 89. 2 wt%, when the reaction temperature increased from 450 °C to 470 °C.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study {{investigated}} relationships between rapid cerebral hemodynamic modulation and attentional performance. Based on former results on complex cognitive functioning, a specific {{association between the}} first seconds of the hemodynamic response and performance was hypothesized. METHODS: Using transcranial Doppler sonography, blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries of both hemispheres were recorded in 48 healthy subjects. The applied task comprised motor reactions on a visual stimulus which was preceded by an acoustic warning signal (interstimulus interval 5 s). Task-induced hemodynamic changes were assessed second-by-second, and related to reaction time using analysis of variance and linear regression. RESULTS: A right dominant blood flow response was observed. Flow velocity increase in the <b>middle</b> <b>fraction</b> of the interstimulus interval, i. e. seconds 2 and 3 after the cuing signal, significantly correlated with reaction time. This {{was not the case}} for the very early and late components of the response. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a time-locked association between cerebral blood flow increase and attentional performance. This is in accordance with neurophysiological studies that revealed the closest relationship between brain perfusion and cortical activity during a similar time window. SIGNIFICANCE: The study supports the assumption of a specific, relatively early time interval in which relationships between cerebral blood flow and behavior become apparent...|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{residue of}} unreactive tarry {{compounds}} mixed with ash from the coal and catalyst. To minimise {{the loss of}} carbon in the residue stream, {{it is necessary to}} have a low-ash feed. Typically the coal should be <10% ash by weight. The hydrogen required for the process can be also produced from coal or the residue by steam reforming. A typical hydrogen demand is ~80 kg [...] hydrogen per ton of dry, ash-free coal. Generally, this process is similar to hydrogenation. The output is at three levels: heavy oil, middle oil, gasoline. The middle oil is hydrogenated in order to get more gasoline and the heavy oil is mixed with the coal again and the process restarts. In this way, heavy oil and <b>middle</b> oil <b>fractions</b> are also reused in this process.|$|R

Despite the further upgrading achieved with this configuration, the accumulation of coke and metals deposits on the catalyst and pore sites, resulting from cracking of the heavy oil, have a detrimental effect on the catalyst activity, life span and process. An alternative contacting pattern between the oil and nanoparticulate catalysts was investigated in this study, to mitigate the above mentioned challenges. The Taguchi method was applied to optimize the effect of reaction factors and select the optimum values that maximize level of heavy oil upgrading while suppressing coke yield. The reaction factors evaluated were reaction temperature, H 2 initial pressure, reaction time, iron metal loading and speed of mixing. An orthogonal array, analysis of mean of response, analysis of mean {{signal to noise ratio}} (S/N) and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) were employed to analyze the effect of these reaction factors. Detailed optimization of the reaction conditions with iron oxide dispersed nanoparticles (≤ 50 nm) for in situ catalytic upgrading of heavy oil was carried out at the following ranges; temperature 355 – 425 oC, reaction time 20 – 80 min, agitation 200 – 900 rpm, initial hydrogen pressure 10 – 50 bar, and iron metal loading 0. 03 – 0. 4 wt%. It was found that the optimum combinations of reaction factors are temperature 425 oC, initial hydrogen pressure 50 bar, reaction time 60 min, agitation 400 rpm and iron-metal loading 0. 1 wt%. The properties of upgraded oil at the optimum condition are API gravity 21. 1 o, viscosity 105. 75 cP, sulfur reduced by 37. 54 %, metals (Ni + V) reduced by 68. 9 %, and naphtha plus <b>middle</b> distillate <b>fractions</b> (IBP – 343 oC) 68 wt% relative to the feed oil (12. 8 oAPI, 1482 cP, sulfur content 3. 09 wt%, metals (Ni+V) content 0. 0132 wt%, and naphtha plus <b>middle</b> distillate <b>fractions</b> 28. 86 wt%) ...|$|R
40|$|CBA mice were {{rendered}} highly tolerant to A/Jax cells by neonatal intravenous {{injections of}} (CBA x A) F 1 spleen cells. The {{high degree of}} tolerance was ascertained {{by the absence of}} circulating antibodies detected in the sera by the usual tests and by the perfect state of A skin grafts during all the experiments. Tolerant sera (sera from tolerant animals) were studied at three periods of tolerance: before skin test grafting, from 2 to 11 wk after grafting, and at time of sacrifice at almost 6 months of age. The tolerant sera were shown to have specific facilitation-enhancing properties promoting the take and growth of A/Jax sarcoma (SaI and /Sa 15091 a grafted on normal CBA mice. These properties were present throughout the duration of the experiments, showing that they were not the result of a beginning interruption of tolerance. The tolerant sera, although lacking the usual serological properties (hemagglutination, hemolysis, cytotoxicity, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis) had, however, specific synergistic hemagglutinating properties (increasing the hemagglutinating titer of a reference immune serum). Antibodies giving direct specific hemagglutination could be extracted from spleens of 20 % of highly tolerant mice. The tolerant sera were also found to contain more IgG 1 and more IgA than normal sera while they contained normal quantities of the complement-fixing immunoglobulins IgG 2 and IgM. Fractionation of tolerant sera on DEAE chromatography column confirmed the data concerning immunoglobulin classes and demonstrated direct specific serological activities undetected in unfractionated sera: a weak hemolysis in the most cationic fractions and a weak hemagglutination in the <b>middle</b> <b>fractions.</b> Synergistic hemagglutination, detected in unfractionated serum, was localized in fast anionic fractions containing high IgA concentration, along with facilitation-enhancing activity, thus confirming a link suggested previously between these three properties. The relation between immunological tolerance and facilitating antibodies was discussed {{in the light of the}} fact that antibodies, possibly of a particular class continuously present at low dose in the sera of highly tolerant animals, are able to transfer (at least partly) this state of tolerance provided a sensitive test system is utilized...|$|R
