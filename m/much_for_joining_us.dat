Thanks so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us.</b> This week {{we begin}} our star of the month festival for March — a thirty-six-film salute {{to one of the}} most underrated actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, the {{delightful}} Ann Sothern. Over the course of her sixty-year career, Ann Sothern found success on the stage, on radio, on film and, certainly, on television, becoming one of those faces which would, invariably, make an audience, en masse, kind of give it a happy sigh of relief, knowing well, now we're in good hands, I know I'm gonna have a good time. And with Ann Sothern, they always did. Still, I don't think the film industry ever really fully appreciated her abilities and rarely gave her a chance to stretch as an actress, something Ann lamented about later in her life. Early on, she spent time working all over Hollywood — at Warner Brothers, RKO, Twentieth Century Fox and things got particularly promising for her when she signed with the mighty MGM in 1939. But that didn't really pan out much either. She was so charming in whatever she was given to do, MGM put her in one film after another and never really upping the stakes by teaming with any of the big male stars on the MGM contract list, people like Tracy or Gable, Bob Taylor, Walter Pidgeon. But all that was still in the future when she made our next film, as a contract player at colo… Columbia Studios.|$|E

Oates and Corey Allen play a couple of sketchy drifters named Duke and Boots. They're hitchhiking their way across Southern California — for a threatening version of George and Lenny in Of Mice and Men. They spy an attractive woman driving a Corvette. Duke and Boots follow her home, take up residence in the vacant house next door, with the intention of spying on her and then seducing her.|$|R

Have her politicians either leisure or special competency for aiding in their administration? India, we must assume, would come within the province and jurisdiction of the Federation. It would hardly be either an advantage or a pleasure to the people of a young country, with all their busy tasks hot on their hands, to be interrupted by the duty of helping by men or cash to put down an Indian Mutiny, and even in quiet times to see their politicians attending to India instead of minding their own very sufficiently exacting business.|$|R

40|$|Welcome to {{the inaugural}} issue of Rejecta Mathematica! Thank you <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> {{what we hope}} will be a unique and {{interesting}} experiment. For those unfamiliar with our mission, Rejecta Mathematica is an open access, online journal that publishes only papers that have been rejected from peer-reviewed journals in the mathematical sciences. In addition, every paper appearing in Rejecta Mathematica includes an open letter from its authors discussing the paper’s original review process, disclosing any known flaws in the paper, and stating {{the case for the}} paper’s value to the community. Since starting this endeavor, the questions we’ve been asked most often are “Why are you doing this? ” and “Is it a joke? ” While we are not above admitting that we have had a few good laughs in this process, we hope that this issue will serve as definitive proof that Rejecta Mathematica is not a joke. Despite the central role that peer review (and even rejection) must play in the scientific process [1], we believe there are several reasons why this project can make a positive and valuable contribution to the mathematical sciences research community. First, there is ample evidence that in the traditional review process, significant (eve...|$|R

This {{year you}} will hear diverse talks from the HCIL’s faculty, staff, and {{students}} on cutting-edge research which focus on three important areas of HCI work: collaboration, search, and visual interfaces. In addition, new this year, we will also be previewing five HCI books that have been either authored or edited {{in the past year}} by our lab’s faculty. Following these talks, we will continue the long-standing tradition of welcoming you to our lab for demos and posters (and of course birthday cake) ! We hope you will be staying the next day as well, May 29, 2009, to enjoy a wide variety of tutorials and workshops topics that range from usability testing, to designing for people who learn differently. The Human-Computer Interaction lab has a long, rich history of transforming the experience people have with new technologies. From understanding user needs, to developing and evaluating those innovative technologies, the lab’s faculty, staff, and students have been leading the way in HCI research and teaching. We believe it is critical to understand how the needs and dreams of people can be reflected in our future technologies. To this end, the HCIL develops advanced user interfaces and design methodology. Our primary activities include collaborative research, publications, and the sponsorship of open houses, workshops and symposiums...|$|R

40|$|Thanks <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> {{again in}} this our latest issue (V/ 1) of Journal of Social Studies Education Research (JSSER). Our journal has turned 5 {{years old with}} this issue. We are {{extremely}} delighted and proud to see the seeds we planted {{in the autumn of}} 2010 take root and grow. Social studies as a system of scientific research, and an academic career, is relatively new to Turkey, so achieving this success here means even more compared to in other countries with more deeply rooted traditions and a greater accumulation of knowledge in this area. Therefore I am grateful to everyone who contributed to achieving this success over the last four years. JSSER {{is a member of the}} Association for Social Studies Educators (ASSE). From ASSE’s perspective JSSER‘s role is to provide a basis for social studies academicians to fulfill their national and wider responsibilities and mission by contributing to the advancement of the social science research and to the sharing of research results. The second contribution of the JSSER in this area was to set up and institutionalize an International Symposium on Social Studies Education. Last month we held the third such symposium. Every year we bring together hundreds of native and foreign scientists, teachers and students in these symposiums, which have gained the status of a scientific banquet. Among our medium term targets is the advancement of these two activities in quality and quantity...|$|R

I {{want to thank all}} of our AAEA members and guests <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> in this beautiful city. Likewise, it is a special pleasure to partner with the Western Association. We have a very ex-citing meeting organized and I am confident that we will find intellectual stimulation, exciting professional interactions, fun, and an opportunity to meet old and new friends alike. The future of any organization lies in its young members. With that in mind, I am especially excited to welcome our newest generations of agricultural, applied, and environmental economists to what I am sure will be a very fulfilling meeting. These meetings play an important role in our professional lives, but no role is as important as that of presenting our association and all that it has to offer to our younger members. I recall the excitement that I experienced in attending my first meeting and I encourage all of our more senior members (that’s anyone who is beyond their first year of membership) to make a special effort to welcome our newest and youngest members who may be attending for the first time. At the same time, I encourage our younger members, especially students, to introduce yourselves to these more senior members. It’s a big meeting but we are really a small and very friendly community.

2500|$|One {{criticism}} of the analogy is that while Ponzi schemes and Social Security have similar structures (in particular, a sustainability problem {{when the number of}} new people paying in is declining), they have different transparencies. In the case of a Ponzi scheme, {{the fact that there is}} no return-generating mechanism other than contributions from new entrants is obscured whereas Social Security payouts have always been openly underwritten by incoming tax revenue and the interest on the Treasury bonds held by or for the Social Security system. The sudden loss of confidence resulting in a collapse of a conventional Ponzi scheme when the scheme's true nature is revealed is unlikely to occur in the case of the Social Security system. Private sector Ponzi schemes are also vulnerable to collapse because they cannot compel new entrants, whereas participation in the Social Security program is a condition <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> the <b>U.S.</b> labor force.
