After offering Dawkins a cheerful welcome, al-Khattab explains his views relating to the decadence of Western values.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Luna Park was {{a magnet}} for servicemen; both those {{treating}} their girlfriends to a night out, and those looking to <b>meet</b> <b>someone.</b> The park's external lights were 'browned out' {{in case of a}} Japanese sneak attack on Sydney, the neon lights were disconnected, and non-essential uses of electricity (primarily for ride facades) were curtailed. The influx of servicemen drew prostitutes to the area, and large-scale brawls were a common occurrence - usually between Australian home defence troops and American sailors on shore leave.|$|E

The first track on the album to introduce their relationship is [...] "Cowboy Style", a country number that was influenced by Celtic and tribal percussion. It details about Minogue meeting Sednaoui for the first time, and achieves a metaphorical experimentalism throughout its lyrical delivery. However, the theme of frustration was lingered into the album's seventh track, the techno-induced [...] "Drunk", which has Minogue feeling unsatisfied with the relationship, despite [...] "having so much feeling for [...] ". [...] "Limbo", a hybrid between rock, techno and drum and bass beats, was written in Spain, where Minogue discusses her inability to leave a certain country to <b>meet</b> <b>someone,</b> due to bureaucracy laws. Outside of Sednaoui, Minogue mentions her meeting an ex-boyfriend on [...] "Through the Years", feeling insecure and doubtful about the entire situation; the composition was compared to Bjork's single [...] "Venus as a Boy" [...] by Cinquemani and R.

500|$|The second track, [...] "Somebody More Like You" [...] {{was written}} by guitarist Sean Watkins.

Watkins said the song wasn't written for anyone in particular, but said [...] "I had this clever line and decided to build a song around it." [...] "Jealous of the Moon", the third track, was co-written by Chris Thile and Gary Louris of Jayhawks fame. This song was released as a promotional single in the United States.

500|$|In October 2010, Mason {{stated that}} a romantic {{interest}} for Chris could be {{introduced in the}} future.

The following year, Mason revealed that the writers had plans for a romance for Chris on their radar and a few weeks later it was announced that Bobby Morley had joined the cast as Aidan Foster, a love interest for Chris. Aidan and Chris formed the serial's first gay couple. Bower called the storyline [...] "a natural progression" [...] for Chris, noting that he needed to <b>meet</b> <b>someone</b> at some stage. Bower told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Chris's romance will be handled in a sensitive way and will be treated within the character. She explained [...] "Chris is a naturally shy person – he is not a person who either flaunts his sexuality or his heart. So it will be done according to that character. And {{it may not be a}} full-on relationship. The character that Bob is playing is older and further down the track with his relationship testing, so it will be a relationship story rather than a gay male romance." [...] Mason said that Chris and Aidan's relationship would have a slow build up.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again". In an {{interview}} with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album [...] "sound more personal than {{they might have been}} a few years ago", and she responded by saying [...] "Some of that could be just chance! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. Maybe people know me better now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning when you <b>meet</b> <b>someone</b> [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right". The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, [...] "Chocolate" [...] is [...] "packed with saccharine innuendo". [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing. Ballads like [...] "Obsession" [...] deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship.|$|E

Although Dan accepts that what his men did was wrong and, as the only officer present, he should carry the can, he appears to be in denial about his share of the responsibility. [...] Vaguely referring to a past relationship, Ambrose suggests that the solution may be for Dan to, at least temporarily, meet other women. Dan returns home drunk again, and this time, the row escalates and Dan mentions they break up for a while, exactly how Ambrose suggested. Feigning indifference, Nicola accepts, saying she may also <b>meet</b> <b>someone</b> else.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Morpurgo, {{the author}} of the book on which the film is based, visited the set several times while filming was being undertaken: [...] "Spielberg’s a {{wonderful}} storyteller and a kid. He adores stories and that’s what he’s best at. It’s extraordinary to <b>meet</b> <b>someone</b> with that kind of enthusiasm, utterly unspoiled ... When I went to visit him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.” Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: [...] "It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. And every single priority that as an actor that you would want to be there was there. It felt very real and focused." [...] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't sleep last night. I was worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything." ...|$|E
