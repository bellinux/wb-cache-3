The adsorption-desorption isotherms of the insulations were also determined in a dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) instrument. It was observed that the likelihood of condensation was higher in Stone Wool insulation than in Hemp insulation. Hemp insulation performed better in managing moisture due to its high hygric inertia and water absorption capacity.

The performance of the neutron activation technique to measure <b>moisture</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to the neutron moisture gauges or neutron logs commonly used in commercial well-logging. The principle difference is that the activation of {sup 64 }Cu (t{sub 1 / 2 } = 12. 7 h) replaces the neutron counters used in moisture gauges or neutron logs. For application to highly radioactive waste tanks, the Cu activation technique has the advantage that it is insensitive to very strong gamma radiation fields or high temperatures. In addition, this technique can be deployed through tortuous paths or in confined spaces such as within the bore of a cone penetrometer. However, the results are not available in ``real-time``.

Cold pools generated by evaporation of precipitation under convective conditions are gusty, with roughly double the wind stress of their surroundings.

40|$|Sphagnum moss is {{the major}} peat-forming {{vegetation}} component in boreal peatlands. The relationship between Sphagnum productivity and moss moisture content has been documented; however, the link between moss moisture content and conditions in the underlying peat column is less clear. We conducted a pilot study in which we monitored volumetric moisture content with depth and gravimetric water content of Sphagnum capitula and CO 2 exchange for two peat monoliths with intact moss layer dominated by Sphagnum fuscum and S. magellanicum. Measurements were made under drying conditions and rewetting from below and following simulated precipitation events. Capitulum moisture content was related to water table position but varied between species. Both capitulum moisture content and water table position {{could be used to}} explain net CO 2 exchange and respiration during drying and rewetting from below, although hysteresis was apparent where respiration was lower on rewetting than drying for the same water table position. Precipitation complicated these relationships because small events (< 5 mm) rewetted the upper few centimeters of moss resulting in a change in capitulum <b>moisture</b> content <b>equivalent</b> to a rise in water table position of 20 cm. This change in capitulum moisture content resulted in substantial shifts in both photosynthesis and respiration rates without affecting water table position or subsurface volumetric water contents as shallow as 5 cm below the surface.

Studies were made at two incubation temperatures (5 °C to restrict degradation and 20 °C to promote degradation), with soil <b>moisture</b> contents <b>equivalent</b> to field capacity. Measurements were made of the changes over time in both methanol extractable herbicide residues and in herbicide concentrations in the soil solution. Sorption distribution coefficients of linuron and isoproturon increased with residence time in the soil and the increases were more pronounced at 20 °C than at 5 °C, suggesting an interaction between sorption and degradation. With linuron, comparative studies were done with the herbicide applied to soil as either a commercial formulation or as pure, analytical grade compound. No significant differences were observed between the two treatments. In further experiments with isoproturon, incubations were made at 5 °C with initial concentrations of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg isoproturon kg- 1 soil and total residues and soil solution concentrations were measured after 4 days. Sorption measurements of isoproturon were also made using a standard batch equilibrium method.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is an {{analysis}} of the causes of spruce (Picea abies L.) decline and mortality in Belarus. The analysis was based on forest inventory and Landsat satellite (land cover classification, climate variables (air temperature, precipitation, evaporation, vapor pressure deficit, SPEI drought index)), and GRACE-derived soil <b>moisture</b> estimation (<b>equivalent</b> of water thickness anomalies, EWTA). We found a difference in spatial patterns between dead stands and all stands (i. e., before mortality). Dead stands were located preferentially on relief features with higher water stress risk (i. e., higher elevations, steeper slopes, south and southwestern exposure). Spruce mortality followed a series of repeated droughts between 1990 and 2010. Mortality was negatively correlated with air humidity (r = - 0. 52), and precipitation (r = - 0. 57), and positively correlated with the prior year vapor pressure deficit (r = 0. 47), and drought increase (r = 0. 57). Mortality increased with the increase in occurrence of spring frosts (r = 0. 5), and decreased with an increase in winter cloud cover (r = - 0. 37). Spruce mortality was negatively correlated with snow water accumulation (r = - 0. 81) and previous year anomalies in water soil content (r = - 0. 8). Weakened by water stress, spruce stands were attacked by pests and phytopathogens. Overall, spruce mortality in Belarussian forests was caused by drought episodes and drought increase in synergy with pest and phytopathogen attacks. Vast Picea abies mortality in Belarus and adjacent areas of Russia and Eastern Europe is a result of low adaptation of that species to increased drought. This indicates the necessity of spruce replacement by drought-tolerant indigenous (e. g., Pinus sylvestris, Querqus robur) or introduced (e. g., Larix sp. or Pseudotsuga menzieslii) species to obtain sustainable forest growth management...|$|R

Trametes versicolor produced pigmentation at a lower <b>moisture</b> content <b>equivalent</b> of 18 – 35 % for sugar maple, and 26 – 32 % for beech (Figure 4), with no inhibition of mass loss. The ascomycete X. polymorpha preferred a moisture content that was more consistent between the two wood species studied, producing maximum pigmentation at 29 – 33 % in sugar maple and 29 – 32 % initial moisture content in beech (Figure 5). However, the same moisture content that stimulated pigmentation in beech, also resulted in the highest mass loss (Figure 3 a). In the case of I. hispidus the pigmentation was inhibited at low moisture contents, under 22 - 28 % in beech and 34 - 38 % in sugar maple (Figure 5), and no treatment had a significant influence on mass loss. The same trend can be recognized in P. squamosus (Figure 7), while F. fomentarius and P. brumalis both show a completely different tendency, with maximum pigmentation in beech at 26 – 41 % and in sugar maple at 59 - 96 % (Figures 8 and 9). The pink staining fungus S. cuboideum developed more pigmentation at an the initial moisture content above 35 % for both wood species (Figure 10). The differences in the reaction among fungal species to various moisture contents might be the outcome of fungal specificity to certain conditions and substrate constraints, as part of successional colonization that ensure wood decomposition (Boddy 1983 a; Boddy and Rayner 1983; Cooke and Rayner 1984; Boddy 1986; Rayner 1986; Boddy et al. 1989).
