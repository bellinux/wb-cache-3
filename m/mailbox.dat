5|$|In {{order to}} further enhance the appeal of its new {{flagship}} product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed {{to tap into the}} commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. The Fax Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax <b>Mailbox</b> feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E

Although he has no prior football experience, he has natural talent and becomes the team's first star quarterback.

25|$|Curbside mailboxes, {{known in}} Canada as rural mailboxes, must be weatherproof, have {{space for the}} name of the <b>mailbox</b> owner, and possess a signal device on the {{right-hand}} side (when facing the front of the <b>mailbox)</b> for pickup of outgoing mail. The signal device must rise above the <b>mailbox</b> and be visible at a distance, and must not obscure the <b>mailbox</b> owner's name or impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Canada Post requires all rural mailboxes to have a minimum interior dimensions of 45cm in length by 17.5cm in width by 17.5cm in height for a rectangular <b>mailbox,</b> and 45cm in length by 25cm in diameter {{in the case of a}} cylindrical <b>mailbox.</b>|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{designs of}} <b>mailboxes</b> with {{improved}} construction and security have been patented in recent years, {{particularly in the}} United States. In 2001, the USPS first approved designs for locking curbside <b>mailboxes</b> to stem a rise in identity and mail theft. With these secure designs, the incoming mail is placed into a slot or hopper by the mail carrier, where it drops into a secure locked compartment for retrieval by only the homeowner (who retains a key or combination to the lock). Locking <b>mailboxes</b> are generally constructed of heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate, though some models are made of roto-moulded polymer plastic.|$|R

25|$|The Joroleman <b>mailbox</b> was {{originally}} approved for manufacture in one size, the No. 1, which could accommodate letter mail, periodicals, newspapers, catalogs, and small parcels. After July 1, 1916, the Joroleman <b>mailbox</b> {{would be the}} only design approved by the Post Office for new curbside <b>mailbox</b> installations. In July 1929, the Post Office approved specifications for a larger Joroleman <b>mailbox</b> known as the No. 2. The No. 2 <b>mailbox,</b> soon followed by the still-larger No. 3, could accept larger parcels and packages sent via Parcel Post; these large boxes proved particularly popular with rural mail recipients, who could order manufactured goods by mail for delivery to the farm or ranch.|$|E
25|$|Constructed of {{light-gauge}} painted sheet steel, Joroleman designed his <b>mailbox</b> with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the <b>mailbox</b> door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} <b>mailbox</b> served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman <b>mailbox</b> required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman <b>mailbox</b> was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling <b>mailbox</b> since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|E
