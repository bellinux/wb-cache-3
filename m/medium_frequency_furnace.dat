The effect of rotating speed of centrifugal machine on microstructures and properties of the recycled composites rings were investigated by mechanical property tester, SEM, EDS, and XRD. The {{results show that the}} recycled rings are a composite structure consisting of outer recycled composites region reinforced with undissoved WCP and core Fe-C alloy region unreinforced. The undissoved WCP-distribution in the recycled composites region is even. At the rotating speed of 720 rpm, the particle volume fraction in the recycled composites region reaches 54 vol. %, the hardness and impact toughness attain to HRC 55. 8 and 3. 5 J/cm 2, respectively.

The controlled values of different casting parameters such as pouring temperature, inoculation, carbon equivalent, moisture content, green compression strength, permeability and mould hardness were selected. Three different melts of metal with 0. 4 wt. %, 0. 6 wt. %, and 0. 8 wt. % inoculation (Fe-Si-Mg alloy and post inoculant) were produced using a 1 -ton capacity coreless <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> induction <b>furnace.</b> L- 27 orthogonal array with 3 -level settings {{were chosen for}} the analysis.

Microstructures of the as-cast QT 700 - 6 alloy were observed using a scanning-electron microscope (SEM) and the mechanical properties were investigated using a universal tensile test machine. Results indicate that the ratio of pearlite/ferrite is about 9 : 1 and the graphite size is less than 40 μm in diameter in the as-cast QT 700 - 6 alloy. The predominant refinement mechanism is attributed to the formation of niobium carbides, which increases the heterogeneous nucleus and hinders the growth of graphite. Meanwhile, niobium carbides also exist around the grain boundaries, which improve the strength of the ductile iron. The tensile strength and elongation of the as-cast QT 700 - 6 alloy reach over 700 MPa and 6 %, respectively, when the addition amount of niobium is 0. 8 %. The addition of copper and nickel elements contributed to the decrease of eutectoid transformation temperature, resulting in the decrease of pearlite lamellar spacing (about 248 nm), which is also beneficial to enhancing the tensile strength. The main fracture mechanism is cleavage fracture with the appearance of a small amount of dimples...|$|R

The literature reports that Niobium leads to better mechanical properties of the NCIs, and recent results indicate that 0. 5 wt% Niobium increases the strength and the Charpy notch toughness of NCIs, but decreases its hardness, in relation to a similar NCI without Niobium. The present report studies the addition of 0. 23, 0. 47, 0. 67, and 0. 85 wt% Niobium to a NCI covering the effects on the microstructures, yield and tensile strengths, tensile elongations and Charpy toughness.

40|$|The paper reviews {{original}} {{data obtained by}} the present authors, revealed in recent separate publications, describing specific procedures for high quality grey irons, and reflecting the forecast needs of the worldwide iron foundry industry. High power, <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> coreless induction <b>furnaces</b> are commonly used in electric melting grey iron foundries. This has resulted in low sulphur (1, 500 °C), contributing to unfavourable conditions for graphite nucleation. Thin wall castings are increasingly produced by these electric melt shops with a risk of greater eutectic undercooling during solidification. The paper focused on two groups of grey cast irons and their specific problems: carbides and graphite morphology control in lower carbon equivalent high strength irons (CE= 3. 4 %- 3. 8 %), and austenite dendrite promotion in eutectic and slightly hypereutectic irons (CE= 4. 1 %- 4. 5 %), {{in order to increase}} their strength characteristics. There are 3 stages and 3 steps involving graphite formation, iron chemistry and iron processing that appear to be important. The concept in the present paper sustains a threestage model for nucleating flake graphite [(Mn,X) S type nuclei]. There are three important groups of elements (deoxidizer, Mn/S, and inoculant) and three technological stages in electric melting of iron (superheat, pre-conditioning of base iron, final inoculation). Attention is drawn to a control factor (%Mn) x (%S) ensuring it equals to 0. 03 – 0. 06, accompanied by 0. 005 wt. %– 0. 010 wt. % Al and/or Zr content in inoculated irons. It was found that iron powder addition promotes austenite dendrite formation in eutectic and slightly eutectic, acting as reinforcement for the eutectic cells. But, there is an accompanying possible negative influence on the characteristics of the (Mn,X) S type graphite nuclei (change the morphology of nuclei from polygonal compact to irregular polygonal, and therefore promote chill tendency in treated irons). A double addition (iron powder + inoculant) appears to be an effective treatment to benefit both austenite and graphite nucleation, with positive effects on the final structure and chill tendency...|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since its}} {{discovery}} in 1948, {{the application of}} ductile cast iron [also known as spheroidal graphite iron (SGI) ] has been increasing day by day. This {{is due to the}} fact that the material exhibits an excellent combination of tensile strength, ductility, toughness in addition to castability, machinability and damping characteristics. It has also got considerable amount of resistance to corrosion. For these reason extensive works are being carried out now-a-days to produce ductile irons with enhanced mechanical and physical properties. An investigation was performed to improve the mechanical property of thick-walled/heavy section ductile iron castings in as-cast condition alloying with nickel and copper. The property enhancement can be done by heat treatment procedures or by the addition of suitable alloying elements. In the present work, effect of two important alloying elements Copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni) has been studied in thick section (≥ 20 mm) ductile iron castings. For this purpose fifteen different melts of SG iron were produced in a coreless <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> induction <b>furnace</b> having a capacity of 1000 kg. Five of them were almost without nickel and copper (they were present in a very little amount), five were with significant amount of Ni and another five were with significant amount of Cu. Different tests were performed to determine the different important mechanical properties like strength, ductility, toughness and hardness of the matrix structures of each of the melts in order to study the effect of the two alloying elements on those properties. The microstructures of all the different alloys were studied and a phase analysis was performed to get an idea about the structure - property relationship. The results showed that the small addition of Ni and Cu changed the as-cast mechanical properties owing to the different as-cast matrix micro-structures. The study of the tensile properties for the melts without Ni & Cu showed the low strength and hardness as well as high ductility and impact energy with feritic matrix. Some fractions of pearlitic structures were developed near the austenitic cell boundaries due to the presence of Ni in the melts with nickel content. The amount of pearlite increased with increase in Ni content but ferritic matrix rapidly changed to pearlite (for the melts with Cu content) due to the addition of Cu in the melt. The tensile properties for the melts C 1 to C 5 showed that 0. 2 % YS, tensile strength were increased with increasing the pearlite level in the matrix structure. The Brinell hardness value for all melts was found increasing from 126 to 252 due to increase in the pearlite content in the matrix as investigated. This change in hardness value reflects the change in the mechanical properties of as-cast heavy section SG iron castings...|$|R

These <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> movements, further, appear to bear some relation to the high frequency volatility of output. That is, periods of stagnation are often associated with significant recessions, while persistent booms typically are either free of recessions or are interrupted only by very modest downturns. In this paper we explore the idea of medium term cycles, which we define as reflecting the sum of the high and <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> variation in the data. We develop a methodology for identifying these kinds of fluctuations and then show that a number of important macroeconomic time series exhibit significant medium term cycles.

We then develop a model to explain the medium term cycle that features both disembodied and embodied endogenous technological change, along with countercyclical markups and variable factor utilization. The model is able to generate medium term fluctuations in output, technological change, and resource utilization that resemble the data, with a non-technological shock as the exogenous disturbance. In particular the model offers a unified approach to explaining both high and <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> variation in aggregate business activity. ...|$|R
