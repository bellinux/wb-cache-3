5|$|In Western countries, {{the number}} of new episodes per year has been {{estimated}} to be between 0.89 and 1.89 cases per 100,000 people. Children and young adults {{are less likely to be}} affected than the elderly: the risk increases by 20% for every decade of life. Men are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> Guillain–Barré syndrome than women; the relative risk for men is 1.78 compared to women.|$|E
50|$|Mechanistically, {{the causes}} of pelvic floor {{dysfunction}} are two-fold: widening of the pelvic floor hiatus and descent of pelvic floor below the pubococcygeal line, with specific organ prolapse graded relative to the hiatus. Associations include obesity, menopause, pregnancy and childbirth. Some women may be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> pelvic floor dysfunction because of an inherited deficiency in their collagen type. Some women may have congenitally weak connective tissue and fascia and are therefore at risk of stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.|$|R

5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive sleep apnea, {{researchers have found that}} 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black {{people are more likely to}} be obese than American whites, and are therefore <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, {{women were}} seven {{times more likely}} than men to have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Lameness in horses is {{movement}} at an abnormal gait due to pain in {{any part of}} the body. It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders, hips, legs or feet. Lameness can also be caused by abnormalities in the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> lameness, trauma, infection and acquired abnormalities are also causes. The largest cause of poor performance in equine athletes is lameness caused by abnormalities in the muscular or skeletal systems. The majority of lameness is found in the forelimbs, with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from problems in the structures from the knee down. Lameness in the hind limbs is caused by problems in the hock and/or stifle 80 percent of the time.|$|E

40|$|Why do firms {{sometimes}} {{choose to}} undertake their R&D by financing start-up companies, while other times {{they do it}} in their internal labs? We present a model where the choice of R&D is driven by information asymmetries {{on the quality of the}} project between the corporate venture capitalist and the idea owner. In an incomplete information environment, higher-quality projects are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>developed</b> by start-up firms, while low-quality ones are exploited internally. Also, two types of risk are examined, intrinsic quality risk and external shock risk. Riskier project quality and more difficult project monitoring make a project <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>developed</b> as a new venture. Finally, the model is able to show why corporate lab scientists get most of their compensation as a fixed salary, while idea owner entrepreneurs working for start-up companies have a profit-sharing agreement.

5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight {{times more likely than}} men to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E
5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary renal cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old and men are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E
5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E
50|$|ABT-724 {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a {{dopamine}} agonist, and is selective for the D4 subtype. It was developed as a possible drug {{for the treatment of}} erectile dysfunction, although poor oral bioavailability means alternative drugs such as ABT-670 may be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>developed</b> commercially. Nonetheless, it continues to be used in scientific research into the function of the D4 receptor.|$|R

25|$|Children {{of alcoholics}} (COAs) are more {{susceptible}} to alcoholism and other drug abuse than children of non-alcoholics. Children of alcoholics are four times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than non-COAs <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> alcoholism.

5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to mistake for solar urticaria because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{pre-eclampsia}} {{and development}} of placental dysfunction {{has also been shown}} to be recurrent cross-generationally on the maternal side and most likely on the paternal side.

50|$|A study {{into the}} disaster's {{long-term}} psychological effects {{was published in}} the British Journal of Psychiatry in 2003.
