6000|$|... "Middle stump," [...] Cross acknowledged.

6000|$|... "It {{would be}} very disgraceful to <b>me</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> if I was a living woman when you read it. I shall be dead and gone, sir, when you find my letter.

6000|$|He had tiptoed {{down the}} corridor, as rigid as ever, and was sitting outside {{one of the}} shut doors.

60|$|There {{is another}} thing that makes it {{difficult}} for <b>me</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> story, and that is, that it is all about myself. In <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> story, I shall have to keep on talking about myself; and talking about ourselves is what we modern-day authors have a strong objection to doing. If we literary men of the new school have one praiseworthy yearning more ever present to our minds than another it is the yearning never to appear in the slightest degree egotistical.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{know all}} that," [...] she rejoined, [...] "but let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Uncle Ryder. Luke has {{admitted}} all that, as you say; {{but he has}} never admitted that he killed Philip de Mountford--or Paul Baker--whoever he may be. Luke, Uncle Ryder, is allowing the awful accusation to rest upon him, because he wishes to shield the real perpetrator of the crime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] he answered, [...] "I {{have spoken}} of him. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> young man. If I {{believed}} {{that you were}} a creature of his breed, if I believed that a drop of his black blood ran in your veins, I would take you by the neck now and throw you into the nearest creek where the water was deep enough to drown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{always to}} wait," [...] she complained. [...] "I will be patient, but <b>you</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>this.</b> <b>You</b> are so kind to me. You make or mar my life. You must care a little? Please?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Papa, you are satirical, you are méchant! I can {{pronounce}} all {{the letters}} of the alphabet as clearly as <b>you</b> can. But <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> <b>you</b> are very particular in making me be civil to Dr. Bretton, do you like him yourself?" ...|$|R
