5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} {{to have some}} of the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression <b>modulus</b> Ka, bending <b>modulus</b> Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a shear <b>modulus,</b> but like any liquid, the shear <b>modulus</b> is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.|$|E
5|$|The bulk <b>modulus</b> of a {{material}} {{is a measure}} of its resistance to uniform pressure. Californium's bulk <b>modulus</b> is 50± 5GPa, which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70GPa).|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's <b>modulus</b> 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The <b>modulus</b> of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this <b>modulus</b> and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E
5|$|Iridium's <b>modulus</b> of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, {{together with a}} high shear <b>modulus</b> and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{fibers and}} sub-millimeter sized {{crystalline}} boron springs {{are produced by}} laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (elastic <b>modulus</b> 450GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.|$|E
5|$|By {{matching}} {{up these}} curves on the HR diagram the absolute magnitude of main-sequence {{stars in the}} cluster can also be determined. This in turn provides a distance estimate to the cluster, based on the visual magnitude of the stars. The difference between the relative and absolute magnitude, the distance <b>modulus,</b> yields this estimate of the distance.|$|E
5|$|Titanium has the {{inherent}} ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that {{can last for}} over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower <b>modulus</b> of elasticity (Young's <b>modulus)</b> to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still {{more than twice that}} of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|While Klein's use of {{aluminium}} for a bicycle frames {{was not entirely}} novel, his use of large diameter tubes was. Aluminium alloys have a Young's <b>modulus</b> around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes {{he was able to}} make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.|$|E
25|$|A more {{accurate}} approximation of the buckling load {{can be had}} {{by the use of}} the tangent <b>modulus</b> of elasticity, Et, which is less than the elastic <b>modulus,</b> in place of the elastic <b>modulus</b> of elasticity. The tangent is equal to the elastic <b>modulus</b> and then decreases beyond the proportional limit. The tangent <b>modulus</b> is a line drawn tangent to the stress-strain curve at a particular value of strain (in the elastic section of the stress-strain curve, the tangent <b>modulus</b> is equal to the elastic <b>modulus).</b> Plots of the tangent <b>modulus</b> of elasticity for a variety of materials are available in standard references.|$|E
25|$|But {{note that}} the {{elasticity}} of coiled springs comes from shear <b>modulus,</b> not Young's <b>modulus.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{solution}} treatment, the {{tensile strength}} of the alloy increases, but its Young's <b>modulus</b> decreases. The second stage of artificial aging increases the strength slightly, but also restores or improves the <b>modulus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Elastic <b>modulus</b> {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic <b>modulus</b> with low deflection. As the elastic <b>modulus</b> of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic <b>modulus</b> is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic <b>modulus</b> then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic <b>modulus</b> of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic <b>modulus</b> of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic <b>modulus</b> measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Young's <b>modulus,</b> {{also known}} as the elastic <b>modulus,</b> {{is a measure of the}} {{stiffness}} of a solid material. It is a mechanical property of linear elastic solid materials. It defines the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (proportional deformation) in a material.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} strength increase due to drying {{is in the}} ultimate crushing strength, and strength at elastic limit in endwise compression; these are followed by the <b>modulus</b> of rupture, and stress at elastic limit in cross-bending, while the <b>modulus</b> of elasticity is least affected.|$|E
25|$|The Baby-step giant-step {{algorithm}} {{is often used}} to solve for the shared key in the Diffie Hellman key exchange, when the <b>modulus</b> is a prime number. If the <b>modulus</b> is not prime, the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm has a smaller algorithmic complexity, and solves the same problem.|$|E
25|$|Young's <b>modulus</b> is {{the ratio}} of stress (which has units of pressure) to strain (which is dimensionless), and so Young's <b>modulus</b> has units of pressure. Its SI unit is {{therefore}} the pascal (Pa or N/m2 or kg·m1·s2). The practical units used are megapascals (MPa or N/mm2) or gigapascals (GPa or kN/mm2).|$|E
25|$|Young's <b>modulus</b> quantifies the {{elasticity}} of the polymer. It is defined, for small strains, as {{the ratio of}} rate of change of stress to strain. Like tensile strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the physical properties of polymers, such as rubber bands. The <b>modulus</b> {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature. Viscoelasticity describes a complex time-dependent elastic response, which will exhibit hysteresis in the stress-strain curve when the load is removed. Dynamic mechanical analysis or DMA measures this complex <b>modulus</b> by oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain as a function of time.|$|E
25|$|Since λ has <b>modulus</b> 1, {{multiplying}} any split-complex number z by λ {{preserves the}} <b>modulus</b> of z and represents a hyperbolic rotation (also called a Lorentz boost or a squeeze mapping). Multiplying by λ preserves the geometric structure, taking hyperbolas {{to themselves and}} the null cone to itself.|$|E
25|$|The Young's <b>modulus</b> of PP {{is between}} 1300 and 1800 N/mm².|$|E

25|$|The Young's <b>modulus</b> of a {{material}} {{can be used}} to calculate the force it exerts under specific strain.|$|E
25|$|The {{finite element}} method (FEM) is a {{powerful}} technique originally developed for numerical solution of complex problems in structural mechanics, and it remains the method of choice for complex systems. In the FEM, the structural system is modeled {{by a set of}} appropriate finite elements interconnected at discrete points called nodes. Elements may have physical properties such as thickness, coefficient of thermal expansion, density, Young's <b>modulus,</b> shear <b>modulus</b> and Poisson's ratio.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{his main}} stage bass is a Custom Shop Fender Jazz Bass, {{modified}} with a <b>Modulus</b> Lane Poor pickup.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{quadratic}} form is not positive-definite but rather has signature , so the <b>modulus</b> {{is not a}} norm.|$|E
25|$|Viscoelastic creep {{data can}} be {{presented}} {{in one of two}} ways. Total strain can be plotted as a function of time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of applied stress, a material may exhibit linear viscoelasticity. Above this critical stress, the creep rate grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting viscoelastic creep in a material is by plotting the creep <b>modulus</b> (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic creep <b>modulus</b> is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus time response to various applied stress may be represented by a single viscoelastic creep <b>modulus</b> versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E
25|$|Sound {{waves in}} solids are {{composed}} of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and {{a different type of}} sound wave called a shear wave, which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in seismology. The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium's compressibility, shear <b>modulus</b> and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear <b>modulus</b> and density.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the complex plane allows a {{geometric}} interpretation of complex numbers. Under addition, they add like vectors. The multiplication of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in polar coordinates — the magnitude or <b>modulus</b> of the product {{is the product of}} the two absolute values, or moduli, and the angle or argument of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of <b>modulus</b> 1 acts as a rotation.|$|E
25|$|The inverse of the {{compressibility}} {{is called}} the bulk <b>modulus,</b> often denoted K (sometimes B). That page also contains some examples for different materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{speed of}} a {{compression}} wave in fluid {{is determined by the}} medium's compressibility and density. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility and density, but with the additional factor of shear <b>modulus</b> which affects compression waves due to off-axis elastic energies which are able to influence effective tension and relaxation in a compression. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear <b>modulus</b> and density.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, a {{probability}} amplitude {{is a complex}} number used in describing the behaviour of systems. The <b>modulus</b> squared of this quantity represents {{a probability}} or probability density.|$|E

25|$|Up to {{this amount}} of stress, stress is {{proportional}} to strain (Hooke's law), so the stress-strain graph is a straight line, and the gradient will be equal to the elastic <b>modulus</b> of the material.|$|E
25|$|Using the Euclidean algorithm, one can {{efficiently}} {{recover the}} secret key d if {{one knows the}} factorization of N. By having the secret key d, one can efficiently factor the <b>modulus</b> of N.|$|E
25|$|Thin lines show {{intermediate}} {{levels of}} constant <b>modulus</b> and constant phase. At poles , phase and amplitude are not defined. Equilines are dense in vicinity of singularities along negative integer {{values of the}} argument.|$|E
