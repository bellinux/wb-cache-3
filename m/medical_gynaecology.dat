40|$|Western {{medicine}} {{is seen as}} universally valid, but in reality it displays {{a wide range of}} national and local variability. Our paper focuses on one such case of local variation: the widespread use of progestins in France to treat various pre-menopausal conditions as well as for contraception. The case of progestins allows us to explore how specific styles of research may come to dominate a particular local medical culture, and how they are influenced by changing criteria of scientific validity and wider social relations. We argue that in the 1980 s and 1990 s a single prestigious research-oriented Parisian hospital service played a dominant role in the transformation of progestins into scientifically validated medical practice. This status was not called seriously into question until recently when foreign research on a different form of hormone therapy suggested that risk was associated with their use. We also propose that both the research around and medical use of progestins in France was shaped by the positive attitude of many French women, including feminists, to hormonal therapies and to the non-surgical specialty most closely associated with hormones, <b>medical</b> <b>gynaecology.</b> France Progestins Gynaecology Hormonal therapy Endocrinology Women's health...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{appropriateness}} of inpatient antibiotic use, a 4 -week prospective survey in medical, surgical and gynaeco-logical wards was undertaken at Groote Schuur Hospital. A total of 224 prescriptions comprising 680 antibiotics were analysed.

The greatest number of inappropriate prescriptions - 54 % - {{were found in the}} gynaecology ward. Prophylactic antibiotic use was highest in the surgical ward at 41 % where a very satisfactory 91 % was considered appropriate, whereas 66 % of gynaecological prophylaxis was inappropriate. Therapeutical use was highest and more often appropriate. Therapeuticic usewas highest and more often appropriate in the medical wards. Antibiotics classified as restricted according to the hospital antibiotic policy were generally used appropriately, whereas inappropriate choice, dose, frequency of administration, duration, and unnecessary antibiotic use were encountered in 22 - 100 % of cases with unrestricted antibiotics. Particular problems pinpointed in this survey included excessive dosages of penicillin G and amoxycillin, an irrational protocol for the treatment of pelvic sepsis in gynaecology, and frequent inappropriate selection of erythromycin.

40|$|In 2004, the Italian {{parliament}} comprehensively regulated medically assisted reproduction. Law 40 / 2004 has outlawed several {{techniques and}} tightly compressed {{the freedom of}} {{research in the area of}} human reproduction and regenerative medicine. This article analyses the post- 2004 political, bioethical and legal debate on assisted reproduction in Italy. The analysis is grounded on empirical evidence on fertilisation outcomes released in 2007 and 2008 by the Italian government, on recent amendments related to the regulation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis and on the debates on the status of spare embryos as for their availability for scientific researches. The analysis shows that Law 40 / 2004 has failed to improve the access of infertile couples to assisted reproduction techniques and keeps supporting practices that the other jurisdictions have rejected because they are unwise from a clinical standpoint.

40|$|Abstract Background Tertiary care {{hospitals}} are a potential source for development and spread of bacterial resistance {{being in the}} loop to receive outpatients and referrals from community nursing homes and hospitals. The liberal use of third-generation cephalosporins (3 GCs) in these hospitals {{has been associated with}} the emergence of extended-spectrum beta- lactamases (ESBLs) presenting concerns for bacterial resistance in therapeutics. We studied the 3 GC utilization in a tertiary care teaching hospital, in warded patients (<b>medical,</b> surgical, <b>gynaecology,</b> orthopedic) prescribed these drugs. Methods Clinical data of patients (≥ 13 years) admitted to the General Hospital, Port of Spain (POSGH) from January to June 2000, and who had received 3 GCs based on the Pharmacy records were studied. The Sanford Antibiotic Guide 2000, was used to determine appropriateness of therapy. The agency which procures drugs for the Ministry of Health supplied the cost of drugs. Results The prevalence rate of use of 3 GCs was 9. 5 per 1000 admissions and was higher in surgical and gynecological admissions (21 / 1000) compared with medical and orthopedic (8 / 1000) services (p Conclusions There is extensive inappropriate 3 GC utilization in tertiary care in Trinidad.

40|$|Introduction. From literature, it is {{well known}} that {{communication}} between health care providers and cancer patients is complicated by emotional issues. In this study, we investigated the communication skills of ward nurses during interactions with simulated cancer patients. This study is part of a large study in which the effect of a communication training for nurses is being evaluated by means of videotaped admission conversations of nurses with actual cancer patients as well as with simulated patients. Methods. In total, 55 ward nurses of different medical disciplines have been recruited for participation. The <b>medical</b> disciplines included: <b>gynaecology,</b> urology, surgery, internal medicine/ haematology and, the ear-nose-throat diseases. Each nurse had a videotaped admission conversation with an actor who played a recently diagnosed cancer patient who arrived on the ward for admission. The actor was instructed to play a cancer patient according to the script we developed specifically for this study. For each nurse, the script was standard, but small adaptions were made for each medical discipline. The participating nurses were instructed to have the admission conversation with the simulated patient as they were used to have on the ward with actual patients. The 55 videotaped admission conversations with simulated patients were observed using an adapted version of Roter’s Interaction Analysis System, in which a divisionis made between instrumental and affective categories. Results. The results show that nurses predominantly use technical behaviours and discuss biomedic topics reflected in the instrumental clusters of the RIAS, relative to facilitating behaviours, reflected in the affective clusters of the RIAS.

40|$|BACKGROUND Surgical site {{infections are}} the most common {{nosocomial}} infections. Postoperative complications, especially surgical site infections can double the length of time a patient stays in hospital and increase the cost of healthcare. Antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery has evolved over last twenty years and is definitely valuable to reduce postoperative wound infection. Obstetric surgeries are considered as clean contaminated wounds where antibiotic prophylaxis has proven beneficial in preventing postoperative complications, antibiotic resistance and economic burden. But, in countries like India, even a large group of obstetricians are reluctant to follow it. Hence, this study was conducted. The aim of the study is to study the effectiveness of single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis in preventing postoperative complications in patients undergoing elective cesarean compared to postoperative antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective observational study conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and <b>Gynaecology,</b> <b>Medical</b> College, Kottayam, from January 2014 -December 2014. After obtaining permission from the hospital ethical committee for research, hundred patients undergoing elective cesarean in our hospital were selected for the study using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria of which fifty patients received injection cefazolin 2 g intravenously one hour before surgery. Remaining fifty patients who were matched for age, parity and body mass index were given cefotaxime and metronidazole pre and postoperatively. All these patients were followed up postoperatively for complications, antibiotic change and duration of hospital stay. Statistical analysis done using suitable software. RESULTS Complications were comparable in those receiving prophylactic cefazolin and those receiving postoperative antibiotics. Both groups required antibiotic change for complications. Patients requiring prolonged hospital stay was comparable in both the groups. Surgical site infections was the commonest cause of prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSION Antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin is as effective as postoperative antibiotics in preventing postoperative complications in a major referral centre in India. Hence, antibiotic prophylaxis should be preferred in uncomplicated surgeries as it reduces patient’s morbidity, antibiotic resistance and workload of hospital staff...|$|R

The primary {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the {{perception of}} risks and benefits of 9 drug classes during pregnancy and associations with women’s characteristics. Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to pregnant women who attended a Dutch Obstetric Care facility (first- and second-line care). Mean perceived risk and benefit scores were computed for 9 different drug classes (paracetamol, antacids, antibiotics, antifungal medication, drugs against nausea and vomiting, histamine- 2 receptor antagonists/proton pump inhibitors, antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and sedatives/anxiolytics). For each participant, we computed weighted risk and benefit sum scores with principal component analysis. In addition, major concerns regarding medication use were evaluated. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 136 women (response rate 77 %). Pregnant women were most concerned about having a child with a birth defect (35 %), a miscarriage (35 %), or their child developing an allergic disease (23 %), respectively, as a result of drug use. The majority of studied drug classes were perceived relatively low in risk and high in benefit. Higher risk scores were reported if women were in their first trimesters of pregnancy (p= 0. 007). Lower benefit scores were reported if women were single (p= 0. 014), smoking (p= 0. 028), nulliparous (p= 0. 006), or did not have a family history of birth defects (p= 0. 005).

40|$|French enlightment {{came with}} new conceptions of {{physiological}} processes. It included also a childbirth that was relieved of magic and irrationality. One {{of the products}} of this ideology was populationism with its idea of the state organisation of health service. Attention to {{a mother and a}} child created its basics. Medicine focused on pregnancy and childbirth and it led to establishing of obstetrics as a special <b>medical</b> field. Later, <b>gynaecology</b> and pediatry were emancipated. Although medicalisation of childbirth was not direct and definite, medicine doctors took control over obstetrics in Europian countries from the middle of 20 th century. Midwives were originally only a product of woman solidarity; it was institutionalized because every society tried to protect a beginning human life. Therefore the midwives became the first non-productive professional group that was reglemented by public authority. Suzerain, municipal, parish authorities and also some forward-looking individuals called for their competence during early modern times. On July 24 th 1753 Maria Theresia published General health order for the Bohemian Kingdom that included the ordinance about the education and exams of midwives. In 1770 it was followed by such an order for all the monarchy which laid the fundamentals to modern health service. After these orders precise instructions for midwives were published; in the same time it was started with publishing of the textbooks for them. Some dozens of them are preserved up to this day and they are an important source to the history of this medical field and also to the history of this profession. We can reconstruct the genesis of social position of midewives and settle the requirements that were imposed on their professional ability and moral qualities. We can also use topographic and statistic manuals that say us a lot about the rate of midewives in concrete regions and about their efficiency. Very valuable but seldom preserved resources are also the booklets in which the midewives wrote about the course of concrete childbirths. This article is based upon four such booklets that come from Týn nad Vltavou, Choltice, Výpravy near Hradec Králové and Hořice (1870 s- 1930 s). Current time has again rehabilited the personality of midewife. We can say that the development of obstetrics in the industrial countries reminds a circle: from the monopoly of midewife to the monopoly of medical doctor and from this one back again...|$|R

Use of videos and photos can be useful {{for the assessment of}} trainees. Improvement of their technique, advice and corrections can be done in a more comprehensive way. After a certain time, there is real evidence of higher quality safe operative technique by the trainee, which is a main concern in the NHS Trust daily practice. Gynaecological units should have systems available for medical illustration because some times, gynaecologist and surgeons may be involved with an unusual condition which needs to have photographic evidence that will be used to get advice from other senior or experienced colleagues (not always present during the operation). Some times, unsuspected diagnosis of a non-gynaecological condition may occur. Available photos may give valuable information in these cases to other specialist without the need of a repeated operation. In the UK, the RITA system (specialist registrar training assessment) may include such proof of standardized tasks and skills that can be evaluated and thus produce more competent junior specialists! In minimal access surgery and especially for gynaecology, numerous photos can be helpful in order to create some computer modelling of the uterus and female reproductive system. Generic 3 D animation explains the process of a surgical technique to the patients, students and trainees without the real background (view of bloody tissues that may upset the public). Other forms of photography may be multi-step illustration that depicts the anatomy, patient positioning and proper approach for performing a certain task in laparoscopy training (medium and higher level of operating experience). An editor may seek scientific illustrations for textbooks or training materials. New modern books seek high-quality photos for better comprehension and more impressive and convincing presentation of a chapter. Illustration is essential for use on the cover of a medical journal, and is intended to entice the viewer to read the journal article. Illustrations play a great role creating impressive and nicely presented articles and papers for publication. If there are difficulties in obtaining new and relevant photos then articles may have more delays in being accepted or even not accepted for publication. Some of the illustrations can be used for educational posters explaining the complex physiological status of a condition or emphasising the benefits of a surgical technique. The Internet and electronic publishing are powerful tools for the dissemination of medical information and have created a demand for medical images. In general, public and medical web sites use more and more interactive photographic pieces incorporate 3 D animation into a review of the female anatomy and compare and contrast current practice methods.|$|R
40|$|This feminist {{study is}} an {{exploration}} of the subjectivity of women working as nurses within the gynaecological ward. Gynaecology has a long history as a unique area of concern to the health practitioners of any given period. However, recently with the development of modern gynaecology, this specialty has become based on male knowledge and male texts, women either as patients or nurses appear voiceless within this canon. Major texts within nursing mirror a <b>medical</b> construction of <b>gynaecology,</b> with the women involved in the discourse again absent from the literature. To explore the nurses' reality within the gynaecological ward I have undertaken a feminist interpretive study. Feminist research is gaining recognition within nursing and the contribution that such research can make to the development of nursing knowledge is acknowledged within the profession. However, it is within the work of nurse-scholars from Australia that feminist and postmodern ideas are most commonly debated. Their work provides an innovative approach to the exploration of nurses' work. To contribute to this debate I drew on certain specific notions from feminist and postmodern epistemologies to inform my work. These notions of the Other, difference, the body and discourse provided a unique way of viewing the practice of the nurses in this gynaecological setting. These epistemological concepts were then interwoven with feminist strategies to undertake my research. Through the process of feminist praxis, which included my working alongside the nurses and conducting in-depth interviews, three areas of general concern to the nurses emerged. Firstly the relationships, that is their relationships with each other as nurses and with their women patients. Secondly, the difficulties inherent in nurses' practice in this setting {{due to the nature of}} the experiences of the women they were nursing. These difficulties arose in relation to two particular situations, nursing women experiencing a mid-trimester termination and nursing women with cancer. Thirdly, the relationship with/in the medical discourse and individual doctors which, according to the nurses, had a major impact on their work. This study contributes to nursing knowledge by providing a forum for the voices of women as nurses, who nurse women in the gynaecological ward, to be heard. Using concepts from both feminist and postmodern theorising enabled the surfacing of the voices of nurses and interpretation of their experiences from a position of embodied reality. The diversity of the practice of nurses and the importance of recognising and working with this diversity became evident. Writing the text has been an important part of this research. Seeing writing as a political act in the way that many feminists do requires careful attention to the written word. Considering our fundamental nursing texts from a feminist perspective shows that many reflect a medical construction of gynaecological conditions and their treatment. Making explicit the voices of women as nurses is an important step in making women visible within the discourse of gynaecology. Nursing and feminism have much to offer each other and share an emancipatory goal of positive action to support and assist people in their lives...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is about a}} shared journey of being together. It involved thirteen women nurses (including myself) in a process approach to working with data collected through audio transcriptions of conversations during group get-togethers, field notes and journalling over twelve months. The project was conducted in a large acute care metropolitan hospital where the ward staff interests lie in a practice history of the <b>medical</b> specialty of <b>gynaecology</b> and women 2 ̆ 7 s health. Prior to commencement ethical approval was gained from both the University and hospital ethics committees. Accessing the group was complicated by the political climate of the hospital, possibly exaggerated further by the health politics across the state of Victoria, {{at a time of}} major upheaval characterised by regionalism, rationalisation and debt servicing. In order to ascertain women clinical nurses 2 ̆ 7 constructions of collegiality I adopted an ethnomethodological approach informed by a critical feminist lens to enable the participants to engage in a process of openly ideological inquiry, in critiquing and transforming practice. I felt the choice of methodology had to be consistent with my own ideological position to enable me to be myself (as much as I could) during the project. I wanted to work with women to illuminate the ways in which dominant ideologies had come to be apprehended, inscribed, embodied and/or resisted in the everyday intersubjective realities of participants. The research itself became a site of resistance as the group became aware of how and in what ways their lives had become distorted, {{while at the same time}} it collaboratively transformed their individual and collective practice understandings, enabling them to see the self and other anew. Set against the background of dominant discourses on collegiality, women 2 ̆ 7 s understandings of collegiality have remained a submerged discourse. Revealed in this work are complex inter-relationships that might be described by some as collegial!, but for others relations amongst these women depict alternative meanings in a rich picture of the fabric of ward life. The participants understand these relations through a connectedness that has empathy as its starting point. In keeping with my commitment to engage with these women I endeavoured to remain faithful to the dialogical approach to this inquiry. Moreover I have brought the voices of the women to the foreground, peeling away the rhizomatic interconnections in and between understandings. What this has meant in terms of the thesis is that the work has become artificially distanced for the purposes of academic requirements. Nevertheless it speaks to the understandings the participants have of their relationships; of the various locations of the visible and invisible voices; of the many landscapes and images, genealogies, subjectivities and multiple selves that inform the selves with(in) others and being-in-relation. Throughout the journey meanings are revealed, revisited and reconstructed. Many nuances comprise the subtexts illuminating the depths of various moral locations underpinning the ways these women engage with one another in practice. The process of the research weaves through multiple positions, conveying the centrality of shared goals, multiple identities, resistances and differences which contribute to a holding environment, a location in which women value one another in their being-in-relation and in which they stand separately yet together...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the outpatient treatment of Endometriosis {{for the first time}} in Germany, considering its sociodemographic, clinical and economic parameters in a specialized solo practitioner center. Methods The data were collected and analyzed retrospectively at the study centre and <b>medical</b> office for <b>gynaecology</b> and obstetrics of Professor Andreas D. Ebert in Berlin. We evaluated the medical records of 385 women suffering from endometriosis and treated in our center in 2015. Analysis included patient characteristics and cost-relevant factors. Results The highest density of our study population was aged 23 - 46 years (n= 331, 85, 9 %). There was a peak at the age of 33 years (n= 24, 6, 2 %). The average Body-Mass-Index was 23, 1 (normal weight). 351 (91, 2 %) patients had a statutory health insurance and 34 (8, 8 %) had a private health insurance. The cardinal symptoms were dysmenorrhea (n= 188, 48, 8 %), hypermenorrhea (n= 174, 45, 2 %), bowel symptoms (n= 111, 28, 8 %), pelvic pain (n= 104, 27 %), dyspareunia (n= 98, 25, 5 %), infertiliy (n= 82, 23, 1 %) and depressive disorder (n= 81, 21 %). There were 98 (25, 5 %) patients with rASRM-stage I, 47 (12, 2 %) patients with rASRM-stage II, 55 (14, 3 %) patients with rASRM-stage III and 79 (20, 5 %) patients with rASRM-stage IV. 317 (82, 3 %) patients received surgical treatment at least once, 102 (26, 5 %) of them at least twice, before they visited our center for the first time. From the onset of symptoms until endometriosis was diagnosed, we estimated an average delay of diagnosis up to 17 years for patients with primary dysmenorrhea. The total capital reimbursement in 2015 amounted 76340, 26 Euro. 28 % (21633, 66 Euro) resulted from the treatment of patients with private health insurance, 57 % (43654, 65 Euro) of patients with statutory health insurance and 15 % (11051, 95 Euro) resulted from additional treatment patients paid by themselves. The average reimbursement per case were fivefold higher for patients holding a private health insurance compared to patients holding a statutory health insurance. In comparison to the younger population, the reimbursement decreased significantly from 71, 69 Euro to 64, 91 Euro starting from the age of 51. Surgical treatments in rASRM-stage IV were associated with higher costs (648, 75 Euro) compared to rASRM-stage I (465, 38 Euro). Patients with multifocal endometriosis (Adenomyosis uteri, rectovaginal endometriosis and endometriosis of the bowel) visited our center 3, 6 -times a year on average and were remunerated with 90, 67 Euro per year, respectively with 25, 19 Euro per physician visit. Conclusion In summary it can be concluded that the capital reimbursement of endometriosis-related outpatient treatments depend on the individual health insurance status of each patient, the age of the patients, the number of affected organs and the rASRM-stage in surgical treatments. The results are raising further thoughts to what extend obligatory quality standard in the endometriosis-related outpatient treatment could be established to allow a premature diagnostic and to ensure an appropriate cost reimbursement. The patients would benefit from an early and correct diagnosis resulting in an increase of quality of life and avoiding productivity loss. Furthermore, there would be a significant benefit for the health system due to the decrease of endometriosis-related treatment costs...|$|R
