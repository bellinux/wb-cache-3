5|$|Stopford {{had hoped}} that his attack on Jurien's {{squadron}} might draw Willaumez's fleet out of the anchorage in support, where they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> and defeated by the British fleet. Willaumez however made no movement to prevent {{the destruction of the}} frigate squadron. Stopford returned to watch the French fleet from the anchorage at Basque Roads, where he was shortly after joined by the British fleet under Admiral Lord Gambier, and was present although not directly engaged in the Battle of Basque Roads in April at which the French fleet was defeated, losing five ships. Willaumez had been replaced in March by Zacharie Allemand, whose defensive positions were unable to prevent a major attack by fireships on 11 April followed by a bombardment by conventional warships. In the aftermath of the battle Gambier was accused of failing to effectively support the attack and faced a court-martial in July, although he was acquitted and returned to command.|$|E

Fans <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at her references to 'the hell that we built' and the 'violent times,' but Mariah thinks this song is for 'anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship.' 'You know what? I’ve been through too much at this point,' she said. 'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put me through cause me to be kind of on the defensive a lot of the time. And if somebody isn’t mature or caring and loving and open-hearted enough to understand that, then it’s tough, but this is a song for people who need that.' Mariah hopes that this song helps people feel 'a little bit stronger.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Students who are {{introduced}} to factoring as a primary method of solving quadratic equations <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to know {{it is one of}} the newest methods of solving them. Vera Sanford points out in her A Short History of Mathematics (1930) that “In view of the present emphasis given to the solution of quadratic equations by factoring, it is interesting to note that this method was not used until Harriot’s work of 1631. Even in this case, however, the author ignores the factors that give rise to negative roots.” Harriot died in 1621, and like all his books, this one, Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas, was published after his death. An article on Harriot at the Univ of Saint Andrews math history web site says that in his personal writing on solving equations Harriot did use both positive and negative solutions, but his editor, Walter Warner, did not present this in his book. Harriot’s method of factoring may look different than what modern students expect. [...] In the first section (Sectio Prima) Harriot draws tables to illustrate the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of monomial, binomial, and trinomial terms. [...] Then in the second section he shows a more direct multiplication that provides the foundation to his factoring method. He sets up the equation , and shows that this matches the form of multiplication he has previously provided as, ...|$|E

60|$|And the {{intention}} of the pleasantry is pointed by a malicious footnote, to the effect that people who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> that a serious man like Valère should have written works of this licentious and frivolous kind, will conceive that in a moment of leisure a philosopher should write Les Bijoux Indiscrèts, for instance, and the next day follow it by a treatise on morality,[195]--as Diderot unhappily had done.|$|E

60|$|I {{was indeed}} terribly {{surprised}} at the sight, and stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised,</b> and yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my works and improvements, they would immediately conclude {{that there were people}} in the place, and would then never give over till they had found me out.

Which way had he walked? Anyway: he had not noticed where he went. These replies were all made in a tone that offended me. Besides, I observed there was no dust on his boots (after a week of dry weather), and his walk of two hours did not appear to have heated or tired him.
