For over a century it has been the custom in this region to store stable manure in a walled <b>manure</b> <b>yard,</b> partly or wholly covered, in which the stabled animals are allowed to exercise during the day. Manure thrown into such a yard and thoroughly tramped by stock loses much less through heating and leaching than does manure piled in the open.

40|$|The authors {{divided the}} {{reclaimed}} land into {{three kinds of}} field conditions; only irrigated field, chemical manure given field and chemical <b>manure</b> and barn <b>yard</b> <b>manure</b> given field; and planted the aquatic rice in each of them. After harvest, we sampled sub-soil from each field and made {{a study of the}} Atterberg Limits of the soil. The results are as follows. The chemical <b>manure</b> and barn <b>yard</b> <b>manure</b> given field showed the highest Atterberg Limits, the second was the chemical manure given field and the lowest was the only irrigated field. The contents of organic matter of soil increased in the following order: Chemical <b>manure</b> and barn <b>yard</b> field > Chemical manure field > Only irrigated field. Therefore, it is concluded that the organic matter affects the atterberg Limits. Then the authors studied how the manure, (NH 4) 2 SO 4, KCl, affects the atterberg Limits. In this study, the atterberg Limits of sub-soil soaked in various electiolyte solutions of 1 N, 1 / 2 N, 1 / 4 N, 1 / 8 N, and 1 / 16 N were determined.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Each year nearly 30 million cubic yards of sediment are dredged from the Texas waterways and ports. A majority of the dredged material is disposed in confined disposal facilities, and these disposal sites are being filled. As these sites reach capacity, land must be found and purchased to build new disposal sites. Constructing new confined disposal sites is becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, alternatives to confined disposal facilities are being considered. One of the proposed alternatives is to convert dredged material to manufactured soil (artificial topsoil). A limited number of studies have been conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Waterways Experiment Station in conjunction with local USACE Districts to demonstrate the applicability of manufactured soil. Manufactured soil is created using dredged material and recyclable organic waste materials such as bio-solids (sewage sludge), animal <b>manure,</b> <b>yard</b> waste, and bio-mass (cellulose or saw dust). Manufactured soil helps reduce and recycle wastewater sludge and provides an alternative for the long-term management of dredged material disposal sites by reducing the area needed for the placement of dredged material in a confined disposal facility (CDF). The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the applicability of converting dredged material to topsoil as a beneficial use of dredged material. The site selection in terms of location, material, and marketing are paramount in determining the most economically feasible alternative. Location in terms of dredged material, sewage treatment facility, and potential markets all must be considered. The chemical and physical composition of the dredged material must be addressed since the amount of contaminants or salt has an affect on the application of the topsoil. The paper also presents a dredged material to topsoil. The economic factors that control the final selection for the test site are presented. The factors include excavation, transportation, and manufacturing costs...|$|E

The trial was conducted on a sandy loam soil at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute-Lanet, Kenya. Farmyard manure obtained from the centre cattle shed was incorporated into the soil at the time of sowing at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 Mg ha - 1 in a Randomized Complete Block Design replicated three times. Standard inorganic fertilizer was included as a control at the rate of 60 kg N ha - 1 and 30 kg P 2 O 5 ha - 1. The highest grain yield was produced where 5 Mg ha - 1 of farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure</b> was applied during the first year while 40 Mg ha - 1 produced lowest yield among manure treatments. During the second year significantly (p< 0. 05) higher grain yields were achieved from treatments of 30 and 40 Mg ha - 1. In the third year, no significant differences (p< 0. 05) were observed among the manure treatments but 30 and 40 Mg ha - 1 farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure</b> produced highest yields. Manures produced higher yields in all years than the recommended inorganic fertilizer.

40|$|The {{livelihood}} of Nepali {{farmers in}} mid-hills Nepal is interrelated to forest-livestock-farming system. Farmers {{go to the}} forest to take fodder as feed for livestock then the livestock products are used for their consumption and income sources. The fresh manure is utilized as fertilizer for crop farming as farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure</b> (FYM). However, the nutrient relationship among fodder, <b>manure,</b> and farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure</b> has not been clearly understood. In addition, the monetary value of the nutrient of FYM has not been quantified. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the importance of fodder trees as a source of soil nutrition. To achieve this, this study has the following objectives: 1) to examine the nutrient status in commonly-used fodder trees, 2) to determine the nutrient status of fresh manure from livestock feeding on different fodder trees, 3) to survey the use and quality of farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure,</b> and 4) to determine the equivalent market value of the nutrients in farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure.</b> This study explains the results of analysis identifying the concentration of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) in four forest fodder species. Additionally, it analyses the nutrient composition (NPK) of the manure of five goats, cows and buffalo feeding on three types of fodder species over a 27 day cycle. Finally, it calculates the monetary value of the nutrients in both fodder and manure. The nutrient content of each fodder species is different for each village and according to livestock type. The nutrient content of fresh manure produced by different fodder types also differed in K concentration (for cows) and in P and K concentrations (for buffalo). This study shows that Quercus is a promising fodder for cows and buffalo, along with Ficus fodder also for buffalo. Furthermore, the P concentration in FYM differed for each village. Lastly, an analysis of the equivalent monetary value of FYM determined that it is five to ten times less than the market value of FYM traded. Thesis (M. Phil.)

If the persistence of transgenic DNA in the environments is considered as the only risk factor, composting is a 'DNA-safe' method to treat GM plant residues. However, even though transgenic plant DNA was not detected in bacterial isolates in our experiments, we cannot conclude that horizontal gene transfer can not take place. The 300 isolates tested proved to be too low a number to be conclusive. The numbers of isolates tested {{were based on the}} screenings indicating high transfer, but the screenings were biased apparently because some Bacillus species gave PCR products matching the transgenic DNA.

30|$|Bioavailability of Zn in maize {{grains and}} stover was {{significantly}} (P[*]‚â§[*] 0.05) increased by addition of organic manures and Zn fertilization (Table¬† 4). This increase in Zn grain concentration, Zn stover concentration, Zn content, and Zn accumulation in shoots indicates {{that all the}} manures have potential to increase the phytoavailability of Zn to maize crop. It {{might be due to}} application of Zn-enriched manures with Zn fertilization, because organic manures in soil influence the microbial population which can enhance Zn content in rhizosphere by changing soil chemistry and release at time for plant uptake (Tejada et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2013; Patil et al. 2017). Foliar spray of Zn (1840 ¬†g¬†ha‚àí 1) and (1500 ¬†g¬†ha‚àí 1) resulted in increase of 28 ‚Äì 68 % and 61 %, respectively, Zn in wheat (Zhang et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2014). Therefore, organic <b>manures</b> specifically, farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure,</b> fisheries manure, and press mud along with Zn foliar and soil fertilization can influence the availability of Zn to shoot and grains of maize crop.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the wheat profitability and factors affecting its production under the Kareze irrigation system in Qilla Abdullah, Balochistan, Pakistan, {{during the year}} 2002 - 2003. The profitability of wheat was estimated using enterprise budget technique whilst log-linear Cobb-Douglas production function was developed to analyze the factors affecting wheat production. The result indicates that wheat is a profitable crop under Kareze irrigation system. Water availability through relatively inexpensive Kareze water and high use of inputs are the major contributors to high net returns and benefit cost ratio. The empirical results suggest that Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) Farm <b>Yard</b> <b>Manure</b> (FYM) {{and size of the}} plot are the key inputs affecting wheat production. The comparison of farm-level inputs use with the recommended inputs use by the national and international agricultural organizations show that farmers are roughly applying the recommended inputs level, which {{is also one of the}} main reasons for obtaining high wheat yield. Based on the empirical findings, it is recommended that farmers should increase the quantity of diammonium phosphate and farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure</b> to obtain maximum yield...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess appropriate means of nursery propagation and to evaluate field adaptation and carbon sequestration potential of Pistacia chinensis- a root stock for edible nut bearing pistachio. The trial was conducted at Debre Zeit and Wondo Genet in 2006. Matured seeds of the species with protective seed coats were sown on standard soil mixture (SSM) that comprised 3 % top soil, 2 % cow dung and 1 % sand and their germination was compared with seeds with protective seed pods that were sown on composted farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure</b> (FYM). Two independent experiments were conducted in completely randomized design with four replications, each replication containing one hundred pure viable seeds. Mean comparisons of germination percentages revealed highly significant differences between the treatments (seeds with protective seed coats sown on farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure)</b> and control groups (seeds with protective seed coats sown on standard soil mixture) at P< 0. 05. Thus, the most viable means of propagating Pistacia chinensis under the nursery conditions of Debre Zeit was sowing seeds with pods on farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure.</b> In a separate experiment, seeds without pods were also sown in replicates on standard soil mixture and their germination was compared with that of intact seeds (Seeds with their pods) sown on standard soil mixture. Mean comparisons of germination percentages for seeds without pods disclosed a highly significant decline as compared to the control groups i. e. intact seeds at P< 0. 05. Height and collar diameter of trees averaged 194. 61 cm and 4. 82 cm for Debre Zeit and thus are found significantly different from their counterparts (141. 1 cm for height and 3. 35 cm for diameter) at Wondo Genet...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the response of Napier-bajra hybrid grass that was subjected to treatment with 3 different types of organic manures and 3 different levels of inorganic nitrogen (20 kgN/acre, 40 kgN/acre and 60 kgN/acre) as fertilizer. Organic <b>manure</b> (farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure,</b> bio digested slurry and poultry manure) @ 4 tons/acre as basal manure increased the fodder biomass in a dose-dependent manner when used in combination with a nitrogen-containing fertilizer. We estimated biomass yield in terms of fresh matter yield and dry matter yield. We estimated the nutrient content in terms of percentages of crude protein and crude fibre in the grass that was subjected to different treatments. Our results show that biomass yield was significantly higher when organic manures were used in combination with maximum level (60 kg/acre) of inorganic nitrogen application. The crude protein content was comparable between the 3 types of organic manures and increased in a dose dependent manner to the level of inorganic nitrogen used. The crude fibre content was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher when poultry manure was used as organic manure and was not influenced by the level of inorganic nitrogen application. There {{was no significant difference in}} the palatability of grass fed to the sheep. The cost of production of the grass decreased at higher levels of nitrogen application. From this study, was conclude that inorganic nitrogen @ 60 kg/acre and organic manure @ 4 tons/acre yields significantly higher fodder biomass and that nitrogen- containing fertilizer is a critical component required for economical production of Napier- bajra hybrid grass...|$|R
40|$|Four tehsils of {{district}} Kasur (Chunian, Pattoki, Kot Radha Kishan and Kasur) were surveyed and five villages were selected in each tehsil at random. Two water {{samples were collected}} from each village and were analyzed for various irrigation water quality parameters. The results indicated that 60 % tubewell were unfit from Chunian, 90 % from Pattoki, 90 % from Kot Radha Kishan and 80 % from Kasur tehsil. Overall, 20 % of total tubewells water sampled had quality parameters within the acceptable limits whereas 80 % were unfit for irrigation. About 97 % waters were unfit due to high salinity (EC > 1250 ÔÅ≠S cm¬¨- 1), 63 % were due to high sodium adsorption ratio (SAR > 10 mmol L- 1) 1 / 2 and 97 % were due to high residual sodium carbonate (RSC > 2. 5 me L- 1). It may be inferred that use of poor quality irrigation water will cause deterioration in soil health, which consequently will result in poor crop production. Hence, it is emphasized that tubewell discharging unfit water should be used by following sound management practices like precision land leveling, inclusion of high salt tolerant crops in traditional cropping system, occasional deep ploughing in heavy textured soil, occasional flushing of the soil profile with heavy irrigation to reduce the salt concentration in the root zone and application of organic and inorganic amendments like pressmud, poultry <b>manure,</b> farm <b>yard</b> <b>manure</b> and gypsum or acid/acid formers etc, however the management options must be {{on the basis of}} analysis of water quality parameters...|$|R
