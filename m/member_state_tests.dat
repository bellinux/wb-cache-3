Study design: A structured questionnaire was sent to the Ministries of Health and the societies of obstetricians and midwives. Descriptive analyses identified which and how many <b>member</b> <b>states</b> recommend a <b>test,</b> to how many people this applied, and whether there was a correlation between the gross national product and the number of tests recommended. Results: Answers were obtained from all 25 <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Twenty of them have a national guideline. Forty-seven tests were reported and 23 of these are recommended for routine care by more than 50 % of the countries and apply to more than 50 % of inhabitants. Those tests are also supported by scientific evidence. Countries with a GNP below EU-average recommend more tests than the others. Conclusion: For the first time it has been demonstrated what the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the EU recommend for antenatal care.

The first chapter discusses the basics of UN peacekeeping: the UN organs involved in peacekeeping, the main characteristics of various types of peace operations, the 50 -year history of UN peacekeeping, the financing methods used by the United Nations for its peacekeeping operations. As an attempt to survey the change in suboptimality of UN peacekeeping efforts, the second chapter of this dissertation examines the financial burden-sharing patterns of selected UN <b>member</b> <b>states</b> {{for the period of}} 1975 - 96. Using non-parametric statistical tests, this chapter studies the rank correlation between GDP and share of GDP devoted to UN peacekeeping for four different subsets of UN <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> The <b>test</b> results show evidence of increased disproportionate burden sharing by wealthy countries {{in the first half of}} 1990 s for a sample which includes only NATO <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> In the third chapter, a reduced-form UN peacekeeping contribution function is derived using a joint-product model, in which peacekeeping efforts are assumed to produce contributor-specific benefits as well as purely public benefits.;The contribution functions are estimated for a sample of 25 UN <b>member</b> <b>states</b> for the period of 1975 - 96.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} factors that explain the voting {{cohesion}} of the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) on foreign policy issues in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). It is often argued that the EU and the US are simply too different to cooperate within international organizations and thus to vote the same way, for example, in the UNGA. However, {{there is still a}} lack of research on this point and, more importantly, previous studies have not analyzed which factors explain EU-US voting cohesion. In this paper, I try to fill this gap by studying voting cohesion from 1980 until 2011 on issues of both ‘high’ politics (security) and ‘low’ politics (human rights) not only as regards EU-US voting cohesion, but also concerning voting cohesion among EU <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> I <b>test</b> six hypotheses derived from International Relations theories, and I argue that EU-US voting cohesion is best explained by the topic of the issue voted upon, whether an issue is marked as ‘important’ by the US government, and by the type of resolution.

These findings are robust to the choice of control variables and the method of estimation.

HPV testing used as a triage for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, test of cure after treatment, and HPV-based primary screening may improve current cervical screening programs. HPV testing as a triage test for ASCUS seems to offer an improved sensitivity, with a similar specificity as compared to repeat cytology for diagnosing high-grade CIN and has been recommended throughout most EU <b>states.</b> HPV <b>testing</b> as a triage test for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions has a low specificity and is not recommended in most <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> HPV <b>test</b> of cure offers an improved sensitivity compared to cytology for women with persistent cervical precancer after treatment. HPV-based cervical cancer screening is more effective than screening with cytology. The effects of HPV-based screening depend on the organization of the program and on adherence to algorithms for screening triage. Otherwise, it is likely that HPV-based screening will increase the referral rate to colposcopy including more women with no detectable cervical lesion.

40|$|This article compares European Union (EU) {{burden-sharing}} {{in security}} governance distinguishing between assurance, prevention, protection, and compellence policies. We employ joint-product models {{and examine the}} variation {{in the level of}} publicness, the asymmetry of the distribution of costs and benefits, and aggregation technologies in each policy domain. Joint-product models predict equal burden-sharing for protection and assurance because of their respective weakest-link and summation aggregation technologies with symmetric costs. Prevention is also characterized by the technology of summation, but asymmetry of costs implies uneven burden-sharing. Uneven burden-sharing is predicted for compellence because it has the largest asymmetry of costs and a best-shot aggregation technology. Evaluating burden-sharing relative to a country's ability to contribute, Kendall tau-tests examine the rank-correlation between security burden and the capacity of EU <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> These <b>tests</b> show that the smaller EU members disproportionately shoulder the costs of assurance and protection; wealthier EU members carry a somewhat disproportionate burden in the provision of prevention, and larger EU members in the provision of compellence. When analyzing contributions relative to expected benefits, asymmetric marginal costs can largely explain uneven burden-sharing. The main conclusion is that the aggregated burden of collective security governance in the EU is shared quite evenly. © 2009 The IO Foundation...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent study}} {{argues that the}} {{contraction}} in total trade {{that occurred during the}} crisis was mainly driven by the fall in high quality goods, which should have higher income elasticity owing to a non-linear Engel curve. Our aims are, on the one hand, to test the quality Engel curve assumption for EU 15 imports from Italy and, on the other hand, to ascertain whether a break in income elasticities – either temporary or permanent – occurred during the global financial crisis {{as a result of the}} changing preference for quality of consumers in the old EU <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> We <b>test</b> these hypotheses by estimating income and price elasticities of EU imports of consumption goods from Italy for both volumes and market shares. The contribution of this paper is twofold.

Second, we perform three different versions of the mean group estimator. Our results are consistent with the assumption of a change in the preference for quality. This change may be due either to a shift in consumption from high to medium quality Italian products or to the higher quality, actual or perceived, of Italian medium quality goods compared with the varieties imported from the rest of the world.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{challenge}} {{the ability of}} the conventional methods initiated by Barro and Sala-i-Martin in the early 1990 s to detect actual convergence or divergence trends across countries or regions and suggest an alternative dynamic framework of analysis, which allows for {{a better understanding of the}} forces in operation. With the use of a SURE model and time-series data for eight European Union (EU) <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> we <b>test</b> directly for the validity of two competing hypotheses: the neoclassical (NC) convergence hypothesis originating in the work of Solow and the cumulative causation hypothesis stemming from Myrdal’s theories. We also account for changes in the external environment, such as the role of European integration on the level of regional disparities. Our findings indicate that both short-term divergence and long-term convergence processes coexist. Regional disparities are reported to follow a procyclical pattern, as dynamic and developed regions grow faster in periods of expansion and slower in periods of recession. At the same time, significant spread effects are also in operation, partly offsetting the cumulative impact of growth on space. Similar results are obtained from the estimation of an intra-EU model of disparities at the national level, indicating that the forces in operation are independent of the level of aggregation. Our findings challenge the view of economic growth as the main driver for a reduction of regional disparities and contribute to the growing scientific evidence that points towards the need to rethink current EU-wide regional development policies. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} features of recent studies of European integration has been {{the growth in the}} number of publications that have focused on the impact that membership of the European Union has had on its <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> One element of this has been the emergence of a significant body of work that has been concerned with domestic patterns of adjustment, thereby helping to address an important gap in the literature (Knill and Lehmkuhl, 1999 : 1; Börzel and Risse, 2000 : 1). In this sense, it is striking that the majority of the EU literature has tended to focus on developments at the European level rather than paying attention to developments at the domestic level and in particular the impact of European integration. And those studies which have sought to examine the nature of a <b>member</b> <b>state’s</b> relationship with the EU have principally charted the negotiating stance taken by government in a historical perspective. This is significantly different from offering an analytical review of the extent to which European integration has impacted on <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> for example on the activities of government. This is a point of which Claudio Radaelli is perfectly aware: ‘Europe matters, but how? The political systems of the European Union (EU) <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are penetrated by European policies, but what is the effect of this process? Is Europeanization making the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> more similar? Or do different domestic political structures “refract” Europeanization in different directions? Has “Europe” changed domestic political structure (for example, party systems and public administration) and public policy? If so, what are the mechanisms of change?’ (Radaelli, 2000 : 1). This article is concerned with the impact that membership of the European Union has had on <b>member</b> <b>states</b> by examining four books that seek to cast light on the nature of the relationship between the domestic and the EU level. Any book that seeks to investigate the way in which membership of the EU has impacted on <b>member</b> <b>states</b> should be <b>tested</b> against a number of criteria: first, a common framework for analysis; second, is the book written in a manner that provides a coherent account or is it structured in a way that is more reflective of a collection of individual essays; and third, does the book enhance our knowledge of the subject area. In examining the various contributions that comprise these four books, this article is divided into five sections, the first of which looks at the changing character of EU membership. Section two sets these changes within the context of the emergent literature on Europeanization. The third section takes a closer look at the approach and focus deployed in each of the books, while section four examines the extent to which the material adds to our understanding of the relationship between the EU and its <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> The final section notes the overall value of the four books...|$|R

40|$|The EU Commission proposes {{establishing}} Sovereign-Backed Securities (SBSs) as a {{class of}} safe assets for the euro area. SBSs are generated by an issuing agency that would purchase a large diversified portfolio of national sovereign bonds, and finance the purchases by issuing (at least) two types of structured bonds: a risk-free senior SBSs tranche and a risky junior SBSs tranche. Overall, we recognise that the SBSs concept has the theoretical potential to improve financial stability and financial integration in the euro area, provided it is built on a sound framework that overcomes several potential technical and political problems. However, SBSs could pose the risk of eventually leading to unconditional debt mutualisation in times of severe crisis. With regard to technical problems, {{it is not clear}} whether the SBSs concept represents a viable business model for a private entity, and whether senior and junior SBSs would find sufficient demand, particularly in times of crisis. If the market for the junior tranche broke down, the whole concept would collapse. In such instances, the political risk could arise that rescue measures are taken that, in contrast to existing rescue mechanisms (ESM and OMT), are not subject to sufficient controls by <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> solvency <b>tests</b> and reform requirements (conditionality). Another political risk relates to the introduction of the SBSs concept, which is regarded here as one part of a political compromise. We foresee the danger that the second part - de-privileging national sovereign bonds in banking regulation to sever the sovereign-banking nexus - may not be followed through, due to political resistance and to sequencing problems with introducing SBSs. Other political problems concern possible market distortions even in non-crisis times (particularly in primary markets), and the potential irreversibility of the concept. [ [...] . ...|$|R
