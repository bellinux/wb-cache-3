5|$|Mephedrone {{has been}} implicated {{in the death of}} a 22-year-old male, who had also {{injected}} black tar heroin. Mephedrone was found in his blood at a concentration of 0.50mg/L and in his urine at a concentration of 198mg/L. The blood concentration of <b>morphine,</b> a metabolite of heroin, was 0.06mg/L. For comparison, the average blood <b>morphine</b> concentration resulting from deadly overdoses involving only heroin is around 0.34mg/L.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is also {{sometimes}} used in newborns who are receiving mechanical ventilation, although <b>morphine</b> is preferred, owing to its better safety profile for this indication.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 1 May 1945, Goebbels {{arranged}} for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with <b>morphine</b> {{so that when they}} were unconscious, an ampule of cyanide could be then crushed in each of their mouths. According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children <b>morphine</b> injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS-Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Gray was {{planning}} to tour with the supergroup, Hail!, but on May 24, 2010, he {{was found dead in}} an Urbandale, Iowa hotel room. Circumstances surrounding his death at the time were not immediately known; an autopsy suspected his death was not intentional but did not reveal the cause. The day after his death, the remaining eight members of the band held a live, unmasked, press conference alongside Gray's widow and brother. On June 21, {{the cause of death was}} confirmed as an accidental overdose of <b>morphine</b> and synthetic <b>morphine</b> substitute fentanyl.|$|E
5|$|Introduced by {{the second}} International Opium Convention, the Permanent Central Opium Board had to {{supervise}} the statistical reports on trade in opium, <b>morphine,</b> cocaine and heroin. The board also established a system of import certificates and export authorisations for the legal international trade in narcotics.|$|E
5|$|An {{epilogue}} flashback scene soon {{reveals that}} Kelso {{had known about}} the stolen <b>morphine</b> and Sheldon's involvement, after they and their other fellow Marines found the surplus supply on their ship home. However, Kelso refused {{to be involved in}} Sheldon's scheme to sell the drugs along with the other Marines, telling them all that they will lose his respect for them as Marines if they go through with the drug profiting, setting in motion the events of the game.|$|E
5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as <b>morphine</b> {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms. This includes nitroglycerin, beta blockers and, {{in the context}} of an acute event, stronger pain relief such as <b>morphine</b> and other opiates. Many of these drugs have additional protective benefits, by decreasing the sympathetic tone on the heart that occurs with the pain, or by dilating blood vessels (GTN).|$|E
5|$|George V died on 20 January 1936, {{after his}} physician, Lord Dawson of Penn, {{gave him an}} {{injection}} of <b>morphine</b> and cocaine that may have hastened his death. Queen Mary's eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales, ascended the throne as Edward VIII. She was now the queen mother, though she did not use that style, and was instead known as Her Majesty Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass {{meetings}} and rallies in Munich and elsewhere {{during the early}} 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power. Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome, the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. Göring, who was with Hitler heading up the march to the War Ministry, {{was shot in the}} leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested. With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to Innsbruck, where he received surgery and was given <b>morphine</b> for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December. This was the beginning of his <b>morphine</b> addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg. Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to Venice. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via Florence and Siena. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.|$|E
5|$|If {{the pain}} is still not managed adequately, short term use of opioids such as <b>morphine</b> may be useful. These {{medications}} carry a risk of addiction, may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have {{a greater risk of}} side effects, including dizziness, nausea, and constipation. The effect of long term use is unknown. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Dr. Dre and Jenita Porter had a son, Andre Young Jr. In 1990, Porter sued Dr. Dre in Orange County Superior Court seeking $5,000 {{of child}} support per month. On August 23, 2008, Andre Young Jr. {{died at the}} age of 20 at his mother's Woodland Hills home. The coroner {{determined}} that he died from an overdose of heroin and <b>morphine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lecter takes Starling to Krendler's secluded lake {{house and}} treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July, Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by <b>morphine</b> {{and dressed in}} a black velvet evening gown, awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler's prefrontal cortex, sautés it, and feeds it to him.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2009, he co-hosted the 2009 Kerrang! Awards {{alongside}} Scott Ian of Anthrax. The following year, {{they both}} once again co-hosted The Kerrang Awards, where Corey collected the K! Services to Metal award {{on behalf of}} Paul Gray, who died after an accidental overdose of <b>morphine</b> and fentanyl.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 1944, Williams married Audrey Sheppard. It was {{her second}} {{marriage}} and his first. Their son, Randall Hank Williams, who would achieve fame {{in his own}} right as Hank Williams Jr., was born on May 26, 1949. The marriage, always turbulent, rapidly disintegrated, and Williams developed a serious problem with alcohol, <b>morphine,</b> and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his spina bifida. The couple divorced on May 29, 1952.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{analgesia}} is {{the cheapest}} and simplest mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as sublingual, topical, transdermal, parenteral, rectal or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of fentanyl transdermal patches in controlling chronic cancer pain is weak but they may reduce complaints of constipation compared with oral <b>morphine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Peptides {{in black}} mamba venom {{have been found}} to be {{effective}} analgesics. These peptides, part of the 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as strong as that of <b>morphine,</b> mambalgins do not have a resistance to naloxone, suffer less from induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{problems}} {{continued to}} multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The Görings—with difficulty—raised {{the money in}} the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Danzig (now Gdańsk). Göring had become a violent <b>morphine</b> addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with epilepsy and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring; her son was taken by his father. Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925. He was violent {{to the point where he}} had to be confined to a straitjacket, but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the <b>morphine.</b> Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry. Hitler, who had written Mein Kampf while in prison, had been released in December 1924. Carin Göring, ill with epilepsy and tuberculosis, died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like <b>morphine,</b> quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with <b>morphine</b> from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including <b>morphine</b> from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a <b>morphine</b> {{injection}} earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients <b>morphine</b> and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E
5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, <b>morphine,</b> cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and <b>morphine</b> or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, {{not only because}} of the events in the Caribbean, but also because of what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a <b>morphine</b> addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|E
5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, <b>morphine</b> and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|Heroes for Sale was {{directed}} by prolific pre-Code director William Wellman and featured silent film star Richard Barthelmess as a World War I veteran cast onto the streets with a <b>morphine</b> addiction from his hospital stay. In Wild Boys of the Road (1933), the young man played by Frankie Darrow leads a group of dispossessed juvenile drifters who frequently brawl with the police. Such gangs were common; around 250,000 youths traveled the country by hopping trains or hitchhiking in search of better economic circumstances in the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In November 1951 Hank {{suffered}} a fall during a hunting trip with his fiddler Jerry Rivers in Franklin, Tennessee. The fall reactivated his old back pains. He later started to consume painkillers, including <b>morphine,</b> and alcohol {{to ease the}} pain. On May 21, he had been admitted to North Louisiana Sanitarium {{for the treatment of}} his alcoholism, leaving on May 24. On December 13, 1951 he had a spinal fusion at the Vanderbilt University Hospital, being released on December 24. During his recovery, he lived with his mother in Montgomery, and later moved to Nashville with Ray Price.|$|E
5|$|In {{its earlier}} years, the studio did not {{hesitate}} to take advantage of scandal sheet–worthy events. After the death of celebrated Paramount actor Wallace Reid, brought on by <b>morphine</b> addiction, his widow, Dorothy Davenport, signed on as producer and star of a cinematic examination of the sins of substance abuse: Human Wreckage, released by FBO in June 1923, five months after Reid's death, featured Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as the wife of a noble attorney turned dope fiend.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines {{are derived from}} plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, taxol, <b>morphine,</b> quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, <b>morphine</b> and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of <b>morphine</b> obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Tim Guest {{attended}} Sussex University {{where he}} studied psychology, and obtained a M.A. degree in creative writing from the University of East Anglia. Guest was a journalist for The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph. After the publication of My Life in Orange, Guest later {{wrote a book about}} the phenomenon of electronic virtual worlds and video games, titled , published in 2008 by Random House. On 31 July 2009, Guest died of a suspected heart attack at 34 years old. He was found dead by his wife Jo; despite her efforts to resuscitate him, she was unable to revive him. It was later determined that Guest had died of a <b>morphine</b> overdose.|$|E
5|$|Busch stopped {{painting}} in 1896 and signed-over all publication rights to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, {{and his hands}} trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's suggestion {{to move into a}} large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections Schein und Sein and Zu guter Letzt were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed a sore throat in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and a few drops of <b>morphine</b> as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{short-lived}} relationship with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards), Donna {{moves on to}} date hospital manager Bradley Hume (Scott Adkins). Their relationship is terminated by the discovery that Bradley has been running a pharmaceutical scam, resulting {{in the death of}} one of Donna's patients due to a <b>morphine</b> overdose. After entering into a scratchcard syndicate at work, Donna wins £20,000. She refuses to share her winnings with the others and resigns from her job, making plans to travel to Australia. On her last day, a patient with bi-polar disorder steals and re-distributes her money. Donna misses her flight, and is forced to remain in Holby. She goes on to begin an affair with consultant general surgeon Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), despite the fact he is married. When Michael's wife Annalese (Anna-Louise Plowman) begins working at the hospital as a locum anaesthetist, she suspects that Michael has been unfaithful to her and confronts Donna, who confesses the affair and apologises profusely.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cope began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of <b>morphine,</b> belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled with care. The injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to <b>morphine</b> and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E
