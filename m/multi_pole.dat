40|$|The present work {{reports a}} general method for the {{calculation}} of t he polarizability of a truncated sphere on a substrate. A multipole ex pansion is used, where the multipoles are not necessarily localized {{in the center of}} the sphere but can freely move on the revolution axis. From the weak formulation of the boundary conditions, an infinite set of linear equations for the multipole coefficients is derived. To obta in this set, the interaction between the island and the substrate is t aken into account by the technique of image multipoles. For numerical implementation, this set is truncated at an arbitrary mu ltipole order. The accuracy of the method is jugded through the stabil ity of the truncated sphere polarizability and the the fulfilment of t he boundary conditions which are demonstrated to be satisfied in large regions of the parameter space. This method brings an improvement wit h respect to the Bedeaux's case Wind 87 a,Wind 87 b where the <b>multi</b> <b>poles</b> are located {{in the center of the}} sphere.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, the European Union (EU) governance and administration are undergoing some significant transformations, not without obstacles, from concept to reality, revealing characteristics that aim both the European and national elements in a permanent interpenetration, whose complexity is superior to other processes and phenomena specific {{for the construction of a}} United Europe. The major objective of the current paper is to substantiate and describe systemically the process of affirmation and transformation of the EU administration as a core pillar of European governance. A doctrinal overview on the debated topic reveals an atypical concept in terms of the traditional approach in administrative sciences, thus leading in the specialized studies to controversies going to the conceptual negation of the EU administration. This time, the reality of EU construction anticipates traditional theories and doctrines, imposing even a change of vision, getting closer to the modern theories of public management and administration. The EU administration has developed simultaneously with the construction of the United Europe on a distinct area that overlaps with the EU area in its various enlargement stages. In a regulatory perspective, the EU administration has benefited due to the constitutive treaties, from a contextual ground containing relatively few direct and explicit assertions, but which valorize the European traditions and culture, mainly in the Member States, integrating creatively the international developments of public management. In a developing relation, we witness a permanent adaptation of the EU administration to the needs arising from the achievement of the EU objectives. The attempt to institute an ‘EU Constitution’ got the doctrinal approach of the EU administration closer to the traditional approach specific for the European legal systems. The failure of that activity has created a new impetus to a different approach encompassing even features of a significant reform expressed in the Lisbon Treaty that entered into force on December 1 st 2009. Taking into consideration the background of the European integration, the studies and researches highlight that the main processes of the EU administration construction consist of Europeanization, administrative convergence and dynamics. In a systemic approach they become mechanisms of adjustment and self-adjustment in a social dynamic system, with <b>multi</b> <b>poles</b> and mixed architecture, such as that of the EU administratio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only given. The {{annihilation}} reaction pp to 2 pi /sup +/ 2 pi /sup -/ at 3. 6 GeV/c {{appears to}} proceed through 9 intermediate channels involving meson resonances rho /sup 0 /, f/sup 0 /, g/sup 0 /. The <b>multi</b> Regge <b>pole</b> of Chan-Loskiewicz and Allison (CLA), which {{is found to}} give a good description of pion distributions, such as c. m. s. angles and momenta, is inadequate for resonance formation. The introduction of resonances in the CLA model made by Plathe and Roberts leads to a rather poor description of the data and gives no information on the branching ratios of the intermediate states. So the author attempts to introduce the resonances in the CLA model by considering {{that they can be}} coupled to the nucleon Regge trajectory {{in the same way as}} pions through phenomenological coupling constants. Then, the amplitudes of all the multiperipheral graphs that can be drawn are added incoherently. This phenomenological model introduces one extra parameter/resonance relative to the original CLA model. It may be extended to higher multiplicities. It is found that this sum of amplitudes approximates well the physical situation at 3. 6 GeV/c, equally well for pions and multi-pions distributions as for resonance formation. A straightforward extrapolation of the model to 1. 2 and 5. 7 GeV/c leads only to minor discrepancies...|$|R
40|$|One way {{to tackle}} the problem of noise {{generated}} aerodynamically at solid surfaces is based on surface integral methods. To capture sound radiation characteristics sufficiently accurate {{it is necessary to}} enclose with the surface the entire surface area that affects sound radiation. For airfoil trailing edge noise, for example, this means to wrap-up the entire airfoil to properly capture the multi-lobe radiation pattern. If surface data is not available everywhere, the unknowns of the problem can be obtained with the Boundary Element Method (BEM). High Helmholtz number problems such as aerodynamically generated sound refracted at full-scale aircraft become treatable with fast <b>multi</b> <b>pole</b> BEM. However, surface integral based methods cannot properly tackle refraction effects in non-uniform flow. In recent years different numerical perturbation methods have been developed for simulating the propagation of acoustic perturbations over a given non-uniform meanflow. The neglect of refraction effects can give rise to significant errors in the prediction of sound pressure levels. The applicability of stochastic methods generating synthetic turbulence for the fast prediction of turbulence related broadband sound has been studied in recent years. The coupling of synthetic turbulence methods to perturbation equations and fast <b>multi</b> <b>pole</b> BEM will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{illustrate}} the effect of ferromagnetic materials on field enhancement and field distribution in a useful magnet aperture. Also treated are the effects of perturbations due to manufacturing constraints. A selected number of magnet types was chosen, such as axially-symmetric magnets, and higher order coils. The field distribution is calculated in the presence or absence of iron return yokes, The field values are obtained by using computer codes for *variable permeability problems based on vector potential calculations. Computational results are compared to simplified first-order calculation methods utilizing uniform permeability distribution or infinite permeability in iron. To show the extent of perturbations due to coil manufacturing upon field or gradient homogeneity in beam transport magnets, a calculating method based on complex variables is used. Field or gradient distribution in the coil aperture, due to ideal current density distribution, is compared to flux densities or field gradients when the ideal coil configuration has been modified to a more practical shape. Current filaments (<b>multi</b> [...] <b>poles)</b> are used to correct for field inhomogeneities. Computer calculations have their limitations due to convergence problems, size limitation, digitalization, and boundary effects. Specifically,, if field homogeneity in the order of 10 - 5 over a certain experimental area is required,,computational errors overshadow actual results due to the presence of iron with variable iron permeability or partial saturation, Based on a practical 8 th-order coil, a computational method is illustrated, which overcomes this deficiency.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of sound with an arbitrarily shaped underwater object must in general {{be treated as}} a coupled interaction between the fluid and structure, due to the acoustic impedance properties of water. Typically, this type of problem is solved by building a numerical model of the exterior fluid and interior solid regions and then simultaneously solving the coupled system of equations, on the common fluid-structure interface. These models are restricted by their high cost in terms of computational time and memory. The fast <b>multi</b> <b>pole</b> method (FMM) significantly reduces these requirements and is applicable to many types of boundary integral equations. For simple structures, a coupled model using the FMM for both the fluid and structure will provide a substantial increase in the possible model size or frequency limit compared to traditional methods.

40|$|We offer two {{possible}} explanations {{to account for}} the characteristics of integrated pulse profiles, in particular their degree of complexity, their variation from pulsar to pulsar, their stability, and the tendency of complex profiles to be associated with older pulsars. It is proposed that the pulse structure could be a reflection of surface irregularities at the polar caps, and it is shown how the surface relief can affect the number of positrons released into the magnetosphere which are subsequently responsible for the observed radio radiation. The electrons produced in the vacuum break-down in the gap carry enough energy to allow creating such a surface relief in ~ 10 - 6 years, and one way in which this could be achieved is discussed. Alternatively, the presence of <b>multi</b> <b>pole</b> components in the magnetic fields of older pulsars could lead to significant variations in the curvature of the field lines across the gap, and hence to structure in the integrated pulse profiles. An assessment of the two hypotheses from observed pulse profiles seems to favour the polar cap relief picture...|$|E
40|$|Photonic {{crystals}} are a novel {{class of}} optical materials that, almost certainly, will underpin major advances in future communication and computer technology. In a photonic crystal, the periodic distribution of refractive index {{gives rise to}} interferometric action which leads to band gaps, or frequency ranges for which light cannot propagate. Material or structural defects in the crystal can give rise to localised states, or field modes, that are the analogues of impurity modes in semiconductors, changing the radiation dynamics of the crystal and providing the ability to mould the flow of light {{in a variety of}} ways. The radiation dynamics are characterised by the local density of states (LDOS) and, in this paper, we describe a new, highly accurate and efficient technique based on field <b>multi</b> <b>pole</b> methods for computing the LDOS. Its implementation on SMP systems using the OpenMP and MPI protocols is discussed and we illustrate its applicability in studies of ordered and disordered crystals.

40|$|Energy crisis {{faced by}} Indonesia, {{especially}} on electrical case has forced various parties {{to find the}} solution in solving this problem. The most popular one is by utilizing wind energy. In using energy with fluctuating characteristic, it is needed an appropriate electrical machine (generator) based on the characteristic of its motor. Generator is machine that converts mechanical energy into electric power through magnetic induction. Generator obtained its mechanical power from initial drive (primary mover). Mechanical power here is used to rotate coil wire as the conductor in magnetic field or even otherwise, rotating magnet between conductor coils. Electrical generator widely available in the market (radial flux) is usually high speed induction generator. This kind of generator needs initial electrical energy (excitation voltage) to configure magnet field. Besides, most of wind turbine (more than 90 %) in the world uses slip-ring and high speed induction generator which have such deficiencies; they are: more cost for slip-ring, maintenance of brush-gears, includes the replacement of brush in current period.

40|$|Nuclear {{reactions}} {{in which the}} incident projectile is absorbed by the target nucleus and y radiation is then emitted are known as radiative capture reactions. As a class, they are important {{in many areas of}} pure and applied physics. Radiative capture reactions can help determine such nuclear features as the spectroscopic properties of nuclear states (1), the collective band structure and origin of enhanced <b>multi</b> <b>pole</b> decays (2), and the modes of nuclear motion (3, 4). Such spectroscopic properties in turn provide information on spectrum fluctuations in nuclei with high-level densities, which are of interest in chaos physics (5). The interaction of atomic and nU(;lear physics can be studied by the energy shift of a nuclear resonance due to K-shell ionization (6). Radiative capture reactions are also useful in measuring the depth profiles of nuclides in materials (7). Condensed matter effects on nuclear resonances can be studied via channeling features (8). The Lewis effect (9) appears to be sensitive to surface features. The capture y-ray flux emitted from the plasma fuel of a fusion reactor can be. used to measure the plasma temperature (10). Finally, the radiative capture reaction {{is one of the most}} important in the formation of various elements in the universe, and thus it is crucial for the field of nuclear astrophysics (11, 12).

40|$|The {{origins of}} the {{magnetic}} anisotropy energies of the crystals of FeO and CoO {{in the state of}} antiferromagnetic ordering and the mechanism of the deformation they suffer when the antiferro-magnetic ordering sets in are investigated from the atomistic point of view, following the line developed in the preceding paper. It is concluded that the most effective part of the magnetic anisotropy energy in the deformation-free state of the crystals originates from orbital <b>multi</b> <b>pole</b> (or van Vleck's orbital valence) interactions arising from both the coulomb and exchange interactions between cations. The deformation of the crystals, however, is caused mainly by magnetostriction arising from linearly strain-dependent terms of the crystalline field energies. It is shown that the theoretical determination of the axis and magnitude of the deformation, using the point charge model for the calculation of the crystalline field, can give results which are semi-quantitatively consistent with the experimental results. It is shown that in CoO the deformation-dependent anisotropy energy overcomes other anisotropy energies and determines the direction of the magnetization to be the direction of the tetragonal axis of deformation, [001], while in FeO the>deformation-independent anisotropy energies are predominant in determining that direction, which coincides with the crystalline trigonal axis, [Ill]. Discussions are also given for other kinds of deformations which do not depend on the orientation of the magnetic moments, that is, the volume striction and the trigonal deformation suggested by Greenwald and Smart.

40|$|Many {{applications}} such as automobiles, gyroscopes, machine tools, and transfer systems require orientation control of a rotating shaft. Demands for multi-degree of freedom (DOF) actuators in modern industries have motivated this research to develop a ball-joint-like, brushless, direct-drive spherical wheel motor (SWM) that offers a means to control the orientation of its rotating shaft. This thesis presents a general method for deriving a closed-form magnetic field solution for precise torque calculation. The method, referred here as distributed <b>multi</b> <b>pole</b> (DMP) modeling, inherits many advantages of the dipole model originally conceptualized {{in the context of}} physics, but provides an effective means to account for the shape and magnetization of the physical magnet. The DMP modeling method has been validated by comparing simulated fields and calculated forces against data obtained experimentally and numerically; the comparisons show excellent agreement. The DMP models provide a basis to develop a non-contact magnetic sensor for orientation sensing and control of a rotating shaft. Three controllers have been designed and experimentally implemented for the SWM; open-loop and PD with/without an observer. The OL control system, which decouples the spin from the shaft inclination, provides the fundamental design structure for the SWM and serves as a basis for designing feedback controllers with/without an observer. While the observer and controller designs have been developed {{in the context of a}} spherical wheel motor, these techniques along with the models and analysis tools developed in this research can be applied to design, analysis and control of most electromagnetic devices. We expect that the analytical method along with the orientation sensor and spherical wheel motor will have broad spectrum of applications. Ph. D.

The popular one is the utilization of water and wind energy. The blowing wind in Indonesia, according to LAPAN, is variably and the average of its velocity is low (0 – 5 m/s). In utilizing this variably energy, there should be needed electrical machine (generator) that appropriate with the characteristics of its driver. Electrical generator has been widely spread in the market (radial flux type), usually {{in the kind of}} high speed induction generator where in this type, it needs gearbox transmission to get high rotation and also needs initial electrical energy (excitation voltage) to make its magnetic field.
