5|$|The DeKalb County Circuit Court {{came into}} {{existence}} in June 1839 when the first session of court met in Sycamore's first courthouse building, though the building was somewhat incomplete. At first, it seemed, that Sycamore <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> location of the DeKalb County Courthouse; other towns were vying for the county seat title. A now defunct town called Brush Point was {{the choice of a}} Dr. Henry Madden and Rufus Colton would have preferred Coltonville, where he made his home.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} begins {{nine months after}} the pilot episode. After Pete and Jenny's baby is born in Episode 1, the couple {{have a hard time}} getting any sleep. Pete has to cope with {{the death of his father}} in Episode 4. Adam and Rachel decide to rent a house together. He is horrified to {{discover}} in Episode 2 that she is married to another man. While he is staying with Pete and Jenny, Rachel has sex with her visiting husband (Lennie James)—who leaves soon after—and is pregnant by Episode 6. Just as hers and Adam's relationship is recovering, she tells him that he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> father, and that she is moving to London until the birth. Karen and David have recently hired Ramona as a nanny to their young son Josh. At her publishing job, Karen edits the novel of a renowned author (Denis Lawson), whom she becomes attracted to. She plans to sleep with him on a book tour but is humiliated when she finds out he is not attracted to her. David tries to sleep with Ramona to get back at Karen, which causes friction between the couple. They seek guidance counselling to repair their marriage.|$|E

5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its {{orbit around the}} Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, {{the point in the}} comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the retrograde orbit, it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> parent of that shower.|$|E

25|$|Driving in Rio de Janeiro, as in {{most large}} cities of Brazil, <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best choice {{because of the large}} car fleet. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common. Because of the {{organization}} of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighbourhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Américas).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best method of furthering the social {{object of the}} MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and {{so this was a}} question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E

500|$|However, modern {{translations}} make {{it clear}} that Laing was using the nursery rhyme as a model for his very free translation, and the reference to London Bridge does not appear {{at the start of the}} verse and it is unlikely that this is an earlier version of the nursery rhyme.

However, the original document detailing the attack was written only about 100 years after what would be a famous event in a highly populated area, leading the majority of historians to conclude that the account is at least relatively accurate.

500|$|Although {{he agrees}} {{that it would}} take a force of about 3,000 newtons to push over a {{standing}} cow, biologist Steven Vogel thinks that the study by Lillie and Boechler overestimates the pushing ability of an individual human. Using data from Cotterell and Kamminga, who estimated that humans exert a pushing force of 280 newtons, Vogel suggests that someone applying force at the requisite height to topple a cow might generate a maximum push of no more than 300 newtons. By this calculation, at least 10 people would be needed to tip over a non-reacting cow. However, this combined force requirement, he says, <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> greatest impediment to such a prank. Standing cows are not asleep and like other animals have ever-vigilant reflexes. [...] "If the cow does no more than modestly widen its stance without an overall shift of its center of gravity", he says, [...] "about 4,000 newtons or 14 pushers would be needed—quite a challenge to deploy without angering the cow." ...|$|E
500|$|Augustus {{was granted}} sole imperium {{within the city}} of Rome itself, in {{addition}} to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular [...] "imperium" [...] when they crossed the Pomerium – the sacred boundary of Rome – and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, {{when he was in the}} city, he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.|$|E
