Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and {{not based on}} good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E

This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} psychologists {{conducted}} a study to test the McGurk effect with Aphasia patients and speech reading. The subjects watched dubbed videos in which the audio and visual did not match. Then after they completed {{the first part of}} the experiment, the experimenters taught the aphasic patients to speech read, which is the ability to read lips. The experimenters then conducted the same test and found that the people still had more of an advantage of audio only over visual only, but they also found that the subjects did better in audio-visual than audio alone. The patients also did improve their place of articulation and their manner of articulation. This all means that aphasic patients <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> learning how to speech read (lip reading).|$|E

Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is.

500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E
500|$|Governor Eden was {{certainly}} embarrassed by Spotswood's invasion of North Carolina, and Spotswood disavowed himself of {{any part of}} the seizure. [...] He defended his actions, writing to Lord Carteret, a shareholder of the Province of Carolina, that he <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests. [...] He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden [...] "could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design", and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king. [...] Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice. [...] By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion. [...] Lee (1974) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods. [...] Eden doubtless shared the same view. [...] As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach, on 4April 1719, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning. [...] Israel Hands had, weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the Adventure in August 1718, shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize. [...] Four pirates had testified that with Teach, they had visited Knight's home to give him presents. [...] This testimony and the letter found on Teach's body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence. [...] Despite being very sick and close to death, he questioned the reliability of Spotswood's witnesses. [...] He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress, and that under North Carolinian law, the other witness, an African, was unable to testify. [...] The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally, and Teach had visited him only on business, in his official capacity. [...] The board found Knight innocent of all charges. [...] He died later that year.|$|E

In the pursuit of a polished and thus slicker surface for a plough, he experimented with portions of saw blades and by 1837, he was making polished, cast steel ploughs. The energy effort required was lessened, which enabled the use of larger ploughs, making more effective use of horse power.|$|E

Careful consideration of the record as it is available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby." [...] He also recommended against the creation of a government program to investigate UFO reports. He also described the problem that confronts the scientific community, that each scientist must evaluate the record for himself, and that the Reports recommendation against further research [...] "may not be true for all time." [...] He advised that government agencies and private foundations [...] "ought to be willing to consider UFO research proposals...on an open-minded, unprejudiced basis....ach individual case ought to be carefully considered on its own merits."

In 2013, the court found in favor of the ranchers for all other charges, including water rights, grazing rights, and all but two livestock trespass charges in United States v. Wayne Hage. In the ruling, the judge said, [...] "government officials ... entered into a literal, intentional conspiracy to deprive the Hages not only of their permits but also of their vested water rights.
