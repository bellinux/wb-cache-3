Finally, even Robespierre's own voice failed on him: it faltered at his last attempt to beg permission to speak.|$|E
2500|$|At the Atkin, Harris was {{examined}} by a doctor, who issued a preliminary diagnosis of apoplexy. Later in the evening, four other doctors arrived, including Harris's brother-in-law, John Fouche. These doctors rejected the initial diagnosis, and suggested a possible morphine overdose. Around 10:00 PM, Harris briefly regained consciousness, and <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> one final word: [...] "poisoned". He died shortly afterward, {{with the official}} cause listed as [...] "unknown." [...] No copy of his manuscript, High Times and Hard Times, has ever been found.|$|E

[...] Walter is the male pigeon and Clay is the female pigeon. Walter and Clay Pigeon are true urban birds, but let's just say that they're not the {{brightest}} lights in the sky—without each other's help, they might never <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> complete their own thoughts.
