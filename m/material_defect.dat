60|$|Chopin {{concludes that}} a lease is only {{voidable}} {{in case of}} <b>material</b> <b>defect,</b> or nuisance, as of pestilential air, not in a case which, after all, is a mere vice d'esprit. Here Maitre Chopin sits down, with a wink at the court, and Nau pleads for the tenant. First, why abuse the judge at Tours? The lessors argued the case before him, and cannot blame him for credulity. The Romans, far from rejecting such ideas (as Chopin had maintained), used a ritual service for ejecting spooks, so Ovid testifies. Greek and Roman hauntings are cited from Pliny, Plutarch, Suetonius; in the last case (ghost of Caligula), the house had to be destroyed, like the house at Wolflee where the ghost, resenting Presbyterian exorcism, killed the Rev. Mr. Thomson of Southdean, father of the author of The Castle of Indolence. 'As to Plato, cited by my learned brother, Plato believed in hauntings, as we read in the Phaedo,' Nau has him here. In brief, 'the defendants have let a house as habitable, well knowing the same to be infested by spirits'. The Fathers are then cited as witnesses for ghosts. The learned counsel's argument about a vice d'esprit is a pitiable pun.|$|E

First, the positive index <b>material</b> <b>defect</b> layer is considered, and the effects of the polarization and the angle of incidence on the defect mode in the transmission spectra of the both structures are investigated. The results show that the number of the defect modes in the transmission spectra depends on the geometry (symmetric or asymmetric) of the structure.

We employ three-dimensional Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations to measure relevant physical observables including the force-velocity / current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, vortex spatial arrangement and structure factor, and mean flux line radius of gyration. Our simulation results compare well to earlier findings and physical intuition. We focus specifically on the voltage noise power spectra {{in conjunction with the}} vortex structure factor in the presence of weak columnar and point pinning centers.

Twenty metal-polymeric fixed partial prostheses were used for this study. The esthetic component of the prostheses has been Adoro (Ivoclar). Optical investigations of the metal prostheses have revealed no <b>material</b> <b>defects</b> or fracture lines. All the prostheses were temporary cemented in the oral cavities of the patients for six month. The non-invasive method used for the investigations was OCT working in Time Domain mode at 1300 nm. The evaluations of the prostheses were performed before and after their cementation in the patient mouths. All the imagistic results were performed in 2 D and than in 3 D, after the reconstruction.
