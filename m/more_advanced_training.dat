5|$|The men's hammer throw {{became an}} Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4kg (8.82lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally {{featuring}} on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards {{as a result}} of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>training</b> techniques. Professional hammer throwers as historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary tales about individual failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Parents and family members were expected to act as role models, and parents who worked for a living passed their skills on to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships for <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>training</b> in crafts or trades. Formal {{education was}} available only to children from families who could pay for it, {{and the lack of}} state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. <b>More</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>training</b> often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E

5000|$|In Europe the {{definition}} of a minimum speed for newly built high-speed railways is 250 km/h (155 mph); for upgraded high-speed railways it is 200 km/h (124 mph).

500|$|Both {{halves of}} the technique, that of uke and that of tori, are {{considered}} essential to aikido training. Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. Tori learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while uke learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which tori places them. This [...] "receiving" [...] of the technique is called ukemi. Uke continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while tori uses position and timing to keep uke off-balance and vulnerable. In <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>training,</b> uke will sometimes apply [...] to regain balance and pin or throw tori.|$|E

5000|$|The Millennium trains were criticised {{for having}} several {{technical}} problems and causing {{problems with the}} CityRail network; they were {{referred to in the}} media reports as The [...] "Mi-lemon" [...] and [...] "Millenni-Bug" [...] as a result.

5000|$|However, in 2001 Dorothea Fischer-Hornung {{concluded}} that the film achieved more than Rossen and contemporary critics realised. The lead, Italian shop-girl Giovanna, enrolls in a troupe led by real-time choreographer Katherine Dunham. The other three main characters in different ways try to dominate Giovanna, but she renounces one while the other two die violently. Giovanna returns to the troupe to devote herself to dance. In the first scene a sexually charged dance accompanies a character's intense pass at Giovanna. The rest of the first third of the film forms three stages of Giovanna's training: basic lessons in Durham's technique; Giovanna collapses; <b>more</b> <b>advance</b> <b>training,</b> using twirling and other movements to induce trances. While most contemporary critics considered the cinematography of the dance scenes [...] "confusing" [...] and [...] "handled with no real flair", one described it as [...] "briefly, seems like genius", replacing conventional straight shots with sudden cuts, mirroring and montage.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] HRT was {{originally}} conceived {{during the late}} 1970s, and was set up after FBI director William H. Webster witnessed a demonstration by the U.S. Army's Delta Force. When Webster reviewed the equipment used by the Delta Force and noticed there were no handcuffs, he inquired about it. An operator grimly replied, [...] "We put two rounds in their forehead. [...] The dead don't need handcuffs." [...] The [...] HRT {{was originally}} to be an augmented SWAT and counter-terrorist team, capable of handling extraordinary hostage situations, large-scale counter-terrorist operations, situations involving nuclear or biological agents, or operations that local law enforcement or the regional FBI field office were not trained or equipped to handle. Final approval for the HRT was given in early 1982, and formal planning began in March that year. The initial HRT selection course was held in June 1982 and consisted of three groups of 30 candidates each. Most candidates were experienced SWAT team members. Of this group, 50 candidates were selected to continue to <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E

50|$|Agent {{training}} often includes {{techniques of}} tradecraft such as clandestine communications, including cryptography, {{the use of}} one-time pads, the construction of concealment devices, and the employment of dead drops. Other elements of tradecraft include elicitation, surveillance and countersurveillance, photography and the emplacement of audio devices, sensors, or other transmitters. Case officers generally train agents one at a time, in isolation, including only those elements of tradecraft needed to penetrate the target at hand. Case officers will also teach agents how to develop cover for status, and cover for action, meaning how to establish credible pretexts for their presence and behavior while engaged in collection activities. A well-trained and competent agent can conduct his or her clandestine tasks while under close surveillance, and still evade detection. <b>More</b> <b>advanced</b> agent <b>training</b> can include resistance to interrogation.|$|R
50|$|Automatic train {{protection}} (ATP) {{is a much}} <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> form of <b>Train</b> Stop, which can regulate the speed of trains in many more situations other than at a stop signal. ATP supervises speed restrictions and distance to danger points. An ATP does take into account individual train characteristics such as brake performance. Thus, the ATP determines when brakes should be applied {{in order to stop}} the train before getting beyond the danger point. In the UK, {{only a small percentage of}} trains (First Great Western and Chiltern Railways) are fitted with this equipment.|$|R
