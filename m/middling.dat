50|$|A {{progressive}} miller, John Sidney imported three {{barrels of}} Red Fife wheat from Canada; the Archibalds developed the seed into the No. 1 hard spring wheat that revolutionized farming in Minnesota. Before 1860, the wheat {{grown in the}} United States was soft winter wheat, but spring wheat was better suited to the soil. What initially prevented spring wheat from wide adoption was its characteristic flinty quality and high <b>middlings</b> content. Under the low grinding process used before 1870, the wheat's hardness caused the mash to heat and its thin brittle bran filled the flour with specks that discolored the flour. To fix this issue, millstones in their mills were run at a lower speed and were set higher so as to simply crack the kernel at the first grinding. It was then put through several grindings. The purpose was to make <b>middlings</b> the most valuable part of the product, as gluten {{was found in the}} <b>middlings</b> and provided nutrition and gave bread its rising quality. The Archibalds' mills would later be among the first to adopt the <b>middlings</b> purifier, developed in Minneapolis, which allowed for large scale production of the higher gluten flour.|$|R

Pigs fed diets containing 20 % wheat <b>middlings</b> had decreased (P < 0. 01) final BW; while there was a numerical increase in final BW (P < 0. 09) as dietary fat was increased.

Additionally, pigs fed added fat had a tendency for increased backfat depth (linear; P < 0. 06) and had a linear increase (P < 0. 01) in jowl iodine value. For economics, adding 20 % wheat <b>middlings</b> to the diet decreased (P < 0. 001) feed cost per pig and feed cost per lb gain; however, total revenue was also reduced (P < 0. 003), resulting in a numeric decrease (P = 0. 13) in income over feed cost (IOFC).

Therefore, wheat <b>middlings</b> can be used as an alternative ingredient in swine diets to decrease feed cost and feed cost per lb of gain, but in this study the reduced performance resulted in less revenue and lower profitability...|$|R
