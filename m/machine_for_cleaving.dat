40|$|ADAMTS- 2 is an {{extracellular}} metalloproteinase responsible <b>for</b> <b>cleaving</b> the N-propeptides of procollagens I–III; {{an activity}} {{necessary for the}} formation of collagenous ECM (extracellular matrix). The four TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) regulate the activities of matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in degrading ECM components.

In the first study, the reactivities of metal-alkoxide and metal-hydroxide nucleophiles are compared <b>for</b> <b>cleaving</b> phosphate diesters. In the second study, the reactivity of a dinuclear metal complex is compared to a mononuclear metal complex for hydrolyzing RNA. Copper(II) complexes of bis(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine (Cu(II) bpa), N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) bis(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine (Cu(II) hebpa) and N-(3 -hydroxypropyl) bis(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine (Cu(II) hpbpa) have been synthesized and their reactivities and mechanisms <b>for</b> <b>cleaving</b> bis(2, 4 -dinitrophenyl) phosphate (BDNPP) have been investigated. Cu(II) hpbpa is observed {{to be the most}} reactive (k = 7. 2 $ times$ 10 $ sp{- 1 }$ M$ sp{- 1 }$ s$ sp{- 1 }$ at 25 $ sp circ$C, pH 8. 8) <b>for</b> <b>cleaving</b> BDNPP followed by Cu(II) bpa (k = 2. 0 $ times$ 10 $ sp{- 2 }$ M$ sp{- 1 }$ s$ sp{- 1 }$) and Cu(II) hebpa (k = 2. 0 $ times$ 10 $ sp{- 2 }$ s$ sp{- 1 }$). HPLC product analyses indicated that Cu(II) hpbpa cleaves BDNPP mostly through transesterification while the complexes Cu(II) bpa and Cu(II) hebpa cleave BDNPP predominantly by hydrolysis. The differences in the mechanisms and the reactivities are explained in terms of the differences in the structures of the three copper(II) complexes. Copper(II) complexes of 1, 8 -bis(1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononyl-N-methyl) naphthalene (tntn), 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (tacn), and N-benzyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (btacn) have been prepared and their reactivities compared <b>for</b> <b>cleaving</b> RNA. The novel dinuclear copper(II) complex, Cu(II) $ sb 2 $tntn, is observed to be 200 - 500 fold faster per metal center than the mononuclear copper(II) complexes, Cu(II) tacn and Cu(II) btacn, <b>for</b> <b>cleaving</b> a diribonucleotide, ApA, and its cyclic phosphate intermediate, $ 2 sp prime 3 sp prime$-cAMP. Cu(II) $ sb 2 $tntn (2. 0 mM) reduces the half life of ApA (0. 05 mM) to 50 minutes (pH 6, 50 $ sp circ$C); this represents a rate acceleration of approximately 10 $ sp 5 $ fold over the background hydroxide rate. The half life of $ 2 sp prime 3 sp prime$-cAMP (0. 05 mM) is decreased to 4 minutes in the presence of Cu(II) $ sb 2 $tntn (2. 0 mM, pH 6, 25 $ sp circ$C); this represents a rate acceleration of about 10 $ sp 8 $ fold over the background hydroxide rate...|$|R

Methods: The human corneal endothelial cell line HCEC- 12 was cultured in five different media: HCEC growth medium F 99, standard corneal organ culture medium MEM+ 2 % FCS, MEM+ 5 % FCS, and humanised, serum-free medium Endothelial-SFM (with and without antibiotics). Part of the cells were treated with 0. 5 µmol/l staurosporine and examined for signs of apoptosis by assessing mitochondrial membrane polarisation state (intravital JC- 1 staining), YO-PRO- 1 and propidium iodide staining, determining fragmentation of nuclei by sub-G 1 DNA content, immunocytochemistry <b>for</b> <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 3, cleaved caspase- 8, Bax, Bcl- 2, and western blotting <b>for</b> <b>cleaved</b> caspase- 3 and cleaved PARP.

Possible reasons for their loss include the elimination of non-viable genetic constitutions arising through meiosis, however, the precise relationship between meiotic stages and prenatal apoptosis of oocytes remains elusive.

Results Microspreads of fetal and neonatal ovarian cells underwent immunocytochemistry for meiosis- and apoptosis-related markers.
