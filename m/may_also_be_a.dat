5|$|Individuals with neuroacanthocytosis {{also often}} suffer from parkinsonism, the {{uncontrolled}} slowness of movements, and dystonia, abnormal body postures.

Seizures <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> symptom of neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E

5|$|Bridging the {{gap between}} self-expressive {{piercing}} and spiritual piercing, modern primitives use piercing {{and other forms of}} body modification as a way of ritually reconnecting with themselves and society, which according to Musafar once used piercing as a culturally binding ritual.

5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} is in a binary star system and is accreting matter from its companion, {{a variety of}} {{phenomena}} may occur, including novae and Type Ia supernovae. It <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> super-soft x-ray source if {{it is able to}} take material from its companion fast enough to sustain fusion on its surface. A close binary system of two white dwarfs can radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves, causing their mutual orbit to steadily shrink until the stars merge.|$|E
5|$|Possible ceratopsians {{from the}} Southern Hemisphere include the Australian Serendipaceratops, known from an ulna, and Notoceratops from Argentina is known {{from a single}} toothless jaw (which has been lost). Craspedodon from the Late Cretaceous (Santonian) of Belgium <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> ceratopsian, {{specifically}} a neoceratopsian closer to ceratopsoidea than protoceratopsidae. Possible leptoceratopsid remains have also been described from the early Campanian of Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the penis is flaccid. Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin are that it serves to protect the penis as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves sexual pleasure. The foreskin <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment to the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. There <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E

Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean. In Chile, the Cetacean Conservation Center, {{with support from the}} Chilean Navy, is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of Chiloe Island in the Gulf of Corcovado (Chilo√© National Park), where 326 blue whales were spotted in 2007. In this regions, it is normal for blue whales to enter Fiords. Whales also reach southern Los Lagos, such as off Caleta Zorra, live along with other rorquals.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> focus of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Music is an {{important}} part of education in the United States, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band. Music <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of theatrical productions put on by a school's drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games, a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa's bands in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E

5|$|The {{curriculum}} emphasizes writing; {{students are}} required to complete a semester project each term on a topic chosen in conjunction with an advisor, and are required to complete a research paper during their third year. All students must pass a basic-studies comprehensive examination to register for upper-level courses, and at least one area-studies comprehensive examination (usually in their area of concentration) to graduate. A senior thesis is required of all students. Usually an analytic or expository essay, it <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> piece of original fiction, poetry, a performance or work of visual art. Students are encouraged to present their theses orally, and the public is invited to the presentations.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by {{depleting}} CD4+ T cells. This {{weakens the}} immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases. During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of {{the immune system}} to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.|$|E
