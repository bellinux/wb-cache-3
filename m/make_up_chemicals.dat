Crustaceans gather chemical information from distant odor sources by means of specialized chemosensory sensilla called aesthetascs located on the antennules (Heimann, 1984; Hallberg et al., 1993). Successful chemoreception requires that the odorant molecules that <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the <b>chemical</b> signal be transported to the aesthetasc surface.

Due to traditional views and societal norms, women struggle to remain in their careers or to move up in the workplace. Substantially more women are enrolled in science-based fields such as pharmacy and biology than in mathematics and physics. Within engineering, statistics vary based on the specific engineering discipline; women <b>make</b> <b>up</b> 78% of <b>chemical</b> engineering students but only 5% of mechanical engineering students. As of 2005, out of 35,564 researchers in science, technology, and engineering, 10,874 or 31% were female.|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the ionization energies of electrons in both valence band and core orbitals. As core vacancies are the initial states for X-ray emission, a knowledge of their energies for all atoms in a mineral enables all the X-ray spectra to be placed on a common energy scale. X-ray spectra re atom specific and are governed by the dipole selection rule. Thus the individual bonding roles of the different atoms are revealed by the fine structure of valence X-ray peaks (i. e. peaks which result from electron transitions between valence band orbitals and core vacancies). The juxtaposition of such spectra enables the composition of the molecular orbitals that <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the <b>chemical</b> bonds of a mineral to be determined. Examples of this approach to the direct determination of electronic structure are given for silica, forsterite, brucite, and pyrite. Multi-electron effects and developments involving anisotropic X-ray emission from single crystals are also discussed.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The identification of hazards in chemical plants has become increasingly important. Not only have chemical plants become larger and more complex, but some countries now have regulations requiring {{that some form of}} formal hazard identification be carried out. With the increased speed of many other parts of the design process, hazard identification is becoming the log-jam in attempts to speed up the design of new plants still further. One of the most popular techniques for hazard identification is a hazard and operability study (HAZOP), in which a group of people attempt to identify creatively the possible hazards by applying a methodical process whereby the effect of deviations to every process variable is considered in every part of the plant. The aim of this thesis is to explore methods of improving hazard identification through the development of the HAZOP technique. This thesis examines possible improvements that can be made through a better understanding of activities and how they are carried out in HAZOP, discusses the possibilities of automated hazard identification based on HAZOP, and in particular presents a novel, modular HAZOP methodology. Modular HAZOP is based around identifying the modules that <b>make</b> <b>up</b> a <b>chemical</b> plant and then using previously generated HAZOP results associated with each of the modules. The hazards associated with these modules will therefore be known and rules are required to deal with the interconnections between modules. Application of these rules determines any additional hazards that might arise from the interconnection of modules. A number of important principles have been identified including, the level of decomposition required, the use of interchangeable sub-modules within modules, the fact that the majority of cause-consequence scenarios exist in adjacent modules, and the categorisation of locally and remotely propagated effects. These provide for a procedure which is adaptable to different plant configurations, but can also be quickly and easily applied. The latter principles enable the simpler fault paths, which <b>make</b> <b>up</b> most of the cause-consequence scenarios, to be identified quickly, leaving a much reduced number of fault paths which require a more thorough analysis...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} new thermodynamic {{paradigm of}} chemical equilibrium, setting forth comprehensive basics of Discrete Thermodynamics of Chemical Equilibria (DTd). Along with previous results {{by the author}} during the last decade, this work contains also some new developments of DTd. Based on the Onsager's constitutive equations, reformulated by the author thermodynamic affinity and reaction extent, and Le Chatelier's principle, DTd brings forward a notion of chemical equilibrium as a balance of internal and external thermodynamic forces (TdF), acting against a chemical system. Basic expression of DTd is the chemical system logistic map of thermodynamic states that ties together energetic characteristics of chemical reaction, occurring in the system, the system shift from "true" thermodynamic equilibrium (TdE), and causing that shift external thermodynamic forces. Solutions to the basic map are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams in coordinates "shift from TdE - growth factor (or TdF) "; points, corresponding to the system thermodynamic states, are dwelling on its branches. The diagrams feature three typical areas: true thermodynamic equilibrium and open equilibrium along the thermodynamic branch before the threshold of its stability, i. e. bifurcation point, and bifurcation area with bistability and chaotic oscillations after the point. The set of solutions <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> the <b>chemical</b> system domain of states. The new paradigm complies with the correspondence principle: in isolated chemical system external TdF vanish, and the basic map turns into traditional expression of chemical equilibrium via thermodynamic affinity. The theory binds together classical and contemporary thermodynamics of chemical equilibria on a unique conceptual basis. The paper is essentially reworked and refocused version of the earlier preprint on the DTd basics, supplemented with new results.
