40|$|Motion of {{ferroelectric}} domain walls greatly {{contributes to the}} macroscopic dielectric and piezoelectric response of ferroelectric materials. The domain wall motion through the ferroelectric material is however hindered by pinning on crystal defects which substantially reduces these contributions. Here, using thermodynamic models based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, we find a relation between microscopic reversible motion of non-ferroelastic 180 -degree domain walls interacting with a periodic array of pinning centers and the nonlinear macroscopic permittivity. We show, that the reversible motion of domain walls can be split into two basic modes. First, the bending of a domain wall between pinning centers, and, second, the uniform movement of domain wall plane. We show that their respective contributions may change when the distribution of pinning centers is rearranged during the <b>material</b> <b>aging.</b> We demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to indicate which mechanism of the domain wall motion is affected during <b>material</b> <b>aging.</b> This allows to judge whether the defects only homogeneously accumulate at domain walls or prefer to align in certain directions inside the domain wall plane. We suggest that this information can be obtained using simple macroscopic dielectric measurements and a proper analysis of the nonlinear response. Our results may therefore serve as a simple and useful tool to obtain details on domain wall pinning in an aging process. Comment: Accepted in Phys Rev...|$|E

The assessment of <b>material</b> <b>ageing</b> requires narmally extensive destructive testing by using different kinds of testing and samples. One example is the use of the Charpy impact technique. The possibility to use of Non Destructive Techniques, NDT, for assessing <b>material</b> <b>ageing</b> is very promising and needs further investigation, assessment and qualification. The possibility to qualify Non Destructive Techniques, NDT, at least for some of the above mentioned ageing cases, would make the studies on ageing and the relative assessment much easier and cheaper, saving a lot o f money and resources in Europe. Futhermore, it would make it possible to assess on site various components that now-a-days can only be assessed either by calculation or by means of very expensive sample gaining techniques.
