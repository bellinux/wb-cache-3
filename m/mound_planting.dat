Apart from this, the department is also considering allocation of [...] 5 million for conducting research projects on the marshland, about [...] 6 million towards a bird census, a [...] boardwalk path in a period of 3 years at a cost of [...] 30 million, watchtowers at two places in a period of 2 years at a cost of [...] 2 million, and a wetland centre at a cost of [...] 4 million.

40|$|This {{review was}} {{initiated}} by the Herbert Cane Productivity Services (HCPSL) limited {{in order to identify}} the major reasons for highly variable productivity in recent years. The review encompassed the collation and analysis of productivity data held by HCPSL, interpretation of the analyses, and interviews with growers. In general the outcomes clearly indicated that water management (seasonal conditions, drainage, water logging), various aspects of harvesting (groups too big, harvesting too fast, not enough adjustment for seasonal conditions/ geographic harvesting, cane loss) and season length (the harvest season being too long) were the main factors influencing productivity in the Herbert. Suggestions are made as to how these issues may be addressed. Although it is acknowledged that varieties {{are an important part of}} any production system it is demonstrated that their influence on the large season to season variability in productivity is relatively minor. The following recommendations are made: Recommendation 1 : The large amount of variety performance data on different soil types in different seasons held by HCPSL warrants collation and analysis in order to objectively assess whether different varieties are suited to different soil types and regions. Recommendation 2 : The importance of seasonal conditions in November as they affect the subsequent crop needs to be fully appreciated and strategies adopted to minimise their impact. Recommendation 3 : The difference in climatic regimes between the Ingham Line area (and Upper Stone) and other areas needs to be recognised and if necessary different production strategies put in place. Recommendation 4 : The most suitable varieties for Ingham Line may well be different to those for other areas and this should be taken into account within the variety evaluation program Recommendation 5 : Emphasis should be placed on the development of <b>mound</b> <b>planting</b> for the wetter areas. Recommendation 6 : The analysis of harvesting losses in the current crop and harvesting practices on the productivity of the next crop needs to be continued and expanded. It is a critical area of investigation. Recommendation 7 : The harvest season should be adjusted to aim for the crushing to finish by the end of October with the current practice of setting a starting date to be replaced by setting a finishing date. This recommendation will obviously require an earlier starting date and probably staggered harvesting based on geographical and equity considerations but should not be dismissed out of hand...|$|E
40|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War, the Department of Energy (Department) {{has greatly}} reduced the {{production}} of nuclear weapons and redirected the capabilities and focus of the weapons complex. As part of this redirection, the <b>Mound</b> <b>Plant</b> was transferred from a Defense Program site to an Environmental Management site with emphasis on accelerated cleanup and transition of facilities and personal property to the local community. This audit was initiated to determine if the shutdown and transition of the <b>Mound</b> <b>Plant</b> was progressing effectively and efficiently. The Department prepared a Nonnuclear Consolidation Plan (NCP) designed to reduce its costs of operation by closing and consolidating facilities. In contrast to the goal of the NCP, the Department plans to keep a portion of the <b>Mound</b> <b>Plant</b> open solely to perform work for other Federal agencies. Specifically, the Department has decided to continue assembling and testing isotopic heat sources and radioisotope thermoelectric generators (HS/RTG) at the <b>Mound</b> <b>Plant</b> despite the transfer or planned transfer of all other production operations. The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology decided to continue its HS/RTG operations at the <b>Mound</b> <b>Plant</b> without adequately considering the overall economic goals of the Department. As a result, the Department may not achieve the savings envisioned by the NCP. Also, the Department may incur between $ 4 million and $ 8. 5 million more than necessary each year to continue its HS/RTG operations at the <b>Mound</b> <b>Plant.</b> Additionally, if the HS/RTG operations stay at the <b>Mound</b> <b>Plant,</b> the Department will spend more than $ 3 million to consolidate these operations into one location...|$|R

40|$|Fine-scale spatial {{heterogeneity}} influences {{biodiversity and}} ecosystem productivity at many scales. In savanna systems, Macrotermes termites, through forming spatially explicit mounds with unique woody plant assemblages, emerge as important sources of such heterogeneity. Despite a growing consensus regarding {{the importance of}} functional diversity (FD) to ecosystem processes, no study has quantified how termite <b>mounds</b> affect woody <b>plant</b> FD. We address whether termite mounds alter the distribution of functional traits, and increase FD of woody plant communities within Africa's largest savanna woodland, the 2. 7 million km 2 miombo system. Using plant traits that change according to soil resources (for example, water and nutrients), and disturbance (for example, fire and elephant herbivory), we identified response functional groups and compared relative representation of these groups between mound and matrix habitats. We also asked whether mound and matrix habitats differed in their contribution to FD within the system. Although species representing most functional groups were found in both mound and matrix habitats, relative abundance of functional groups differed between mound and matrix. <b>Mound</b> <b>plant</b> assemblages had greater response diversity to soil resources than matrix plots, {{but there was no}} difference in response diversity to disturbance. High trait values on mounds included tree height, leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, and palatability. Species with root ectomycorrhizae dominated the matrix. In conclusion, these small patches of nutrient-enriched substrate emerge as drivers of FD in above-ground woody plant communities...|$|R
