Since the planar technology, commonly PCB layers, limits the <b>maximum</b> <b>layer</b> <b>thickness,</b> the use {{of parallel}} windings is usually {{required in order to}} reduce the current density and losses. The distribution of the current through each parallel winding depends on the winding positioning and the frequency effects. This effect is especially important in gapped inductors, because the energy stored in the gap region determines the current distribution through the windings. Therefore, the winding positioning is a critical task in order to obtain a balanced current distribution through all the parallel winding...|$|E
40|$|S-phase can {{be created}} in {{austenitic}} stainless steels by low-temperature thermochemical treatments, which greatly enhanced their hardness, wear resistance and fatigue properties because of the supersaturation by interstitials. One of the technological challenges associated with S-phase surface engineering is that the <b>maximum</b> <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> of the S-phase layers is very thin. The thickness of S-phase is restricted by its metastability and precipitation will occur {{as a result of}} prolonged treatment. In this project, the effect of in situ tensile stress on the formation of carbon S-phase on 316 L austenitic stainless steel was investigated and it was demonstrated that the tensile stress thickened the S-phase layer by promoting the carbon diffusion in austenitic substrate. However, metastable carbides precipitated when applied tensile stress exceeded 40 MPa. The thermo-mechanical stability of carbon S-phase was studied by creeping (tensile stress) and HIPping (compressive stress) tests. The results showed that the compressive stress retard the decomposition of S-phase by impeding the carbon diffusion; on the other hand, tensile stress promoted the carbon diffusion. The residual compressive and shear stresses in carbon S-phase was measured be 2. 2 GPa and 132 MPa. The wear behaviour of carbon S-phase was studied by dry and oil lubricated reciprocating wear. ...|$|E

The method {{has been used}} industrially since 1924 {{and is one of}} the most important and widely used surface finishing techniques. Ban of chromium compounds with chromium in the oxidation state VI (eg. CrO 4 -) in cars and in old electrical devices was implemented by the European Union. In recent years, substantial efforts were undertaken in order to replace corrosion protection systems on the basis of chromium(VI) -containing connections by other procedures. Usually chromium(VI) starting materials are used during the deposition of chromium layers in galvanic processes. Modern electrolytes are available, which allow the deposition of thin and decorative chromium layers in galvanic processes. Nevertheless, the deposition is limited to a <b>maximum</b> <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> of 10 µm and a corresponding hardness of 900 HV. This dissertation identifies the factors which influence the outcome of chrome plating with chromium(III) electrolytes. These factors are then explored further with the help of experiments, allowing conclusions to be drawn on the conditions required for successful application of chromium(III) electrolytes in hard chrome plating. Practical issues tackled include membrane technologies, chemical buffer systems, pH regulation and complexing agents. In this lecture we present a procedure, which offers the possibility to deposit hard and thick chromium layers from trivalent chrome electrolytes. It offers an approach of an efficient energy use during the layer production and avoids the contact of construction units and workers with chromium(VI) compounds during the coating process...|$|E

Both measurements show similar depressed freezing and melting points due to the Gibb-Thomson effect. The neutron diffraction measurements for fully filled pores show, in addition to cubic and hexagonal crystalline ice, {{the presence of a}} disordered water/ice component extending a further 50 - 80 K, down to around or below 200 K. NMR relaxation measurements over the same temperature range show a free induction decay that is partly Gaussian and characteristic of brittle ice but that also exhibits a longer exponential relaxation component.

The behaviour of these films was studied by the Essential Work of Fracture (EWF) method.

In the case of PET films, a nano-layer of polystyrene (PS) was laid on top of the PET matrix film with a <b>maximum</b> <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> of 600 nm and a minimum of < 20 nm. DDENT (deeply double edge notched tension) specimens were cut and tested in tension for the determination of the specific essential work of fracture.

It was shown that a mere 50 nm of PS thick layer on the PET substrate can provide some toughness improvement (ca. 20 %) whereas the sPP/montmorillonite systems has exhibited a drastic 100 % of EWF toughness improvement at 1 wt% of nano- filler content. Finally, a semi-empirical model for the prediction of the residual mechanical properties of the notched specimens has been successfully applied in {{the present study}}.

The {{formation}} of the Subtropical Mode Waters (STMW) in the South Atlantic, part of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), by the subduction process, transferring mixed layer fluid into the permanent thermocline, is investigated using results of numerical simulations with the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM).

The peculiarity of the measurement scheme is the applicationofhigh-resolution camera as a radiation detector and information storage as an images package. Researches allowed receivingexperimental data in the form of ink ATR spectra arrayfor studied areas of layer surface in a given spectral range. Main Results. The estimation of ink layer thickness was done, that gives the possibilityto visualize its distribution over the surface using three-dimensional modeling capabilities.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical study {{is carried out}} {{of the flow of}} granular material in cylinders with different cross-sectional shapes rotated about their axes. The flow of particles in such geometries is confined to a shallow layer at the free surface. The length and thickness of the layer shrink and expand periodically with rotation of the cylinder, resulting in chaotic advection and improved mixing of passive tracers. Experimental results obtained by flow visualization are reported for quasi-two-dimensional mixers half filled with glass beads. A depth-averaged flow model to predict the time-varying layer thickness profile is presented, along with a perturbation solution in terms of a small parameter k, which is the ratio of the <b>maximum</b> <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> to the half length of the layer (L), at the cross-section orientation when the length is minimum. To the lowest order [O(k(0)) ], the model predicts that the layer profiles scaled with L(theta) at different mixer orientation angles (theta) are identical and the same as that for a circle. The measured layer thickness profiles averaged over different orientations of noncircular mixers match reasonably well with the theory, but the standard deviations are larger for the noncircular cylinders compared to the circle. The O(k) perturbation solution and the full theory both predict that the scaled layer thickness varies periodically; the deviations are proportional to the rate of change of the length with orientation. The perturbation solution gives results close to those from the numerical solution except at cylinder orientations when the length of the flowing layer changes sharply. The measured variation of the scaled midlayer thickness with orientation for all geometries is well predicted by the theory...|$|E

The definitive version is available at: [URL] To investigate the effects of the infra-red power level on sintering behaviour in the High Speed Sintering process. Design/methodology/approach: Single-layer parts were produced using the High Speed Sintering process, {{in order to determine the}} effect of the infra-red power level on the maximum achievable layer thickness, and the degree of sintering. The parts were examined using both optical microscopy and contact methods. Findings: Whilst it was expected that an increase in the infra-red lamp powder might allow an increase in the depth of sintering that could be achieved, as a result of increased thermal transfer through the powder, results in fact indicated that there is a <b>maximum</b> <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> that can be achieved, as a result of part shrinkage in the z direction. Optical microscopy images have shown that a greater degree of sintering occurs at higher power levels, which would be expected to correspond to an improvement in the mechanical properties of the parts produced. These images also indicate that the RAM forms in small ‘islands’ on the powder bed surface. However, these islands begin to merge as sintering progresses, to a greater degree as the infra-red lamp power is increased. Research limitations/implications: These results are based only on single layer parts. Further work will examine the sintering characteristics of multiple layer parts. Practical implications: Results have shown that, whilst it is not possible to increase the achievable layer thickness of the parts produced by modifying the infra-red lamp power, the degree of sintering can be improved greatly by increasing the power. Originality/value: High Speed Sintering is an entirely new process which is currently still under development; the results presented here will directly impact the direction of further development and research into this process...|$|E

40|$|Clouds {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{uncertainties}} in climate change predictions caused by their complex structure and dynamics. Numerous cloud processes are acting from cloud-scale down to mm-scale and interplay with each other as well as with atmospheric processes. This complexity {{on the one hand and}} the high spatial resolution required to analyse the small scale processes on the other hand cause difficulties in cloud research. One important and until now insufficiently understood process in cloud microphysics is the entrainment process. It defines the turbulent transport of sub-saturated environmental air into the cloud region. Subsequent mixing leads to the evaporation of cloud droplets resulting in negatively buoyant air at cloud edge. One distinguishes between two types of entrainment processes: cloud top and lateral entrainment. While the first type is mostly detected at the top of stratiform clouds, lateral entrainment plays an important role for the dynamics of cumulus clouds. Within in this thesis, highly-resolved measurements with a resolution down to the centimeter scale performed with the helicopter-borne measurement payload ACTOS (Airborne Cloud Turbulence Observation System) are used to study both types of entrainment processes. Shear-induced cloud top entrainment leads to a turbulent inversion layer (TIL) atop of a stratocumulus layer consisting of clear air. The TIL seems to be coupled with the underlying cloud layer due to the turbulence intensity. With increasing thickness of the TIL the turbulence inside is damped monotonically leading to a <b>maximum</b> <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> and inhibiting direct mixing between cloud top and free troposphere. At the edges of shallow trade wind cumuli, shear-induced lateral entrainment generates a subsiding shell. Its evolution is analysed based on detailed measurements in continuously developing shallow cumuli. With the cloud evolution, the subsiding shell grows at the expense of the cloud core region and an increasing downdraft velocity is observed within this region. These observations are confirmed with the simulation of an idealised subsiding shell. The results present unique observations at the edges of clouds and are an appreciable progress in cloud research which decisively influence future research...|$|E

MEIS can provide high resolution compositional and structural information as a function of depth in the near surface region (0 – 250 Å); these parameters are inextricably linked with the magnetic properties exhibited by materials of this type. Amongst the information available from MEIS is the accurate determination of the layer spacings, structural information from individual layers (even at thicknesses close to a monolayer), and high sensitivity to disorder in the layers. MEIS therefore provides additional information above that provided by in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction monitoring during growth and ex situ x-ray diffraction measurements so that it re{{presents an}} ideal complementary technique for the analysis of thin-film magnetic multilayer materials of this type. An Au/Fe multilayer sample of a type previously shown to exhibit giant magnetoresistance (GMR) was analyzed. Individual gold layers were clearly resolved and a measurement of the bilayer spacing obtained; this parameter determines the magnitude of the exchange coupling and GMR. Au/Fe/Au trilayer samples grown on both MgO(100) and sapphire(112 ¯ 0) substrates were also analyzed for a series of Fe layer thicknesses between 2 and 16 Å. The MgO(100) grown samples showed unusually high second-layer Au signal consistent with atomic layer spacings in the Fe layers that lead to enhanced illumination of the second-layer Au. This effect could be modeled using bcc(100) layer spacings thus confirming the structure to be bcc(100) Fe between fcc(100) Au layers. In the sapphire-grown samples, twinned fcc(111) structure was observed in the individually resolved Au and Fe layers. The amplitude of the Fe blocking features was reduced with increasing Fe layer thickness indicating a reduction in crystallinity until for the highest thickness there was little indication of structure within the layer.

40|$|Rare-earth-ion doped KY(WO 4) 2 (hereafter KYW:RE) is a {{promising}} material for novel solid-state lasers. Its low laser threshold, high laser efficiency, and third-order nonlinear effects have stimulated research towards miniaturized thin-film waveguide lasers and amplifiers. A method of liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) to produce KYW:RE thin layers with vertical substrate dipping has been developed. Undoped KYW crystals having laser-grade polished (010) faces {{served as the}} substrates. Two solvents, the tungstate K 2 W 2 O 7 and the chloride NaCl–KCl–CsCl, were tested. The K 2 W 2 O 7 solvent contains no impurity ions and is a good solvent for KYW, which is the only stable phase to be crystallized from the solution. The substrate position and rotation rate were optimized by numerical simulation of liquid flow in the crucible in order to obtain uniform layer thickness. A crystallization rate of 1. 2 mg K- 1 g- 1 at the growth temperature of 900 °C results in high-quality layers with thickness up to 100 µm and RE 3 + concentrations ranging from 0. 2 to 3 mol% with respect to Y 3 +. Dipping the substrate at 0. 1 – 0. 3 K above the saturation point helps to eliminate surface defects and assure a defect-free interface. An undoped overlay of KYW can subsequently be grown on KYW:RE layers to obtain buried structures. The chloride NaCl–KCl–CsCl solvent with its melting point of 480 °C allows epitaxial growth at temperatures as low as 520 °C, which can reduce thermal stress in heavily RE-doped layers. However, the LPE is complicated by the formation of parasitic phases and pronounced 3 D island nucleation, which limit the <b>maximum</b> <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> to approx. 10 µm. The original concept of microchannel epitaxy (MCE) has been applied {{for the first time to}} produce channel structures with an oxide material. KYW:RE ribs, 40 - 200 µm wide and 3 - 20 µm high, can be grown from the K 2 W 2 O 7 solvent on KYW substrates with a patterned gold or platinum mask deposited on the substrate surface. Surface and buried planar layers as well as channels of KYW:RE have been tested as optical waveguides. End-coupling and propagation of laser light at 633 nm or pumping at 981 nm results in excellent passive (633 nm) or active (e. g. 1030 -nm Yb 3 + fluorescence) waveguiding performance with propagation losses of only 0. 1 - 0. 2 dB cm- 1. Continuous-wave (CW) lasing in both surface and buried KYW:Yb planar waveguides has been demonstrated at 1025 nm in the fundamental mode.

40|$|AbstractUntil recently, {{generating}} {{clouds of}} microbubbles {{was a relatively}} expensive proposition, with the smallest bubbles requiring high energy density from either the saturation–nucleation mechanism or Venturi effect. Due to the expense of processing with microbubbles, exploration of the acceleration effects of microbubbles for physico-chemical processes are largely unstudied, particularly those that are combined effects. In this paper, the trade-off between heat transfer and evaporation on the microbubble interface are explored, largely by computational modelling but supported by some experimental evidence. The hypothesis is that both processes are inherently transient, but that during short residence times, vaporization is favoured, while at longer residence times, sensible heat transfer dominates and results in re-condensation of the initially vaporized liquid. The computational model address how thin a <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> {{will result in the}} maximum absolute vaporization, after which sensible heat transfer condenses the vapour as the bubble cools. This <b>maximum</b> vaporization <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> is estimated to be a few hundred microns, on the order of a few microbubble diameters at most. If the maximum vaporization estimate and the contact time necessary to achieve it are accurately estimated, these are engineering design features needed to design a vaporizing system to achieve maximum removal of vapour with minimum heat transfer.

Future climate trends will promote significant changes of the active layer regime and permafrost distribution, and therefore a better characterization of present-day state is needed. With this purpose, this research focuses on Ulu Peninsula (James Ross Island) and Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island), located {{in the area of}} continuous and discontinuous permafrost in the eastern and western sides of the AP, respectively. Air and ground temperatures in as low as 80 cm below surface of the ground were monitored between January and December 2014. There is a high correlation between air temperatures on both sites (r= 0. 74). The mean annual temperature in Ulu Peninsula was - 7. 9 ºC, while in Byers Peninsula was - 2. 6 ºC. The lower air temperatures in Ulu Peninsula are also reflected in ground temperatures, which were between 4. 9 (5 cm) and 5. 9 ºC (75 / 80 cm) lower. The <b>maximum</b> active <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> observed during the study period was 52 cm in Ulu Peninsula and 85 cm in Byers Peninsula. Besides climate, soil characteristics, topography and snow cover are the main factors controlling the ground thermal regime in both areas. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: When a {{laser beam}} scans once {{across the surface of}} a {{metallic}} powder bed, the resulting track may be continuous with a crescent or an elliptic cross-section, irregularly broken, balled or only partially melted. This paper reports what laser powers and scan speeds lead to what types of track, for a CO 2 laser beam focused to 0. 55 mm and 1. 1 mm diameters, scanning over beds made from M 2 and H 13 tool steel and 314 S-HC stainless steel powders. Beds have been made with particle size ranges from 300 mm to 150 mm, from 150 mm to 75 mm, from 75 mm to 38 mm, and less than 38 mm. Measurements are also reported of bed physical properties that are used in a finite element model to predict melt pool dimensions and temperatures. Boundaries between regions of different track formation are explained in terms of melt surface temperature gradients, melt pool length–diameter ratio instabilities, and transitions from partial to complete melting. Implications for building metal parts in powder beds without supports are considered. The modelling is briefly extended to multi-track and multi-layer processing, to conclude that bonding by remelting between layers, while still maintaining control of the melt flow, places severe constraints on the <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>layer</b> <b>thickness...</b>|$|R
40|$|There are {{indications}} that the adsorption of water-soluble gases like NH 3 and SO 2 on a leaf surface may {{be compared with the}} dry deposition on a freely accessible water layer. The aim of our study was to quantify the thickness of the apparent water layer on the leaf surface. The thickness was calculated from NH 3 adsorption data on leaves. Also we performed weighing experiments with dried leaves of different plant species at relative air humidities of 20 and 95 % (at 20 oC), respectively. From the increase in weight the water film thickness was calculated. The thickness calculated from NH 3 adsorption data strongly depends on air humidity and varied from 10 m at low relative humidities to 100 m at high relative humidities. However, the <b>maximum</b> water <b>layer</b> <b>thicknesses</b> obtained for the dried leaves were much lower (8. 8 - 17. 9 m). We postulate that the cuticular membrane may behave as a ''valve'' between the inner and outer region of the leaf and that its permeability is controlled by the relative humidity of the air. This view may be a fundamental contribution to the representation of the mechanism of the dry deposition of gaseous compounds to the vegetation...|$|R

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] recently, generating clouds of microbubbles was a relatively expensive proposition, with the smallest bubbles requiring high energy density from either the saturation–nucleation mechanism or Venturi effect. Due to the expense of processing with microbubbles, exploration of the acceleration effects of microbubbles for physico-chemical processes are largely unstudied, particularly those that are combined effects. In this paper, the trade-off between heat transfer and evaporation on the microbubble interface are explored, largely by computational modelling but supported by some experimental evidence. The hypothesis is that both processes are inherently transient, but that during short residence times, vaporization is favoured, while at longer residence times, sensible heat transfer dominates and results in re-condensation of the initially vaporized liquid. The computational model address how thin a <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> will result in the maximum absolute vaporization, after which sensible heat transfer condenses the vapour as the bubble cools. This <b>maximum</b> vaporization <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> is estimated to be a few hundred microns, on the order of a few microbubble diameters at most. If the maximum vaporization estimate and the contact time necessary to achieve it are accurately estimated, these are engineering design features needed to design a vaporizing system to achieve maximum removal of vapour with minimum heat transfer. The modelling work presented here should be considered in light of the humidification experiments also conducted which showed the exit air at 100...|$|R
40|$|The biomechanics-based Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk {{assessment}} has gained considerable scientific and clinical momentum. However, such studies have mainly focused on information {{at a single}} time point, and {{little is known about}} how AAA properties change over time. Consequently, the present study explored how geometry, wall stress-related and blood flow-related biomechanical properties change during AAA expansion. Four patients with a total of 23 Computed Tomography-Angiography (CT-A) scans at different time points were analyzed. At each time point, patient-specific properties were extracted from (i) the reconstructed geometry, (ii) the computed wall stress at Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), and (iii) the computed blood flow velocity at standardized inflow and outflow conditions. Testing correlations between these parameters identified several nonintuitive dependencies. Most interestingly, the Peak Wall Rupture Index (PWRI) and the maximum Wall Shear Stress (WSS) independently predicted AAA volume growth. Similarly, Intra-luminal Thrombus (ILT) volume growth depended on both the maximum WSS and the ILT volume itself. In addition, ILT volume, ILT volume growth, and <b>maximum</b> ILT <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> correlated with PWRI as well as AAA volume growth. Consequently, a large ILT volume as well as fast increase of ILT volume over time may be a risk factor for AAA rupture. However, tailored clinical studies would be required to test this hypothesis and to clarify whether monitoring ILT development has any clinical benefit...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to investigate the effects of gamma radiation on the wear behavior of unirradiated and irradiated ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) against Ti- 6 Al- 4 V under dry and lubricated conditions at different applied loads. The UHMWPE specimens were exposed directly to nominal doses of 0, 25, 40, 50, and 100 kGy. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the worn surface of UHMWPE and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V was performed to understand the mechanism of wear involved between the contact surfaces during wear testing. From the wear test results, {{there were significant differences}} between the wear of unirradiated UHMWPE and UHMWPE irradiated at 25, 40, and 50 kGy under dry and lubricated conditions. SEM results for the worn surface of unirradiated and irradiated UHMWPE samples showed that dry and lubricated conditions affected the wear behavior of irradiated UHMWPE. Examination of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy counterface tested under dry conditions revealed that the <b>maximum</b> transfer <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> was as high as 22. 79 μm. In addition, the UHMWPE irradiated at 100 kGy resulted in a more continuous and adherent transfer film on the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V surface compared to the unirradiated sample under dry conditions. Under serum-lubricated conditions, the transfer film layer on the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy surface was thinner compared to under dry conditions...|$|R
40|$|In this study, Mn {{silicate}} (MnSiO 3) barrier layers {{were formed}} on thermally grown SiO 2 using both metallic Mn and oxidized Mn films, {{in order to}} investigate the role of oxygen in determining {{the extent of the}} interaction between the deposited Mn and the SiO 2 substrate. Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, {{it has been shown that}} a metallic Mn film with an approximate thickness of 1 nm cannot be fully converted to Mn silicate following vacuum annealing to 500 °C. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis suggests the <b>maximum</b> MnSiO 3 <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> obtainable using metallic Mn is ∼ 1. 7 nm. In contrast, a ∼ 1 nm partially oxidized Mn film can be fully converted to Mn silicate following thermal annealing to 400 °C, forming a MnSiO 3 layer with a measured thickness of 2. 6 nm. TEM analysis also clearly shows that MnSiO 3 growth results in a corresponding reduction in the SiO 2 <b>layer</b> <b>thickness.</b> It has also been shown that a fully oxidized Mn oxide thin film can be converted to Mn silicate, in the absence of metallic Mn. Based on these results it is suggested that the presence of Mn oxide species at the Mn/SiO 2 interface facilitates the conversion of SiO 2 to MnSiO 3, in agreement with previously published studies. © 2011 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|In melting and {{assimilation}} of a cylindrical shaped additive in an agitated hot melt bath {{during the process}} of preparation of cast iron and steel of different grades, an unavoidable step of transient conjugated conduction-controlled axisymmetric freezing and melting of the bath material onto the additive immediately after its dunking in bath occurs. Decreasing the time of completion of this step is of great significance for production cost reduction and increasing the productivity of such preparations. Its suitable mathematical model of lump-integral type is developed. Its nondimensional format indicates the dependence of this step upon independent nondimensional parameters- the bath temperature, θb the modified Biot number, Bim denoting the bath agitation, the property-ratio, B and the heat capacity-ratio, Cr of the melt bath-additive system, the Stefan number, St pertaining to the phase-change of the bath material. The model provides the closed-form expressions for both the growth of the frozen <b>layer</b> <b>thickness,</b> ξ onto the additive and the heat penetration depth, η in the additive. Both are functions of these parameters, but when they are transformed to the growth of the frozen <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> with respect to the heat capacity ratio per unit Stefan number; and the time per unit property-ratio, B, their expressions become only a function of single parameter, the conduction factor, Cof consisting of the parameters, B, Bim and θb. The closed-form expression for the growth of the maximum thickness of the frozen layer, its time of growth, the time of the freezing and melting; the heat penetration depth are also derived. When the heat penetration depth approaches the central axis of the cylindrical additive in case of the complete melting of the frozen layer developed Cof≤ 11 / 72. It is found that the decreasing Cof reduces both the time of this unavoidable step and the growth of the <b>maximum</b> frozen <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> and at Cof= 0, the frozen layer does not form leading to zero time for this step. If the bath is kept at the freezing temperature of the bath material, only freezing occurs. To validate the model, it is cast to resemble the freezing and melting of the bath material onto the plate shaped additive. The results are exactly the same as those of the plate...|$|R

Materials and Methods For single composite resin samples, 6 mm diameter and 4 mm thickness cylindrical samples were fabricated using Ceram-X mono (DENTSPLY DeTrey) and CIE L*a*b* values were measured with spectrophotometer. Same process was done for layering composite resin samples, making 3 dentinal shade samples, 4 mm thickness, for each shade using Ceram-X duo (DENTSPLY DeTrey) and enamel shade resins were layered in 2 mm thickness and CIE L*a*b* values were measured. These samples were ground to 0. 2 mm thickness each time, and CIE L*a*b* values were measured to 1 mm thickness of enamel shade resin. Results Color difference (ΔE*) between single and layering composite resin was 1. 37 minimum and 10. 53 <b>maximum</b> when <b>layering</b> <b>thicknesses</b> were between 1 mm and 2 mm and 6 out of 10 same shade groups suggested by manufacturer showed remarkable color difference at any thickness (ΔE* > 3. 3).
