Anti-inflammatory activity was measured against lung inflammatory cell influx induced by OVA inhalation in OVA-sensitised animals or by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure of non-sensitised animals. Airway function (sGaw) was measured over 24 h after OVA exposure. Airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled histamine and inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were recorded 24 h after OVA or LPS challenge. Histamine-induced bronchoconstriction was inhibited by inhaled <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> or salbutamol alone and in combination, they produced synergistic bronchoprotection.

Objectives: To assess the effects of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> therapy given to women in threatened preterm labour with the aim of preventing preterm birth and its sequelae. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (last searched 31 January 2014). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> as the only tocolytic, administered by any route, compared with either placebo, no treatment or alternative tocolytic therapy (not <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate)</b> to women considered to be in preterm labour. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and undertook data extraction independently. Main results: The 37 included trials (total of 3571 women and over 3600 babies) were generally of moderate to high risk of bias. Antenatal <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was compared with either placebo, no treatment, or a range of alternative tocolytic agents. For the primary outcome of giving birth within 48 hours after trial entry, no significant differences were seen between women who received <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and women who did not (whether placebo/no alternative tocolytic drug, betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, cox inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitors, or human chorionic gonadotropin) (19 trials, 1913 women). Similarly for the primary outcome of serious infant outcome, {{there were no significant differences}} between the infants exposed to <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and those not (whether placebo/no alternative tocolytic drug, betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, cox inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitors, human chorionic gonadotropin or various tocolytic drugs) (18 trials; 2187 babies). No trials reported the outcome of extremely preterm birth. In the seven trials that reported serious maternal outcomes, no events were recorded. In the group treated with <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> compared with women receiving antenatal placebo or no alternative tocolytic drug, a borderline increased risk of total death (fetal, neonatal, infant) was seen (risk ratio (RR) 4. 56, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 00 to 20. 86; two trials, 257 babies); none of the comparisons between <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and other classes of tocolytic drugs showed differences for this outcome (10 trials, 991 babies). The outcomes of neonatal and/or infant deaths and of fetal deaths did not show differences between <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and no <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> whether compared with placebo/no alternative tocolytic drug, or any specific class of tocolytic drug. For most of the other secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences between <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and the control groups for risk of preterm birth (except for a significantly lower risk with <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> when compared with barbiturates in one trial of 65 women), gestational age at birth, interval between trial entry and birth, other neonatal morbidities, or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Duration of neonatal intensive care unit stay was significantly increased in the <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> group compared with the calcium channel blocker group, but not when compared with cox inhibitors or prostaglandin inhibitors.

Introduction. The investigation of NLO materials have gained predominant attention in current research owing to their applications in the technology of information transmission and processing. It is evident that the NLO crystals have exceptional technological requirements such as wide transparency range, fast response and high damage threshold. Due to such distinct optical properties, synthesis and growth of unique materials are in progress. The most widely used materials in photonic technologies are mainly inorganic crystals based on Borates and Phosphates. Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> Li 2 So 4 H 2 o (LSMH) is also one such inorganic highly NLO active materials [1 - 4]. The crystal structure and space group of Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> were originally determined as monoclinic point group P 21 by G. E. Ziegler (1934) [5]. A detailed study on the redetermination, further refinement and inclusion of hydrogen's position of Li 2 So 4 H 2 o structure were reported [6 - 8]. It is explored from the literature that the Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> has remarkable piezoelectric and electro-optic properties. Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> has highest pyroelectric effects among the non-ferroelectric polar crystals [9]. Earlier researches show that Lithium found to be effective NLO material on its combination with Selenate, Glycine and Bromide [10 - 12]. Since there is large demand for crystal in electronic industries, it is required to synthesize NLO material and to improve the properties of existing materials. Considering the facts, ethylene diamine tetra acetate and Cu II doped Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> single crystals have been synthesized and shown as promising candidate for optical second harmonic generation [13 - 14].

Increase in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at 30 and 45 min was greater in those who received <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> compared to placebo (P = 0. 03), although the mean percentage change in PEFR was just 24 %, without significant differences in dyspnoea scores, hospital admission rates, or emergency department readmission rates compared to placebo. Nebulized <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> with salbutamol versus nebulized salbutamol with saline placebo showed no significant differences is forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) measured at 90 min after adjustment for baseline FEV 1 (P = 0. 34) or differences in the need for hospital admission. Combined inhalational and intravenous <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> versus intravenous saline placebo and nebulized ipratropium bromide were comparable in terms of hospital admission, intubation and death, but the ipratropium bromide group showed better bronchodilator effect and improvement in arterial blood gas parameters. Overall, trial evidence for trial evidence for <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> in acute exacerbation of COPD is poor, and further well-designed trials are needed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is used {{to inhibit}} uterine {{activity}} in women in preterm labour to prevent preterm birth. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> therapy given to women in threatened preterm labour {{with the aim of}} preventing preterm birth and its sequelae. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (May 2002) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002). SELECTION CRITERIA: TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Women thought to be in preterm labour. Types of interventions: <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> as the only tocolytic, administered intravenously or orally, compared with either placebo, no treatment or alternative tocolytic therapy. Types of outcome measures: Measures of effectiveness, complications, women's satisfaction with their care and health service use. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Assessments of trial eligibility, quality and data extractions were done by {{at least two of the}} reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Over 2000 women were recruited into the 23 included trials. Only nine trials were rated of high quality for the concealment of allocation. In the <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> versus control (all studies) no difference was seen for the risk of birth within 48 hours of treatment for women given <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> compared with controls when using a random effects model (relative risk (RR) 0. 85, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 58 - 1. 25, 11 trials, 881 women). No benefit was seen for <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> on the risk of giving birth preterm (< 37 weeks) or very preterm (< 34 weeks). The risk of death (fetal and paediatric) was higher for infants exposed to <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (RR 2. 82, 95 % CI 1. 20 - 6. 62, 7 trials, 727 infants). There were only two fetal deaths, both in the <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> group in one study. The six other trials reported there were no fetal deaths. No differences for total paediatric mortality were shown in the six trials with data. No beneficial effect was seen from using <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> on the risk of other neonatal morbidity. A non-significant reduction in the risk of cerebral palsy was reported at follow up at 18 months corrected age (RR 0. 14, 95 % CI 0. 01 - 2. 60, 1 trial, 99 children). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is ineffective at delaying birth or preventing preterm birth, and its use is associated with an increased mortality for the infant. Any further trials should be of high quality, large enough to assess serious morbidity and mortality, compare different dose regimens, and provide neurodevelopmental status of the child...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether prophylactic <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{is necessary to}} prevent eclampsia and associated complications among women with pre-eclampsia prior to labour. Design: Case series. Setting: Tertiary referral centre. Population: Three hundred and eighteen women with pre-eclampsia (blood pressure ≥ 140 / 90 mmHg and ≥ 2 + proteinuria) who were not in labour or for planned induction thereof and had not received <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> during transfer. Methods: Clinical evaluation of the pregnant women with careful blood pressure control. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was withheld even {{in the presence of}} imminent eclampsia. During labour, the option of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> prophylaxis was left to the clinician, but <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was administered in cases of eclampsia. Main outcome measures: Eclampsia and related complications. Results: Five women (1. 5 %) developed eclampsia, although none developed related complications. Women presented at an early gestational age (mean 30 weeks), with high blood pressure, often suffering from headaches. Twenty pregnancies were terminated prior to viability, of which half were terminated for maternal reasons. Ten intrauterine deaths occurred. Most often fetal distress (38. 6 %) initiated the delivery process, which was mainly by caesarean section (68. 5 %). With the exception of epigastric discomfort, symptoms and signs of imminent eclampsia decreased after admission. Blood pressure values were significantly lower at delivery although biochemistry results deteriorated from admission to delivery. Conclusion: In women with pre-eclampsia prior to labour, where blood pressure control was carefully applied but <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> not given, the eclampsia rate was low and eclampsia did not appear to worsen the existing prognosis for mother or fetus.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of intravenous <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> in the treatment of acute asthmatic attacks in children by meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic and comprehensive search of the literature was performed to identify controlled clinical trials of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> in paediatric acute asthma which evaluated outcomes of hospitalisation or short term pulmonary function tests or symptom scores. Unpublished data were searched by personal contacts with authors and specialists. Two reviewers independently assessed trial qualities and synthesised data. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by the Cochrane Q test. Outcome data were pooled by random or fixed effect models depending on presence or absence of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Five randomised placebo controlled trials involving a total of 182 patients were identified. They compared intravenous <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> to placebo in treating paediatric patients with moderate to severe asthmatic attacks in the emergency department, with co-therapies of inhaled beta 2 agonists and systemic steroids. The studies were of high quality with results judged to be valid. Four studies showed that <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was effective, while one study found it ineffective. There was no significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome of hospitalisation. In the fixed effect model, <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is effective in preventing hospitalisation (OR 0. 290, 95 % CI 0. 143 to 0. 589). The number needed to treat is 4 (95 % CI 3 to 8).

CONCLUSION: Intravenous <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> probably provides additional benefit in moderate to severe acute asthma in children treated with bronchodilators and steroids. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the analgesic efficacy of intra-articular injection of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (4 %) compared with equivalent volume of bupivacaine (0. 5 %) after outpatient knee arthroscopic meniscectomy. Forty patients {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups. Group M (n= 20) received intra-articular <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> 4 %, group B (n= 20) received bupivacaine (0. 5 %). Analgesic effect was evaluated by analgesic duration, and by measuring pain intensity at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 h both at rest and on knee movement to 90 °. The primary outcome variable was pain intensity on the VAS at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 h post arthroscopy at rest and on movement (flexion of knee to 90 °), although the magnesium group had lower time weighted averages (TWAs) at rest and on movement, these TWAs were not statistically significant. The median duration of postoperative analgesia was significantly longer in the patients treated with <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (528 min) than in the bupivacaine group (317 min) (p< 0. 0001), with less number of patients needing supplementary analgesia in magnesium group (8 / 20) than those of the bupivacaine group (16 / 20) (p< 0. 022). Also analgesic consumption was significantly lower in the <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> group (p< 0. 002). We concluded that the use of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is rational and effective in reducing pain, and is more physiological and shortens convalescence after outpatient arthroscopic meniscectomy, however our hypotheses that analgesic efficacy of intra-articular isotonic <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> would be superior to intra-articular local anaesthetic cannot be supported with this study...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is {{extensively}} used in obstetrics for {{the treatment}} and prevention of eclampsia. A recent meta-analysis has shown that <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is an effective fetal neuroprotective agent when given antenatally to women at risk of very preterm birth. Term infants {{account for more than}} half of all cases of cerebral palsy, and the incidence has remained fairly constant. It is important to assess if antenatal administration of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> to women at term protects the fetus from brain injury, and associated neurosensory disabilities including cerebral palsy. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> given to women at term as a neuroprotective agent for the fetus. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trial Register (31 July 2012) and the reference lists of other Cochrane reviews assessing <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> in pregnancy. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials comparing antenatally administered <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> to women at term with placebo, no treatment or a different fetal neuroprotective agent. We also planned to include cluster-randomised trials, and exclude cross-over trials and quasi-randomised trials. We planned to exclude studies reported as abstracts only. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and for risk of bias. Two authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS We included one trial (involving 135 women with mild pre-eclampsia at term). An additional six studies are awaiting further assessment. The included trial compared <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> with a placebo and was at a low risk of bias. The trial did not report any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes. There was no significant difference between <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and placebo in Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (risk ratio (RR) 0. 51; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 05 to 5. 46; 135 infants), nor gestational age at birth (mean difference (MD) - 0. 20 weeks; 95 % CI - 0. 62 to 0. 22; 135 infants). There were significantly more maternal side effects (feeling warm and flushed) in the <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> group than in the placebo group (RR 3. 81; 95 % CI 2. 22 to 6. 53; 135 women). However, no significant difference in adverse effects severe enough to cease treatment was observed (RR 3. 04; 95 % CI 0. 13 to 73. 42; 135 women). There were no significant differences seen between groups in the rates of postpartum haemorrhage (RR 4. 06; 95 % CI 0. 47 to 35. 38; 135 women) and caesarean section (RR 0. 80; 95 % CI 0. 39 to 1. 63; 135 women). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently insufficient evidence to assess the efficacy and safety of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> when administered to women for neuroprotection of the term fetus. As there has been recent evidence for the use of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> for neuroprotection of the preterm fetus, high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the safety profile and neurological outcomes for the term fetus. Strategies to reduce maternal side effects during treatment also require evaluation. Thuy-My N Nguyen, Caroline A Crowther, Dominic Wilkinson, Emily Bai...|$|R
