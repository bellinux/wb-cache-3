It was available in every existing BRZ paint hue.|$|E
500|$|The first 15 B.1s were {{powered by}} the Olympus 101 with [...] thrust. Many of these early {{examples}} in a <b>metallic</b> <b>finish</b> remained {{the property of the}} Ministry of Supply being retained for trials and development purposes. Those entering RAF service were delivered to No 230 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), the first in July 1956. Later aircraft, painted in anti-flash white and {{powered by the}} Olympus 102 with [...] thrust, began to enter squadron service in July 1957. The Olympus 102s were quickly modified to the Olympus 104 standard, ultimately rated at [...] thrust. As far back as 1952, Bristol Aero Engines had begun development of the BOl.6 (Olympus 6) rated at [...] thrust but if fitted to the B.1, this would have re-introduced the buffet requiring further redesign of the wing.|$|E
50|$|Aliphatic can be {{a better}} option for colors because its color is more stable over time in {{ultraviolet}} light. It is produced with pure polyurethane, which drives up the cost approximately 35%. Aliphatic materials can be sprayed {{in a wide variety}} of colors, including <b>metallic</b> <b>finishes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additives can be {{incorporated}} into the compound to enhance the material's strength, reduce its weight, add heat stability, decorative effects, and so on. Polyresin is also compatible with a large range of different finishes, including paint and <b>metallic</b> <b>finishes,</b> which is why many decorative pieces are made from this material.|$|R

The shoes {{are covered in}} a metallic copper/bronze silk textured weave and edged in gold <b>metallic</b> <b>finished</b> leather. The Boulevard set-under heels are lacquered with a <b>metallic</b> gold <b>finish</b> and set with rhinestones. One shoe with label inside: "Wise Shoe / For Every Occasion" Both shoes with hand-marked notations: " 6 1 / 2 aa / D 30014 / 11 - 564 " Some rhinestones on the heels have been replaced {{at some point in}} the past with other rhinestones that do not quite match the original stones...|$|R
500|$|Colossus's {{movements}} were re-recorded with performer T.J. Storm, as Tricoteux {{had been unable}} to move athletically due to the platform shoes he had to wear on set to replicate the character's height. LaSalle was used for his facial performance. DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic-accurate. The team sought specific reference for Colossus's <b>metallic</b> <b>finish</b> to avoid looking [...] "chromey", visiting a metal company to look at various samples. They settled on cold rolled steel, with the darker hot rolled steel used for his hair. The model also includes ridges on the character, which could be moved separately {{from the rest of the}} model to keep them always perfectly straight as in the comic books. DD also created the model of Deadpool that was used by all vendors. His mask is animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics, which helped balance out the [...] "chinwag" [...] caused by Reynolds' acting coming through the bottom of the mask. Replacing Deadpool's head fully was going to be too costly, so Weta Digital instead warped each shot based on facial reference from Reynolds, and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes. This was called an [...] "ingenious 2D-ish solution".|$|E
2500|$|On May 1, 1979, AMC {{celebrated the}} 25th {{anniversary of the}} Nash-Hudson merger and {{released}} {{a limited number of}} specially appointed [...] "Silver Anniversary" [...] AMC Concords to commemorate the event.

30|$|A nanoparticulate complex {{between the}} organic metal {{polyaniline}} and Ag {{has been described}} for the first time. A new type of nano size surface finish for metals (here: Cu) can be deposited using a dispersion of this complex. Although it does not form a continuous nanolayer, it completely and effectively shields the Cu and prevents it from being oxidized. Its ageing resistance and wetting (soldering) performance is excellent and superior to established <b>metallic</b> <b>finishes.</b>|$|R
50|$|When it was {{introduced}} on the U.S. market, the Ericofon was available in 18 colors, but after transfer of production to North Electric, the number of colors was reduced to eight.

50|$|As {{the decade}} closed, in 2000 GAZ was in active {{preparation}} {{to launch the}} 3111 Volga. The vehicle demanded a serious upgrade to existing facilities at the plant, and as these came online, they were extensively tested by the 3110. For example, the new Haden Drysys paintshop, when introduced to the conveyor, with attractive acrylic and <b>metallic</b> <b>finishes,</b> helped to tackle the major corrosion problems of the 3110. Simultaneously came the new 265/70R15 tyres. A small series of licence-built Steyr Diesel engines (ZMZ-560) were available.|$|R
50|$|Forms of {{wet on wet}} {{painting}} have been in use in industrial applications for some years. The German F.A.L. process used sulphurised linseed oil and was used for some years to paint United States Postal Service vans. With the development of quick-drying primers, it was used by Rank Xerox to paint parts for their copiers. The original clear on base system for automotive <b>metallic</b> <b>finishes</b> used an air drying base. This system, using a flash primer as well, was used for cycle finishes well before it was used for cars.|$|R
50|$|Historic paint {{analysis}} is the scientific analysis of architectural finishes, including not only paints but also <b>metallic</b> <b>finishes</b> and clear and translucent finishes used on historic buildings. The {{primary purpose of}} such {{analysis is}} to determine the color of the finish used at a particular time in the building's history, usually the original construction, but not always. Secondary purposes include determination of ingredients such as media (water, oil, latex, etc.) and pigments (organic pigments, inorganic pigments, dyes, etc.). Paint analysis is also used at times as a dating technique for various building elements.|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons to paint plastics. Some are painted for appearance; others for {{functional}} purposes. Often the objective of painting a plastic part is to achieve the smooth, mitrorlike, automotive “Class A “ finish. The molded surface of non-painted plastic usually doesn’t have this desired appearance. The paint covers molding and substrate imperfections. Also, decorative effects such as <b>metallic</b> <b>finishes,</b> textures and color match of differently processed parts can be achieved by painting. Paint sometimes acts as a sealer and protection against weathering. Some plastic...|$|R

40|$|The ITRI / October Project on (<b>Metallic)</b> Surface <b>Finishes</b> {{was started}} to {{investigate}} the use of Palladium (Pd) as a PWB finish that would withstand multiple passes through SMT and Wave Soldering as well as support Aluminum and Gold Wire Bonding operations. The project was expanded to include Bismuth, Silver and Tin finishes. A test vehicle was designed. To determine if different PWB processes would affect the assembly process, the Test Vehicle would be built a second time to verify repeatability. Different Palladium chemistries would {{also be used for}} the same finishes. Electroless Nickel / Immersion Gold finish would be used as a reference. Different companies would perform various assembly and test operations on a number of boards. The following describes some of the activities that Celestica, Inc. (formerly IBM Canada Ltd., Toronto Mfg.) performed during the various assembly, aluminum wire bonding and testing operations on the ITRI / October Project Test Vehicles with the different <b>metallic</b> <b>finishes...</b>|$|R
