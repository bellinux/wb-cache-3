40|$|Many macro systems, {{especially}} for Lisp and Scheme, allow macro transformers to perform general computation. Moreover, the language for implementing compile-time macro transformers {{is usually the}} same as the language for implementing run-time functions. As a side effect of this sharing, implementations tend to allow the mingling of compile-time values and run-time values, as well as values from separate compilations. Such mingling breaks programming tools that must parse code without executing it. Macro implementors avoid harmful mingling by obeying certain <b>macrodefinition</b> protocols and by inserting phase-distinguishing annotations into the code. However, the annotations are fragile, the protocols are not enforced, and programmers can only reason about the result in terms of the compiler's implementation. MzScheme [...] - the language of the PLT Scheme tool suite [...] -addresses the problem through a macro system that separates compilation without sacrificing the expressiveness of macros...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a {{computer-aided}} approach to fault observability investigation of linear analog circuits is developed. The method {{is based on}} sensitivity investigation of the test characteristics in the frequency domain. The test frequencies are selected maximizing {{the sensitivity of the}} magnitude of the test characteristics. Applying postprocessing of the simulation results using <b>macrodefinitions</b> in the graphical analyzer Probe, a fault observability investigation of the circuit is performed. A number of sensitivity measures are defined in Probe for observability investigation of multiple faults using pre-defined <b>macrodefinitions.</b> The sensitivity of S-parameters is obtained in order to investigate the fault observability at RF...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{parameter}} extraction methodology is {{proposed for the}} simplified small-signal NMOSFET equivalent circuit utilizing Cadence PSpice circuit simulator. A direct extraction procedure is realized based on the two-port Y-parameters. Using postprocessing in the graphical analyzer Probe utilizing corresponding <b>macrodefinitions,</b> a Y- to S- parameter conversion is performed of the simulated results. The magnitude values of the measured S-parameters are introduced in the behavioral model using frequency-dependent elements of EFREQ type. Verification of the extraction methodology is made by comparing the simulated and experimental results for the S-parameters...|$|R
