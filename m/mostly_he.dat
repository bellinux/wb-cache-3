5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes {{that we know of}} and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order. But he took huge German {{casualties}} elsewhere and he was a servant of the regime. He was not exactly a shining liberal or Social Democrat. <b>Mostly,</b> <b>he</b> was interested in his career.|$|E
25|$|Born in Churchill, Worcestershire, Bache {{was educated}} at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, and Caius College, Cambridge. He made his {{first-class}} debut for Worcestershire against Surrey at Worcester {{late in the}} 1907 season, scoring 9 in his only innings and holding three catches. The following season, he played twice for the county, but he made nine appearances in 1909 and eight in 1910. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> played for Worcestershire but he turned out three times for Cambridge University.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Longrigg's {{place in}} Cambridge's best side {{seemed to be}} assured. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> opened the innings and against Sussex {{early in the season}} hit an unbeaten 84, his highest score to that point. He {{achieved}} little in the University Match, but later in the season with Somerset he improved his highest score again, making 95 against Hampshire after five wickets had fallen 90 on a wet wicket at Weston-super-Mare. In all cricket in 1928, he made 800 runs with an average of 28.57.|$|E

25|$|De la Peña {{played for}} the Gloucestershire second team {{in the second half}} of the 1990 season, and the {{following}} year he made his first-team debut, in a County Championship match against Essex. He took 1–69 from 24 overs in Essex's only innings, removing Paul Prichard for 10. He played one other game that season, against Leicestershire, but then returned to the seconds, where he remained right through 1992. He did play twice in 1993, taking 4–77 against the Australians in June, but <b>mostly</b> <b>he</b> remained in the second team, and left Gloucestershire at the end of the season.|$|E
25|$|The 1924 South Africans {{lost the}} Test series to England by three matches to nil, with two draws, with the {{weakness}} of the bowling singled out by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in its review of the tour as a prime cause for failure. Deane himself merited not a single mention in the four-page Wisden article describing the highlights of the tour, and his tour figures indicate that he was rarely prominent: in 25 first-class matches, he passed 50 only once, and his 621 runs came at an average of 22.18. The one half-century was a not-out innings of 80 in a match against Scotland in which the South Africans comprehensively outplayed their hosts. Despite this modest record, Deane was picked as a specialist batsman for all five Test matches and in a team in which only Bob Catterall and, to a lesser degree, Fred Susskind made many runs, he did as much as most of his team-mates, scoring 143 runs at an average of 23.83. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> batted in lower middle order at No 7, and his best score came in the third Test when he reverted to that position for the second innings, having opened the batting in the first innings, and made an unbeaten 47 that forced England to bat again after South Africa had followed on 264 runs behind on the first innings.|$|E
500|$|While at Northwestern, Colbert {{studied with}} the intent of {{becoming}} a dramatic actor; <b>mostly</b> <b>he</b> performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close's ImprovOlympic {{at a time when the}} project was focused on competitive, long-form improvisation, rather than improvisational comedy. [...] "I wasn't gonna do Second City", Colbert later recalled, [...] "because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv– there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people". After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job. [...] A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs. Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free. Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly.|$|E

2500|$|According to William's brother Walter, {{their father}} [...] "tried many things. For some {{time he was}} in very low water; then he got up again and settled in a quiet office. He was not a pushing man, nor did he know how to catch at opportunities. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> waited. Meanwhile, he was a studious man, whose chief delight was in reading... He was never in the least degree moved by the Calvinistic {{fanaticism}} of the time... Although regular in attendance at Church, he never ventured to present himself at Holy Communion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1929 and 1930 seasons {{were the}} only two where Longrigg was able to play fairly {{continuous}} county cricket until he became Somerset captain {{towards the end of the}} 1930s. In 1929 he played 25 matches, all but one of them for Somerset, and made 1,123 runs at an average of 24.41. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> batted in the middle order, but it was as an opener that he made the first century of his career, 124 against Warwickshire at Taunton. Wisden noted that his average was lower than in the previous season and that [...] "his batting was marked by stubborn defence".|$|E
2500|$|The most {{powerful}} folk figure is the Ankou or the [...] "Reaper of Death". Sometimes a skeleton {{wrapped in a}} shroud with the Breton flat hat, sometimes described as a real human being (the last dead of the year, devoted to bring the dead to Death), he makes his journeys by night carrying an upturned scythe which he throws before him to reap his harvest. Sometimes he is on foot but <b>mostly</b> <b>he</b> travels with a cart, the Karrig an Ankou, drawn by two oxen and a lean horse. Two servants dressed in the same shroud and hat as the Ankou pile the dead into the cart, and to hear it creaking at night means you have little time left to live.|$|E

2500|$|Gloucestershire under Bailey in 1951 {{dropped from}} {{seventh in the}} County Championship to twelfth, but Wisden claimed that [...] "statistics told only half the story". Injuries to bowlers and the {{retirement}} of Tom Goddard, mainstay of the bowling attack for the previous 20 years, disrupted the team. Bailey's own performance earned praise from Wisden. His [...] "advance" [...] as a batsman was [...] "satisfying" [...] and [...] "besides leading the side unobtrusively (he) set a great example by his courage and.. recorded his maiden century in first-class cricket". Injuries to batsmen meant that Bailey moved {{up and down the}} batting order: <b>mostly</b> <b>he</b> batted at No 6, but when opening batsmen were out of action, he opened the innings. His maiden century came in the second innings of a heavy defeat against Sussex at Hove; trailing by 273 after the first innings, Bailey promoted himself to No 3 for the second innings and made 111 [...] "displaying special skill in strokes in front of the wicket".|$|E
2500|$|In both 1935 and 1936, Bennett barely {{played at}} all, {{but he came}} back to the Somerset side in 1937, playing in most of the matches in the first two-thirds of the season. He passed 50 twice, with the higher innings being 62 against Gloucestershire at Taunton, but his {{aggregate}} for the season was only 292 runs and his average was just 13.90. He was absent for most of 1938, but came back for a final season in 1939, when he played in half of Somerset's matches and captained the side in the temporary absence of the regular captain, Bunty Longrigg, in games in early July. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> batted a long way down the batting order and it was from No 9 that he made his highest of the season, 72 against Kent at Maidstone, an innings described by Wisden as [...] "dashing"– though Somerset still lost the match easily inside two days. His final Somerset match, a month before the outbreak of the Second World War, was against the West Indians; Bennett scored 56 in Somerset's only innings as the county beat the touring side by an innings in less than two days. He did not appear in first-class cricket again.|$|E
60|$|Bert {{slept for}} a time, {{and then his}} sleep was broken by dreams. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> was fleeing from formless terrors down an interminable passage in an airship--a passage paved at first with ravenous trap-doors, and then with {{openwork}} canvas of the most careless description.|$|E

60|$|So {{there we}} are. But {{considering}} man at his best, {{he is at}} the start faced with the great problem. At the very start he has to undertake his tripartite being, the mother within him, the father within him, and the Holy Ghost, the self which he is supposed to consummate, and which <b>mostly</b> <b>he</b> doesn't.|$|E
60|$|That was {{the last}} of rest and easy {{traveling}} for the girls. The forest that he struck into seemed ribbed like a washboard with deep ravines so steep of slope as to make precarious travel. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> kept to the bottom where dry washes afforded a kind of trail. But it was necessary to cross these ravines when they were too long to be headed, and this crossing was work.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{not merely}} a lapse from his lately hopeful state with Alford, it was a collapse.

He did not walk much. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> remained shrunken in the arm-chair where he used to sit beside Mrs. Yarrow's rocker, and the ladies, the older and the older-fashioned, who were [...] "sticking it out" [...] at the hotel till it should close on the 15th of September, observed him, some compassionately, some censoriously, but all in the same conviction.|$|E
60|$|In {{the afternoons}} there was leisure {{for him and}} for the women. He had no favorites, and let the {{occasion}} decide {{what he should do}} and with whom he should be. They had little parties at the cottages and picnics under the cedars. He rode up and down the valley with Ruth, who could ride a horse as no other girl he had ever seen. He climbed with Hester. He walked with Joan. <b>Mostly</b> <b>he</b> contrived to include several at once in the little excursions, though it was not rare for him to be out alone with one.|$|E
6000|$|... “No; omnibus,” {{the little}} man {{answered}} readily enough. He lived far away in Islington, in a small house down a shabby street, littered with straw and dirty paper, where out of school hours a troop of assorted children ran and squabbled with a shrill, joyless, rowdy clamour. His single back room, remarkable for having an extremely large cupboard, he rented furnished from two elderly spinsters, dressmakers in a humble way with a clientele of servant girls <b>mostly.</b> <b>He</b> had a heavy padlock put on the cupboard, but otherwise he was a model lodger, giving no trouble, and requiring practically no attendance. His oddities were that he insisted on being present when his room was being swept, and that when he went out he locked his door, and took the key away with him.|$|E
