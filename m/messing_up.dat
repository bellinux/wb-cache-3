5|$|Leterrier had {{to direct}} four units {{with a broken}} foot. Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting {{primarily}} took place in Toronto, because mayor David Miller is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing Yonge Street for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite <b>messing</b> <b>up</b> the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day. The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the University of Toronto and Morningside Park. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out. There was also shooting in the Financial District. A factory in Hamilton, Ontario, which was due for demolition, was {{the interior of the}} Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center. The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a backlot in Hamilton. Other Canadian locations included CFB Trenton and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in New York City and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro. While there, the crew shot at Rocinha, Lapa, Tijuca Forest and Santa Teresa. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.|$|E

Villiers, however, keeps on <b>messing</b> <b>up</b> his lines and throwing in various ad-libs relating to Doctor Who.|$|E
25|$|The {{second act}} takes {{place after the}} dinner. In spite of Arabella {{spending}} the entire dinner unconscious, and Paige and Micky joining the meal and <b>messing</b> <b>up</b> the cutlery arrangement, things have evidently gone well. Julie-Ann, having swapped dresses with Paige at some point, attempts to make things up with Arabella, although Arabella never seems to grasp which girl is which. However, things start to go downhill when Derek has a private word with Justin. Derek suggests Justin should move up to Doncaster to take over his garden centre business, oblivious to Justin's hints {{that he is not}} interested. Furthermore, Justin learns from Derek that the reason Derek and Dee fell out with Julie-Ann's two sisters was because {{one of them is a}} lesbian and the other married a Chinese man.|$|E

25|$|Detective Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery) and {{his partner}} Ryan Alba (Greg Serano) {{have spent the last}} three years unsuccessfully trying to locate the Lion (Joe Pantoliano), an {{international}} hitman that has always eluded their grasp. They believe that they've found his location via a tipster but instead find Tom’s wife Kelly (Michelle Greathouse) tied up in a basement filled with explosives, surrounded by a black outline. The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk the entire house blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for <b>messing</b> <b>up</b> the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States. His only mercy is that Tom may turn out the lights in the basement. With no other option, Tom has the lights turned off and he shoots and kills Kelly.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} between General Manager Eric Bischoff and Eugene in a [...] "Choose the Loser's Fate". Eugene {{performed}} a leg drop on Bischoff for the win. After the match ended, the audience voted that Bischoff get his head shaved. Jonathan Coachman, however, {{announced that the}} audience instead voted [...] "Loser is Winners Servant", in which he and Bischoff would be Eugene's servants for five minutes. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon came out and reversed the stipulation and announced that Bischoff would get his head shaved. McMahon warned that if Bischoff did not go through it, he would be fired. Eugene shaved Bischoff's hair and Coachman was forced to wear a dress for <b>messing</b> <b>up</b> {{the outcome of the}} match.|$|E

You get the individual personalities of all five members, the infectious togetherness of the group at large, and most importantly, the sense that they were coming to absolutely blast through American pop music and mess up everything we previously thought we knew." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Passion" [...] {{was directed by}} Utada's ex-husband Kazuaki Kiriya, where it was filmed at the Gung-Ho Films studios in Beijing, China. At {{the start of the}} video, an animation sequence was created and produced by Kōji Morimoto, whom helmed a design-based campaign for the singers album Exodus, which was recognized as Fluximation-style animations. The remaining additions of computer generated imagery were generated by the company N-Design. Several workers had hand-made the scenery including the infrastructure of the grand-hall (seating for the drummers, floor design, etc.) and the cathedral (the walls, platform for Utada, floor); Kiriya placed a blue screen behind these structures in order to expand them to higher lengths. Utada revealed that majority of the dancers and drummers had choreographed intensely before commencing the video shoot; she jokingly stated that she apologized several times whilst <b>messing</b> <b>up</b> the routines.|$|E
500|$|Several [...] "alternate" [...] nude {{scenes were}} filmed during the production. Set in a pub and {{involving}} local [...] "wenches", the sequences were reportedly solely {{intended for the}} movie's German release version. Reeves refused {{to take part in}} the filming of these sequences and they were completed by the crew after the [...] "regular" [...] versions of the scenes had been shot, with Tigon's Tenser acting as director. According to Waddilove, Louis M. [...] "Deke" [...] Heywood appeared at the location only to ensure those additional scenes were filmed. The credits read, [...] "Additional scenes by Louis M Heywood." [...] According to Ogilvy, this was an in-joke because for Reeves, [...] "additional scenes" [...] meant [...] "some prick of a producer putting his oar in and <b>messing</b> <b>up</b> what the director had done." [...] None of these scenes were made available in the theatrical versions released in the US or UK, although they were included in the videotape version released in the mid-1980s by HBO Home Video.|$|E
500|$|The ninth track, [...] "Stop the World", was co-written by Lovato and Nick Jonas about {{falling in}} love with someone, but [...] "people don't want you to". The song {{includes}} a reference to the infamous criminal couple Bonnie and Clyde: [...] "Like Bonnie and Clyde, let's find a ride." [...] Lovato wrote the album's tenth track, [...] "World of Chances", with John Mayer. According to Allison Stewart of The Washington Post, the ballad showcases the [...] "rough grain" [...] of Lovato's voice.The song tells about a girl giving a boy she loves chances to fix their relationship but keeps <b>messing</b> <b>up.</b> [...] "Remember December" [...] diverges from Lovato's usual pop rock sound into more prominent power pop and synthpop with [...] "a bit of techno". In the song, she reminisces a winter romance: [...] "I remember us together / With a promise of forever." [...] The twelfth and final track [...] "Everything You're Not" [...] was co-written by Toby Gad, Lindy Robbins and Lovato. The lyrics chronicle self-respect as Lovato sings [...] "I want a gentleman who treats me like a queen/I need respect, I need love/Nothing in between." [...] The first bonus track of the album, [...] "Gift of a Friend", was co-written and produced by Adam Watts and Andy Dodd. The song is {{about not being able to}} [...] "pursue our aspirations or deal with disappointments" [...] without friends. The second bonus track, [...] "So Far, So Great", was written and produced by Aris Archontis, Jeannie Lurie and Chen Neeman and served as the theme song of Sonny with a Chance.

2500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Mad Head Love" [...] was {{released}} online on September 21, 2013, and {{was directed by}} Sojiro Kamitani, who also directed a video for [...] "Poppin' Apathy". [...] "Mad Head Love" [...] features three different scenes. Yonezu is shown performing different instruments such as a red Fender Telecaster electric guitar and a keyboard, as well as holding a recording device and listening through headphones. Other scenes show a Caucasian man and woman in beige clothing. They interact by prodding each other, such as poking the other person's ear, or <b>messing</b> <b>up</b> their hair. Other scenes show strange moving contraptions, such as one that turns a toy horse around, or a golden crane that drops a plastic fish onto a plate.

2500|$|Beginning in 1967, studies raised {{concerns}} that LSD might produce genetic damage or developmental abnormalities in fetuses. However, these initial reports {{were based on}} in vitro studies or were poorly controlled and have not been substantiated. In studies of chromosomal changes in human users and in monkeys, the balance of evidence suggests no increase in chromosomal damage. For example, white blood cells {{of people who had}} been given LSD in a clinical setting were examined for visible chromosomal abnormalities; overall, there appeared to be no lasting changes. [...] Several studies have been conducted using illicit LSD users and provide a less clear picture. Interpretation of this data is generally complicated by factors such as the unknown chemical composition of street LSD, concurrent use of other psychoactive drugs, and diseases such as hepatitis in the sampled populations. It seems possible that the small number of genetic abnormalities reported in users of street LSD is either coincidental or related to factors other than a toxic effect of pure LSD. A 2008 medical review concluded, [...] "The available data suggest that pure LSD does not cause chromosomal abnormalities, spontaneous abortions, or congenital malformations." [...] However, this refutation has not stopped this perennial legend from being told, nor has it stopped the jokes about such [...] "mutations" [...] allegedly <b>messing</b> <b>up</b> the children of the Baby Boomers.|$|E

Stugotz is fined for [...] "phlegm issues" [...] though his fines aren't incurred simply for being phlegm-soaked and vile; he is fined when he coughs into his microphone without hitting the cough button, which mutes the microphone. [...] Stugotz is also fined $5 for reading the internet incorrectly. [...] Greg Cote is fined $5 for breaking the show beyond repair. [...] Guillermo is fined $2 anytime he makes a fundamentally useless contribution into the microphone. Roy is fined for lousy hockey updates. [...] Finally, Mike Ryan is fined $2 for [...] "music snobbery" [...] which entails Mike sharing little known music facts or opinions, ostensibly {{to add to the}} conversation but more likely to flaunt his music knowledge.

After his revelation, she tells him he should go and to write about their night together. In the middle of their conversation, she hears a voice she recognizes singing. When she looks at the stage, she sees that it is Charlie and realizes that she did not know everything about him. Michael is upset, thinking that she declined his offer for Charlie and is ready to go. After they leave, Charlie is auditioning for a music agent and is rejected. The next day when Peggy goes to talk to Charlie, he lashes out at her and she gives him a song she [...] "wrote" [...] for him (which ends up being [...] "She Loves You", by The Beatles).
