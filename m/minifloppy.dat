25|$|The {{head gap}} of an 80‑track {{high-density}} (1.2 MB in the MFM format) 5¼‑inch drive (a.k.a. Mini diskette, Mini disk, or <b>Minifloppy)</b> {{is smaller than}} that of a 40‑track double-density (360 KB) drive but can format, read and write 40‑track disks well provided the controller supports double stepping or has a switch to do such a process. 5.25-inch 80-track drives were also called hyper drives.|$|E
50|$|System 8813 {{hardware}} {{included the}} standard CPU and VTI cards; a RAM card, typically {{with at least}} 32K of memory; and a disk controller card, to interface with the <b>minifloppy</b> drives. Later, a Z80 based disk controller supported double sided, double-density <b>minifloppy</b> drives, and full-size (8-inch) floppy drives.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of double-sided, double density <b>minifloppy</b> drives, the storage capacity of a single floppy became approximately 360K bytes (the same as the original IBM-PC floppy drive capacity). This {{made it feasible to}} store Exec, applications and data on a single floppy. The System 8810 was functionally identical to the 8813, but in a smaller chassis, with 5 slots and only one <b>minifloppy</b> drive.|$|E
50|$|Shugart Associates was a {{computer}} peripheral manufacturer {{that dominated the}} floppy disk drive market in the late 1970s and is famous for introducing the 5-inch <b>minifloppy</b> floppy disk drive.|$|E
50|$|PolyMorphic's {{disk-based system}} was the System 8813. It {{consisted}} of a larger chassis holding one, two, or three 5-inch <b>minifloppy</b> disk drives from Shugart Associates. The drives used single-sided, single-density storage on hard-sectored diskettes. Storage capacity was approximately 90K bytes per diskette.|$|E
50|$|The 5-inch {{disk drive}} was {{introduced}} by Shugart in September 1976 as the Shugart SA-400 <b>Minifloppy</b> (Shugart's trademarked brand name) at an OEM price of $390 for the drive and $45 for ten diskettes. The SA-400 and related models became their best selling products, with shipments of up to 4000 drives per day.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1975, R2E signed Warner & Swasey Company as the {{exclusive}} manufacturer and marketer of the Micral {{line in the}} United States and Canada. Warner & Swasey marketed its Micral-based system for industrial data processing applications such as engineering data analysis, accounting and inventory control. [...] R2E and Warner & Swasey displayed the Micral M multiple microcomputer system at the June 1976 National Computer Conference. The Micral M consists of up to eight Micral S microcomputers, {{each with its own}} local memory and sharing the common memory so the local and common memory look like one monolithic memory for each processor. The system has a distributed multiprocessor operating system R2E said was based on sharing common resources and real-time task management.Some time after the July 1976 introduction of the Zilog Z80, came the Z80-based Micral CZ. The 8080-based Micral C, an intelligent CRT terminal designed for word processing and automatic typesetting, was introduced in July 1977. [...] It has two Shugart SA400 <b>minifloppy</b> drives and a panel of system control and sense switches below the <b>minifloppy</b> drives. Business application language (BAL) and FORTRAN are supported. By October, R2E had set up an American subsidiary, R2E of America, in Minneapolis. [...] The Micral V Portable (1978) could run FORTRAN and assembler under the Sysmic operating system, or BAL. [...] The original Sysmic operating system was renamed Prologue in 1978. Interestingly, Prologue was able to perform real-time multitasking, and was a multi-user system. R2E offered CP/M for the Micral C in 1979.|$|E
50|$|The {{head gap}} of an 80‑track {{high-density}} (1.2 MB in the MFM format) 5¼‑inch drive (a.k.a. Mini diskette, Mini disk, or <b>Minifloppy)</b> {{is smaller than}} that of a 40‑track double-density (360 KB) drive but can format, read and write 40‑track disks well provided the controller supports double stepping or has a switch to do such a process. 5.25-inch 80-track drives were also called hyper drives.A blank 40‑track disk formatted and written on an 80‑track drive can be taken to its native drive without problems, and a disk formatted on a 40‑track drive can be used on an 80‑track drive. Disks written on a 40‑track drive and then updated on an 80 track drive become unreadable on any 40‑track drives due to track width incompatibility.|$|E
50|$|By using custom {{formatting}} and load/save routines (sometimes {{included in}} third-party DOSes, see below), {{all of the}} mechanically possible 40 tracks can be used. The reason Commodore decided {{not to use the}} upper five tracks by default (or at least more than 35) was the bad quality of some of the drive mechanisms which did not always work reliably at the highest tracks. So by reducing the number of tracks used and thus capacity, it was possible to further reduce cost - in contrast to single-density drives used e.g. in IBM PC computers of the day which save 180 kB on one side (by using a 40-track format). The 1983 Apple FileWare <b>minifloppy</b> drives use double-sided media, higher track pitch, and variable motor speed to achieve a storage capacity of 871 kB, or 435 kB per side.|$|E
40|$|To monitor solar neutron events, a new {{recording}} {{system will be}} installed at Mt. Norikura Cosmic Ray Observatory. The {{recording system}} is composed of a pulse counter with clock and a microcomputer with <b>minifloppy</b> disk. The counter and the microcomputer are connected through the General Purpose Interface Bus line. The one minute total count of the neutron monitor is recorded on the <b>minifloppy</b> disk...|$|E
40|$|The Motorola Exorset 30 system, {{based on}} a Motorola 6809 {{microprocessor}} which serves as control processor for the microdensitometer is presented. User communication and instrument control are implemented in this syatem; data transmission to a host computer is provided via standard interfaces. The Vienna PDS system (VIPS) software was developed in BASIC and M 6809 assembler. It provides efficient user interaction via function keys and argument input in a menu oriented environment. All parameters can be stored on, and retrieved from, <b>minifloppy</b> disks, {{making it possible to}} set up large scanning tasks. Extensive user information includes continuously updated status and coordinate displays, as well as a real time graphic display during scanning...|$|E
