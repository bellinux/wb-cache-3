25|$|The {{acetabular}} cup is {{the component}} which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a metal coating {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a <b>Morse</b> <b>taper.</b>|$|E
25|$|The femoral {{component}} is the component that fits in the femur (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped {{to accept the}} femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There {{are two types of}} fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic bone cement to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a <b>Morse</b> <b>taper.</b> These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the microleakage at the implant-abutment (I-A) interface of <b>Morse</b> <b>tapered</b> implants inoculated with different volumes of bacterial suspension. METHODS: <b>Morse</b> <b>tapered</b> I-A sets were selected and divided in two groups {{depending on the}} type of abutment: passing screw (PS) and solid (S), and then subdivided into four subgroups (n= 6) according to the suspension volume: PS 1 : 0. 1 µL; PS 3 : 0. 3 µL; PS 5 : 0. 5 µL; PS 7 : 0. 7 µL; S 1 : 0. 1 µL; S 3 : 0. > 3 µL; S 5 : 0. 5 µL and S 7 : 0. 7 µL. A control test was performed to verify the presence of external contamination during the inoculation and the implants were incubated for microbiological analysis. The microleakage was evaluated every 24 h for 7 days by the clarity of solution. After this period, the implants were disassembled for confirmation of bacterial viability. RESULTS: All the specimens with 0. 7 µL and one sample of S 5 presented turbidity in the control test indicating external contamination, and were excluded from the study. After 7 days of observation, none of the specimens presented positive results for microleakage and the bacterial viability was confirmed in all specimens. The 0. 1 µL and 0. 3 µL volumes did not present bacterial microleakage, meaning that these volumes may be inadequate for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: None of the sets evaluated showed bacterial microleakage at the I-A interface and the volume of 0. 7 µL exceeded the internal capacity of the implants...|$|R

50|$|Bridgeport manual milling {{machines}} {{have come in}} many types and sizes over the years, including (but not limited to) the C head (original), R head (heavy duty C head), M head, J head (and high speed, 5440 RPM version), 2J1 1/2 head (1.5 HP Vari-Speed), 2J2 (2HP Vari-speed), and Series II head (4HP Vari-speed). All of the heads offer variable speeds, the earlier ones via a step pulley (cone pulley) and the later ones via electrically or electronically modulated variable-speed drive. Typical table sizes are 9″ × 49″ (Y and X, respectively) and 10″ × 54″. Machine tapers for toolholding include <b>Morse</b> <b>tapers</b> (on early models) and the R8 taper (a widely used standard that Bridgeport created) on most models. Both Morse and R8 allow for both collets and solid holders; and a drill chuck can be held by either of the latter.

40|$|PURPOSE. This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the correlation between microleakage and screw loosening at different types of implant-abutment connections and/or geometries measuring the torque values {{before and after the}} leakage tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three different abutment types (Intenal hex titanium, internal hex zirconium, <b>morse</b> <b>tapered</b> titaniuım) with different geometries were connected to its own implant fixture. All the abutments were tightened with a standard torque value then the composition was connected to the modified fluid filtration system. After the measurements of leakage removal torque values were re-measured. Kruskal-wallis test was performed for non-parametric and one-way ANOVA was performed for parametric data. The correlation was evaluated using Spearman Correlation Test (α= 0. 05). RESULTS. Significantly higher microleakage was found at the connection of implant-internal hex zirconium abutment. Observed mean torque value loss was also significantly higher than other connection geometries. Spearman tests revealed a significant correlation between microleakage and screw loosening. CONCLUSION. Microleakage may provoke screw loosening. Removing torque values rationally decrease with the increase of microleakage. [J Adv Prosthodont 2014; 6 : 35 - 8...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{presence}} of a microgap between implant and abutment could produce a bacterial reservoir which could interfere with the long-term health of the periimplant tissues. The aim {{of this article was}} to evaluate, by x-ray 3 -dimensional microtomography, implant-abutment contact surfaces and microgaps at the implant-abutment interface in different types of implant-abutment connections. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 implants were used in this in vitro study. Ten implants presented a screw-retained internal hexagon abutment (group I), 10 had a <b>Morse</b> Cone <b>taper</b> internal connection (group II), 10 another type of <b>Morse</b> Cone <b>taper</b> internal connection (group III), and 10 had a screwed trilobed connection (group IV). Results: In both types of Morse Cone internal connections, there was no detectable separation at the implant-abutment {{in the area of the}} conical connection, and there was an absolute congruity without any microgaps between abutment and implant. No line was visible separating the implant and the abutment. On the contrary, in the screwed abutment implants, numerous gaps and voids were present. Conclusions: The results of this study support the hypothesis that different types of implant-abutment joints are responsible for the observed differences in bacterial penetration...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the pen-implant soft tissues and the amount of inflammatory cells around two different implant-abutment connections (self-locking conical connection with platform switching and screwed connection with standard abutment and internal anti-rotational system). Histological analysis was made of 14 implants, 7 with self-locking <b>Morse</b> <b>tapered</b> connection (experimental group A) and 7 with screw-retained anti-rotational connection (control group B). Sixty days after non-functional immediate loading, pen-implant tissue biopsies were performed. In the samples taken from the experimental group the pen-implant connective tissue consisted of a greater density of collagen and fibroblasts compared to the connective tissue of the control group. The experimental group specimens showed less inflammatory infiltrate close to the self-locking tapered connection compared to the tissues around the screw-retained connection. The SEM observations showed less microgap in the self-locking conical connection than in the screw connections with standard abutment and internal anti-rotational system. The presence of connective tissue with few inflammatory cells and the absence of inflammatory infiltrate, in self-locking conical connection implants is due to the minimal size of the implant-abutment microgap that does not allow the passage of fluids and bacteria from the oral cavity to the implant thus preventing tissue inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Stable crestal bone {{levels are}} {{believed}} to be critical for the long-term implant success. After implant insertion and loading, crestal bone usually remodels to a level about 2. 0 mm apical to the the implant–abutment junction in two-piece implants. This could be lead to a localized inflammation of the peri-implant tissues. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the clinical outcomes of cone connection implants and zirconia restorations on peri-implant tissues. Methods: 91 Morse cone connection implants (Ankylos® Dentsply Friadent, Mannheim, Germany) were inserted in 53 patients, ranging in age between 27 and 65 years old, to correct partial or single edentulisms. After an healing period of 2 months, the implants were loaded, for 1 month with resin provisional prosthesis and then with Zirconia core fixed partial dentures and were monitorized every 3 months for 2 years. The crestal bone height was evaluated with digital standardized radiographs; mSBI, mPlI, suppuration or gingival enlargment were recorded to study soft tissue conditions. Results: Mean crestal bone loss at interproximal surfaces was ≤ 0, 5 mm. Stable bone above the implant shoulder was detected in case of subcrestal positioning of the implant. No infrabony pockets were present. mPlI≤ 1 and mSBI≤ 1 were recorded regardless of patient smoking or hygene habits; no suppurations or gingival enlargments were observed. Conclusions: It has been claimed that <b>morse</b> <b>tapered</b> abutment connection provides high resistance to micromotion and bacteria infiltration and that Zirconia provocs lower inflammatory level in surrounding tissues than titanium. Clinical outcomes seem to confirm reduced inflammatory manifestation of peri-implant soft and mineralized tissues using this kind of implant-prosthesis...|$|R
5000|$|NMTB is a [...] "self releasing" [...] or [...] "fast" [...] taper. Unlike {{the more}} acute self holding tapers above, such tapers are not {{designed}} to transmit high torque; high torques are carried by driving keys engaging slots on the flange. The purpose is to allow a quick and easy change between different tools (either automatically or by hand) while ensuring the tool or toolholder will be tightly and rigidly connected to the spindle, and accurately coaxial with it. The larger end adjacent to the tool makes for more rigidity than is possible with <b>Morse</b> or RT <b>tapers</b> fitted to comparable machines.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Morse</b> <b>taper</b> {{was invented}} by Stephen A. Morse in the mid-1860s. Since then, it has evolved to {{encompass}} smaller and larger sizes and has been adopted as a standard by numerous organizations, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO 296 and the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) as DIN 228-1. It {{is one of the}} most widely used types, and is particularly common on the shank of taper-shank twist drills and machine reamers, in the spindles of industrial drill presses, and in the tailstocks of lathes.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Morse</b> <b>taper</b> {{allows the}} bit to be mounted {{directly}} into the spindle of a drill, lathe tailstock, or (with the use of adapters) into the spindle of milling machines. It is a self-locking (or self holding) taper of approximately 5/8" [...] per foot that allows the torque {{to be transferred to}} the drill bit by the friction between the taper shank and the socket. The tang {{at the end of the}} taper is only for ejecting the drill bit from the spindle, with the aid of a drift.|$|E
50|$|Extended-reach or long-series drills are {{commonly}} called aircraft-length from their original use in manufacturing riveted aluminum aircraft. For bits thicker than a minimum size such as 1/8 inch, {{they are available}} in fixed lengths such as 6, 8, 12, or 18 inches rather than the progressive lengths of jobber drills. The image shows a long-series drill compared to its diametric equivalents, all are 11/32 in in diameter. The equivalent <b>Morse</b> <b>taper</b> drill shown in the middle is of the usual length for a taper-shank drill. The lower drill bit is the jobber or parallel shank equivalent.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{the entire}} {{tailstock}} is {{moved to the}} approximate position {{that it will be}} needed by manually sliding it along its ways. There, it is locked in place and the tool mounted to it is moved with a leadscrew to the exact position where it is needed. When a cutting tool such as a drill bit or reamer is used, the feed is done with this leadscrew. The tailstock quill or extendible portion usually has a <b>Morse</b> <b>taper</b> mount in the end of it to secure the drill or reamer. If the work is heavy the drill may be further secured from turning with a lathe dog as shown in the photo.|$|E
5000|$|Morse tapers come {{in eight}} sizes {{identified}} by whole numbers between 0 and 7, and one half-size (4 1/2 - very rarely found, and not {{shown in the}} table).Often the designation is abbreviated as MT followed by a digit, for example a <b>Morse</b> <b>taper</b> number 4 would be MT4. The MT2 taper is the size most often found in drill presses up to [...] " [...] capacity. Stub (short) versions, the same taper angle but a little over half the usual length, are occasionally encountered for the whole number sizes from 1 through 5. There are standards for these, which among other things are sometimes used in lathe head stocks to preserve a larger spindle through-hole.|$|E
5000|$|At {{one end of}} the bed (almost {{always the}} left, as the {{operator}} faces the lathe) is a headstock. The headstock contains high-precision spinning bearings.
