25|$|The new {{agreement}} {{did not last}} long. On November 7, just 41 days later, the Teamsters union {{said it would not}} repudiate the contracts it had signed. But the UFW now had too few resources and membership to do <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The UFW deployed its best strategic weapon, the boycott, and kept up the push for a national boycott of grapes, wine and lettuce. The Teamsters reiterated their pledge to uphold their contracts in November.|$|E
25|$|Having escaped prosecution, Clodius {{attained}} the aedileship for 57 BC. He {{then started}} proceedings against Milo for inciting violence, the same charge Milo had brought against him. He {{did not expect}} conviction as Milo had many powerful allies, including Cicero and Pompey. He used this to attack both his followers and Pompey. He got his supporters to taunt Pompey in the assemblies. Pompey could not do <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He also continued his attacks on Cicero. The latter claimed that his transitio ad plebem was illegal and so were the laws he had passed, including the one that sanctioned his exile. Clashes between the two factions continued.|$|E
25|$|During the Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC) the Lucanians and Bruttii {{sided with}} Pyrrhus and {{provided}} contingents which fought with his army. When Pyrrhus landed in Italy {{the people of}} Rhegion were worried about their safety and asked Rome for protection. The Romans sent soldiers from Campania to garrison the city. Coveting {{the wealth of the}} city, the soldiers killed its prominent men, sent away the rest and seized their property. The Romans could not do <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> because they were engaged in the war. A few {{years after the end of}} the war, in 271 BC, the Romans retook the city, arrested the soldiers and took them to Rome, where they were executed. After Pyrrhus was defeated, to avoid Roman revenge, the Bruttii submitted willingly and gave up half of the Sila, a mountainous plateau which was valuable for its pitch and timber. The timber here was sold all over Italy and the resin of the area was of the highest quality.|$|E

[...] This request was the same year that prosecutors say he agreed to start paying hush money to the person he allegedly committed misconduct against. John told the New York Times that [...] "I did not think <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at the time, but looking back at it, it does seem strange. He just said he needed to generate some cash." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna talk too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I was just gonna stew on it, {{and then do}} it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E
500|$|Leiber remembered {{initially}} finding Presley [...] "not quite authentic—after all, {{he was a}} white singer, and my {{standards were}} black." [...] According to Stoller, the duo was [...] "surprised at the kind of knowledge that he had about black music. We figured that he had these remarkable pipes and all that, but we didn't realize that he knew {{so much about the}} blues. We were quite surprised to find out that he knew as <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as we did. He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music." [...] Leiber remembered the recording process with Presley, [...] "He was fast. Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes." [...] As Stoller recalled, Presley [...] "was 'protected'" [...] by his manager and entourage. [...] "He was removed. ... They kept him separate." ...|$|E

[...] Jagger said of the lyrics, [...] "It's weird where your lyric things come from. On Tumbling Dice, I {{sat down with the}} house keeper and talked to her about gambling.

500|$|He starred as {{psychiatrist}} Craig [...] "Huff" [...] Huffstodt in the Showtime {{drama series}} Huff, which ran for two seasons between 2004 and 2006, airing 24 episodes. Azaria {{served as an}} executive producer {{on the show and}} directed an episode of its second season. After reading the pilot script, he sent it to Platt, who took the role of Huff's friend Russell Tupper. Azaria enjoyed working on the show, but struggled with the bleak subject matter and was often in dispute with its creator Bob Lowry, noting that it [...] "was tough to marry our visions all the time, [...] we both cared so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> that neither of us were willing to let go." [...] Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly called Azaria [...] "impressively subtle" [...] in the role, while John Leonard of New York magazine said he was a [...] "shrewd bit of casting." [...] The show garnered seven Emmy nominations in 2005, including a nomination for Azaria for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Despite the awards, the show continually received low ratings, and Showtime chose not to commission it for a third season.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{in their}} review said that [...] "uneven pacing and tone mar an {{intriguing}} cautionary tale. This collaboration, completed before Clarke's death last March, would've made a better solo project for either author." [...] The Washington Post said that [...] "The Last Theorem {{reads like a}} dog-eared album of favorite themes from yesteryear", referring to Clarke and Pohl topics from the authors' earlier works. Thomas M. Wagner at SF Reviews wrote that [...] "The Last Theorem is a book I really resent not liking, because there's so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> that deserves to be liked." [...] He said that the first two-thirds is [...] "so good ... it almost, but doesn't quite, {{make up for the}} nonsense that overtakes the whole affair at the climax." [...] Wagner felt that the meeting of [...] "two disparate storytelling sensibilities" [...] was [...] "far less harmonious and compatible" [...] than Clarke and Pohl may have imagined. Wagner summed up by saying that [...] "The Last Theorem is not simply an uneven novel. It's a deeply disjointed one, a book that introduces a host of wonderful ideas and sympathetic, believable characters, only to decide it doesn't trust them to carry off the story in the end, ultimately falling back – disastrously – on dated and dubious formula." [...] Sheila Merritt at SciFi Dimensions said that while it should have been [...] "a fine tribute and a fitting farewell to this master of science fiction", {{it turned out to be}} an [...] "easy book to put down." [...] She said that the plot [...] "meanders in fits and starts" [...] and that the book is too long for the story it tells. Ed Park of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the first third of the book, but said that for the rest, its [...] "winning and winking self-consciousness evaporates." [...] He wondered how stable the manuscript was when it was published, and added that it does nothing to [...] "burnish the legacy of either of its authors." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Democrats {{have also}} had a candy desk since at least 1985. A rolltop desk located on the front wall, {{belonging}} to the United States Senate Democratic Conference Secretary, is also filled with sweets.
