Prior {{to the second}} servicing mission, Hubble used three 1970s-style reel-to-reel tape recorders. During the second servicing mission, one of these mechanical recorders was replaced with a digital solid state recorder. During this mission a second <b>mechanical</b> <b>recorder</b> {{was replaced by a}} second Solid State Recorder. The new recorder could hold approximately 10 times as much data as the old unit (12 gigabytes instead of 1.2 gigabytes). The recorder weighs 11.3 kg and is 12 by 9 by 7 inches in size.|$|E

40|$|When an {{ionizing}} particle or radiation enters the sensitive volume of a counter {{an avalanche of}} electrons is formed by the process known as ionization by collisions. In general a counter is operated with the central wire positive {{with respect to the}} cylinder, and consequently the electrons are collected by the wire. A negative voltage pulse is thus developed. On the wire, the size of which depends upon the capacitance of the wire system and the magnitude of the collected charge. The duration and form of the pulse will depend upon the characteristics of the particular counter usedand upon the time constant of the receiving system. In general each {{ionizing particle}} produces a voltage pulse, and it is the function of the associated electrical circuits to record these pulses and thus count the number of particles entering the sensitive volume of counter. The size of the voltage pulse varies with the counter and the type of particle being detected, but the pulses can be increased to the necessary size to actuate scaling and recording devices by means of an amplifier. For counters operating in the Geiger region the pulse size is independent of the type ofionizing agent being detected, providing the voltage across the counter is kept constant, as the counter voltage is increased the pulse size varies over a considerable range until the voltage is reached at which the counter goes into continuous discharge. In consequence, for use in conjunction with different counters, working at various operating potentials, an amplifier with variable gain is necessary. The amplifier can then be set to give a suitable output pulse to the following circuits independently {{of the size of the}} input pulse. For slow counting rates the counter and amplifier can be used directly in conjunction witha suitable <b>mechanical</b> <b>recorder.</b> Many counters have recovery times as short as 10 seconds and correspondingly high counting rates. Amplifiers can be designed with RC time constants as short as 10 seconds or less, so that the results are not affected by the amplifying stage. On the other hand mechanical recorders have comparatively long time constants and if used directly would seriously decrease the possible counting rate. This is avoided by the use of electrical scaling circuits which pass on only a certain proportion of the pulses to the recording circuit. In this case the recovery time and counting rate of the whole system is governed entirely by the characteristics of the counter itself. The pulses from the last stage of the scaling circuit pass on to the recording circuit. It is the function of this circuit to use these pulses to operate some <b>mechanical</b> <b>recorder.</b> The pulses are not usually able to influence the counter directly, and so a hard valve or thyratron is used in conjunction with a telephone or Cenco counter. It will be seen from the above discussion that the electrical circuits needed for use in association with a Geiger counter are as follows 1. Voltage supply circuits for amplifier, scaling and recording circuits. 2. Pulse amplifier. 3. Scaling circuit. 4. Recording circuit. 5. Stabilised high voltage supply for Geiger counter. The arrangement of these circuits will be such as is shown in block form in diagram I. <p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bio-logging {{devices have}} become an {{integral}} part of many studies on the behav-ior, physiology and ecology of marine vertebrates. In the beginning, 1963, a time depth recorder (TDR) was designed to measure time and depth of freely diving Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddellii, in the Antarctic. This was the first device used to obtain detailed information on underwater activity of an aquatic animal. It recorded data for one hour. Since that time there has been a steady evolution of this type of recorder. In 1975 a revised TDR with an extended time base of 14 days recorded the diving activity of the northern fur seal, Callorhinus ursinus. Through the rest of the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s other fur seal species, as well as Weddell seals, and leather back sea turtles were studied, and the inventive pace of the TDR quickened. In 1981 an elegant <b>mechanical</b> <b>recorder</b> that lasted for three months was deployed. The emergence of microprocessors in the 1980 ’s made possible further miniatur-ization and the logging of several additional variables. The next revolution occurred in the 1990 ’s with the inception of satellite transmitters that made it possible to determine precise-ly where an animal was on the planet, and to retrieve other data as well. This remarkable abil-ity to incorporate the measurement of spatial distribution was soon augmented by a third rev-olution, the use of mountable videocameras or camcorders on the animals themselves. With this arsenal of bio-logging devices many questions about aquatic animals are being resolved that were only dreams for the first generation of biologists studying the marine activities of vertebrates. key words: archival recorder, bio-logger, camcorder, TDR, PT...|$|E

25|$|Edison was a {{prolific}} inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, {{as well as}} many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. More significant than the number of Edison's patents was the widespread impact of his inventions: electric light and power utilities, sound recording, and motion pictures all established major new industries worldwide. Edison's inventions contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a <b>mechanical</b> vote <b>recorder,</b> a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution to homes, businesses, and factories – a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York.|$|R

50|$|When a well plan {{dictates}} {{the drilling}} of a straight borehole, surveys are periodically taken {{to ensure that}} it will hit its target and also {{to ensure that it}} does not trespass underneath different property lines. These surveys can be taken fairly simply with a <b>mechanical</b> drift <b>recorder</b> more commonly known as a Totco or Totco barrel (named after the company that perfected the device). This device is run inside the drill string attached to a wire on a wireline unit, {{down to the bottom of}} the drill pipe where the device (which is simply an inverted pendulum with a timer that punches a pin-hole onto a round paper tab delineated with concentric circles indicating increments of degrees) measures the angle of the hole and then is pulled back out to visually inspect to determine the angle. There are versions of this device that actually take a picture on film and are often used in situations where the azimuth (direction) needs to be determined also.|$|R

In addition to gas {{flow metering}}, the RTU also provides some local, self-contained, site control such as well shut-in in the event of abnormal gas flow conditions.

40|$|The {{measured}} data and various analysis approaches described {{were able to}} qualitatively reveal whether the AC was oversized or not but exact quantification was not possible. The same held true {{in terms of being}} able to identify the presence of human behavior on thermostat operation (and thus, on whole-house electricity peaks). Consequently, we were unable to quantitatively determine the amount of peak shaving potential in these houses. Severe capacity problems are experienced by electric utilities during hot summer afternoons. Several studies have found that, in large part, electric peak loads can be attributed to residential airconditioning use. This air-conditioning peak depends primarily on two factors: (i) {{the manner in which the}} homeowner operates his air-conditioner during the hot summer afternoons, and (ii) the amount by which the air-conditioner has been over-designed. Whole-house and air-conditioner electricity use data at 15 minute time intervals have been gathered and analyzed for 8 residences during the summer of 1991, six of which had passed the College Station Good Cents tests. Indoor air temperatures were measured by a <b>mechanical</b> chart <b>recorder,</b> while a weather station located on the main campus of Texas A&M university provided the necessary climatic data, especially ambient temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} practical recording technologies {{were entirely}} <b>mechanical</b> devices. These <b>recorders</b> typically used a large conical horn {{to collect and}} focus the physical air pressure of the sound waves produced by the human voice or musical instruments. A sensitive membrane or diaphragm, located {{at the apex of}} the cone, was connected to an articulated scriber or stylus, and as the changing air pressure moved the diaphragm back and forth, the stylus scratched or incised an analogue of the sound waves onto a moving recording medium, such as a roll of coated paper, or a cylinder or disc coated with a soft material such as wax or a soft metal. These early recordings were necessarily of low fidelity and volume, and captured only a narrow segment of the audible sound spectrum — typically only from around 250 Hz up to about 2,500 Hz — so musicians and engineers were forced to adapt to these sonic limitations. Bands of the period often favored louder instruments such as trumpet, cornet and trombone, lower-register brass instruments (such as the tuba and the euphonium) replaced the string bass, and blocks of wood stood in for bass drums; performers also had to arrange themselves strategically around the horn to balance the sound, and to play as loudly as possible. The reproduction of domestic phonographs was similarly limited in both frequency-range and volume — this period gave rise to the expression [...] "put a sock in it", which commemorates the common practice of placing a sock in the horn of the phonograph to muffle the sound for quieter listening. By the end of the acoustic era, the disc had become the standard medium for sound recording, and its dominance in the domestic audio market lasted {{until the end of the}} 20th century.|$|R
