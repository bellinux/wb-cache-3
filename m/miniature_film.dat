500|$|The {{idea for}} a film was {{in the mind of}} {{director}} Shinichirō Watanabe during the development of the original Cowboy Bebop series, which he had originally envisioned as a film. Watanabe treated each episode of the series as a <b>miniature</b> <b>film,</b> so to progress onto a feature-length film seemed natural to him. So as not to disappoint fans, the film incorporated as much of the series as possible while making it accessible to newcomers. He had thought up some of the story and the character of Vincent during the production of the series. After the series ended and there was worldwide demand for a continuation, the decision was made by the series creators to make a film. Watanabe was aiming towards a live-action look for the film despite its medium, using camera tricks, visual effects and character expression impossible in the series while keeping [...] "the Bebop flavor". According to Kōichi Yamadera, the Japanese voice actor for Spike, the only real changes made by the team in the portrayal were to show off the characters, including Spike, in different ways: Spike, in particular, displayed more of his inner thoughts and showed a gentler side than he did in the series, as there was more time available to express such details. Watanabe personally chose the voice actors for Elektra and Vincent. Vincent was partially intended as a type of villain that could not be done in the series, even though Watanabe felt he was not [...] "particularly unique".|$|E
5000|$|During {{the summer}} of the film's release, Kool-Aid had a tie-in where Kool-Aid points could be {{redeemed}} for a red Jetsons car featuring the cast. However, the promotion was not carried by some theaters, and instead of a red Jetsons car, the points were redeemed for a <b>miniature</b> <b>film</b> poster. Wendy's restaurants had a Jetsons kids' meal tie-in. When clips were shown on television, scenes with George had re-dubbed lines from an unnamed voice actor. The commercials showed Wendy's founder Dave Thomas either in a theater watching the movie or at his restaurant promoting the film. A tie-in simulator ride titled [...] "The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera" [...] opened at Universal Studios Florida one month before the movie's release. In it, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera state that the Jetsons will star in their next project (presuming the film), which angers Dick Dastardly and Muttley and causes them to kidnap Elroy, and Yogi Bear and Boo-Boo Bear must save him by riding through the worlds of The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, and The Jetsons, and Dastardly and Muttley are arrested. Merchandise based on the film and other Hanna-Barbera-related stuff was sold at the ride's gift shop. Also in 1990, Ralston released an apple and cinnamon-flavored Jetsons Cereal.|$|E

40|$|Mass {{miniature}} radiography {{surveys in}} a factory producing artificial grinding wheels detected cases of pneumoconiosis, mostly of the silicotic type. All cases were traced to the department where the so-callec "bond " is prepared and mixed with the abrasive grains of carborundum and artificial corundum. This ceramic-vitrified bond, similar in composition to English general earthenware, contained until recently {{a significant proportion of}} free silica. The <b>miniature</b> <b>film</b> survey was followed up by an investigation on full-sized films, in which 92 % of all workers in the bond department participated. The radiographs were subjected to dual independent viewing and it was found that 66 % of the men who had worked in the bond department for more than 10 years showed radiological evidence of pneumoconiosis with a high proportion of progressive massive fibrosis (P. M. F.) Recently the amount of free silica in the ceramic bond has been reduced by the introduction of "frits " in place of powdered flint and part of the factory has been rebuilt and new methods of dust suppression and dust extraction have been introduced.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} by Watanabe {{as an extension}} of his work on the television series, which he treated as a series of <b>miniature</b> <b>films.</b> So as not to alienate fans of the series, a large amount of aesthetic material was incorporated, while also adjusting it to make it accessible to newcomers. Increased budget and production facilities enabled the use of filming styles associated with live action films and a higher animation quality than the series. Arabic thematic elements were incorporated to contrast against the series, which entailed Watanabe traveling to Morocco for research. The Arabic atmosphere was also used in Kanno's music.|$|R

40|$|The Story of Jennifer and Kevin McCoy is an {{on-going}} {{project in}} which we restage scenes from our lives as they intersect media and culture. The pieces consist of <b>miniature</b> <b>film</b> sets, dozens of live miniature cameras with computerized switches, and video projection. For our fellowship period, we intend to develop site-specific installations {{as part of this}} series of works. To date, we have completed stand-alone sculptures using a similar form and one site-specific work that has ignited our interest. This piece is installed at JFK's Terminal 5 and uses the architecture of the space as a backdrop for our miniature scenes. In new site-specific sculptures, we intend to research and develop strategies for the wireless transmission of images across farther distances, enabling the scattering of the fragmentary physical scenarios across larger and more unorthodox exhibition venues. In our proposed project, we will miniaturize narrative fragments, some from our lives and some from fictional scenarios. These parts are crosscut and interwoven to create a highly mediated form of autobiography in which our personal mythologies are made indistinguishable from our experience as spectators of media. Formally, we are interested in the difference between the three dimensional unrealistic space of the models and the realistic simulation the computers and cameras can create. Motors are also used in this work to further the sense of cinematic illusion...|$|E

The artists created a <b>miniature</b> <b>film</b> set in which the remote audiences acted and directed their own movie, transporting participants into animated environments and sets where they created personalized unique narratives. All the World’s a Screen was a site-specific work allowing the public audiences to engage and interact directly within the installation, merging urban environments with networked audiences, and creating an otherworldly space on-screen where people could interact with others across the two cities, allowing the participants to explore alternative networked spaces. For Charlotte Gould and Paul Sermon this immersive interactive installation represented an exciting new departure from their existing practice. Pushing the boundaries of telematic art and generative cinema, All the World’s a Screen combined the possibilities of telepresent performance with miniature scale-models and animated scenes; through audience participation it explored the way narratives may be revealed through the interplay between artist, audience and environment. With key features of the telematic stage, user generated performances and the dramaturgy of networked communication this project referenced Shakespeare’s infamous line ‘All the world’s a stage’ with seven rooms of a model film set (relating to the seven ages of man in Shakespeare’s As You Like It), thus providing a metaphysical backdrop to steer the unfolding plot. This project was co-hosted by the Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona MACBA Study Centre and on-going research and community building took place throughout the project to generate growing public attention around the research and the final development of the installation...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{possible}} effects of sodium carbonate dust on the lower respiratory passages. A large alkali industry, {{with a number of}} works, was used for an investigation of lime and soda ash dusts evolved during the process. The physical and chemical characteristics of these dusts and details of the type of work and environmental conditions are described. In 1954 and 1956 a survey was made of respiratory sickness absence, chest radiographic appearance, and respiratory function in workers employed in areas with exposure to soda ash, lime dust, and no dust. All were interrogated about their smoking habits. In 1954 there was found to be a significant reduction in expiratory flow rate of workers in dusty jobs in soda ash compared with the group not exposed to dust but this result was nullified in a random sample group in 1955 and in full groups in 1956. Respiratory sickness absence was found to be slightly greater in workers in dusty occupations, particularly in lime dust. No pneumoconiosis was detected on <b>miniature</b> <b>films.</b> The survey of smoking habits revealed that smoking was associated with a definite decrease in the expiratory flow rate, particularly after the age of 40 in heavy smokers.

5000|$|A {{myth that}} was put to rest in cinematographer Oswald Morris' autobiography, Huston, We Have a Problem, is that no {{full-length}} whale models were ever built for the production. Previous accounts have claimed {{that as many as}} three 60-foot rubber [...] "white whales" [...] were lost at sea during filming, making them [...] "navigational hazards". In fact the titular whale shown in the film was constructed by Dunlop in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Moby Dick was 75 ft long and weighed 12 tons, and required 80 drums of compressed air and a hydraulic system in order to remain afloat and operational. However the artificial whale came loose from its tow-line and drifted away in a fog. Peck confirmed in 1995 that he was aboard the prop. According to Morris, after the prop was lost the Pequod was followed by a barge with various whale parts (hump, back, fin, tail). 90% of the shots of the white whale are various size <b>miniatures</b> <b>filmed</b> in a water tank in Shepperton Studios in London. Whales and longboat models were built by a special effects man, August Lohman, working in conjunction with art director Stephen Grimes. Studio shots also included a life-size Moby jaw and head - with working eyes. The head apparatus which could move like a rocking horse was employed when actors were in the water with the whale. Gregory Peck's last speech is delivered in the studio while riding the white whale's hump (a hole was drilled {{in the side of the}} whale so Peck could conceal his real leg).|$|R
