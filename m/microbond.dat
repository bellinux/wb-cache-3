40|$|The <b>microbond</b> test is {{a method}} which is {{sometimes}} used for measuring interfacial shear strength. In {{the analysis of the}} data it is often assumed that the interfacial shear stress is constant and thus, by implication, that the strain in the fibre along the embedded fibre decreases linearly from the point of entry to the point of exit. In this paper the results of conventional <b>microbond</b> tests and simulated <b>microbond</b> tests performed under a Raman microscope on a Kevlar- 49 /epoxy system are reported. The conventionally performed tests show that the calculated interfacial shear strength for this system is approximately 16 MPa regardless of the position of the supporting knife edges. The strain distribution along the fibre during simulated <b>microbond</b> tests was studied as a function of knife edge position, interfacial area and level of load by means of Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the interfacial shear stress was not constant, as is frequently assumed, but was strongly dependent upon distance through the droplet, knife-edge position and applied load. At low loads the strain was a maximum {{at the point where the}} fibre entered the droplet and then dropped off sharply through the embedded length.

First, the stress state of the interface and its evolution upon aging were studied for the <b>microbond</b> geometry. This stress analysis was used with experiments to determine an intrinsic interfacial shear strength. Second, this stress analysis, including aging effects, was used in a fracture mechanics or energy release rate analysis of the <b>microbond</b> test, which involves the energy necessary to propagate a crack instead of the minimum stress to initiate a crack. These methods were tested for both freshly cured and aged epoxy droplets on glass fibres, and were shown to yield similar results. It was found that neither the interfacial shear strength nor the interfacial toughness were changed by physical aging of the polymer matrix when the relaxation of internal stresses and shift of relaxation times of the matrix due to physical aging were accounted for.

40|$|Several methods, such as pull-out, <b>microbond</b> and push-in/push-out tests, {{have been}} {{developed}} to test interfacial adhesion in composite materials. Some of them can only be applied to single-fibre matrix composites, like the <b>microbond</b> test, and others are difficult to perform on brittle fibres due to premature fracture of the fibre. Push-in tests, consisting of pushing the fibre with a micro- or nanoindenter on a bulk specimen, constitute a powerful technique that can be applied directly to composite laminates. However, the interfacial adhesion values obtained from different tests (<b>microbond,</b> push-in) often differ and even the results from one type of test are subjected to a large scatter.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{has focused on}} {{achieving}} a micromechanical understanding of the <b>microbond</b> test, which involves pulling a fiber out of a bead of matrix (i. e. droplet) through a knife-edge, in order to quantify the interfacial fracture properties of fiber-reinforced composites. According to the <b>microbond</b> test results for carbon-fiber and epoxy-resin system, matrix cracking occurred during the fiber pullout, {{in addition to the}} debonding at the fiber–matrix interface. Therefore, in evaluating the fracture properties of the fiber–matrix interface, we should pay attention to the coupling effects of matrix failure and interfacial debonding on the test results. Then, we discuss how to best extract the interfacial properties while excluding the influence of matrix plasticity and cracking, using numerical simulations. The key mechanism demonstrated here is that the pullout force, in the cases where the influence of matrix cracking is negligible, appears as the upper limit among the experimental data of the pullout force for a constant initial embedded length of the fiber in the matrix. For this reason, the upper-limit data all over the range of embedded fiber length in experiments can be reasonably evaluated by the simulation focusing on the debonding process with matrix plasticity. This evaluation technique is effective as a way of extracting interfacial properties appropriately from <b>microbond</b> test results...|$|E
40|$|Single fibre {{tensile testing}} and <b>microbond</b> testing {{have been used}} to {{benchmark}} the influence of silane coupling agents on the performance of glass fibre for reinforced epoxy resin composites.

This poster will focus on a key component in the formation of that interphase, the fibre surface sizing and in particular on the critical role of the silane used in these sizings. It is thought that these coupling agents can directly control the stress transfer capability of the interphase and also play a defining role in the long term performance of composites- through their influence on adhesion and fibre strength. Glass fibre samples were coated with single and blended silanes and these fibres were characterised by single fibre testing for strength and modulus. The effect on interfacial strength in epoxy resin has been measured using the <b>microbond</b> test.

The applications of these laboratory developed techniques are demonstrated by characterisation of the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of glass fibre-polypropylene (GF-PP) and natural fibre-polylactic acid (NF-PLA). The comparison of the IFSS between neat and modified GF-PP showed that both methods were sensitive to the interfacial performance change despite the poor agreement between them for the absolute IFSS values from the same composite. The effect of the material modification was also reflected in load-displacement curves with different behaviour of the frictional motion after complete debonding.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ultra high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber has advanced mechanical properties and excellent physical properties that include high effectiveness for cosmic radiation shielding, which is valuable for outer space missions. Unfortunately, poor interface in UHMWPE fiber–polymer composites hinders the structural integrity and safety, and restricts its effectiveness for the radiation shielding. In this study, {{we focus on the}} improvement of the adhesion property between the UHMWPE fiber and resin matrix by developing a nano-epoxy matrix through making a modification on the matrix with reactive graphitic nanofibers (r-GNFs).

40|$|The {{interfacial}} shear strengths {{between two}} kinds of mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers and epoxy resin matrix were respectively measured by <b>microbond</b> test. The forces when microdebonding occurring between resin microdroplets and carbon fibers {{were obtained from the}} load-displacement curve,and the morphologies of debonded microdroplets and carbon fibers were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Then,the average interfacial shear strength,standard deviation and coefficient of variation for samples were quantitatively calculated. Moreover,the relationships between interfacial shear strength and the lengths, diameters of microdroplets, carbon fiber diameter were analyzed. The results show that interfacial shear strength is proportional to the ratio of length-to-diameter of the resin microdroplet,and inversely proportional to the carbon fiber diameter,to the ratio of the microdroplet length-to-carbon fiber diameter,and to the ratio of the microdroplet diameter-to-carbon fiber diameter...|$|E
