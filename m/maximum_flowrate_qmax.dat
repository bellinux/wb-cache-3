In this paper, we test whether these design rules apply to microscale valveless micropumps using highly resolved CFD calculations.

The effect that the modeling of the wicking limitation of the capillary structure in the liquid return artery of an AMTEC PX-SB series cell has on cell performance was investigated. Preliminary evaluation of an AMTEC PX-SB computational model that predicts cell performance revealed that it did {{not take into account the}} effect that the maximum capillary pumping pressure rise has on performance. Starting with that model, enhancements were made to the program code to model the effect that the <b>maximum</b> <b>flowrate</b> limitation of the capillary structure has on predicted cell performance. It was found that for the AMTEC PX-SB series cell, inclusion of the limitation of the <b>maximum</b> <b>flowrate</b> of the capillary structure had no effect on performance predictions. Sodium flowrates required by the cell, at the tested conditions, were below the maximum capability of the capillary structure, therefore the limitation was not reached and so had no effect on the predicted performance of the cell. For hot-side cell temperatures from 1023 K to 1273 K, the required Socrates ranged from 1. 73 E- 06 to 7. 64 E- 06 kg/s, which were below the capillary structure's maximum wicking capability will be a limitation on AMTEC cell performance if the required flowrate of the cell exceeds the capillary structure's <b>maximum</b> <b>flowrate.</b> This enhanced model will be of benefit to AMTEC cell design variations that require sodium flowrates that exceed the maximum capability of their capillary structures at some operating conditions...|$|R

The mathematical model predicted the gas temperature gradient and the distribution of pressure and velocity standing waves. Owing to the use of a much simplified combustion model, {{it was not possible to}} predict the acoustic energy required to determine the amplitude and frequency of oscillation.

A siphonic system allows roof runoff to quickly reach its <b>maximum</b> <b>flowrate.</b> In contrast to a conventional system the siphonic approach to roof drainage aims to exclude air and to induce the full bore flow conditions required for siphonic action. This means that the filling and priming times are more efficient and quicker than for a conventional gravity-fed roof drainage system.

It has been reported that the application of aircraft deicing fluid (ADF) to planes can result in as much as 96 % of the total glycol used being lost in the runoff. Since glycol has a very high chemical oxygen demand (COD), the resulting runoff will exert a high COD regardless of dilution.

Very similar results were presented for the two models besides the Matlab being of simpler origin, and having no inclusion of energy balances compared to the Hysys model.

The system was configured in a cross flow set up and effects of pH, feed flowrate and operation time were explored in relation to the membrane performance (rejection and flux). Acid mine collected from site had a very high concentration of Iron (1. 055 mg/L), sulphate (3639. 301 mg/L) and high levels of hardness due to magnesium ions (523. 011 mg/L).

The second mold, (device 2), was fabricated from the use of fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3 D printing. The pumping efficiency of the PDMS devices was analyzed through the characterization of the micro-pumps flowrate with respect to the pumps driving pressure and the actuation frequency. Tested at a driving pressure of 10 psi, the flowrate for device 1 peaked at 75 µL/min with a 7 Hz actuation frequency before failing, while device 2 peaked at 498 µL/min with a 15 Hz actuation frequency. Using the techniques of rapid prototyping and fused deposition modelling a pneumatically actuated 3 D printer based micro-pump and micro-mixer are fabricated. The devices were fabricated using a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) material as an alternative material to the present polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The micro-pump’s fluid flow output was analyzed through the characterization of the micro-pumps flowrate with respect to the pumps driving pressure and the actuation frequency.

40|$|The active fog {{catching}} senior {{project team}} {{has been asked to}} develop a device that will harvest water from the atmosphere, namely fog, using active means. The project will be centered on maximizing water collection rate, with efficiency as a secondary concern. The final design utilizes a refrigeration system in which fans pull air across the cold evaporators inside of a duct. Water condenses on the evaporators and drain into a collection container. It was decided to focus on maximizing water collection at the cost of efficiency because the feasibility of actively harvesting fog must be proved before trying to make the system efficient. A Copeland condensing unit that provides 2, 490 Btu/min of heat transfer from the evaporator to the incoming fog is used in tandem with three expansion valves and four evaporators. Two Vernier expansion valves will allow the system to be finely adjusted while a third ball valve is used to coarsely adjust the flowrate. In addition, temperature and pressure gauges will be used to monitor the performance of the system and add additional control over the system. Speed controllers are connected in series to the fans in order to allow for variable flowrate. For testing, the system was placed in a high humidity environment and the fans were set to run at a predetermined flowrate. The Vernier expansion valves were adjusted until the first couple coils were frosting and the kWh consumption of the system was monitored using a watt meter. The results showed that the optimal flowrate for this system was between 140 - 150 cfm. In addition, it was discovered that pulsing the fans (toggling between the set point <b>flowrate</b> and the <b>maximum</b> <b>flowrate</b> for a brief period of time) would promote condensate to form droplets and drip out of the evaporators.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} {{improving}} the flowrate of the Knudsen gas pump. The Knudsen pump uses thermal transpiration as the driving mechanism to pump gas. It is a motionless gas pump as the pump {{does not require}} any moving actuators for pumping. The thermally driven gas flow is accomplished in the molecular or transitional gas flow regime. The advantage of this pump is that without any moving parts it avoids friction losses and stiction problems which devices in micro scale are prone to suffering due to scaling issues. Thus, this pump is highly robust and reliable. Knudsen pumps {{in the past have}} suffered from the drawback of low flowrates and inability to operate at atmospheric pressure. In the early days lack of micromachining technologies limited minimum channel size which had to be operated at lower than atmospheric pressure to achieve free molecular flow. Various designs have been implemented with an impetus on increasing the flowrate of the pump. The key to this pump is establishing a temperature difference {{along the length of the}} channel. A higher temperature difference over a shorter channel length makes the pump more efficient. Pump channels have been made out of various materials like silicon, glass and polymer. The silicon microfabricated single channel conventional design pump suffered from the high thermal conductivity of silicon, which limited the thermal gradient that could be achieved. Silicon was replaced by glass, which has a lower thermal conductivity. The glass micro fluidic pump could pump water in reservoirs but at a slow rate. Renewable forms of Knudsen pump were also made by using nanoporous silica colloidal crystals which are robust and could use solar energy and body heat to create a temperature difference and achieve pumping. The pump powered by body heat produced a maximum pressure differential of 1. 5 kPa. However, the use of these pumps is restricted to certain applications due to slow pumping. The polymer material, made of mixed cellulose ester, has a very low thermal conductivity, which aids in maintaining a higher temperature difference between the ends of a channel to achieve a higher flowrate. The polymer material used is in the form of a nanoporous template which has numerous pores each of which acts as a pump and thus the pump 2 ̆ 7 s conductance to gas flow is also increased which makes it faster. The pore sizes range from 25 nm to 1200 nm. It has been proven that a smaller channel diameter pump is more efficient. Efficiency decreases as the channel size approaches viscous flow regime. The initial design used a resistive heater to actively heat one end of the channel and a heat sink was used to passively cool the other end of the channel. This design was ineffective in achieving a significant temperature difference for a decent flowrate with the materials like silicon and glass. The conventional Knudsen pump design using a porous polymer matrix as channel material attained a normalized <b>maximum</b> no load <b>flowrate</b> of 135 µL/min-cm 2 at 3. 81 Watts of input power. This number is low compared to other micropumps. This led to the use of a thermoelectric material, which could actively heat and cool the pump channel ends and provide a much higher temperature difference over the same channel length as compared to the conventional Knudsen pumps which used only active heating of the channel 2 ̆ 7 s hot side. The thermoelectric strategy also eliminates the need for a heat sink in the pump. This transforms the design to bi-directional modes of operation. The first design using thermoelectrics is a lateral design in which the pump channels closer to the thermoelectric element developed a higher temperature difference across them compared to the channels away from the thermoelectric element. Thus, the thermoelectric energy was underutilized. Changing to the radial design made the pump more efficient compared to the lateral design since the thermoelectric energy was uniformly distributed on all the pump channels. The radial design also reduced air gap resistances and minimized energy losses which enhanced the output for the same input power. At an input power of 4. 18 Watts it achieved a normalized no load flowrate of 408 µL/min-cm 2. It also recorded a <b>maximum</b> normalized <b>flowrate</b> of 1. 5 mL/min-cm 2 while moving a drop of water which to date is the <b>maximum</b> <b>flowrate</b> reported by any Knudsen pump. A theoretical model has been developed to compute the pump 2 ̆ 7 s efficiency based on the flowrate and pressure difference obtained by the pump. The efficiency of the radial design pump with the thermoelectric is higher when compared to a conventional pump using a resistive heater whose channels are also made from the same material as that of the thermoelectric pump...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSewer {{deposits}} {{have been}} identified as a major cause of dysfunctions in combined sewer systems regarding sewer management, which induces different negative consequents resulting in poor hydraulic conveyance, environmental damages as well as worker’s health. In order to overcome the problematics of sedimentation, flushing has been considered as the most operative and cost-effective way to minimize the sediments impacts and prevent such challenges. Flushing, by prompting turbulent wave effects, can modify the bed form depending on the hydraulic properties and geometrical characteristics of the conduit. So far, the dynamics of the bed-load during high-flow events in combined sewer systems as a complex environment is not well understood, mostly due to lack of measuring devices capable to work in the “hostile” in combined sewer system correctly. In this regards, a one-episode flushing issue from an opening gate valve with weir function was carried out in a trunk sewer in Paris to understanding its cleansing efficiency on the sediments (thickness: 0 - 30 cm). During more than 1 h of flushing within 5 m distance in downstream of this flushing device, a <b>maximum</b> <b>flowrate</b> and a <b>maximum</b> level of water have been recorded at 5 m in downstream of the gate as 4. 1 m 3 /s and 2. 1 m respectively. This paper is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this type of gate for around 1. 1 km (from the point - 50 m to + 1050 m in downstream from the gate) by (i) determining bed grain-size distribution and sediments evolution through the sewer channel, as well as their organic matter content, and (ii) identifying sections that exhibit more changes in their texture after the flush. For the first one, two series of sampling were taken from the sewer length and then analyzed in laboratory, one before flushing and second after, at same points among the sewer channel. Hence, a non-intrusive sampling instrument has undertaken to extract the sediments smaller than the fine gravels. The comparison between sediments texture after the flush operation and the initial state, revealed the most modified zones by the flush effect, regarding the sewer invert slope and hydraulic parameters in the zone up to 400 m from the gate. At this distance, despite the increase of sediment grain-size rages, D 50 (median grain-size) varies between 0. 6 mm and 1. 1 mm compared to 0. 8 mm and 10 mm before and after flushing, respectively. Overall, regarding the sewer channel invert slope, results indicate that grains smaller than sands (< 2 mm) are more transported to downstream along about 400 m from the gate: in average 69 % before against 38 % after the flush with more dispersion of grain-sizes distributions. Furthermore, high effect of the channel bed irregularities on the bed material evolution has been observed after the flush...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of an adiabatic two-phase gas-liquid Row {{through a}} duct with a constant cross-sectional area is studied from a thermodynamics point of view. By assuming the two-phase mixture as homogeneous, {{the treatment of}} the physical conservation laws makes it possible to obtain an analytical equation of the fluid evolution which expresses the difference between the Fanno and the isothermal evolutions. On the basis of its differential form and the second principle of thermodynamic, the properties of this flow are discussed. The determination of the Fanno limit shows the existence of a maximum length of the duct, For a length greater than this maximum one, the flow is no more possible. One shows that this maximum length {{is a function of the}} mass quality as well as the initial conditions, i. e. the inlet state variables and the inlet velocity. The results are systematically verified by considering the limit of a single phase ideal gas flow. The theory allows to understand and to justify the existence of the so-called multichoked flow, It is applied to the two-phase flow through discharge lines involving geometrical singularities (sudden enlargement for example). The proposed model is validated on the basis of experimental data obtained for quasi steady-state discharges of pure nitrogen and water-nitrogen mixture through a complex pressure relief line involving several abrupt enlargements. The critical configuration and the <b>maximum</b> mass <b>flowrate</b> as well as the variables of the flow (pressure and temperature) predicted from the model are in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) {{is the most}} environmentally friendly coal-fired power generation technology that offers near zero green house gas emissions. This technology has higher thermal efficiency compared to conventional coal-fired power generation plants and uses up to 50 % less water. This work involves the optimization of IGCC power plants by applying process integration techniques to maximize the use of energy available within the plant. The basis of this project was the theoretical investigations which showed that optimally designed and operated IGCC plants can achieve overall thermal efficiencies in the regions of 60 %. None of the current operating IGCC plants approach this overall thermal efficiency, with the largest capacity plant attaining 47 %. A common characteristic {{in most of these}} IGCC plants is that an appreciable amount of energy available within the system is lost to the environment through cold utility, and through plant irreversibility to a smaller extent. This work focuses on the recovery of energy, that is traditionally lost as cold utility, through application of proven process integration techniques. The methodology developed comprises of two primary energy optimization techniques, i. e. pinch analysis and the contact economizer system. The idea behind using pinch analysis was to target for the <b>maximum</b> steam <b>flowrate,</b> which will in turn improve the power output of the steam turbine. An increase in the steam turbine power output should result in an increase in the overall thermal efficiency of the plant. The contact economizer system is responsible for the recovery of low potential heat from the gas turbine exhaust en route to the stack to heat up the boiler feed water (BFW). It was proven in this work that a higher BFW enthalpy results in a higher overall efficiency of the plant. A case study on the Elcogas plant illustrated that the developed method is capable of increasing the gross efficiency from 47 % to 55 %. This increase in efficiency, however, comes at an expense of increased heat exchange area required to exchange the extra heat that was not utilized in the preliminary design.

40|$|A 3 -D {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model was developed to describe and predict the temperature profiles of palletised polylined kiwifruit packages undergoing forced-air cooling. The geometrical configuration of the kiwifruit, polyliner and cardboard box were explicitly modelled. The model included the effects of natural convection on the airflow behaviour and heat transfer process occurring within the packed fruits inside the polyliner. The capability of the model to predict the fruit temperatures in each package was quantitatively validated against experimental data. A laboratory scaled experimental rig was used to monitor the forced-air cooling process of a half pallet of kiwifruit boxes under controlled operating conditions. The numerical model was able to predict cooling times within experimental error. Cooling within the pallet was primarily influenced by air temperature {{and to a lesser}} extent airflow distribution into each package. A <b>maximum</b> recommended volumetric <b>flowrate</b> through the pallet of 0. 34 L kg(- 1) s(- 1), far lower than flowrates recommended for the cooling of non-polylined produce, was identified. Successive increases to the flowrate, particularly beyond 0. 34 L kg(- 1) s(- 1), resulted in increasingly diminished reductions (< 12 %) to cooling rate. Within the polyliner there was a low transfer of energy between kiwifruit and kiwifruit surrounding air. Instead cooling was reliant on the air temperature flowing over the top of the polyliner.

40|$|As {{a member}} of the Space Suit Assembly Development Engineering Team, I {{designed}} and built test equipment systems to support the development of the next generation of advanced space suits. During space suit testing it is critical to supply the subject with two functions: (1) cooling to remove metabolic heat, and (2) breathing air to pressurize the space suit. The objective of my first project was to design, build, and certify an improved Space Suit Cooling System for manned testing in a 1 G environment. This design had to be portable and supply a minimum cooling rate of 2500 BTU/hr. The Space Suit Cooling System is a robust, portable system that supports very high metabolic rates. It has a highly adjustable cool rate and is equipped with digital instrumentation to monitor the flowrate and critical temperatures. It can supply a variable water temperature down to 34 deg., and it can generate a <b>maximum</b> water <b>flowrate</b> of 2. 5 LPM. My next project was to design and build a Breathing Air System that was capable of supply facility air to subjects wearing the Z 2 space suit. The system intakes 150 PSIG breathing air and regulates it to two operating pressures: 4. 3 and 8. 3 PSIG. It can also provide structural capabilities at 1. 5 x operating pressure: 6. 6 and 13. 2 PSIG, respectively. It has instrumentation to monitor flowrate, as well as inlet and outlet pressures. The system has a series of relief valves to fully protect itself in case of regulator failure. Both projects followed a similar design methodology. The first task was to perform research on existing concepts to develop a sufficient background knowledge. Then mathematical models were developed to size components and simulate system performance. Next, mechanical and electrical schematics were generated and presented at Design Reviews. After the systems were approved by the suit team, all the hardware components were specified and procured. The systems were then packaged, fabricated, and thoroughly tested. The next step was to certify the equipment for manned used, which included generating a Hazard Analysis and giving a presentation to the Test Readiness Review Board. Both of these test support systems will perform critical roles in the development of nextgeneration space suits. They will used on a regular basis to test the NASA's new Z 2 Space Suit. The Space Suit Cooling System is now the primary cooling system for all advanced suit tests...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{systematic}} plantwide procedure of Skogestad (2004) {{is applied to}} two processes; 1 - Post-combustion CO 2 capturing processes, 2 - Natural gas to liquid hydrocarbons (GTL) plants, in order to design economically efficient control structures, which keep the processes nearoptimum when disturbances occur. Because of the large magnitude of energy consumption in both these processes, optimal operation is of great importance. The self-optimizing concept, which {{is the heart of}} the plantwide procedure is used to select the right controlled variables in different operational regions, which when they are kept constant, indirectly give the operation close to optimum. The optimal is to reconfigure the self-optimizing control loops when the process is entered into a new active constraint region, but we try to arrive at a simple/single control structure, which does not need switching, where a reasonable loss in operating economic objective function is accepted. The CO 2 capturing process studied here is an amine absorption/stripping system. The chosen objective function for this process is first to minimize the energy requirement while fixed CO 2 recovery of 90 % is met. This leads to one unconstrained degree of freedom. Maximum gain rule is applied and a temperature close to the top of the stripper is found as the best controlled variable. Further, we introduce penalty on CO 2 amount released to the atmosphere, and this results in two unconstrained degrees of freedom. CO 2 recovery and a temperature close to the top of the stripper are found as the best individual controlled variables in low feedrate. In higher flue gas flowrates, stripper heat input saturates and the self-optimizing method is repeated to select the right controlled variable for the remaining degree of freedom. We validate the propose control structures using dynamic simulations, where 5 different alternatives including decentralized control loops and multivariable controller are studied. We finally achieve a simple control structure, which handles a wide range of change in throughput and keeps the process close to optimum without the need for switching the control loops or updating the controlled variables setpoints by a costly real time optimizer. The GTL process modeled in this thesis includes an auto-thermal reformer (ATR) for synthesis gas production and a slurry bubble column reactor (SBCR) for the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactions. The FT products distribution is determined using a well-known Anderson- Schultz- Flory (ASF) model, where carbon component in CO (consumption rate is found based on the proposed rate by Iglesia et al.) is distributed to a range of hydrocarbons. ASF is a function of chain growth probability and the chain growth is a function of H 2 /CO ratio. We study different scenarios for chain growth and we arrive at a suitable model for optimal operation studies. The optimal operation is considered in two modes of operation. In mode I, natural gas feedrate is assumed given and in mode II, natural gas feedrate is also a degree of freedom. After optimization, in both modes, there are three unconstrained degrees of freedom. The best individual self-optimizing controlled variables are found and since the worst-case loss value is rather notable, combination of measurements is done, which reduces the loss significantly. Mode II happens when oxygen flowrate capacity reaches the maximum and we show that operation in mode II in this case is in snowballing region where operation should be avoided. Operation at <b>maximum</b> oxygen <b>flowrate</b> capacity is where maximum practical profit can be achieved. PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Engineerin...|$|R
