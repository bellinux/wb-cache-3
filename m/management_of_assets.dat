40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 This study {{involves}} {{establishing the}} suitability of the Kaizen Model on the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>assets</b> in the SARB. The goal {{is to show that}} the Kaizen Model could enhance the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>assets</b> in the SARB. This has been done through a literature review, empirical study and hypothesis testing. The literature review indicated that implementation of the Kaizen Model could help to eliminate none value-adding activities and ensure that standard processes are continuously adjusted. Hence its implementation would influence frequent revisiting of the standardised process, which results in the identification of gaps in the process and adjustment thereof to be in line with the changing working environment. Overall conclusion based on the respondents analysis indicated that implementation of the Kaizen Model will eliminate non-value adding activities which would enable all phases <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> mangement processes (including acquistion and disposal processes) to be adjusted to the changing working environment, which will result in fixed asset process improvement. Four hypotheses results analysis indicated suitability of the Kaizen Model on the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the SARB. Hence implementation of the Kaizen Model should result in improvement of service provided and will also foster teamwork which will contribute positively to the achievement of intended goals.
