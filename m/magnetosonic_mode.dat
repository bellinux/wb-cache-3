In {{the limit of}} low temperature (vs&rarr;0), the wave becomes a modified Alfvén wave. Because the phase velocity of the <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode</b> is almost always larger than vA, the magnetosonic wave is often called the [...] "fast" [...] hydromagnetic wave.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{radiative}} energy loss on {{the stability of}} compressible plasma in coronal loops is studied. By taking the limit as poloidal wavenumber m approaches infinity, stability conditions for local modes are derived. It {{was found that the}} radiation effect can trigger MHD instabilities of coronal loops which are in ideally marginally stable states. Compressibility is a stabilizing effect for ideal MHD local modes because the compression of magnetic field lines exerts a restoring force by increasing magnetic pressure. Compression of plasma induces two modes in a radiatively unstable plasma, <b>magnetosonic</b> and condensation <b>modes.</b> Compressibility affects the stability of ideally stable (or unstable) coronal plasmas through <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes,</b> which are a stabilizing (destabilizing) effect for ideally stable (unstable) plasmas. For coronal plasmas in ideally marginally stable states, condensation as well as <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes</b> can trigger MHD instability. Because of these two modes, the effect of radiation on compressible coronal plasmas is more destabilizing than it is on incompressible plasmas when the plasmas are in ideal MHD unstable or marginally stable states...|$|R
30|$|As a {{possible}} trigger of the substorm onset, the ballooning instability has been often suggested. The ballooning disturbances in a finite-pressure plasma immersed into a curved magnetic field are described {{with the system}} of coupled equations for the Alfven and slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes.</b> The spectral properties of ballooning disturbances and instabilities can be characterized by the local dispersion equation. The basic system of equations {{can be reduced to}} the dispersion equation for the small-scale in transverse direction disturbances. From this relationship the dispersion, instability threshold, and stop-bands of the Alfvenic and slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes</b> have been determined. The field-aligned structure of unstable mode is described with the solution of the eigenvalue problem in the Voigt model. We have also analyzed in a cylindrical geometry an eigenvalue problem for the stability of ballooning disturbances with a finite scale along the plasma inhomogeneity. The account of a finite scale in the radial direction raises the instability threshold as compared with that in the WKB approximation.|$|R

In {{the context of}} liner perturbations, {{it is found that}} there appear two wave modes corresponding to a slow phase velocity and a fast phase velocity as is resembled to those in isotropic plasmas. For the fast phase velocity mode, pressure perturbations and field perturbations exhibited paramagnetic relations, similarly to isotropic plasmas. For the slow phase velocity mode, paramagnetic properties appear, unlike the isotropic case, at higher plasma beta part of lower pressure anisotropy (perpendicular/parallel) region...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{analytical}} and numerical {{results of the}} stability analysis of the accretion disk at the inner boundary is presented. Including the effect of finite conductivity in the disk dynamics, a simple calculation considering only the radial perturbation has been carried out. Within local approximation, it is concluded that the disk is stable to Kelvin-Helmholtz and resistive electro-magnetic modes whereas the <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode</b> can destabilise the disk structure...|$|E
30|$|The ionospheric cavity {{with minimum}} of VA(z) works {{not only as}} a {{resonator}} for Alfven waves, but as a waveguide for the <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode</b> also. The waveguide magnetosonic modes excited by the magnetospheric (Fujita and Tamao, 1988) or atmospheric (Pilipenko et al., 2005) sources can propagate to large distances (up to few thousand km) along the ionosphere. In the frequency domain the ionospheric wave guidance manifests itself as an occurrence of low-frequency cut-off corresponding to the waveguide critical frequency (lower than the IAR fundamental frequency).|$|E

A theoretical discussion is given on how these observations can be interpreted {{in terms of the}} characteristic frequency of compressional Pc 3 - 4 magnetic pulsations in the magnetosphere, based on the well-established ion cyclotron resonance mechanism between <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode</b> of low-frequency upstream waves and narrowly reflected ion beams in the earth's foreshock...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{compressibility}} on the propagation and resistive dissipation properties of magnetohydrodynamic waves in nonuniform media is studied {{by using a}} normal mode analysis. We concentrate on wave models for which the resistivity acts over the entire system, thus excluding localized resonant absorption. We identify the wave modes in nonhomogeneous situations in term of their familiar homogeneous counterparts and show that only the shear Alfven and slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes</b> survive in the resistive regime. The most promising heating agents in the astrophysical context are shown to be the shear Alfven waves that behave almost incompressibly...|$|R
40|$|The {{so-called}} {{electrical power}} generation problem for {{exploration of the}} outer planets could be solved deploying an electrodynamic tether. Wave radiation by a conductor carrying a steady current in a polar, highly eccentric, low perijove orbit, as in the planned NASA Juno mission, is considered. The high Jupiter's oblateness produces fast apsidal precession over the meridional plane. In a cold plasma model, radiation occurs in the Alfven and Fast <b>Magnetosonic</b> <b>modes,</b> exhibiting large refraction index. The radiation impedance in both modes is determined for a representative arc in the orbits. Unlike the Earth ionospheric case, the low-dense and highly-magnetized Jovian plasma makes the electron-gyrofrequency to plasma-frequency ratio large [1]; this substantially modifies the power spectrum in either mode...|$|R
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of simultaneous ionospheric Doppler sounding and ground magnetometer observations of low-latitude Pi 2 waves is revised. We compare the theoretical {{estimates of the}} ionospheric Doppler velocity for the same amplitude of the ground magnetic disturbances produced by a large-scale compressional mode and an Alfvén mode. The plasma vertical displacement caused by the wave electric field is shown to be the dominating effect. Taking into account the correction of the previous paper, the observations of low-latitude Pi 2 in the F layer ionosphere by Doppler sounding and SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network) radars give consistent results. We suggest that the Doppler response to Pi 2 waves is produced by the Alfvén wave component, but not the fast-mode component, whereas the ground magnetic signal is composed from both Alfvén and fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R

The data are also used to study the ring current evolution and variations of ion compositions, which are necessary for understanding how ion distributions modify the magnetic field configuration during geospace storms (e.g., Nose et al. 2005).|$|E
30|$|Qualitative {{nature of}} the density {{response}} to the magnetic field fluctuation is in a positive correlation sense like fluctuations in the fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode.</b> The positive correlation sense is observed both in the low-beta and high-beta foreshock plasmas. Examples are displayed in Fig.  1 for a low-beta plasma and in Fig.  2 for a high-beta plasma.

Only few events exhibit barely negative slope values. There is a systematic trend in the diagram for the total fluctuations that the slope of the linear relation is steeper at lower values of β̃ (below unity) and flatter at higher values of β̃ (above unity). The slope can virtually uniquely be mapped to a given value of β̃.|$|E
40|$|We obtain {{dispersion}} {{relations of}} magnetic field fluctuations for two crossings of the terrestrial foreshock by Cluster spacecraft. These crossings cover plasma conditions that differ significantly in their plasma β {{and in the}} density of the reflected ion beam, but not in the properties of the encountered ion population, both showing shell-like distribution function. Dispersion relations are reconstructed using two-point instantaneous wave number estimations from pairs of Cluster spacecraft. The accessible range of wave vectors, limited by the available spacecraft separations, extends to ≈ 2 × 104 km. Results show multiple branches of dispersion relations, associated with different powers of magnetic field fluctuations. We find that sunward propagating fast magnetosonic waves and beam resonant modes are dominant for the high plasma β interval with a dense beam, while the dispersions of the interval with low beam density include Alfvén and fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes</b> propagating sunward and anti-sunward. ...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of dispersive turbulence in magnetized plasmas {{based on the}} Hall-MHD description are presented, assuming spatial variations along a unique direction making a prescribed angle with the ambient magnetic field. Main observations concern the energy transfers among the different scales and {{the various types of}} MHD waves, together with the conditions for the establishment of pressure-balanced structures. For parallel propagation, Alfvén-wave transfer to small scales is strongly inhibited and rather feeds <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes,</b> unless the effect of dispersion is strong enough at the energy injection scale. In oblique directions, the dominantly compressible character of the turbulence is pointed out with, for quasi-transverse propagation, the presence of conspicuous kinetic Alfvén waves. Preliminary {{simulations of}} a Landau fluid model incorporating relevant linear kinetic effects reveal the development of a significant plasma temperature anisotropy leading to recurrent instabilities.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown that deferentially {{rotating}} disks {{that are in}} the presence of weak axial magnetic field are prone to a new nonlinear explosive instability. The latter occurs due to the near-resonance three-wave interactions of a magnetorotational instability with stable Alfven-Coriolis and <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes.</b> The dynamical equations that govern the temporal evolution of the amplitudes of the three interacting modes are derived. Numerical solutions of the dynamical equations indicate that small frequency mismatch gives rise to two types of behavior: 1. explosive instability which leads to infinite values of the three amplitudes within a finite time, and 2. bounded irregular oscillations of all three amplitudes. Asymptotic solutions of the dynamical equations are obtained for the explosive instability regimes and are shown to match the numerical solutions near the explosion time.

Naively speaking, {{the sense of the}} density fluctuation can be correlated to that of the magnetic field fluctuation like in the fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode</b> or anti-correlated like in the slow mode or in the mirror mode. Various mechanisms are possible to cause the density fluctuations in association with the magnetic field, e.g., linear mode waves (magnetohydrodynamic waves), kinetic instabilities (mirror mode under temperature anisotropy), beating or modulation of the wave, ponderomotive force (pinching of the plasma by large-amplitude fluctuation), and shock and shocklet formation.|$|E

From observations of steepened wave forms, it is found that the waves must be propagating toward the sun but are blown back across the ICE spacecraft. The correlation between magnetic field magnitude and electron density enhancements indicates that these waves are fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode</b> emissions.

30|$|In panels (b) and (c), chorus {{waves at}} a few hundred Hz to a few kHz are {{detected}} outside the plasmapause where the ambient density is low, and both lower-band and upper-band chorus waves are sometimes clearly observed. There are several periods when the frequency of chorus emissions is relatively low compared to the local half gyrofrequency because the satellite traverses off the equatorial plane. Inside the plasmapause, whistler mode hiss waves are observed. Panel (d) presents a frequency-time diagram of the low-frequency electric fields covering the ULF and ELF ranges. Several electrostatic waves are observed, and the banded emissions at 70  Hz at about 23 : 00 UT are <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode</b> waves (equatorial noise).|$|E

For the plasma pressure dominated regime, or high β regime (with β the ratio between fluid and magnetic pressure), {{and for the}} magnetic pressure dominated regime, or low β regime, we study magnetic field fluctuations parallel and perpendicular to a guide magnetic field B_ 0. In the low β case we find excitation of compressible and incompressible fluctuations, with a transfer of energy towards Alfvénic modes {{and to a lesser}} extent towards <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes.</b> In particular, we find signatures of the presence of fast magnetosonic waves in a scenario compatible with that of weak turbulence. In the high β case, fast and slow magnetosonic waves are present, with no clear trace of Alfvén waves, and a significant part of the energy is carried by two-dimensional turbulent eddies...|$|R
40|$|A {{conducting}} body {{embedded in}} a magnetized plasma flow may interact with the medium {{in a variety of}} ways. Within a MHD description, {{it is well known that}} the currents induced within the satellite can be closed in the plasma by standing Alfv•n waves attached to it. However, we show that such a simple model (when viewed in the massive satellite rest frame) cannot satisfy continuity of mass, momentum or energy fluxes. The imbalance is due to the neglect of other plasma disturbances, i. e., the fast and slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes.</b> In this paper we introduce a slow magnetosonic wake and find that a suitable solution can redress the balance demanded by continuity to a large extent. The full solution, including the fast magnetosonic wave, remains an outstanding problem.

We employ a source-term adaptation and two-fluid extension of the second-order high-resolution central scheme of Balbas et al. (2004) [1]. The model employed is a 2 D extension of that used by Baboolal and Bharuthram (2007) [5] in studies of 1 D shocks and solitons in a two-fluid plasma under 3 D electromagnetic fields. Further, we outline the use of free-flow boundary conditions to obtain stable wave structures over sufficiently long modelling times.

3000|$|The {{resonant}} mode coupling of MHD waves {{is one of}} the most fundamental processes in space science and has become an important concept for understanding almost all aspects of ULF waves. Prof. Tamao (Professor Emeritus, Univ.

40|$|The {{eigenmode}} {{spectrum of}} the ultra low frequency (ULF) waves in the Earth magnetosphere is discrete and consists of Alfvén and slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes.</b> Their interaction depends on ionospheric conductivity and the magnetic field curvature. We present the physical conditions of resonant ULF waves realization obtained for different wave polarization types. ULF waves with poloidal polarization are strongly coupled to slow magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. The magnetic field pressure oscillates with 180 ° phase shift {{with respect to the}} plasma pressure. Thus, for such coupled waves the partial pressure compensation is observed. The crucial influence of the background magnetic field shear on the poloidal modes is shown. The toroidal field line resonant ULF waves do not have magnetic pressure and plasma pressure perturbations. Results presented in this paper are common for the ULF waves in the Earth's magnetosphere and include different scale disturbations. The verification of the obtained conditions with parameters of waves collected in the Earth's magnetosphere ULF is carried out by use of AMPTE/CCE and Equator-S data.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} low-frequency {{electromagnetic}} waves upstream of the Saturn bow shock {{have shown that}} these waves, in contrast to those at Earth, are observed not in one, but in at least two, distinct frequency bands. The results of wave mode identification based on the Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of plasma and observed wave polarization suggested that these waves propagate in the high beta intermediate mode. However, the underlying instability was not unambiguously determined. In the present paper we use the full electromagnetic dispersion relation derived from linear Vlasov theory {{in order to examine}} which of the plasma modes, with observed properties, are unstable in an isotropic Maxwellian plasma in the presence of backstreaming proton beams consistent with Voyager 2 observations at Saturn. As a result we find that the unstable 'Alfvenic' beam mode, as well as resonant and non-resonant fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes</b> have properties consistent with the data. Moreover, we find that in contrast to the Earth's upstream waves, at Saturn no 'kinetic' normal mode can account for the observed magnetic polarization...|$|R

Numerical analysis is performed by using a simple box model, taking account of the anisotropically conducting ionosphere and the insulating atmosphere. Owing to limited capacity of a computer, the effect of the ionospheric Hall current is discussed. We obtained the following results : (1) The mode conversion effect due to the Hall current gives rise to resonant coupling when the azimuthal wave number is zero (the azimuthal direction is referred to the direction perpendicular to the plane of the box model). (2) The Alfven mode perturbation is enhanced along the resonant field line {{but in the case of}} the fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode</b> the enhancement does not occur...|$|E

One example is seen around 23 UT, the banded emissions at ~  70  Hz (<b>magnetosonic</b> <b>mode</b> waves). The waveforms of such waves should be compared with their magnetic counterpart. Since the waveform and the spectrum with enough spectral resolution at a frequency of less than 200  Hz are not provided by OFA-E, EFD is requested to provide this information. Although the sensitivity of EFD is limited by its lower gain and low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 100  Hz, the capability is still effective if the wave amplitudes are strong enough.|$|E

This paper presents two-dimensional hybrid simulations of the energy cascade among the fast waves {{in the vicinity of}} the proton inertial scale. The initial spectrum consists of modes propagating in the positive direction, defined by the mean magnetic field, and is allowed to evolve freely in time. The plasma beta is set to low values typical of the solar corona. The cascade proceeds from lower to higher wavenumbers and mostly in the direction across the magnetic field. The highly oblique fast waves are strongly dissipated on the protons. The resulting proton heating is preferentially perpendicular to the magnetic field.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the linear stability {{properties of the}} plane interface separating two relativistic magnetized flows in relative motion. The two flows are governed by the (special) relativistic equations for a magnetized perfect gas in the infinite conductivity approximation. By adopting the vortex-sheet approximation, the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations are linearized around the equilibrium state and the corresponding dispersion relation is derived and discussed. The behavior of the configuration and the regimes of instability are investigated following the effects of four physical parameters, namely: the flow velocity, the relativistic and Alfvénic Mach numbers and the inclination of the wave vector on {{the plane of the}} interface. From the numerical solution of the dispersion relation, we find in general two separate regions of instability, associated respectively with the slow and fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes.</b> Modes parallel to the flow velocity are destabilized only for sufficiently low magnetization. For the latter case, stabilization is attained, additionally, at sufficiently large relativistic velocities between the two flows in relative motion.

40|$|International audienceWe analyze coupled Alfvén {{and slow}} magnetosonic {{eigenmodes}} in a dipole geomagnetic field with different ionospheric conductivities {{in the framework}} of ideal magnetic hydrodynamics (MHD) with finite pressure. We use numerical and, if possible, analytical methods to describe eigenmode frequencies, growth rates and eigenfunctions. The spectrum of Alfvén and slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes</b> is discrete and equidistant. The frequencies of the first Alfvén and slow magnetosonic eigenmodes are estimated as ~ 1 Hz and ~ 1 mHz, respectively. In the case of finite conductivity, periodic and aperiodic modes are separated and their interaction analyzed. It was shown that periodic and aperiodic perturbations can mutually transform into each other. A new flute stability criterion is derived (?~ 4. 25), which is stricter than the Gold criterion (?= 20 / 3). Here, as usual, ?=? L/p dp/dL.

40|$|Linear {{instability}} of two equilibrium configurations with either poloidal (I) or toroidal (II) dominant magnetic field components are studied in thin vertically-isothermal Keplerian discs. Solutions of the stability problem are found explicitly by asymptotic expansions {{in the small}} aspect ratio of the disc. In both equilibrium configurations the perturbations are decoupled into in-plane and vertical modes. For equilibria of type I those two modes are the Alfvén-Coriolis and sound waves, while for equilibria of type II they are the inertia-Coriolis and magnetosonic waves. Exact expressions for the growth rates {{as well as the}} number of unstable modes for type I equilibria are derived. Those are the discrete counterpart of the continuous infinite homogeneous cylinder magnetorotational (MRI) spectrum. It is further shown that the axisymmetric MRI is completely suppressed by dominant toroidal magnetic fields (i. e. equilibria of type II). This renders the system prone to either non-axisymmetric MRI or non-modal algebraic growth mechanisms. The algebraic growth mechanism investigated in the present study occurs exclusively due to the rotation shear, generates the inertia-Coriolis driven <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>modes</b> due to non-resonant or resonant coupling that induces, respectively, linear or quadratic temporal growth of the perturbations.
