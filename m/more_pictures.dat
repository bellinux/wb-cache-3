5|$|In {{line with}} the Warner brothers' early {{opposition}} to Nazism, Warner Bros. produced <b>more</b> <b>pictures</b> about the war than any other studio, covering every branch of the armed services. In addition, the studio produced patriotic musicals such as This is the Army and Yankee Doodle Dandy.|$|E
5|$|Tracy drank heavily {{during his}} years with Fox, and gained a {{reputation}} as an alcoholic. He failed to report for filming on Marie Galante in June 1934, and was found in his hotel room, virtually unconscious after a two-week binge. Tracy {{was removed from the}} Fox payroll while he recovered in a hospital, and then sued for $125,000 for delaying the production. He completed only two <b>more</b> <b>pictures</b> with the studio.|$|E

50|$|NTSC is more {{spectrum}} {{efficient than}} PAL, giving <b>more</b> <b>picture</b> detail {{for a given}} bandwidth. This is because sophisticated comb filters in receivers are more effective with NTSC's 4 field color phase cadence compared to PAL's 8 field cadence. However, in the end, the larger channel width of most PAL systems in Europe still give their PAL systems the edge in transmitting <b>more</b> <b>picture</b> detail.|$|R
25|$|Two behind-the-scenes {{videos were}} {{released}} on the serial's YouTube account. The first video {{focuses on the}} filming of Toadie and Sonya's wedding, {{as well as the}} cast's take on the day. The second deals with the aftermath of the explosion. Channel 5 also released some behind-the-scenes photos of the scenes from the storyline on their website. On 26 March, <b>more</b> <b>pictures</b> previewing the scenes were released by the channel.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, The Wachowskis {{presented}} {{the script for}} the film Assassins to Warner Bros. Pictures. After Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two <b>more</b> <b>pictures,</b> Bound and The Matrix, in the contract. The first movie The Wachowskis directed, Bound, then became a critical success. Using this momentum, the siblings later asked to direct The Matrix.|$|E
25|$|Paper Moon, a Depression-era comedy {{starring}} Ryan O'Neal {{that won}} his 10-year-old daughter Tatum O'Neal an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress, proved the high-water mark of Bogdanovich's career. Forced {{to share the}} profits with his fellow directors, Bogdanovich became dissatisfied with the arrangement. The Directors Company subsequently produced only two <b>more</b> <b>pictures,</b> Coppola's The Conversation (1974), which was nominated for Best Picture in 1974 alongside The Godfather, Part II, and Bogdanovich's Daisy Miller, which had a lacklustre critical reception.|$|E

25|$|The {{identity}} of the artist is unknown. At some point the portrait was altered to cater to public demand for <b>more</b> <b>pictures</b> of the bard and to conform to 19th century ideas of Shakespeare. The hair over the forehead was scraped out and painted over to create a bald patch. It was also lengthened at the sides, an appearance associated with Shakespeare. The date was also altered to fit Shakespeare's age. The coat of arms was painted over. In this form the painting bore the date 1611 and purported to show Shakespeare {{at the age of}} 47.|$|E
25|$|For many years, {{only one}} {{confirmed}} photograph {{of him was}} known to exist outside North Korea, apparently taken in the mid-1990s, when he was eleven. Occasionally other supposed images of him surfaced but were often disputed. It was only in June 2010, shortly before he was given official posts and publicly introduced to the North Korean people, that <b>more</b> <b>pictures</b> were released of Kim, taken when he was attending school in Switzerland. The first official image of him as an adult was a group photograph released on 30 September 2010, {{at the end of}} the party conference that effectively anointed him, in which he is seated in the front row, two places from his father. This was followed by newsreel footage of him attending the conference.|$|E
25|$|<b>More</b> <b>pictures</b> were {{released}} to the press later in the day. These depicted {{the exterior of the}} Diary Room, this year a chaotic web of sliced and angled mirrors giving housemates a distorted reflection {{of the rest of the}} house. These pictures also showed that the house was composed of one main, column-free, airy room with cream-coloured carpeting on which the dining table rested and an elevated kitchen containing a row of yellow cabinets. For the first time, an American-style refrigerator was utilised, giving the housemates more space for food and located next to the store-room. However, the glass wall that allowed housemates to view the bedroom from the living area was disguised as a mirror to ensure that viewers would not be able to count how many housemates would be in the House. Finally, only a few days before launch night, pictures of a loft in the garden leaked to the press. On Day 1, it was shown that it was painted green rather than the pink shown in the pictures.|$|E

500|$|Poverty Row studios, from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures, Tiffany Pictures, and Sono Art-World Wide Pictures down to shoestring operations, made {{exclusively}} B movies, serials, {{and other}} shorts, and also distributed totally independent productions and imported films. In {{no position to}} directly block book, they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to [...] "states rights" [...] firms, which in turn peddled blocks of movies to exhibitors, typically six or <b>more</b> <b>pictures</b> featuring the same star (a relative status on Poverty Row). Two [...] "major-minors"—Universal Studios and rising Columbia Pictures—had production lines roughly similar to, though somewhat better endowed than, the top Poverty Row studios. In contrast to the Big Five majors, Universal and Columbia had few or no theaters, though they did have top-rank film distribution exchanges.|$|E
500|$|Before {{starting}} the march across the [...] "dreadful terrain," [...] {{the three men}} spent {{a week in a}} tent at the crash site, packing up and making decisions about what and how much to bring and where to go. The far-off North Pole was not mentioned as an option; the choice lay between two depots of food and ammunition laid down for their safety, one at Cape Flora in Franz Josef Land and one at Sjuøyane (Seven Islands) in Svalbard (see map). Inferring from their faulty maps that the distances to each were about equal, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took <b>more</b> <b>pictures</b> during this week than he would at any later point, including 12 frames that make up a 360-degree panorama of the crash site.|$|E

500|$|The next {{films in}} which Lombard {{appeared}} were Henry Hathaway's Now and Forever (1934), featuring Gary Cooper {{and the new}} child star Shirley Temple, and Lady by Choice (1934), which was a critical and commercial success. The Gay Bride (1934) placed her opposite Chester Morris in a gangster comedy, but this outing was panned by critics. After reuniting with George Raft for another dance picture, Rumba (1935), Lombard was {{given the opportunity to}} repeat the screwball success of Twentieth Century. In [...] Mitchell Leisen's Hands Across the Table (1935), she portrayed a manicurist in search of a rich husband, played by Fred MacMurray. Critics praised the film, and Photoplays reviewer stated that Lombard had reaffirmed her talent for the genre. It is remembered as one of her best films, and the pairing of Lombard and MacMurray proved so successful that they made three <b>more</b> <b>pictures</b> together.|$|E
500|$|Julian Lennon {{discovered}} that [...] "Hey Jude" [...] {{had been written}} for him almost 20 years after McCartney composed the song.

We had a great friendship going {{and there seems to}} be far <b>more</b> <b>pictures</b> of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad." [...] In 1996, Julian paid £25,000 for the recording notes to [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at an auction. He spent a further £35,000 at the auction, buying John Lennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon's manager, stated at the time: [...] "He has a few photographs of his father, but not very much else. He is collecting for personal reasons; these are family heirlooms if you like." ...|$|E
