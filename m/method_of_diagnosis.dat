25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 200 million people have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. About 15% of White people in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected.

25|$|Ornithine transcarbamylase is only {{expressed}} in the liver, thus performing an enzyme assay to confirm the diagnosis requires a liver biopsy. Before molecular genetic testing was commonly available, {{this was one of}} the only methods for confirmation of a suspected diagnosis. In cases where prenatal diagnosis was requested, a fetal liver biopsy used to be required to confirm if a fetus was affected. Modern molecular techniques have eliminated this need, and gene sequencing is now the preferred <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> in asymptomatic family members after the diagnosis has been confirmed in a proband.|$|E
500|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{is typically}} diagnosed {{based on the}} presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing. It {{can be difficult to}} confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems. The McDonald criteria, which focus on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evidence of lesions at different times and in different areas, is the most commonly used <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> with the Schumacher and Poser criteria being of mostly historical significance. While the above criteria allow for a non-invasive diagnosis, some (...) state that the only definitive proof is an autopsy or biopsy where lesions typical of MS are detected.|$|E

2500|$|EEG is {{most often}} used to {{diagnose}} epilepsy, which causes abnormalities in EEG readings.

EEG used to be a first-line <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> for tumors, stroke and other focal brain disorders, but this use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT).

60|$|We were sitting--a {{little group}} of us--round about {{the fire in}} a {{comfortable}} corner of the Steam and Air Club. Our talk had turned, as always happens {{with a group of}} professional men, into more or less technical channels. I will not say that we were talking shop; the word has an offensive sound and might be misunderstood. But we were talking as only a group of practising plumbers--including some of the biggest men in the profession--would talk. With the exception of Everett, who had a national reputation as a Consulting Barber, and Thomas, who was a vacuum cleaner expert, I think we all belonged to the same profession. We had been holding a convention, and Fortescue, who had one of the biggest furnace practices in the country, had read us a paper that afternoon--a most revolutionary thing--on External Diagnosis of Defective Feed Pipes, and naturally the thing had bred discussion. Fortescue, {{who is one of the}} most brilliant men in the profession, had stoutly maintained his thesis that the only <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> for trouble in a furnace is to sit down in front of it and look at it for three days; others held out for unscrewing it and carrying it home for consideration; others of us, again, claimed that by tapping the affected spot with a wrench the pipe might be fractured in such a way as to prove that it was breakable. It was at this point that Thornton interrupted with his remark about never being willing to accept a cellar case.|$|E
