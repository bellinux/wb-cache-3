5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{brought to}} the fore the {{simmering}} hostility between regular officers and reservists. Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if {{that could be done}} at the expense of an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, so <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better.</b> They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E

25|$|The {{letters of}} Alfred Newton include one {{to his brother}} giving an {{eye-witness}} account of the debate, and written {{less than a month}} afterwards. Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought he had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event. The general view was and still is that Huxley got <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.|$|E
500|$|In {{their first}} League match for three weeks, Small Heath played out a 1–1 draw with Sheffield United. Wheldon's {{positional}} sense left him free {{to receive a}} pass from Mobley and score after only five minutes, and then the game went from end to end, both sides attacking but failing to score. Full-back Fred Jones turned up late, but once he did take the field he was kept busy by the Sheffield forwards. The visitors had <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> of the second half; [...] "shot after shot rained upon the Small Heath goal, {{and it was only}} by swarming round Charsley that the Coventry road men kept the ball out." [...] With 11 minutes left, the ball was dribbled from the goal-line into midfield, then passed from flank to flank before a cross from Drummond found Davies who scored the equalising goal.|$|E
500|$|On a {{hard and}} {{dangerous}} playing surface, Small Heath had <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> {{of the game}} against Northwich Victoria. The visitors scored first, which only served to settle the home side. The forwards dominated, {{the remainder of the}} first half being [...] "practically a bombardment of the Northwich goal". After Hallam used his pace to equalise, inside-left Wheldon was actively involved {{in the rest of the}} goals. Hallam just failed to reach the rebound from Wheldon's shot, and full-back Billy Ollis headed home from a Wheldon cross. The same player's shot across goal was tapped in by Walton, and a goal was awarded despite the Northwich goalkeeper's claim that the ball had not crossed the line. Wheldon himself scored the fourth with a [...] "brilliant shot", then he and Hands ran the ball upfield before crossing for Hallam to score with a header. In the second half, Wheldon scored Small Heath's sixth from , before the pace of the game dropped and Northwich scored a consolation with a long-range cross-shot.|$|E

500|$|Although the Spanish {{people had}} {{accepted}} foreign monarchs in the past, they deeply resented the new French ruler. On May 2, 1808, provoked by {{news of the}} planned removal to France of the last members of the Spanish royal family, the people of Madrid rebelled in the Dos de Mayo Uprising. A proclamation issued that day to his troops by Marshal Murat read: [...] "The population of Madrid, led astray, has given itself to revolt and murder. French blood has flowed. It demands vengeance. All those arrested in the uprising, arms in hand, will be shot." [...] Goya commemorated the uprising in his The Second of May, which depicts a cavalry charge against the rebels in the Puerta del Sol square {{in the center of}} Madrid, the site of several hours of fierce combat. <b>Much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> known of the pair, The Third of May illustrates the French reprisals: before dawn the next day hundreds of Spaniards were rounded up and shot, at a number of locations around Madrid. Civilian Spanish opposition persisted as a feature of the ensuing five-year Peninsular War, the first to be called guerrilla war. Irregular Spanish forces considerably aided the Spanish, Portuguese, and British armies jointly led by Sir Arthur Wellesley, who first landed in Portugal in August 1808. By the time of the painting's conception, the public imagination had made the rioters symbols of heroism and patriotism.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the name}} suggests, an {{infected}} mosquito injects a larva into the dog's skin, where it migrates to the circulatory system and takes {{up residence in}} the pulmonary arteries and heart, growing and reproducing to an alarming degree. The effects on the dog are quite predictable, cardiac failure over a year or two, leading to death. Treatment of an infected dog is difficult, involving an attempt to poison the healthy worm with arsenic compounds without killing the weakened dog, and frequently does not succeed. Prevention is <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> course, via heartworm prophylactics which contain a compound which kills the larvae immediately upon infection without harming the dog. [...] Often they are available combined with other parasite preventives.|$|E

2500|$|A disappointingly {{small crowd}} saw Small Heath lose 3–1 to Aston Villa in a benefit match for Ted Devey, the club's longest-serving player and fans' {{favourite}} {{who had been}} in poor health. Both clubs had promised full first teams, but numerous regulars were unavailable, and Small Heath fielded their fourth different goalkeeper of the season, Bill Meates, an amateur signed from Eastbourne a few weeks earlier. Meates kept his place for the next League game, and Hands, who was injured against Bury, Billy Walton and Devey were replaced by Jack Jones, Charlie Izon and Alex Leake, the latter two making their first appearances of the season, as Small Heath were [...] "completely outclassed" [...] by Stoke. The Heathens had <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> of the first half against Aston Villa, and the pace and trickery of the visitors' forwards was thwarted only by the excellence of the home side's defence. The second half was quite the opposite. Meates made two blunders that led to goals, Villa gained and kept the upper hand, and the final score was 4–1.|$|E
2500|$|A {{friendly}} arranged at {{short notice}} at Millwall Athletic attracted few spectators, [...] "the poor form displayed recently by Small Heath causing the fixture to possess but little interest"; Millwall won 9–1. Back in the league, a fine attacking display gave Grimsby Town a 2–0 half-time lead; on change of ends, playing against the wind, Small Heath's performance improved, and Hare scored on the break ten minutes from time, but {{they were unable to}} equalise. In {{the first round of the}} Birmingham Cup, an own goal earned Small Heath a draw at Burton Swifts. The losing run in the League continued with a [...] "sorry show" [...] at Loughborough. The home side's long-ball style effectively disrupted Small Heath's preference for close passing, and the game finished 2–0. At home to Walsall, whom they had beaten 6–1 in the previous meeting, Small Heath had <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> of the first half, with goals from Charlie Izon and Denny Hodgetts, but the visitors equalised after a goalkeeping error, and the final score was 3–3, Walsall being [...] "unlucky in not winning".|$|E
2500|$|Financed by The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, Morrison {{was sent}} on an {{exploration}} journey to New Guinea. He sailed from Cooktown, Queensland {{in a small}} lugger, arriving at Port Moresby after a stormy passage. On 24 July 1883 Morrison with a small party started {{with the intention of}} crossing to Dyke Acland Bay 100 miles (160km) away. Much high mountain country barred the way, and it took 38 days to cover 50 miles. The natives became hostile, and about a month later Morrison was struck by two spears and almost killed. Retracing their steps, with Morrison strapped to a horse, Port Moresby was reached in days. Here Morrison received medical attention {{but it was more than}} a month before he reached the hospital at Cooktown. In spite of his misfortune Morrison had penetrated farther into New Guinea than any previous white man. <b>Much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> for a week in hospital Morrison went on to Melbourne, but he still carried the head of a spear in his body and no local surgeon was anxious to probe for it in the condition of surgery in that day. His youngest sister, whose married name was Evelyn Hilda Gaunt (1877-1967), presented a miniature daily devotional book with an inscription [...] "Ernest with Hilda's love. Geelong College March 1884". She was the youngest sibling and was six years old when she gave the 22-year-old this book before he left Melbourne, for Edinburgh, on 27 March 1884.|$|E
