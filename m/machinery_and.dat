5|$|The {{armistice}} {{that ended}} World War I was signed on 11November 1918. The next day, all Spruce Production Division logging ended, most construction projects were stopped, and sawmill operations were curtailed. Government <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> equipment {{from all over}} the Northwest was shipped back to Vancouver Barracks, and division personnel were quickly discharged from military service. Over $12million worth of logging equipment, sawmill <b>machinery,</b> <b>and</b> other property was eventually sold in a government auction.|$|E

Almost all were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded and captured by the Wehrmacht defending Saint-Nazaire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Industry is the {{foundation}} of national economy and military development, <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> manufacture <b>and</b> production is the main content of industry. Therefore, each country attaches great importance to its own <b>machinery</b> manufacture capacity <b>and</b> production levels. Influenced by the special historical factors, China's economy started relatively late, with a low machinery manufacture capacity. To essentially change this phenomenon, the selection and processing technology of metal materials must be optimized. This paper analyzes the concept and characteristics of metal mechanics, together with the present situation of China's <b>machinery</b> manufacture <b>and</b> production. After studying the relationship between metal mechanical <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> manufacture <b>and</b> production, it is found that the use of metal mechanics can improve the quality of mechanical products...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} and discuss on the plant <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> valuation syllabus for higher learning education in Malaysia to ensure the practicality of the subject in the real market. There have been limited studies in plant <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> area, either by scholars or practitioners. Most papers highlighted the methodologies but limited papers discussed on the plant <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> valuation education. This paper will determine inputs for plant <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> valuation guidance focussing on the syllabus set up and references for valuers interested in this area of expertise. A qualitative approach via content analysis is conducted to compare international and Malaysian plant <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> valuation syllabus <b>and</b> suggest improvements for Malaysian syllabus. It is found that there are few higher education institutions in the world that provide plant <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> valuation courses as part of their property studies syllabus. Further investigation revealed that on the job training is the preferable method for plant <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> valuation education <b>and</b> based on the valuers experience. The significance of this paper is to increase the level of understanding of plant <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> valuation criteria <b>and</b> provide suggestions to Malaysian stakeholders with the relevant elements in plant <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> valuation education syllabus...|$|R

5|$|During World War I, a {{large number}} of pre-dreadnoughts {{remained}} in service. The advances in <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> armament meant that a pre-dreadnought was not necessarily the equal of even a modern armoured cruiser, and was totally outclassed by a modern dreadnought battleship or battlecruiser. Nevertheless, the pre-dreadnought {{played a major role in}} the war.|$|E

5|$|Iron is {{the most}} widely used of all the metals, {{accounting}} for over 90% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and structural components for buildings. Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel.|$|E
