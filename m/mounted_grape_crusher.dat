2500|$|The Hunter Valley wine {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} its proximity to Sydney. It has also become a significant element in the local economy in the tourism industry. The significance of tourism can be exemplified by the employment of more people in that industry than wine production. In 2008, a total of [...] of wine grapes were planted in the Hunter Valley with [...] dedicated to red grapes and [...] planted to white grapes. At harvest time, 9,263 tonnes of red wine varieties were crushed {{for an average of}} 5.5 tonnes/ha. Among white wine varieties, 19,310 tonnes were crushed with an average of 6.9 tonnes/ha. Around 28% of the red grapes and 63% of the white <b>grapes</b> <b>crushed</b> were from estate grown-fruit. Roughly a third of the red grapes and a fifth of the white <b>grapes</b> <b>crushed</b> were imported from outside the Hunter Valley.

Many other lesser varieties are also grown, including Chardonnay, Semillion, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo and Grenache.

40|$|Indoor {{formation}} of airborne particles during pre-fermentation grape processing {{was assessed by}} particle counting using laser particle sizers. Particle numbers of four different aerodynamic size classes (0. 3 to 0. 5 microm, 0. 5 to 1 microm, 1 to 5 microm, and > 5 microm) were determined during unloading of harvest containers and subsequent <b>grape</b> stemming and <b>crushing.</b> Regarding these size classes, composition before grape handling was determined as 87. 9 %, 10. 4 %, 1. 7 %, and 0. 1 %, respectively, whereas the composition changed during grape handling to 50. 4 %, 15. 2 %, 33. 0 %, and 1. 5 %, respectively. Airborne bacteria and fungi originating from grape processing were collected by impactor and liquid impinger samplers. Grape handling resulted in a sixfold increase in total (biological and non-biological) airborne particles. The generation of bacterial and fungal aerosols was associated mostly with particles of aerodynamic diameters> 5 microm (mainly 7 to 11 microm) as determined by flow cytometry. This fraction was increased 150 fold in relation to background levels before <b>grape</b> <b>crushing.</b> Maximum concentrations of culturable bacteria reached 485, 000 colony forming units (cfu/m 3), whereas 146, 000 cfu of fungi and yeasts were detected per cubic meter of air. Culturable Gram-negative bacteria occurred only in small numbers (180 cfu/m 3). In relation to {{the total number of}} airborne particles emitted, culturable microorganisms comprised 0. 1 % to 0. 2 %. As soon as <b>grape</b> <b>crushing</b> was stopped, particle concentrations decreased rapidly either due to passive settling or due to air currents in the occupational indoor environment reaching background levels...|$|R

40|$|Formation of wine thiol {{precursors}} is {{a dynamic}} process, which can be influenced by vineyard and winery processing operations. With the aim of increasing thiol precursor concentrations, {{a study of the}} effects of storing machine-harvested Sauvignon blanc <b>grapes</b> prior to <b>crushing</b> and pressing was undertaken on a commercial scale. 3 -Mercaptohexan- 1 -ol (3 -MH) precursors, 2 -S-glutathionylcaftaric acid (grape reaction product, GRP), glutathione (GSH) and a number of C 6 compounds were assessed at several time points during the experiment. The concentration of the cysteine precursor to 3 -MH doubled within 8 h and tripled after 30 h while the GSH and cysteinylglycine precursors increased in concentration roughly 1. 5 times. (E) - 2 -Hexenal and GSH levels decreased as thiol precursors, GRP and C 6 alcohols increased during storage. Principal component analysis revealed that precursors contributed to most of the variation within the samples over the storage period, with additional influence, primarily from GSH and GRP, as well as (E) - 2 -hexenal and (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol. Early storage time points were associated with higher concentrations of GSH and some unsaturated C 6 compounds while longer storage times were most closely associated with higher thiol precursor and GRP concentrations. This study provides a detailed overview of interactions related to thiol precursor formation on a commercial scale and highlights the ability to manipulate precursor concentrations prior to <b>grape</b> <b>crushing.</b> Dimitra L.
