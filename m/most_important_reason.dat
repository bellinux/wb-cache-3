From 1980 to 1993, 692 rhinos were poached in India. In India's Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, 41 rhinos were killed in 1983, virtually the entire population of the sanctuary. By the mid-1990s, poaching had rendered the species extinct there.|$|E

25|$|Although {{diamonds}} were {{a significant}} motivating and sustaining factor, {{there were other}} means of profiting from the Sierra Leone Civil War. For instance, gold mining was prominent in some regions. Even more common was cash crop farming {{through the use of}} forced labor. Looting during the Sierra Leone Civil War did not just center on diamonds, but also included that of currency, household items, food, livestock, cars, and international aid shipments. For Sierra Leoneans who did not have access to arable land, joining the rebel cause was an opportunity to seize property through the use of deadly force. But the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> why the civil war should not be entirely attributed to conflict over the economic benefits incurred from the alluvial diamond mines is that the pre-war frustrations and grievances did not just concern that of the diamond sector. More than twenty years of poor governance, poverty, corruption and oppression created the circumstances for the rise of the RUF, as ordinary people yearned for change.|$|E
25|$|Although the Qajars were victorious and Agha Mohammad Khan {{kept his}} promise to Heraclius (Erekle) that if he would not drop the {{alliance}} with Russia and voluntarily reaccept Iranian suzerainty they would invade his kingdom, it also showed that Russia's own ambitions and agenda were set as the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> for Russia not to intervene at Krtsanisi, even though the latter had officially declared in the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783 that it would protect Erekle's kingdom against any new Iranian ambitions to re-subjugate Georgia. Subsequently, in order to restore Russian prestige, Catherine would launch a punitive campaign against Iran the next year, but it was shortly recalled after her death. The following years remained turbulent and were known as a time of muddle and confusion. Reestablishment of Iranian rule over Georgia did not last long, for the shah was assassinated in 1797 in Shusha, and the Georgian king had died the year after. With Georgia laying in ruins and the central rule in Iran being concerned with the next heir to the throne, it {{opened the way for}} Georgia's annexation by Russia several years later by Tsar Paul.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> for the precipitous {{decline of}} President Johnson's {{popularity}} was the Vietnam War, which he greatly escalated {{during his time}} in office.

[...] Draftees made up 42 percent {{of the military in}} Vietnam, but suffered 58% of the casualties as nearly 1000 Americans a month were killed and many more were injured.

2500|$|The {{accordion}} only {{arrived in}} large numbers {{in the country in}} about 1875, but its popularity grew quickly. [...] Among the reasons for this were the instrument's cheapness and durability, and could be played solo, and was easier to learn. [...] Perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason,</b> though, was the instrument's association with 'kof ha kof' couples dancing like waltzes and mazurkas, which stood {{in stark contrast to the}} line and round dances familiar in Breton folk; the perceived sexuality of the instrument's common dances may have made it more attractive. [...] By the 1920s, the instrument was more popular than any other. In the 1930s, chromatic accordions arrived in Brittany and jazz-influenced bands with saxophones, drum kits and banjos were formed.|$|E

[...] The safety bonus of engines that could be adjusted and mended in the air, the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> behind the layout was achieved. [...] The maximum speed and climb rate of the Bodmin were marginally better than those of the identically powered though slightly smaller metal-framed Boulton & Paul BugleII.|$|E
2500|$|A crisis arose when Christensen {{was going}} through a palette of emotions, but he could not share them with the other band members as they neither shared Christensen's enthusiasm, nor could {{appreciate}} the unique symbolism of recording in these legendary studios as much as Christensen did. This caused Christensen to turn to his long-time girlfriend Pernille Rosendahl {{in and out of the}} studio, while becoming increasingly estranged from the band. Nielsen and Friis even went as far as labeling the couple as [...] "John and Yoko", referring to the supposed detrimental influence of Yoko Ono on John Lennon, which is said to have contributed to the break-up of the Beatles. This period also showed the first signs of the band members heading in different musical directions, about which Christensen explained in 2000: [...] "I needed change while the others wanted to continue in the same style, and that was actually the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> we split up." [...] This is especially evident from the song [...] "Rise and Fall"; although songs were usually a collaborative effort by the band, Christensen requested Nielsen and Friis to allow him to be in full control over this song, and as a result it is distinctly different from all other songs on the album.|$|E

2500|$|Vane {{became a}} member of the Boston church on 1 November 1635 and was given the honor of sitting on the magistrate's bench in the meetinghouse, next to Winthrop. [...] In January 1636, Vane took it upon himself to {{arbitrate}} in a dispute between Winthrop and magistrate Thomas Dudley, and he was elected governor of the colony in May, despite his youth and inexperience. [...] He built an extension to Cotton's house in which he lived while in New England, and was [...] "deeply taken with the radical possibilities in Cotton's theology." [...] Historian Michael Winship states that it was Vane who encouraged Hutchinson to set up her own conventicles and to actively engage in her own theological radicalism. [...] He writes that Vane had an appetite for unconventional theological speculation, and that it was [...] "this appetite that profoundly altered the spiritual dynamic in Massachusetts. [...] It caused John Cotton, after a quarter century of flirting with extremism and managing to keep on his feet, to make his first serious stumble," [...] and it [...] "pushed Anne Hutchinson into the public limelight". [...] The role of Vane is almost entirely neglected by scholars, but Winship surmises that he may have been the single <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> that the controversy reached a high pitch.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired to a {{large extent}} by the stories of the {{soldiers}} at trial, mutiny broke out in the Royal Indian Navy, and received widespread public support. While the troops who fought for the Allies were being demobilised, the Navy mutiny was followed up by smaller mutinies in the Royal Indian Air Force, and a mutiny in the Indian Army that was suppressed by force. In the aftermath of the mutinies, the weekly intelligence summary issued on 25 March 1946 admitted that the Indian military was no longer trustworthy, and for the Army, [...] "only day to day estimates of steadiness could be made". The armed forces could not be relied upon to suppress unrest as they had been before, and drawing from experiences of the Free India Legion and INA, their actions could not be predicted from their oath to the King-Emperor. Reflecting on the factors that guided the British decision to relinquish their rule in India, Clement Attlee, then the British Prime Minister, cited as the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> the realisation that the Indian armed forces might not prop up the Raj. Although the British government had promised to grant dominion status to India {{at the end of the}} war, the views held by British officials after the war show that although militarily a failure the Indians who fought for the Axis likely accelerated Indian independence. This is contrary to the usual narrative of India's independence struggle, which focuses only on the INC and Mahatma Gandhi.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{was seen}} as having brought new life to the post of {{governor}} general, receiving praise through her first years in office for being a more modern governor general who brought increased public attention to the position; Michaëlle Jean recognised Clarkson as having [...] "infused the office with a new energy", for [...] "promot artists and their achievements from across Canada", and for her [...] "close work with aboriginal communities". Clarkson was further praised for her devotion to {{the armed forces and}} remembrance, and was credited for breathing new life into the Canadian monarchy as a whole; Mailo' Ken Wiwa stated in The Globe and Mail: [...] "that Adrienne Clarkson, once a refugee, represents the Queen here in Canada is, for me, the singular <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> for believing that the monarchy is relevant to Canada's emerging identity. Her role may only be ceremonial and symbolic, but as the enduring quality of the Royal Family attests, you can never underestimate the power of myth. Even or rather, especially in this iconoclastic age." [...] Clarkson and her husband also travelled across Canada and met more Canadians than any other governor general in Canadian history and, unlike many other state figures, Clarkson also wrote most of her own speeches, which were noted for being simultaneously intellectual and approachable. Clarkson's tenure was also notable for her patronage of all the arts making such efforts as ensuring the governor general's study at Rideau Hall had copies of every book that had won the Governor General's Awards for literature and for sports, as demonstrated in her creation on September 14, 2005, of the Clarkson Cup for women's hockey in Canada. John Fraser in 2012 stated of Clarkson: [...] "o one, in the whole history of Rideau Hall, ever evoked the country quite as effectively".|$|E
