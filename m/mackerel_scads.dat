Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 90 {{per cent}} of total catches in {{northern}} Sulawesi are pelagic fishes. About two-third {{of them are}} large pelagic fish, such as tunas (Katsuwonus, Thunnus, Euthynnus). However the National Assessment Stock Commission reported that availability of the large pelagic fishes in Sulawesi and Maluku Sea is just {{about one-third of the}} total pelagic fish resources.

In contras, small pelagic fish such as <b>mackerel</b> <b>scads,</b> travellies, sardine, needlefish, Indian mackerel, and flyingfish is less than 40 per cent of the total allowable catch (TAC) exploited. Fishing activities on large pelagic fish by means of pole and line, longline etc. are mainly conducted by fishing industries based in the area of Bitung. This situation may give negative impact on fishing industries due to overexploitation of the large pelagic fish. To maintain the current fishing industries, expansion in fishing fleets for large scale pelagic fisheries should be reviewed.

40|$|The {{fisheries}} for <b>mackerel</b> <b>scad,</b> Decapterus macarellus, {{are particularly}} important in Cape Verde, constituting almost 40 % of total catches {{at the peak of}} the fishery in 1997 and 1998 (3700 tonnes). Catches have been stable at a much lower level of about 2 100 tonnes in recent years. Given the importance of <b>mackerel</b> <b>scad</b> in terms of catch weight and local food security, there is an urgent need for updated assessment. Stock assessment was carried out using a Bayesian approach to biomass dynamic modelling. In order to tackle the problem of a non-informative CPUE series, the intrinsic rate of increase, r, was estimated separately, and the ratio B- 0 /X, initial biomass relative to carrying capacity, was assumed based on available information. The results indicated that the current level of fishing is sustainable. The probability of collapse is low, particularly in the short-term, and it is likely that biomass may increase further above B-msy, indicating a healthy stock level. It would appear that it is relatively safe to increase catches even up to 4000 tonnes. However, the marginal posterior of r was almost identical to the prior, indicating that there is relatively low information content in CPUE. This was also the case in relation to B- 0 /X There have been substantial increases in fishing efficiency, which have not been adequately captured by the measure used for effort (days or trips), implying that the results may be overly optimistic and should be considered preliminary.

The torpedo scad is distributed throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Tonga in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in south. It is a schooling pelagic fish which occupies the surface layers of both inshore and offshore oceanic waters. The torpedo scad is easily identified by both its 'torpedo' shaped body and a series of detached finlets at the rear of both the dorsal and anal fins. The largest recorded individual was 80cm long and weighed 4 kg, although it is more common at lengths less than 40cm. It is a predatory species, taking a variety of fish, cephalopods and crustaceans by both active and filter feeding. There is a shift in diet as the species grow; however fish is the dominant prey in all size classes. Torpedo scad reach sexual maturity at 22cm in females and 26.4cm in males, with spawning occurring between March and July in India, where significant research into larval growth and morphometrics has been carried out.|$|R
