40|$|The {{influence}} of human monocyte-derived chemotactic peptide (GCP/IL- 8) on degranulation of neutrophils {{was investigated in}} relation {{to that of other}} <b>monokines.</b> GCP/IL- 8 promoted a dose-dependent release of lactoferrin from specific granules but had no effect on enzyme release from primary granules. From the other <b>monokines</b> that were tested, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) also induced degranulation, while IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 scored negatively. TNF alpha-induced lactoferrin release was enhanced by cytochalasin B pretreatment of the granulocytes, while GCP/IL- 8 -promoted degranulation was not. In contrast to GCP, TNF alpha also caused the release of LDH, suggesting a non-specific cell destruction.

50|$|In {{the acute}} phase of chikungunya, {{the virus is}} {{typically}} present in the areas where symptoms present, specifically skeletal muscles, and joints. In the chronic phase, {{it is suggested that}} viral persistence (the inability of the body to entirely rid itself of thevirus), lack of clearance of the antigen, or both, contribute to joint pain. The inflammation response during both the acute and chronic phase of the disease results in part from interactions between the virus and monocytes and macrophages. Chikungunya virus disease in humans is associated with elevated serum levels of specific cytokines and chemokines. High levels of specific cytokines have been linked to more severe acute disease: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, RANTES, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), <b>monokine</b> induced by gamma interferon (MIG), and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10). Cytokines may also contribute to chronic chikungunya virus disease, as persistent joint pain has been associated with elevated levels of IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In those with chronic symptoms, a mild elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) has been observed, suggesting ongoing chronic inflammation. However, there is little evidence linking chronic chikungunya virus disease and the development of autoimmunity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – <b>Monokines</b> are glycoproteins, {{synthesised}} by macrophages, which exert various {{effects on}} the organism. The most important <b>monokines</b> are interleukin (IL) - 1 α, IL- 1 β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and IL- 6. This paper reports on immunohistochemical techniques developed {{for the detection of}} IL-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α in fixed and paraffin-embedded pig tissues (spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, liver and kidney). Different fixatives (buffered formalin, acetic formalin, paraformadehyde-lysine-periodate and Bouin solution), and antigen unmasking techniques (permeabilisation with Tween 20, pronase enzymatic digestion and microwave-citrate buffer) were used. We describe different protocols for detection of <b>monokines</b> using polyclonal antibodies against the studied <b>monokines.</b> No signal was obtained with monoclonal antibodies against pig-TNF-α and human IL- 1 α. Bouin solution was shown to be the best fixative for immunohistochemical detection of IL- 1 α, TNF-α, and IL- 6, using permeabilisation with Tween 20 as an unmasking antigen method. Acetic formalin was shown to be the best fixative for IL- 1 β detection, not needing antigen retrieval techniques. Macrophages were identified as the main cytokine-producing cells, although other types of cells also stained positively to some cytokines. These techniques represent valuable tools for studies of the pathogenesis of viral and bacterial diseases, and of the immune system of the pigs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Monokines</b> {{have been}} {{increasingly}} recognized as communication signals that interact with both immune and non-immune cells during inflammation.

40|$|Glycosphingolipids (GSL) {{isolated}} from the gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -free bacterium Sphingomonas paucimobilis have remarkable structural similarities with LPS and its hydrophobic part, termed lipid A. Like LPS, but {{in contrast to the}} structurally related ceramides and cerebrosides, GSL contain an alpha-linked, negatively charged pyranosidic glycosyl component adjacent to the lipid portion and are capable of forming membranes. Because of these similarities, it was of interest to investigate whether these GSL are also able to induce <b>monokine</b> production in human mononuclear cells (MNC). Our results show that a GSL containing four sugar residues (GSL- 4 A) induced the release of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin- 6, and interleukin- 1 in MNC, whereas GSL- 1, containing only one glycosyl residue, was inactive. A minimal concentration of 1 microgram of GSL- 4 A per ml was necessary to induce <b>monokine</b> production in MNC, whereas LPS was as active at a 10, 000 -fold-lower concentration (0. 1 ng/ml). Both GSL- 4 A-induced <b>monokine</b> production and LPS-induced <b>monokine</b> production were reduced by the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein and GSL- 1. In contrast to LPS, GSL- 4 A-induced <b>monokine</b> release could be inhibited neither by an anti-CD 14 monoclonal antibody nor by lipid A partial structures. We therefore conclude that at the receptor level, different mechanisms are involved in the LPS- and GSL- 4 A-induced <b>monokine</b> release...|$|E

40|$|Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, {{autoimmune}} {{disease of the}} central nervous system. MS {{is believed to be}} a Th 1 inflammatory disease, speculated to be mediated by CD 4 + T lymphocytes. The specific contribution of monokines to disease has not been extensively studied in MS. I thus hypothesize that Th 1 regulatory <b>monokine</b> levels are elevated in MS patients, and these increased levels correlate to disease severity. This project deals with the quantitation of regulatory <b>monokine</b> mRNA and protein levels in MS patients and their subsequent comparison to healthy control levels. The influence of cytokine-directed immunotherapy, specifically IFN-beta 1 a and IL- 10, on these <b>monokine</b> levels is also addressed. Highly enriched monocytes were isolated and separately cultured for 24 hours in the presence of RPMI media alone, or supplemented with IFN-beta 1 a or IL- 10. Protein and mRNA levels were determined for various monokines by intracellular staining, ELISA, and Riboquant RNase Protection Assay. Increased <b>monokine</b> levels of IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 12, and TNF-alpha were found to correlate significantly with increased MS disease severity as compared to healthy control levels.

Conversely, CD 14 (+) monocytes synergize with <b>monokines</b> to promote IFN-gamma production by these NK cells. Again, this interaction is dependent on cell:cell contact. The experiments show that CD 56 (bright) NK cells accumulate in inflammatory lesions and, in the appropriate cytokine environment, can engage with CD 14 (+) monocytes in a reciprocal activatory fashion, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response. Such a positive feedback loop is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R

During the time required for glycogen depletion (3 hr), stimulation of 3 -O-methyl-D-glucose and 2 -deoxy-D-glucose uptake was initiated and observed to reach a maximum enhancement of 200 % 12 - 15 hr later. The <b>monokine</b> {{had no effect on}} the Km value for 2 -deoxy-D-glucose uptake (1. 1 mM), while Vmax was increased from 912 to 2400 pmol/min per mg of protein. The increase was cytochalasin B inhibitable and was dependent on protein synthesis. Photoaffinity labeling and equilibrium binding studies with [3 H]cytochalasin B support the hypothesis that this increase in hexose transport was due to an increase in hexose transporters present in the plasma membrane. Purified recombinant interleukin- 1 alpha had no effect on hexose transport, whereas purified recombinant cachetin/tumor necrosis factor did stimulate hexose uptake, with half-maximal stimulation occurring at 36 nM. Although cachetin accounts for most of the biological activity associated with the crude <b>monokine</b> preparations, {{it is not the only}} <b>monokine</b> capable of inducing glucose transport in L 6 cells.

40|$|Production of interleukin- 6, tumor {{necrosis}} factor α and interleukin- 10 {{in vitro}} correlates with the clinical immune defect in chronic hemodialysis patients. In {{patients with chronic}} renal failure alterations in <b>monokine</b> production are a common feature. Their clinical relevance {{has not yet been}} proven. We show here a correlation between an overproduction of interleukin-(IL) - 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) upon stimulation with LPS by mononuclear cells in vitro and the clinical grade of immunodeficiency found in these patients. Higher levels of IL- 6 and TNFα were correlated with an immunocompromized state, that is, non-responsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination, whereas patients with a better immune competence showed the same levels of these cytokines as healthy controls. Only the patients with a good immune function showed a high secretion of IL- 10. The feedback mechanism of IL- 10 for reducing <b>monokine</b> synthesis seems to be intact in these patients. Thus the secretion of IL- 10 might be regarded as a compensatory mechanism which controls <b>monokine</b> induction by chronic renal failure and hemodialysis treatment. Immunocompromized patients who are unresponsive to hepatitis B vaccination seem to be unable to enhance IL- 10 synthesis for control of <b>monokine</b> overproduction.

Fibronectin markedly stimulated the secretion of IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL- 6 from cultured monocytes in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximal effect apparent within 24 h. Northern blot analysis revealed a marked increase in the abundance of mRNA specific for each <b>monokine</b> on exposure of monocytes to fibronectin. Monoclonal antibodies to the alpha chain of very late antigen (VLA) - 5, the beta 1 integrin, the alpha chain of Mac- 1, and the beta 2 integrin, {{as well as the}} synthetic peptide of GRGDSP (which corresponds to the cell-binding domain of fibronectin), inhibited (> 50 %) fibronectin-induced <b>monokine</b> production. Monoclonal antibodies to the alpha chain of VLA- 4, and the alpha chain of LFA- 1, as well as the synthetic peptide CS- 1 (which corresponds to the alternatively spliced connecting segment of fibronectin) and the control peptide GRADSP, had no inhibitory effect on <b>monokine</b> production. A MoAb, R 60, that recognizes an epitope of the fibronectin molecule that includes the RGD sequence, inhibited <b>monokine</b> production, whereas the MoAb Y 16, which recognizes another epitope of fibronectin not including RGD, did not. These results indicate that fibronectin-induced production of IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL- 6 from cultured monocytes is mediated predominantly by interaction of the cell-binding domain of fibronectin with VLA- 5, although Mac- 1 also may contribute to this effect of fibronectin. Our results indicate that the interaction of fibronectin with integrins may contribute to the cytokine network in inflammatory response...|$|E
40|$|The acute-phase {{response}} to inflammatory stimuli, characterized by increased synthesis of acute-phase proteins (APP), is {{often accompanied by}} changes in the glycosylation patterns {{of some of these}} proteins. While expression of APP genes in hepatocytes is regulated by <b>monokines,</b> mechanisms governing changes in glycosylation are not known. Exposure of human hepatoma cell line Hep 3 B to conditioned medium from LPS- activated human monocytes and to medium from the keratocarcinoma cell line COLO- 16 led to increased synthesis of alpha 1 proteinase-inhibitor and ceruloplasmin and to alterations of their glycosylation patterns similar to those seen in human serum in various inflammatory states. IL- 1, tumor necrosis factor, and hepatocyte stimulating factor I increased synthesis of ceruloplasmin without alterations in the pattern of its glycosylation.

40|$|SummaryActivated monocytes produce proinflammatory cytokines (<b>monokines)</b> such as {{interleukin}} (IL) - 12, IL- 15, and IL- 18 for induction of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) {{by natural}} killer (NK) cells. NK cells provide the antiinflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, an autocrine/negative regulator of IFN-γ. The ability of one signaling pathway to prevail {{over the other}} is likely important in controlling IFN-γ {{for the purposes of}} infection and autoimmunity, but the molecular mechanism(s) of how this counterregulation occurs is unknown. Here we show that in isolated human NK cells, proinflammatory <b>monokines</b> antagonize antiinflammatory TGF-β signaling by downregulating the expression of the TGF-β type II receptor, and its signaling intermediates SMAD 2 and SMAD 3. In contrast, TGF-β utilizes SMAD 2, SMAD 3, and SMAD 4 to suppress IFN-γ and T-BET, a positive regulator of IFN-γ. Indeed, activated NK cells from Smad 3 −/− mice produce more IFN-γ in vivo than NK cells from wild-type mice.

We conclude that two separate mechanisms influence macrophage physiology in diabetes—lack of saturation of insulin receptors on macrophages and an indirect effect due to formation of advanced glycosylation endproducts (AGE) on their surfaces. The latter is possibly responsible for increased generation of ROIs, since it cannot be down-regulated by prolonged insulin treatment.

SETTING: University hospital, Belgium. SUBJECTS: 19 Selected patients who underwent operations for benign (n = 10) or malignant (n = 9) diseases. INTERVENTIONS: Whole blood was collected in heparinised tubes before operation and on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. After 1 / 10 dilution in culture medium the whole blood cells were stimulated with 5 micrograms/ml phytohaemagglutinin and 25 micrograms/ml lipopolysaccharide, and incubated at 37 degrees C in 5 % carbon dioxide. Concentrations of interleukin 1 (IL- 1), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) were measured at 24 hours, and interferon-gamma and interleukin 2 (IL- 2) were measured at 72 hours, with commercially available assays. OUTCOME MEASURES: Production of the <b>monokines</b> IL- 1, TNF alpha, and IL- 6, and of the lymphokines IL- 2 and interferon-gamma, postoperatively. The <b>monokines</b> were expressed {{as a percentage of the}} preoperative values/monocyte, and the lymphokines as a percentage of preoperative values/lymphocyte. RESULTS: Production of IL- 1 and TNF alpha, but not IL- 6, decreased immediately after operation then returned to preoperative values.

LPS was exposed to lipoprotein classes separated by ultracentrifugation and to apolipoprotein A-I. Then monocytes were added, and the LPS activation of monocytes was determined by measuring the induced monokines. Failure of LPS to induce <b>monokine</b> release was called LPS inactivation caused by lipoproteins or apolipoproteins. The LPS inactivation is {{shown to be a}} function of low-density lipoproteins. High-density lipoproteins inactivate LPS to a much lesser extent. The very-low-density lipoproteins cannot inactivate LPS. Lipid components seemed not absolutely required for LPS inactivation, because purified human apolipoprotein A-I without its physiological lipid complement also inhibits LPS-induced <b>monokine</b> release...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{findings}} indicate that interleukin- 1 beta (IL 1 beta), a <b>monokine</b> secreted by stimulated macrophages and monocytes, modulates neuroendocrine functions {{in a manner similar}} to classical hormones. In this study we show that IL 1 modulates PRL secretion, assessed by reverse hemolytic plaque assay, and describe the effect of the <b>monokine</b> on adenylate cyclase activity and calcium fluxes in rat normal pituitary cells. In basal and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) -stimulated conditions, low doses of IL 1 reduced the mean plaque area, a direct index of PRL secretion without affecting the percentage of PRL-secreting cells. Similarly, low concentrations of IL 1 inhibited adenylate cyclase activity in both basal and VIP-stimulated conditions, while higher concentrations restored the enzymatic activity to the control value. IL 1 also caused a biphasic effect on the free intracellular calcium increase induced by maitotoxin, a calcium channel activator, being inhibitory at low and stimulatory at high concentrations. The effects of IL 1 on adenylate cyclase activity and calcium fluxes were reversed by preincubation of the <b>monokine</b> with its polyclonal antibody, thus confirming the specificity of the effects. In conclusion, our data show that IL 1 modulates PRL secretion by acting directly on pituitary cells through interaction with the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system and calcium flux...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} and {{progression of}} rheumatoid arthritis involves {{the production of}} biologically active lymphokines and <b>monokines.</b> Of these, interleukin 1 (IL- 1) has been somewhat of a controversial molecule {{because it seems to}} evoke various biological responses in several different tissues. In these studies we demonstrate that three biological properties of human monocyte-derived IL- 1 (T-lymphocyte activation and human synovial cell prostaglandin E 2 and collagenase production) co-purify. The complementary DNA for the prominent pI 7 form of human IL- 1 was expressed, purified, and tested. Any controversy now appears resolved since homogeneous recombinant human IL- 1 stimulates prostaglandin E 2 and collagenase from human synovial cells as well as activates T cells in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Human blood {{mononuclear}} {{cells from}} normal adults were collected after density-cut centrifugation and monocytes were then isolated by removal of lymphocytes using {{the techniques of}} E-rosetting and cell adhesion. The purified monocytes were further analysed by velocity sedimentation, and two distinct subpopulations with different cell sizes were obtained. The larger monocytes were 17. 0 +/- 1. 8 microns in diameter with a mean sedimentation rate (SR) of 7. 0 +/- 0. 6 mm/hr, while the smaller monocytes were 9. 5 +/- 0. 8 microns in size and 4. 1 +/- 0. 2 mm/hr in SR. The population ratio of larger:smaller cells was approximately 2 : 1 (66 +/- 2. 8 %: 34 +/- 1. 6 %). Both cell populations exhibited a high positive rate (> 98 %) in both the non-specific esterase and the peroxidase stain. However, the larger cells had much higher phagocytic activity than the smaller ones. Furthermore, the expression of monocyte-associated antigens was also different between these two subpopulations. Thus, {{while most of the}} larger monocytes (98 %) could be recognized by monoclonal antibodies MY 7 and OKM 1, only some (35 and 61 %, respectively) of the smaller monocytes could react with those antibodies. In addition, the larger monocytes secreted a significant amount of <b>monokines</b> including interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and their production increased in proportion to the level of stimulation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whereas the production of <b>monokines</b> by the smaller monocytes remained at low levels and did not respond to LPS stimulation. These results reveal the existence of phenotypic and functional heterogeneity in human blood monocytes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{contrast}} to the mammalian system, avian species lack the so-called "resident " or "harvestable " macrophage population in the abdominal exudate. However, macrophages can be recruited into the chicken's abdominal cavity (presumably from the blood monocyte pool) if an inflammatory agent such as Sephadex is injected. The kinetics of inflammatory cell recruitment in terms of time, cell type, and state of activation to perform a particular effector function is currently an active area of research. This report will provide information on several chicken macrophage effector functions, including in vivo chemotaxis, phagocytosis, bacterial uptake and killing, biosynthesis of nitric oxide and various enzymes, and <b>monokines</b> such as interleukin- 1 and granulo-cyte colony-stimulating factor. (Key words: chicken macrophages, interleukin- 1, nitrite production, acid phos-phatase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor...|$|R
