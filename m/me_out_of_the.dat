He proposes the two of them join forces to unite sight and mobility in the interests of survival. The blind man is tempted by the other’s offer to locate some tinned food. The prospect of chancing across some “baked beans” especially excites him.|$|E

Those were the people that had been around the ballpark all those years, and it was really a wonderful human experience." ...|$|E

500|$|By dawn, {{the winds}} and swells had subsided, but the delay {{caused by the}} bad weather had slowed the two boats, and they now had to travel across the Mindanao Sea in daylight. Cagayan was sighted shortly after 06:30 on 13 March. Although PT-34 had led {{all the way from}} Tagauayan, Kelly now let Bulkeley take the lead, as he had the channel charts. PT-41 {{therefore}} pulled up at the wharf first, with MacArthur on the bow. They were met by Colonel William Morse, an officer {{on the staff of the}} Brigadier General William F. Sharp, the commander of U.S. forces on Mindanao. MacArthur told Bulkeley [...] "I'm giving every officer and man here the Silver Star for gallantry. You've taken <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaws of death, and I won't forget it." ...|$|E
500|$|She made an {{appearance}} {{in a season}} six episode of the television show , for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2005. She starred in the 2005 film Nanny McPhee as Aunt Adelaide, commenting that it was [...] "such fun to play a baddie!", and later informing an interviewer that working on Nanny McPhee [...] "pulled <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abyss" [...] after {{the loss of her}} husband. She then appeared in the 2011 film Mr. Popper's Penguins, opposite Jim Carrey. Lansbury returned to Broadway after a 23-year absence in Deuce, a play by Terrence McNally that opened at the Music Box Theatre in May 2007 for a limited run of eighteen weeks. Lansbury received a Tony Award nomination for Best Leading Actress in a Play for her role.|$|E
500|$|The 1955 Cleveland Indians season {{originally}} {{planned to use}} Houtteman as the number four pitcher on the starting rotation, {{as he had been}} the previous year. He saw himself remaining the fourth starter, and said, [...] "Herb Score won't beat <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth starting job with the Indians" [...] on April 11. However, he became a spot starter, as he lost his starting position to Score, the [...] "most talked-about rookie in all the major league training camps". He split starting time with Bob Feller and finished the season with a 10–6 record, a 3.98 ERA, and three complete games. On December 29, 1955, Houtteman's first son, Jeff, was born with assistance from National Football League player Leon Hart, who was visiting Houtteman and helped deliver the baby.|$|E

500|$|Lexington Herald-Leaders Heather Svokos {{was not as}} pleased. She {{stated that}} [...] "As always, the show is better written than most {{anything}} on TV, but for a 10th season premiere, it didn't blow <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water." [...] In addition, Phil Kloer of The Atlanta Journal gave the episode a C grade, calling it an [...] "off episode". He commented that it [...] "doesn't have the zing that most Simpsons episodes do." [...] Kloer did, however, enjoy Homer's inventions such as the hamburger earmuffs and the make-up gun, and Homer's line to Marge before he shoots her with it: [...] "Try to keep your nostrils closed." [...] Marge's response after being shot, [...] "Homer! You’ve got it set on whore!", was commended by The Gazette, DVD Verdict, and Ian Jane of DVD Talk, who called the scene {{the highlight of the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{working with}} Lovato on her third studio album, Unbroken, Ryan Tedder stated, [...] "Demi blew <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water vocally! I {{had no idea}} how good her voice is. She's one of the best singers I've ever worked with. Literally, that good... I mean, she's a Kelly Clarkson-level vocalist. And Kelly has a set of pipes." [...] He also commented on their work {{together}} on the song [...] "Neon Lights" [...] from Lovato's fourth studio album, saying, [...] "She, in pop music, has one of the biggest ranges, possibly the highest full voice singer I've ever worked with." [...] Tamsyn Wilce from Alter The Press commented on her vocals on Demi, stating [...] "it shows just how strong her vocal cords are and the variation of styles that she can completely work to make her own." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press. Kharlamov himself believed that [...] "Bobby Clarke {{was given the}} job of taking <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game." [...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it." [...] Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke about it later at a team reunion, calling it a [...] "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied [...] "Dick, if I hadn't learned how to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 2011, Aronofsky bowed out of {{directing}} the film, {{saying in a}} statement, [...] "As I talked more about the film with my collaborators at Fox, {{it became clear that}} the production of The Wolverine would keep <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country for almost a year.... I was not comfortable being away from my family for that length of time. I am sad that I won't be able to see the project through, as it is a terrific script and I was very much looking forward to working with my friend, Hugh Jackman, again". Fox also decided to be [...] "in no rush" [...] to start the production due to the damage incurred in Japan by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Despite this, Jackman said the project was moving ahead. [...] "It's too early to call on Japan, I'm not sure where they're at. So now we're finding another director, but Fox is very anxious to make the movie and we're moving ahead full steam to find another director".|$|E
500|$|Walsh {{was passed}} over {{in favor of}} Bill [...] "Tiger" [...] Johnson for the head {{coaching}} job when Brown retired. In a 2006 interview, Walsh said Brown worked against his candidacy to be a head coach anywhere in the league. [...] "All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them", Walsh said. [...] "And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NFL." [...] Brown stayed on as team president following his retirement, and the Bengals later made two trips to the Super Bowl, losing both games to Walsh and the 49ers. He rarely appeared in public, however. He died on August 5, 1991 at home of complications from pneumonia. He and Katie had three sons: Robin, Mike and Pete. Following Katie's death {{of a heart attack}} in 1969, he married his former secretary Mary Rightsell in 1973. His son Robin died of cancer in 1978. Brown is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Massillon.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Alex McCown-Levy graded {{the episode}} a 'B+', calling it [...] "a {{fast-moving}} and fun adventure, {{the kind of}} race-against-time scenario that remains the series’ strong suit [...] played to the show’s strengths on numerous levels". He highlighted Johnson's fight against the prisoners, and Woods' direction of that scene, {{as well as the}} heart-to-heart between Johnson and May. McCown-Levy also felt [...] "the show is having the most narratively efficient season yet, effectively balancing mission-of-the-week adventures with the longer plots", but was critical of Lucy and the low stokes of the villains. Terri Schwartz at IGN scored the episode an eight out of ten, indicating a [...] "great" [...] episode, and said the highlight was the action and choreography. Schwartz also noted character-focused moments such as the Johnson and May heart-to-heart and the revelations about Mace, while highliy criticizing the ghost effects, saying, [...] "Maybe it's Lucy's makeup or maybe it's the downside of having a TV show budget, but the look of these affected beings takes <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode whenever they appear. Because of that ... "Lockup" [...] didn't pop as much as last week's [...] "Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire".|$|E

500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, so I figured, what the heck, I might as well get the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the letters}} was from Bannon, asking for {{professional}} assistance in getting published. On writing to Meaker, she said, [...] "To this day I {{have no idea why}} she responded to <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified." [...] Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it [...] "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon combined—a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." [...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print. And so I made a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became Odd Girl Out." ...|$|E

500|$|In January, Dennis catches Den and {{his girlfriend}} Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) in bed {{together}} and tells Chrissie who is stunned. Zoe discovers she is pregnant by Den. Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, and later reveals that she knows it was Den's baby. Chrissie, Zoe and Sam Hunter (Kim Medcalf) plan revenge on Den; Chrissie for his lies and adultery, Zoe for forcing her to fake a pregnancy and then sleep with him, and Sam for losing her pub to Den in a corrupt scheme that both he and Chrissie were involved in. Chrissie plans to intimidate Den into signing the pub over to her. They confront Den but he takes it in his stride and openly talks about his sins, unaware that Sharon is hiding {{at the other side}} of the pub, listening to her father's confessions. Sharon berates Chrissie for tricking her into coming back to Walford with the lie that her father is ill. She storms out of the pub and Den follows. Chrissie knows that Sharon is the one person Den truly loves and cares about and knows that losing Den the love of his favourite child will destroy him. Den walks back in and she taunts him that he now knows what it is like to lose what he loves most. Unable to contain his rage, Den attacks his wife and hits her head against a fruit machine. Zoe picks up the nearest object (a metal, dog-shaped doorstop) and hits Den over the head with it and he falls to the ground. Perceiving him to be dead, Zoe and Sam go out the back to turn all the lights off and lock all the doors. A smug Chrissie starts to gloat that Den is dead, as if to say she has won. Den suddenly grabs her leg and hisses, [...] "You'll never get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vic." [...] so Chrissie picks up the doorstop and delivers a fatal blow to his head, secretly watched by Sam. The three women bury him in a hole in the pub's cellar, which is filled with cement the next morning.|$|E
