25|$|Sicily is {{the third}} largest wine {{producer}} in Italy (the world's largest wine producer) after Veneto and Emilia Romagna. The region is known mainly for fortified <b>Marsala</b> <b>wines.</b> In recent decades the wine industry has improved, new winemakers are experimenting with less-known native varietals, and Sicilian wines have become better known. The best known local varietal is Nero d'Avola, named for a small town not far from Syracuse; the best wines made with these grapes come from Noto, a famous old city close to Avola. Other important native varietals are Nerello Mascalese {{used to make the}} Etna Rosso DOC wine, Frappato that is a component of the Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG wine, Moscato di Pantelleria (also known as Zibibbo) used to make different Pantelleria wines, Malvasia di Lipari used for the Malvasia di Lipari DOC wine and Catarratto mostly used to make the white wine Alcamo DOC. Furthermore, in Sicily high quality wines are also produced using non-native varietals like Syrah, Chardonnay and Merlot.|$|R

50|$|<b>Marsala</b> <b>wine</b> is a {{wine from}} Sicily that is {{available}} in both fortified and unfortified versions. It was first produced in 1772 by an English merchant, John Woodhouse, as an inexpensive substitute for sherry and port, and gets {{its name from the}} island's port, Marsala. The fortified version is blended with brandy to make two styles, the younger, slightly weaker Fine, which is at least 17% abv and aged at least four months; and the Superiore, which is at least 18%, and aged at least two years. The unfortified <b>Marsala</b> <b>wine</b> is aged in wooden casks for five years or more and reaches a strength of 18% by evaporation.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of <b>Marsala</b> <b>wine</b> {{at the end}} of the 18th century, headed by English merchants settled in Sicily, considerably improved local trade.

50|$|The most {{credible}} {{version of}} the introduction of <b>Marsala</b> fortified <b>wine</b> to {{a wider range of}} consumers is attributed to the English trader John Woodhouse. In 1773, Woodhouse landed at the port of Marsala and discovered the local wine produced in the region, which was aged in wooden casks and tasted similar to Spanish and Portuguese fortified wines then popular in England. Fortified Marsala was, and is, made using a process called in perpetuum, which is similar to the solera system used to produce Sherry in Jerez, Spain.|$|R

50|$|Chicken marsala is an Italian-American dish {{made from}} chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and <b>Marsala</b> <b>wine.</b> It is a {{variation}} of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes, {{of which there are}} many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it most likely originated with English families who lived in western Sicily, where <b>Marsala</b> <b>wine</b> is produced. The chicken is coated in flour, briefly sautéed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding onions or shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately.|$|E
5000|$|Solera is {{a process}} for aging liquids such as wine, beer, vinegar, and brandy, by {{fractional}} blending {{in such a way}} that the finished product is a mixture of ages, with the average age gradually increasing as the process continues over many years. The purpose of this labor-intensive process is the maintenance of a reliable style and quality of the beverage over time. Solera means literally [...] "on the ground" [...] in Spanish, and it refers to the lower level of the set of barrels or other containers used in the process; the liquid (traditionally transferred from barrel to barrel, top to bottom, the oldest mixtures being in the barrel right [...] "on the ground"), although the containers in today's process are not necessarily stacked physically in the way that this implies, but merely carefully labeled. Products which are often solera aged include Sherry, Madeira, Lillet, Port <b>wine,</b> <b>Marsala,</b> Mavrodafni, Muscat, and Muscadelle wines; Balsamic, Commandaria, some Vins doux naturels, and Sherry vinegars; Brandy de Jerez; beer; rums; and whiskies. Since the origin of this process is undoubtedly out of the Iberian peninsula, most of the traditional terminology was in Spanish, Portuguese, or Catalan.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marsala</b> <b>wine</b> was {{traditionally}} {{served as}} an aperitif {{between the first and}} second courses of a meal.

Marsala is sometimes discussed with another Sicilian wine, Passito di Pantelleria (Pantelleria Island's raisin wine).|$|E

Additional ingredients may include different types of wine, such as Madeira wine, and cinnamon. It may also be served as an antipasto dish, the first course of a formal Italian meal.|$|E
