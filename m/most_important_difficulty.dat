40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTime-varying multipath propagation {{is considered the}} <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>difficulty</b> in shallow underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. To compensate for the time variability of the channel, the receiver must use an adaptive algorithm for adjusting its parameters. At high symbol rates, intersymbol interference caused by multipath propagation requires large adaptive filters, increasing the computational complexity at the receiver end. This thesis presents a time-reversal acoustic technique (implemented with a phase-conjugated array of PCA) that generates a spatio-temporal focus of acoustic energy at the receiver location which reduces distortions introduced by channel propagation (including multipath), allowing the use of low-complexity receivers. Numerical analysis shows that for different PCA geometries (element spacing and aperture sizes), the PCA focus footprint {{does not appear to}} significantly change its dimensions. Furthermore, the aperture size plays a more significant role than the number of array elements in a PC array design. Specific examples of novel UWA communication systems utilizing time-reversal focusing are introduced. Current simulation results suggest the potential for high data transfer rates compared to existing noncoherent UWA communication systems. [URL] Portuguese Nav...|$|E

The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>difficulty</b> that arises in an integration effort isthe correct translation {{between the different}} scales of the core dataand the seismic data.

Synthetic seismograms created from velocity and density measurements onselected core samples generally show a good agreement with real seismicdata with respect to amplitude and waveform, whereas timing of theevents is troublesome. The use of velocity profiles with inaccurate sections along cores, afalse depth scale due to recovery problems, and inaccuracies in thepositioning during both seismic and coring operations are the mainshortcomings of this method.

30|$|Finally, the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>difficulty</b> toward {{extending}} {{this paper}} results in more realistic neural networks {{is the definition}} of the synaptic spike response. In IF models, the spike is thought as a punctual “event” (typically, an “instantaneous” pulse) while the synaptic response is described by a convolution kernel (the α-profile). This leads one to consider a somewhat artificial mixed dynamics where membrane potential evolves continuously while spike are discrete events. In more realistic models, one would have to consider kinetic equations for neurotransmitter release, receptor binding and opening of post-synaptic ionic channels [5, 44]. Additionally, the consideration of these mechanics deserves a spatially extended modeling of the neuron, with time delays. In this case, all variables evolve continuously and the statistics of spike trains would be characterized by the statistics of return times in the “spike region”. This statistics is induced by some probability measure in the phase space; a natural candidate would be the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measure [56 – 58], for stationary dynamics, or the time-dependent SRB measure for non-stationary cases, as defined, e.g., in [59]. These measures are Gibbs measures as well [60]. Here, the main mathematical property ensuring existence and uniqueness of such a measure would be uniform hyperbolicity. To our knowledge, conditions ensuring such a property in networks have not been established yet neither for Hodgkin-Huxley’s nor for FitzHugh-Nagumo’s models.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since {{the first}} {{research}} {{works in the}} end of 1980 s on the semi-solid forming of steel, this process has presented a great interest and a real industrial potential. Several research teams, all over the world, have shown the feasibility of such a process. Working on the parameters which have an influence on the process, they pointed out the "technical locks " which must be overcome to allow industrialization of the process.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of disulfiram {{has been well}} known for over 50 years in alcohol dependence management. If disulfiram is in the body, whenever the patient consumes alcohol, it causes accumulation of a toxic intermediate metabolite called acetald§ehyde and produces unpleasant side effects. However, for adequate efficacy, it must be taken per os daily. Therefore, the major difficulty of its usage is compliance of treatment. When patients are recommended to self administer drugs, most of them stop their treatment after a short time. An implantable, slow-release, depot-form of the drug may solve this compliance problem. There are placebo-controlled studies in the literature which prove the {{efficacy of}} this procedure. An additional “psychological deterrent” effect can be mentioned with this method. Its <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>difficulty</b> is requirement of a surgical approach. Furthermore, high rates of surgical wound infection and rejection of implants have been reported.

40|$|Image {{segmentation}} is {{a popular}} topic in computer vision and image processing. As a region-based (global) approach, the Mumford and Shah (MS) model is a powerful and robust segmentation technique as compared to edge-based (local) methods. However, there are some difficulties with the MS model. One difficulty is the detection of roof edges. In this thesis, we first modify the MS model to include second order derivative term and use linear approximation to implement the solution. In this way, we can detect not only step edges but also creases and roof edges. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>difficulty</b> of MS model is that the segmentation results depend on the initial curves. To overcome this problem, we present in this thesis a hierarchical strategy {{that takes into account}} both the local information at the pixel level and the global information of the MS model. With this hierarchical segmentation scheme, we can segment an image into regions until each region is smooth enough and need no additional segmentation. Compared with previous works, our approach can automatically detect both main structure and details in an image with multi-level-set functions, and it can stop automatically when the boundaries are detected. In our approach, the final segmentation does not depend on the initial condition. Many experimental results indicate that our approach is effective in many applications. Especially, we apply the new approach to the image inpainting problem. Compared with previous work, because the new approach can detect all the edges in an image, it can preserve more edges and details in the inpainting process...|$|E

It notes that the integration of renewable energy sources into living and transport sectors presents a daunting task, still. In {{spite of the fact that}} the earth and its atmosphere continually receive 1. 7 × 1017 watts of radiation from the sun, in the portfolio of sustainable and environment friendly energy options, which is about 16 % of the world’s energy consumption and mostly met by biomass, only a paltry 0. 04 % is accredited to solar.

Infusing PV and building elements is greatly simplified with some of the second generation thin film technologies now manufactured as flexible panels.

40|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{facing the}} reparations-for-slavery movement {{is that to}} date the movement has focused its litigation strategies and its rhetorical effort upon the institution of slavery. While slavery {{is the root of}} modern racism, it suffers many defects as the centerpiece of a reparations litigation strategy. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>difficulty</b> is temporal. Formal slavery ended in 1865. Thus, the time line of potentially reparable injury extends to well before the period of any person now living. The temporal difficulty arises from the conventional expectations of civil litigation, which require a harmony of identity between the defendants and the plaintiffs. Although the class action format loosens this expectation in important ways, even the most aggressive application of class action theory is rooted in the requirement of a harmonious identification in which the plaintiffs have been specified and the defendant can be identified as the source of the injury. If reparations are to become a successful legal strategy, the fact that slavery ended more than 130 years ago presents formidable obstacles and conceptual challenges that require careful consideration... Because I argue that an exclusive focus on slavery is misguided, this Article endorses an alternative. My research on the legacy of lynching convinces me that the problem of lynching and race riots in the period 1865 - 1955 provides a promising and ultimately more satisfyingly fertile field for undertaking the same project as the reparations-for-slavery movement, with far fewer of the disabilities of the slavery-focused effort. In what follows, I show how lynching and race riots have virtually disappeared from the official record of American racial history. Through a series of accumulating myths, omissions, and distortions, modern Americans have a collective amnesia about the 2 ̆ 2 red record 2 ̆ 2 of human atrocity. If we focus on the pattern of racial atrocity in the relatively recent past, the conventional lawsuit or legislative reparations might serve as an appropriate vehicle for redress...|$|E
