Laser-induced room temperature luminescence of air-equilibrated or argon-purged solid powdered samples of benzophenone adsorbed onto the two <b>modified</b> <b>celluloses,</b> which will be named C 12 - 1500 and C 12 - 1700, revealed {{the existence of a}} vibrationally structured phosphorescence emission of benzophenone in the case where ethanol was used for sample preparation, while a nonstructured emission of benzophenone exists when water was used instead of ethanol. The decay times of the benzophenone emission vary greatly with the solvent used for sample preparation and do not change with the alkylation degree in the range of 1500 – 1700 micromoles of alkyl chains per gram of cellulose. When water was used as a solvent for sample preparation, the shortest lifetime for the benzophenone emission was observed; this result is similar to the case of benzophenone adsorbed onto the “normal” microcrystalline cellulose surface, with this latter case previously reported by Vieira Ferreira et al. in 1995. This is due to the more efficient hydrogen abstraction reaction from the glycoside rings of cellulose when compared with hydrogen abstraction from the alkyl chains of the <b>modified</b> <b>celluloses.</b> Triplet-triplet transient absorption of benzophenone was obtained in both cases and is the predominant absorption immediately after laser pulse, while benzophenone ketyl radical formation occurs in a microsecond time scale both for normal and <b>modified</b> <b>celluloses...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{anti-microbial}} {{properties of}} metal surfaces are of high interest to water sanitation.

Sustainable alternatives like topographically <b>modified</b> <b>cellulose</b> are also of high interest due to recyclability and low cost. Surfaces that are superhydrophobic are desirable for non-fouling behavior because an affinity for water correlates to an affinity for contaminants.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis describes the use of scientific research {{in the development of}} novel texture and flavour experiences and their potential for use in fine gastronomy. In order to create an interesting textural experience, <b>modified</b> <b>celluloses</b> were investigated. Their unique property is that they have the ability to gel at high temperatures, but return to the solution state upon cooling. This phenomena was used to test the hypothesis that hot gels made from these materials could melt at temperatures greater than mouth temperature, providing a melt-in-the-mouth sensation on consumption in a fashion analogous to gelatine. Melting temperatures of these hot gels were calculated using the techniques of rheology and differential scanning calorimetry, as well as more empirical methods, and results showed that gels made from a number of different hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses (HPMCs) displayed melting temperatures above 37 °C. In order to predict their flavour release properties, the mixing efficiency of the solutions were investigated and results showed that solutions made from the lower molecular weight HPMCs showed more desirable mixing behaviour, suggesting better flavour release than those made from high molecular weight HPMCs. Furthermore, these solutions also had more desirable mouth-feel attributes, as determined by sensory analysis, yet their inherent flavour attributes were less pleasant. Therefore, <b>modified</b> <b>celluloses</b> show potential use in producing hot gels that melt in the mouth. The second part of this thesis was focussed on developing novel flavour experiences, and this was done by creating drinks that changed their flavour as they were consumed. The development of a tomato flavoured drink, whose flavour changed due to the sequential heightening of its tastant profile, is described here, and {{it was found that the}} presence of each tastant at a volume needed to invoke swallowing was more important than the order in which the tastes were administered in terms of ensuring that each different flavour was perceived. In addition, a banana flavoured drink whose flavour changed on consumption to mimic a ripening banana was also created, and this work showed the importance of the matrix on flavour perception at both the physical and psychological level, which has important consequences in general in the development of flavoured products.
