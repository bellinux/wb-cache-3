25|$|The senior Audubon had {{commanded}} ships. During the American Revolution, he {{had been}} imprisoned by Britain. After his release, he helped the American cause. He had long worked to save money and secure his family's future with real estate. Due to slave unrest in the Caribbean, in 1789 he sold part of his plantation in Saint-Domingue and purchased a 284-acre farm called Mill Grove, 20 miles from Philadelphia, to diversify his investments. Increasing tension in Saint-Domingue between the colonists and the African slaves, who greatly outnumbered them, convinced Jean Audubon to return to France, where he {{became a member of}} the Republican Guard. In 1791 he arranged for his natural children Jean and <b>Muguet,</b> who was majority-white in ancestry, to be transported and delivered to him in France.|$|E

25|$|Later on 11 June de Gaulle {{attended}} {{the meeting of}} the Anglo-French Supreme War Council at the Chateau du <b>Muguet</b> at Briare. The British were represented by Churchill, Anthony Eden, John Dill, General Ismay and Edward Spears, and the French by Reynaud, Pétain, Weygand and Georges. Churchill demanded that the French take to guerrilla warfare, and reminded Pétain of how he had {{come to the aid of}} the British with forty divisions in March 1918, receiving a dusty answer in each case. De Gaulle's fighting spirit made a strong impression on the British. At the meeting de Gaulle met Pétain for the first time in two years. Pétain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that Pétain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the Battle of the Marne in 1914, he replied that there was “no comparison” with the present situation. De Gaulle later conceded that Pétain was right about that much at least. De Gaulle missed the second day of the conference as he was in Rennes for a meeting (not mentioned in his memoirs) to discuss the plans for the Breton redoubt with General René Altmayer. He then returned to attend a Cabinet meeting, at which it was clear that there was a growing movement for an armistice, and which decided that the government should move to Bordeaux rather than de Gaulle’s preference for Quimper in Brittany.|$|E

2500|$|Audubon {{was born}} in Les Cayes in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) on his father's {{sugarcane}} plantation. He {{was the son of}} Lieutenant Jean Audubon, a French naval officer (and privateer) from the south of Brittany, and his mistress Jeanne Rabine, a 27-year-old chambermaid from Les Touches, Brittany (now in the modern region Pays de la Loire). They named the boy Jean Rabin. His mother died when the boy was a few months old, as she had suffered from tropical disease since arriving on the island. His father already had an unknown number of mixed-race children (among them a daughter named Marie-Madeleine), some by his mulatto housekeeper, Catherine [...] "Sanitte" [...] Bouffard (described as a quadroon, meaning she was three-quarters European in ancestry).

2500|$|Following his win in Hong Kong A Shin Hikari {{was off the}} racecourse for {{six months}} before being sent to France for the Prix d'Ispahan on 24 May. The race was run at Chantilly Racecourse as its usual venue, Longchamp, was being redeveloped. He was made the 7.4/1 fourth choice behind New Bay, Dariyan (Prix Ganay) and Vadamos (Prix du <b>Muguet)</b> whilst the other five runners {{included}} the Grand Prix de Paris winner Erupt. Racing on heavy ground he settled in second place behind Vadamos {{before going to the}} front 400 metres from the finish. He drew further and further away from his rivals in the straight and crossed the line ten lengths clear of Dariyan. After the race Sakaguchi said [...] "I had imagined he would jump to the front and lead the race, so I was surprised, but it was good judgement by Yutaka to run him a bit away from the rail where the ground was not as bad. It was great to see that he could settle and race from second place, as well as win with that style. We can now proudly hold our heads high and go to England for the Royal Ascot meeting". Bookmakers responded by making the horse favourite for the Prince of Wales's Stakes. In the June 2016 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings A Shin Hikari was rated the best horse in the world, three pounds ahead of California Chrome and Winx.|$|E
