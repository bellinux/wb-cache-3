No presente estudo esta avaliação foi feita analisando as características de comprimento da fibra, índice de finura (Micronaire), uniformidade de comprimento, índice de resistência (Pressley), porcentagem de fibras e peso de um capulho, sendo os dados obtidos para a amostra usual correlacionados com os dados de amostras marcadas, constituídas por capulhos de mesma idade, provenientes {{de flores}} abertas no mesmo dia e, portanto, sujeitas às mesmas condições climáticas. Tais capulhos foram colhidos de diferentes partes da planta, isto é, do baixeiro, da parte mediana e do ponteiro. Os resultados revelaram que a média das amostras marcadas apresentou boa correlação com a amostra da parte mediana da planta, indicando ser o terço médio representativo da planta.

40|$|Purpose: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) {{is defined}} by a perturbed B-cell receptor-mediated {{signaling}} machinery. We aimed to model differential signaling behavior between B cells from CLL and healthy individuals to pinpoint modes of dysregulation. Experimental Design: We developed an experimental methodology combining immunophenotyping, multiplexed phosphospecific flow cytometry, and multifactorial statistical modeling. Utilizing patterns of signaling network covariance, we modeled BCR signaling in 67 CLL patients using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Results from multidimensional modeling were validated using an independent test cohort of 38 patients. Results: We identified a dynamic and variable imbalance between proximal (pSYK, pBTK) and distal (pPLCc 2, pBLNK, ppERK) phosphoresponses. PLSR identified the relationship between upstream tyrosine kinase SYK and its target, PLCc 2, as maximally predictive and sufficient to distinguish CLL from healthy samples, pointing to this juncture in the signaling pathway as a hallmark of CLL B cells.

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{surveys show}} that DDoS attack {{is still one of}} the major threats to the Internet security. Many {{techniques}} have been proposed to trace the origin of attacking packets, known as IP traceback problem, using either hash-based packet logging or probabilistic packet marking. However, both approaches have scalability problems under the heavy DDoS attacks in terms of the space and computational overheads. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable IP Traceback scheme by utilizing the advantage of both packet logging and marking to balance the overheads at routers and at the victim, hence scalable for both sides. The baseline idea of our approach is to sample a very small percentage (e. g., 1 %) of packets at the routers, and save the digests <b>of</b> only <b>sampled</b> packets. At the same time, the routers mark their signature using very simple marking scheme into the <b>marking</b> field <b>of</b> <b>sampled</b> IP packets to send out the “information of logging ” to the victim in probabilistic way to help the traceback procedure. We also propose a heuristic technique to improve the performance <b>of</b> the <b>marking</b> scheme. In the result, the number of attacking packets the victim should collect for the traceback procedure to achieve high level of traceback accuracy is much less than the numbers in previous PPM schemes, and also the computational and storage overhead in routers are much less than previous packet logging approach...|$|R

Numerous works have been carried out to study laser-matter interaction mechanisms on the one hand, and laser machining processes on the other hand. Periodic surface structures, usually named ripples, are often presented in machined samples, either on the surface itself, or on the walls of grooves or holes [5]. Such structures have to be controlled with accuracy to improve processing quality. Sub wavelength ripples can be obtained both on metallic or dielectric samples, and such periodic nano structures can be used for surface functionalization and “smart” <b>marking.</b> The control <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> <b>marking</b> requires a good understanding of laser matter interaction mechanism.

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Despite real applications having complex triaxial loading, current physical test methods to predict component behaviour are mainly uniaxial. But previous work has indicated {{that there may be}} substantial differences between the rubber's uniaxial and biaxial behaviour and hence through incompressibility, its triaxial properties. In order to quantify these differences equipment was developed to assess the biaxial performance of selected rubber compounds using inflated circular diaphragms. Although allowing higher extensions than stretching a sheet in its own plane, such tests do not allow stress and strain to be measured directly, requiring careful <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sample,</b> or calculation through simulation. On the grounds of perceived accuracy, the latter was chosen, requiring accurate, general, elastic constants to high extensions. In this thesis the development of this apparatus, along with the associated techniques is described, along with {{the development of a new}} elastic theory. The tests on this new apparatus indicated significant differences between the uniaxial and biaxial strength and fatigue of rubber. In a unimdal test natural rubber (NR) is much stronger than styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) below 35 pphr of carbon black. In a biaxial test though the converse is true, although there is some evidence of crystallinity in NR during the biaxial test. Distinct differences were also found in fatigue between the two load cases. When plotted against extension ratio the biaxial life of SBR was found to increase, while the converse is true for NR. However if life is plotted against a function of strain energy, the biaxial life of both polymers increases for a given energy...|$|R

40|$|Differentiation {{is a key}} {{cellular}} {{process in}} normal tissue development that is significantly altered in cancer. Although molecular signatures characterising pluripotency and multipotency exist, there is, as yet, no single quantitative <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> a cellular <b>sample's</b> position in the global differentiation hierarchy. Here we adopt a systems view and consider the sample's network entropy, a measure of signaling pathway promiscuity, computable from a sample's genome-wide expression profile. We demonstrate that network entropy provides a quantitative, in-silico, readout of the average undifferentiated state of the profiled cells, recapitulating the known hierarchy of pluripotent, multipotent and differentiated cell types. Network entropy further exhibits dynamic changes in time course differentiation data, and in line with a sample's differentiation stage. In disease, network entropy predicts {{a higher level of}} cellular plasticity in cancer stem cell populations compared to ordinary cancer cells. Importantly, network entropy also allows identification of key differentiation pathways. Our results are consistent with the view that pluripotency is a statistical property defined at the cellular population level, correlating with intra-sample heterogeneity, and driven by the degree of signaling promiscuity in cells. In summary, network entropy provides a quantitative measure of a cell's undifferentiated state, defining its elevation in Waddington's landscape. Comment: 27 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
