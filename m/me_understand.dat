[...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world." [...] Greenfield later said, [...] "I could not for the life of <b>me</b> <b>understand</b> that callousness until, of course, I realized he had been thinking of the death of his brother." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbery {{incorporates}} several themes {{into the}} novel. References to philosophy, for instance, abound throughout, getting increasingly dense {{as the story}} progresses. Barbery confesses to having [...] "followed a long, boring course of studies in philosophy", and comments that [...] "I expected it to help <b>me</b> <b>understand</b> better that which surrounds me: but it didn't work out that way. Literature has taught me more. I was interested in exploring the bearing philosophy could really have on one's life, and how. I wanted to illuminate this process. That's where the desire to anchor philosophy to a story, a work of fiction, was born: to give it more meaning, make it more physically real, and render it, perhaps, even entertaining." ...|$|E
500|$|Douglas {{was given}} an {{assignment}} in 1916 {{to write a story}} on the first woman to join the US Naval Reserve from Miami. When the woman did not show up for the interview, Douglas found herself joining the Navy as a Yeoman (F) first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar as a typist, so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross, where she was stationed in Paris. She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de Rivoli when the Armistice was signed, and she cared for war refugees; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, [...] "helped <b>me</b> <b>understand</b> the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later".|$|E

His wife helped him pull out of that emotional crisis by praising {{his work as a}} songwriter and convincing him to continue writing and recording. In her honour, he later wrote [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed", explaining that with the Beatles breaking up, [...] "that was my feeling: Maybe I'm amazed at what's going on... Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won't you help <b>me</b> <b>understand...</b> Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time, hung me on the line, Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you."

The [...] was easily the most refined, yet was more immediate too. It proved superb with the tonal qualities of instruments, and added a dash of sweetness to higher frequencies also. David Price, writing in Hi-fi News, said that with the earlier NAITs gave the impression of [...] "something overly reminiscent of British hi-fi's 'cottage industry' past", but remarked that the [...] made [...] "all other integrateds sound positively pedestrian". Ian White said the [...] "sounds like a [...] that finally finished going through puberty and emerged as a mature adult", and What Hi-fi? referred to the [...] as [...] "one of the finest amplifiers available this side of 1000 pounds"; In The Absolute Sound, Wayne Garcia noted that the [...] "staggeringly good sound and wonderful value" [...] of the [...] contributed significantly to raising Naim's profile in the US audio market. Matthew Masters remarked about the 5i amp and CD player that [...] "it didn't seem to matter how complex or demanding the music was, the Naims would sort out the elements then present them in a perfectly-timed and coherent musical picture that helped <b>me</b> <b>understand</b> – and feel – precisely what the performers were on about". Commenting on the NAIT XS, Malcolm Stewart wrote that the NAITs were [...] "a musically communicative, minimalist design".|$|E
500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped <b>me</b> <b>understand</b> how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E
