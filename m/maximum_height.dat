5|$|Narcissus is a genus of {{perennial}} herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, dying {{back after}} flowering to an underground storage bulb. They regrow {{in the following}} year from brown-skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks, and reach heights of 5–80cm depending on the species. Dwarf species such as N. asturiensis have a <b>maximum</b> <b>height</b> of 5–8cm, while Narcissus tazetta may grow as tall as 80cm.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 1999, a {{tractor-trailer}} {{carrying a}} backhoe that exceeded the <b>maximum</b> <b>height</b> requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just {{northwest of the}} I-95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the shell of brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and <b>maximum</b> <b>height</b> is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E

5|$|Keswick {{is in the}} lee of the Skiddaw group, {{the oldest}} group of rocks in the Lake District. These fells were formed during the Ordovician period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they form a {{triangle}} sheltering the town, reaching a <b>maximum</b> <b>height</b> of 931m on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of Thornthwaite, is Whinlatter Forest Park and Grisedale Pike. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is St John's in the Vale, {{at the foot of the}} Helvellyn range, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick. In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested £100,000 to remove power lines and replace them with underground cables, to improve the quality of scenery in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The guns used three {{different}} charges, {{depending on the}} situation: a full charge, a full flashless charge, and a reduced charge. The standard full charge weighed 15.2–15.5lb (6.9–7.0kg), the flashless charge was slightly heavier at 16lb (7.3kg), and the reduced charge was significantly smaller, at 3.6lb (1.6kg). Both full charges provided a muzzle velocity of 2,600ft/s (790m/s) in new guns, but as continued fire wore down the barrels, muzzle velocity degraded slightly, to 2,500ft/s (760m/s). The reduced charge's muzzle velocity was correspondingly lower, at 1,200ft/s (370m/s). Each gun was supplied with 450 rounds, and was expected to fire 4,600 shells before it was worn enough to warrant replacement. At the maximum effective elevation to engage surface targets, 45degrees, the guns could hit targets up to 17,392yards (15,903m) away. The <b>maximum</b> <b>height</b> at which aircraft could be engaged was 37,200feet (11,900m).|$|E
