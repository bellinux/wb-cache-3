When a signal is playing while another sound {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker {{does not need to}} have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A <b>masked</b> <b>signal</b> can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E

In light of the Lyapunov stability theory for stochastic differential equations, several theoretical results are rigorously established.

Stinkbugs gain higher signal-to-noise ratio and increase communication distance by emitting narrowband low frequency vibratory signals that are tuned with transmission properties of plants. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate hitherto overlooked consequences of duetting with mutually overlapped narrowband vibratory signals. The overlapped vibrations of the model stinkbug species Eushistus heros, produced naturally or induced artificially on different plants, have been analysed. They represent female and male strategies to preserve information within a complex <b>masked</b> <b>signal.</b> The brown stinkbugs E. heros communicate with species and gender specific vibratory signals that constitute characteristic duets in the calling, courtship and rivalry phases of mating behaviour. The calling female pulse overlaps the male vibratory response when the latency of the latter is shorter than the duration of the female triggering signal or when the male response does not inhibit the following female pulse. Overlapping of signals induces interference that changes their amplitude pattern to a sequence of regularly repeated pulses in which their duration and the difference between frequencies of overlapped vibrations are related inversely. Interference does not occur in overlapped narrow band female calling pulses and broadband male courtship pulse trains. In a duet with overlapped signals females and males change time parameters and increase the frequency difference between signals by changing the frequency level and frequency modulation pattern of their calls...|$|E
40|$|Comodulation masking release (CMR) is an improve-ment in the {{detection}} threshold of a <b>masked</b> <b>signal</b> {{that occurs when}} the masker envelopes are correlated across frequency (i. e., comodulation). CMR can be observed when flanking bands (FBs) of noise co-modulated with an on-frequency band (OFB) noise masker are added at remote frequencies (CMR 1), or when co-modulated envelopes are used instead of anti-modulated envelopes (OFB and FB envelopes out of phase, CMR 2). For FBs widely separated from the OFB, this process is assumed to rely mostly on across-channel comparison of temporal envelopes. Since cochlear implants (CIs) rely predominantly on the transmission of envelope cues, we investigated if CMR {{can be observed in}} electric hearing. We stimulated the auditory nerve of eight CI users with trains of modulated electric pulses presented on an OFB electrode alone, or together with pulse trains on one or two FB electrodes. Participants had to detect signal-induced changes in the envelope of an electric pulse train masker presented on the OFB electrode. Enve-lopes on FB electrodes were either co-modulated or anti-modulated with the envelope of the OFB masker. We observed CMR 1 in one of the eight CI users. However, significant CMR 2 was observed in most CI users. Reducing amplitude-modulation rate from 20 to 8 Hz, reducing envelopes ' randomness or increas-ing electrode separation did not generally improve CMR 1, but increased the prevalence of CMR 2.

One interpretation of all (<b>masked)</b> <b>signals</b> having a good part of their energy captured by the (masked) low-rank atom is to say that all (<b>masked)</b> <b>signals</b> are 1 -sparse in a dictionary of one (masked) atom. Since we already have an algorithm to learn dictionaries from corrupted signals, we can also employ it to learn the low-rank atom. Moreover, since we have an algorithm to learn dictionaries from corrupted signals that contain a low-rank component, we can iteratively learn the low-rank component atom by atom. Adapting the algorithm also leads to some simplifications. After all, we do not need to find the sparse support, since (almost) all signals are expected to contain the one new atom.

Aschoff concluded that the oscillator or circadian clock “integrates” over the intensity of light to which it has been exposed, and then responds with a change in the period of activity, as seen in greenfinches, chaffinches, hamsters, and siskins.

Here, we studied the energetic cost of vibrational signalling in the leafhopper Aphrodes makarovi (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). We measured O 2 consumption of a single male for 15 – 30 min using the closed-bottle method and a lifetime-based optode, while we recorded emitted vibrational signals with a laser vibrometer. Males were emitting three types of vibrational <b>signals</b> (advertisement calls, <b>masking</b> <b>signals</b> and pulse signals), and the respiration rate was significantly positively correlated with the cumulative signalling time.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop and demonstrate a technique for encrypting information by using a <b>masking</b> <b>signal</b> that closely approximates local ambient noise. <b>Signal</b> <b>masking</b> techniques developed to date have used nonlinear differential equations, spread spectrum, and various modulation schemes to encode information. While these techniques can effectively hide a <b>signal,</b> the resulting <b>masks</b> may not appear as ambient noise to an observer. The advantage of the proposed technique over commonly used masking methods is that the transmitted signal will appear as normal background noise, thus greatly reducing the probability of detection and exploitation. A promising near-term application of this technology presents itself in the area of clandestine minefield reconnaissance in shallow water areas. Shallow water mine-counter-mine (SWMCM) activity is essential for minefield avoidance, efficient minefield clearance, and effective selection of transit lanes within minefields. A key technology area for SWMCM is the development of special sonar waveforms with low probability of exploitation/intercept (LPE/LPI) attributes. In addition to LPE/LPI sonar, this technology has the potential to enable significant improvements in underwater acoustic communications. For SWMCM, the chaotic waveform research provides a mechanism for encrypted communications between a submarine (SSN) and an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) via an acoustic channel. Acoustic SSN/UUV communications would eliminate the need for a fiberoptic link between the two vessels, thus increasing the robustness of SWMCM. Similar applications may exist in the areas of radar masking and secure communications. The original approach called for the use of polynomial maps to generate a <b>masking</b> <b>signal.</b> Because polynomial maps were found to have highly restrictive stability criteria, the approach was modified to use radial basis function (RBF) maps. they have shown that stable RBF maps that closely approximate an ambient sea state can be derived using nonlinear systems theory.
