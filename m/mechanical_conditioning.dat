50|$|Inbicon {{utilizes}} a hydrothermal pretreatment process {{after the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> of the feedstock. The premise {{of this process}} is to produce a fibre fraction and a liquid fraction through an extraction using hot water. In the fibre fraction this process achieves greater than 80% of the lignin present in the initial feedstock. Whereas the liquid fraction contains: C5 sugars, alkali chlorides and fermentation inhibitors. The main fermentation inhibitor present is acetic acid. However, the fermentation inhibitors can later be removed through detoxification with NH3 at a feasible cost. Since this pretreatment process does not use acids or bases and only water it eliminates the need to extract pretreatment chemicals once completed.During the initial step of the hydrothermal pretreatment process the feedstock is soaked and simultaneously placed in temperatures of up to 100 °C and ambient pressure. This allows for the extraction of air present and saturates the feedstock with water. The next step entails a pressurized treatment at elevated temperatures in the range of 170 to 230 °C through the addition of hot water or steam for approximately 5-15 minutes. This pressurized treatment can be repeated at altered temperatures and pressures in different zones increasing each subsequent time, therefore, labeled as a counter-current process. The steam released during the hydrothermal pre-treatment process is collected and reused in downstream evaporation processes. Throughout the hydrothermal pretreatment, there are acids formed that causes the fibre fraction to be nearly neutral in pH. The main benefit of this is that the pH will have to barely be adjusted for enzymatic liquefaction.|$|E

This investigation examined the consequences of <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning,</b> using brushing and impedance, on subsequent field performance of tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Mechanically conditioned transplants of processing tomatoes resumed growth after transplant shock as quickly as did untreated plants, and subsequent canopy development was also equal. In 4 years of field trials, yield was not reduced by <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Transplants for fresh-market tomatoes may be more sensitive to injury than those for processing tomatoes because they flower sooner after the conditioning treatments. Nevertheless, neither earliness nor defects in the fruits of the first cluster were affected by <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Early and total yields were equal in both years that fresh-market crops were tested. Thus, there were no adverse effects on field performance of either processing or fresh-market tomatoes as a result of reducing stem elongation by <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> before transplanting.

In wind-tunnel tests, brushed and impeded plants resisted stem bending at wind speeds 4 to 12 km·h– 1 higher than did untreated plants.

Cardiac ATDPCs, grown on 3 different patterned surfaces, were mechanically stretched for 7 days at 1 Hz. A custom-designed, magnet-based, mechanical stimulator device was developed to apply ~ 10 % mechanical stretching to monolayer cell cultures.

Cell differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition can be influenced through {{a wide variety}} of in vitro culture techniques including biochemical stimuli, cell-cell interactions, <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> and scaffold physical properties. In order to systematically optimize in vitro conditions for tissue engineering experiments, the individual effects of these different components must be studied. PEG hydrogels are a suitable scaffold for this because of their biocompatibility and biological "blank slate" nature. This dissertation presents data investigating: the effects of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as biochemical stimuli on pig vocal fold fibroblasts (PVFfs); the effects of <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> and cell-cell interactions on smooth muscle cells (SMCs); and the effects of scaffold physical properties on SMCs. Results show that GAGs influence PVFf behavior and are an important component in scaffold design. Hyaluronic acid (HA) formulations showed similar production in collagen I and III as well as reduced levels of smooth muscle a-actin (SMa-actin), while chondroitin sulfate (CSC) and heparin sulfate showed enriched collagen III environments with enhanced expression of SMa-actin. A physiological flow system was developed to give comprehensive control over in vitro <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> on TEVGs. Experiments performed on SMCs involved creating multi-layered TEVGs to mimic natural vascular tissue. Constructs subjected to <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> with an endothelial cell (EC) layer showed enhanced expression of SMC differentiation markers calponin h 1 and myocardin and enhanced deposition of elastin.

This study describes a novel approach by mimicking only the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle, re-sulting in tissue straining. A novel, yet simplified, bioreactor system was developed for this purpose by applying a dynamic pressure difference over a closed tissue engineered valve, thereby inducing dynamic strains within the leaflets. Besides the use of dynamic strains, the developing leaflet tissues were exposed to prestrain induced {{by the use of}} a stented geometry. To demonstrate the feasibility of this strain-based conditioning approach, human heart valve leaflets were engineered and their mechanial behavior evaluated. The actual dynamic strain magnitude in the leaflets over time was estimated using numerical analyses. Preliminary results showed superior tissue formation and non-linear tissue-like mechanical properties in the strained valves when compared to non-loaded tissue strips. In conclusion, the strain-based condi-tioning approach, using both prestrain and dynamic strains, offers new possibilities for bioreactor design and optimization of tissue properties towards a tissue-engineered aortic human heart valve replacement.

Prospects come from the modern tall building design strategies, for example the use of double-skin façade to give addition of building skin which could provide indoor temperature protection from outside.

40|$|In today’s {{increasingly}} energy conscious society, {{the methods}} of providing thermal comfort to humans are constantly under scrutiny. Depending on the climate, and the comfort requirements of the occupants, buildings can be designed to heat and cool occupants with passive methods, as well as mechanical methods. In the subtropics, where buildings often need to be heated {{in the winter and}} cooled in the summer, a synthesis of these two methods would be ideal. However, there is a disconnect between the integration of passive cooling and <b>mechanical</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> in subtropical architecture. A study of user attitudes, based out of Australia, found that, “Central control of temperatures has been used to cut demand by preventing users from altering thermostats {{and other parts of the}} building for microclimate control. In particular, windows are sealed to prevent tampering. ” 1 Reliance on air conditioning has the everyday person convinced that if we save energy in the right places, we can use air conditioning as much as we like. The same study goes on to state, “Air-conditioning has been assumed to replace the need for climate design features in buildings creating poor thermal design and high energy use. ” 2 This can be most clearly seen in our public buildings. Fully conditioned buildings pump cool air into sealed envelopes, adjusting the thermostat to regulate thermal comfort year-round, often in a climate in which <b>mechanical</b> air <b>conditioning</b> is needed only four months of the year, and during the warmest hours of the day. Inversely, ventilated buildings provide passive cooling in a climate in which the temperature and humidity are often too high for thermal comfort during the same four months of the year. In his book Natural Ventilation in Buildings, Francis Allard points out that the global energy efficiency movement, begun in the early 1990 s, has now emerged as a concept that incorporates active air conditioning and sitespecific climate design of buildings into one holistic approach. 3 However, these buildings exist in more dry and temperate climates, and do not fully apply to the subtropics as cooling models. A model is needed for subtropical architecture allowing a building to reach both ends of the spectrum; from natural ventilation, through mechanical ventilation, to <b>mechanical</b> air <b>conditioning.</b> The goal of this thesis is to design a hybrid model for subtropical architecture which maximizes the use of natural and mechanical ventilation, and minimizes the use of <b>mechanical</b> air <b>conditioning.</b> The vehicle for this explanation is the design of an educational facility. Research of thermal comfort needs for occupants in the subtropics was accompanied with observation studies. This research was compared with case study, site and program analysis. The analysis was supplemented by a handbook of passive and mechanical cooling which was compiled to aid in establishing cooling strategies for the design process. The implementation of the research and analysis was brought to a conclusion that successfully achieved the goals of this thesis.

Methods: A moderate contusion injury of the spinal cord was created with a force-directed impactor in forty-eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats, and, at one week postinjury, the spinal cords were reexposed in all animals.

40|$|The {{autogenous}} {{saphenous vein}} remains the graft {{of choice for}} both coronary (500, 000 annually in the US) and peripheral (80, 000 annually) arterial bypass procedures. Failure of arterial vein grafts (AVGs) remains a major problem, and patients with failed grafts will die or require re-operation. Intimal hyperplasia (IH) accounts for 20 % to 40 % of all AVG failures. It is believed that this adverse pathological response by AVGs {{is largely due to}} their abrupt exposure to the significantly elevated circumferential wall stress (CWS) associated with the arterial system. We believe that if an AVG is given an ample opportunity to adapt and remodel to the stresses of its new environment, cellular injury may be reduced, thus limiting the initiating mechanisms of IH. The goal of this work was to develop a new <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> paradigm, {{in the form of a}} peri-adventitially placed, biodegradable polymer wrap, to safely and functionally "arterialize" AVGs in situ. The polymer wrap was tuned so that as it degraded over a desired period of time, the mechanical support offered by it was reduced and the vein was exposed to gradually increasing levels of CWS in situ. To investigate the effects of <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> on AVGs, we utilized both our well established, validated ex vivo vascular perfusion system (EVPS) as well as an appropriate preclinical animal model. The "engineering" component of this bioengineering study was to enhance our EVPS capabilities. Enhancements were made in the form of rigorous mathematical modeling, via subspace system identification, and automatic feedback control, via proportional integral and derivative control, of the arterial CWS and shear stress waveform generation capabilities of the EVPS. Pairs of freshly harvested porcine internal jugular veins (PIJVs) were perfused ex vivo under several biomechanical conditions. The acute hyperplastic response of PIJVs abruptly exposed to arterial hemodynamic conditions was compared to PIJVs perfused under normal venous conditions. In an attempt to attenuate this acute hyperplastic response, an ex vivo <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> paradigm was imposed onto the PIJVs both via manual adjustment of EVPS parameters and via an adventitially placed tuned electrospun biodegradable polymer wrap. Early markers of IH were evaluated post-perfusion, and they included vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, proliferation, and phenotypic modulation. Quantification of these markers via immunohistochemical techniques provided the foundation for the final stage of this work. To assess the efficacy of the tuned electrospun biodegradable polymer wrap in attenuating the development of intimal hyperplasia in AVGs, a series of preclinical studies was performed in a pig model. PIJVs abruptly exposed to arterial levels of CWS showed a significant increase in apoptosis and in the number of synthetic smooth muscle cells, as well as a decrease in proliferation. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>conditioning,</b> via both manual adjustment of the EVPS parameters and placement of the biodegradable adventitial wrap, appeared to have beneficial effects on the acute hyperplastic response of PIJVs perfused ex vivo.

Future work should be aimed at enhancing the beneficial effects of the electrospun biodegradable polymer wrap by incorporating the delivery of drugs and/or stem cells in addition to the delivery of structural support to AVGs...|$|E

Currently, bypass surgery using autologous vessels, allografts, and synthetic grafts are known as a commonly used for arterial substitutes 2. However, these grafts have limited applications when an inner diameter of arteries is less than 6 mm due to low availability, thrombotic complications, compliance mismatch, and late intimal hyperplasia 3, 4. To overcome these limitations, tissue engineering has been successfully applied as a promising alternative to develop small-diameter arterial constructs that are nonthrombogenic, robust, and compliant. Several previous studies have developed small-diameter arterial constructs with tri-lamellar structure, excellent mechanical properties and burst pressure comparable to native arteries 5, 6.

40|$|Similar {{to native}} {{cardiovascular}} tissues, the mechanical properties of engineered cardiovascular constructs {{depend on the}} composition {{and quality of the}} extracellular matrix, which is a net result of matrix remodeling processes within the tissue. To improve tissue remodeling, and hence tissue mechanical properties, various <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> protocols, such as strain-based or flow-based conditioning, have been applied to engineered cardiovascular constructs with promising results. We hypothesize that tissue remodeling is dependent on the mode of straining. Therefore, the effects of two modes of straining, being either static or dynamic, were quantified on several indices of tissue remodeling. Differences in matrix composition (collagen and glycosaminoglycans [GAGs]) and maturity (collagen cross-links) were quantified with time on gene expression and protein levels. In addition, the secretion of specific collagen remodeling markers (matrix metalloproteinase- 1), collagen synthesis marker (procollagen type I carboxy-terminal propeptide, PIP), and collagen degradation marker (carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I, ICTP) was investigated with time. Static strain stimulated collagen gene expression and production with time. Dynamic straining resulted in (1) lower collagen gene expression and production, but (2) enhanced collagen cross-link expression and density, and GAG production, and (3) stimulated collagen remodeling processes, as expressed by enhanced production of remodeling markers. Thus, despite a lower collagen production, the quality of the neotissue was enhanced by a dynamic straining component. These straining mode-dependent remodeling responses allow us {{for the first time to}} balance collagen and cross-link production and, thus, to fine tune tissue mechanical properties via <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> protocols.

Our results have demonstrated that both bovine and human-derived chondrocytes demonstrate a dose-dependent response to flow rate (0 - 1 mL/min) in terms of cell number and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content. This may reflect the weak adhesion of cells to the sponge scaffolds and the immature state of the constructs even after 3 weeks of proliferative culture. Our studies define an optimal flow rate between 0. 1 and 0. 3 mL/min for direct perfusion and free flow bioreactors. Using fresh bovine chondrocytes and a lower flow rate of 0. 1 mL/min, a comparison was made between free flow system and direct perfusion system. In the free flow bioreactor, no cell loss was observed and higher GAG production was measured compared with static cultured controls. However, as with direct perfusion, the enhancement effect of free flow perfusion was strongly dependent on the maturation and organization of the constructs before the stimulation. To address the maturation of the matrix, preculture periods were varied before <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning.</b> An increase in culture duration of 18 days before <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> resulted in enhanced GAG production compared with controls. Interestingly, additional enhancement was found in specimens that were further subjected to a prolonged duration of perfusion (63 % increase after an additional 4 days of perfusion) after prematuration. The free flow system has an advantage over the direct perfusion system, especially when using sponge scaffolds, which have lower mechanical properties; however, mass transfer of nutrients is still more optimal throughout the scaffolds in a direct perfusion system as demonstrated by histological analysis. Application {{of mechanical}} stimulation, using dynamic bioreactors, is considered an effective strategy to enhance cellular behavior in load-bearing tissues.

40|$|Field drying {{experiments}} {{in summer and}} winter compared the drying rate of lucerne hay cut with a rotary disc mower and mower-conditioner, with or without 300 1 ha of 2 % aqueous potassium carbonate solution sprayed at cutting. Local farm practice was followed in cutting, raking and drying. Statistical analysis showed significant treatment differences in both summer and winter experiments. Mechanical-cum-chemical conditioning treatment provided the greatest field drying rate, followed by chemical conditioning alone, <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> alone and non-conditioned lucerne, respectively. The effectiveness of mechanical and chemical conditioning treatments was greater in summer than in winter. Under good S. E. Queensland summer conditions, mechanical-cum-chemical conditioning would allow hay to be cut and baled on the same day, but at least 4 days were required under cool winter weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Progenitor cells {{derived from}} the oral mucosa lamina propria (OMLP-PCs) {{demonstrate}} an ability to differentiate into tissue lineages removed from their anatomical origin. This clonally derived population of neural-crest cells have demonstrated potential to differentiate along mesenchymal and neuronal cell lineages. Objective Significant efforts are being made to generate functioning muscle constructs for use in research and clinical tissue engineering. In this study we aimed to determine the myogenic properties of clonal populations of expanded OMLP-PCs. Design PCs were subject to several in vitro culture conditions {{in an attempt to}} drive myogenic conversion. Methodologies include use of demethylation gene-modifying reagents, <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditioning</b> of tissue culture substrates, tuneable polyacrylamide gels and a 3 -dimensional construct as well as published myogenic media compositions. PCR and immunostaining for the muscle cell markers Desmin and MyoD 1 were used to assess muscle differentiation...|$|E
40|$|An Australian {{research}} facility, {{conducted a}} study on several different school classrooms in regards to their thermal comfort, CO 2 levels, air temperature stratification and ventilation rates in a selection of Victorian (Melbourne, Australia) schools during a winter season. A brief literature review reveals similar IAQ problems elsewhere (outside Australia) and suggests several HVAC concepts that provide potential solutions. Our intention is to highlight particular IAQ discrepancies in existing school classroom design resulting from these case study measurements, suggesting construction and <b>mechanical</b> operational <b>conditioning</b> improvements. In particular this research confirms the urgency and necessity of addressing IAQ problems in schools, world wide. Our results of the Australian school classroom measurements are similar {{to other parts of}} the world, indicating that CO 2 levels, ventilation rates and air temperatures are non-compliant with the standards...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of the UK building stock has increased the pressure on architects, engineers and building operators to reduce the use of air conditioning in favour of more passive cooling solutions. Good {{progress has been made}} in this direction but many passive solutions are limited to new-build projects. For existing buildings, and those for which <b>mechanical</b> air <b>conditioning</b> cannot be avoided, low energy cooling capability can be incorporated to improve significantly overall efficiency. This paper focuses on one such example – cooling using groundwater, which has gained popularity in recent years in the London area. Among the reasons for this are the excellent energy efficiency and the increasing viability of water abstraction systems. The paper shows that groundwater cooling technology can be incorporated into new and existing buildings to help reduce their {{environmental impact}}...|$|R
5000|$|The city grew explosively in the 1950s; the {{population}} expanded {{by a factor}} of three, and industry {{by a factor of}} fifteen. The growth brought serious problems of minority housing, traffic congestion, smog, and a fading of the traditional laid-back Phoenix lifestyle. By 1950, over 105,000 people lived within the city and thousands more in surrounding communities. There were 148 miles (238 km) of paved streets and 163 miles (262 km) of unpaved streets. [...] The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in <b>mechanical</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat known to Phoenix during its long summers. Affordable cooling in the decade contributed to a wild building boom. In 1959 alone, Phoenix saw more new construction than it had in the more than three decades from 1914 to 1946.|$|R
