2500|$|In psychiatry, {{pathological}} lying (also called compulsive lying, pseudologia fantastica and <b>mythomania)</b> is {{a behavior}} of habitual or compulsive lying. It was first {{described in the}} medical literature in 1891 by Anton Delbrueck. Although it is a controversial topic, pathological lying {{has been defined as}} [...] "falsification entirely disproportionate to any discernible end in view, may be extensive and very complicated, and may manifest {{over a period of years}} or even a lifetime". The individual may be aware they are lying, or may believe they are telling the truth, being unaware that they are relating fantasies.|$|E
2500|$|About {{this time}} Burgess {{collapsed}} in a Brunei classroom while teaching history and {{was diagnosed as}} having an inoperable brain tumour. Burgess was given just a year to live, prompting him to write several novels to get money to provide for his widow. He gave a different account, however, [...] to Jeremy Isaacs in a Face to Face interview on the BBC The Late Show (21 March 1989). He said [...] "Looking back now I see that I was driven out of the Colonial Service. I think possibly for political reasons that were disguised as clinical reasons." [...] He alluded to this {{in an interview with}} Don Swaim, explaining that his wife Lynne had said something [...] "obscene" [...] to the British Queen's consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, during an official visit, and the colonial authorities turned against him. He had already earned their displeasure, he told Swaim, by writing articles in the newspaper in support of the revolutionary opposition party the Parti Rakyat Brunei, and for his friendship with its leader Dr. Azahari. Burgess' biographers attribute the incident to the author's notorious <b>mythomania.</b> Geoffrey Grigson writes, He was, however, suffering from the effects of prolonged heavy drinking (and associated poor nutrition), of the often oppressive south-east Asian climate, of chronic constipation, and of overwork and professional disappointment. As he put it, the scions of the sultans and of the élite in Brunei [...] "did not wish to be taught", because the free-flowing abundance of oil guaranteed their income and privileged status. He may also have wished for a pretext to abandon teaching and get going full-time as a writer, having made a late start.|$|E
50|$|Is <b>mythomania</b> an evil trait, or a sickness? Jeanne, {{played by}} Marie Trintignant, can never {{tell the truth}} {{for more than two}} minutes. She fears that reality is too much for her. And Guillaume Depardieu, who plays the role of her lover, discovers her <b>mythomania,</b> but stays in love with her.|$|E
50|$|Botto's <b>mythomania</b> {{seems to}} have been a lifelong trait of his. He talked about {{unlikely}} friendships with people like Vaslav Nijinsky, Federico García Lorca or André Gide. On the other hand, he never alluded to his modest background or ever talked about his parents or brothers.|$|E
50|$|Once again, Bode {{was making}} himself unwelcome. He drank too much, was {{stealing}} and skipping out on bills again. Bode was even {{taken in by}} the Gestapo and was imprisoned in the Grini concentration camp from 22 December 1942 to 30 January 1943. He was labeled a suspicious person due to his own {{claims to be a}} spy for the Swedish government, but by then his <b>mythomania</b> was so widely known that nobody believed him, and he was finally sent back to Sweden.|$|E
5000|$|Again on his mother's advice, Ranucci wrote a 74-page {{document}} titled [...] "Récapitulatif" [...] ("Summary") {{while on}} death row, {{in which he}} summed up the case {{from his point of}} view, and attempted to prove he was innocent. Gérard Bouladou, who has written books about the case, observes signs of <b>mythomania</b> in this document and argues that Ranucci was trying to persuade himself of his own innocence. His appeal for a second trial was denied by the Court of Cassation on June 17, 1976.|$|E

Initially published in German, an English version was later produced. Complimentary copies of the book were distributed by Turkish organisations to US governmental officials, university libraries and individuals. A short time before he died he finished his last book, called Armenian <b>Mythomania.</b>|$|E

50|$|For {{the most}} part, Bode lived far more extravagantly {{than he was}} able to afford. He was a {{well-known}} figure in show business in those days, and was liked in the pubs because of his generous style. Even {{the fact that he was}} often broke didn't stop him. He was a master of sneaking out the back door and letting others pay his debts. Another distinguishing characteristic of Bode was his unmatched <b>mythomania.</b> Over and over again he lied to others, a personality flaw that blackened his career. He became good friends with Gösta Ekman and was almost like a son to him, until the day Ekman discovered that Bode had tried to sell their silverware set to a pawnbroker. Bode skipped out on countless hotel bills, and was blacklisted by several of Stockholm's finest restaurants. He was also involved in the theft of expensive carpets, and embezzlement through false checks.|$|E
5000|$|In an scathing account {{published}} in a history of Brazilian literature {{in the year of}} Tolentino's death, his fellow-poet Alexei Bueno charged Tolentino with having faked his entire biography from the earliest date, beginning with [...] "his manor house and his English private female tutors": according to Bueno, Tolentino had been born [...] "amid the most banal middle-class milieu from the neighbourhood of Tijuca, as the child of a military man, and had spent his teens in small apartments in the same neighbourhood and in Niterói". According also to Bueno, during 1957, when still in Brazil, Tolentino had been involved in a case of plagiarism, having published a book of poetry whose title and poems were taken from others. His later self-attributed resounding intellectual feats abroad, as well as his alleged connections with European literary figures, were, according to the same Bueno, simply a hoax, as [...] "in order to have lived all happenings he publicly boasted of, Tolentino should have lived nearly three hundred years". Bueno, however, eventually downplayed what he saw as his <b>mythomania</b> by comparing him to the eminent filmmaker Mário Peixoto - who had put in circulation a bogus complimentary article on his work by Eisenstein - as well as acknowledging Tolentino's talent as a satirical poet.|$|E

L'aristocrate russe et son curieux " homme d'affaires " Du duo au quatuor : entrée en scène de la compositrice et de l'inventeur Délations et antisémitisme L'après-guerre : déchirement et transfiguration des victimes du nazisme Épilogue*** Résumé - Visciano vs. Cauvet de Blanchonval (1940 - 1971) : Denunciations, <b>mythomania</b> and {{antisemitism}} Historian Laurent Joly {{calls into}} question preconceptions about denunciations, notably the modest social origins of the denouncers, {{as well as the}} alleged proclivity of women towards denunciation. He also notes that no social milieu was immune to denunciation. The " Affair " which opposed Victorine Visciano and Catherine Cauvet de Blanchonval confirms the complexity of attitudes, the infinite nuances of " gray areas " and the fact that some individuals denounced people to the authorities even as they themselves were victims of repression, and, in some cases, even members of the resistance. Even as we look to the most frequent psychological motivations for denunciation [...] jealousy, the lure of financial gain and revenge, this sordid story is exceptional in more than one way, {{not only because of the}} personalities involved, but also because of its long duration. It testifies above all to the important repercussions of denunciations during the Second World War and the propensity of all the governmental administrations of the day involved in surveillance to follow through on the most fantastical rumors. ***URL : [URL] (consulté le 28 / 05 / 2014...|$|E
