This discrepancy between the wide appearance of IL-15 mRNA and limited production of protein might be explained by the presence of the twelve in humans and five in mice upstream initiating codons, which can repress translation of IL-15 mRNA. Translational inactive mRNA is stored within the cell and can be induced upon specific signal. Expression of IL-15 can be stimulated by cytokine such as GM-CSF, double-strand mRNA, unmethylated CpG oligonucleotides, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through Toll-like receptors (TLR), interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or after infection of monocytes herpes virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans (Figure 2).|$|E

Apo 2 L/TRAIL interacts with an unusually complex receptor system, which in humans comprises two death receptors and three decoy receptors. This molecule has received considerable attention recently because of the finding that <b>many</b> cancer <b>cell</b> types are sensitive to Apo 2 L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis, while most normal cells appear to be resistant to this action of Apo 2 L/TRAIL. In this review, we specifically emphasise on the actions of Apo 2 L/TRAIL with respect to its apoptotic signaling pathways and summarise what is known about its physiological role. The potential therapeutic usefulness of Apo 2 L/TRAIL, especially in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, is also discussed in some detail. S. Bouralexis, D. M. Findlay and A. Evdokio...|$|R
40|$|First {{described}} for their metabolic and immunosuppressive effects, glucocorticoids are widely prescribed in clinical settings of inflammation. However, glucocorticoids are also potent inducers of apoptosis in <b>many</b> <b>cell</b> types <b>and</b> <b>tissues.</b> This review {{will focus on}} the established mechanisms of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and outline what is known about the apoptotic response in <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> <b>tissues</b> of the body after exposure to glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis affects the skeletal system, muscular system, circulatory system, nervous system, endocrine system, reproductive system, and the immune system. Interestingly, several cell types have an anti-apoptotic response to glucocorticoids that is cytoprotective. Lastly, we will discuss the pro- and anti-apoptotic effects of glucocorticoids in cancers and their clinical implications...|$|R
