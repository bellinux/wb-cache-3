40|$|We {{introduce}} C-Slate, a new vision-based system, which utilizes stereo cameras above {{a commercially}} available tablet technology to support remote collaboration. The horizontally <b>mounted</b> <b>tablet</b> provides the user with high resolution stylus input, which is augmented by multi-touch interaction {{and recognition of}} untagged everyday physical objects using new stereo vision and machine learning techniques. This provides a novel and interesting interactive tabletop arrangement, capable of supporting a variety of fluid multi-touch interactions, including symmetric and asymmetric bimanual input, coupled {{with the potential for}} incorporating tangible objects into the user interface. When used in a remote context, these features are combined with the ability to see visual representations of remote users ’ hands and remote physical objects placed on top of the surface. This combination of bimanual and tangible interaction and sharing of remote gestures and physical objects provides a new way to collaborate remotely, complementing existing channels such as audio and video conferencing. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an Intelligent Shopping Assistant {{designed for a}} shopping cart <b>mounted</b> <b>tablet</b> PC that enables individual interactions with customers. We use machine learning algorithms to predict a shopping list for the customer’s current trip and present this list on the device. As they navigate through the store, personalized promotions are presented using consumer models derived from loyalty card data for each inidvidual. In order for shopping assistant devices to be effective, we {{believe that they have}} to be powered by algorithms that are tuned for individual customers and can make accurate predictions about an individual’s actions. We formally frame the shopping list prediction as a classification problem, describe the algorithms and methodology behind our system, and show that shopping list prediction can be done with high levels of accuracy, precision, and recall. Beyond the prediction of shopping lists we briefly introduce other aspects of the shopping assistant project, {{such as the use of}} consumer models to select appropriate promotional tactics, and the development of promotion planning simulation tools to enable retailers to plan personalized promotions delivered through such a shopping assistant...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Meeting the assistive {{technology}} needs of clients in an Irish rehabilitation hospital is challenging given current staffing and financial resources. This paper describes the intervention by a pilot {{assistive technology}} team to facilitate access to mainstream technologies for one {{woman with a}} C 5 spinal cord injury during rehabilitation. Method: The pilot assistive technology team included a clinical rehabilitation engineering student (on a 12 week placement), an occupational therapist and a {{speech and language therapist}} each with 4 hours per week allocated to assistive technology. A single case study of a woman in her 60 ’s is described using photographs to illustrate components of the team intervention and treatment outcomes. Anne (not her real name) sustained a spinal injury following a fall resulting in tetraplegia (C 5 ASIA B). Her functional ability was further compromised by severe bilateral contractures in her upper limb joints. Findings: Interventions included: learning to access a Kindle e-reader; navigation of an iPad; navigation of an Android tablet and use of a standard mobile telephone. These efforts involved a combination of: splinting; customisation of pointing devices; mounting of devices; consideration of switch use; adjustment of everyday devices; trial of various computer apps as well as the development of some digital literacy skills. Anne was able to access <b>mounted</b> <b>tablet</b> computers, an electronic e-reader and her own mobile phone. Successful incorporation of these skills into her daily life required practice and regular review of set-up and access methods as well as frequent adjustments to ensure the intervention matched her changing desires and physical abilities. Conclusion: This single case study provides a description of team work, client centred care and clinical outcomes during a rehabilitation for spinal cord injury programme. While it does not include advanced technological interventions it describes and illustrates the real efforts of a new assistive technology team to enable a person with significant physical restrictions to use and enjoy mainstream technology...|$|E

40|$|This thesis project {{considers}} the potential use of inertial navigation on a consumer grade <b>tablet</b> <b>mounted</b> {{in a vehicle}} in an underground mine. The goal is to identify which sensors and techniques are useful and to design a navigation algorithm based on those results. The navigation algorithm is intended to work alongside the current received signal strength indication (RSSI) positioning system. Testing of the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer sensors suggest that, while dead reckoning is likely not precise enough, an orientation filter can be designed {{that can be used}} for navigation. A complementary orientation filter using the gyroscope and accelerometer is then designed that shows better results than the default sensor fusion solutions available in Android. The filter is expandable and can come to include magnetometer data in the future. Based on the outputs of this filter, a navigation algorithm based onangle matching with map information is proposed. Precise positioning in an underground mine can be crucial to employee safety, and may also bring production benefits...|$|R

They met virtually no resistance from the local militia in this area until they reached Grumman Hill, where fifty Continental troops and a few militiamen, all under the command of Captain Stephen Betts, attempted to halt Tryon's advance. After a brief skirmish the British took the hill and sent the colonists fleeing.|$|R

50|$|In 1766, Mylne was {{appointed}} Surveyor to St Paul's Cathedral, completed by Sir Christopher Wren some 55 years earlier. Nominated by the Lord Mayor of London, his salary was £50 a year. In this capacity, Mylne {{was responsible for}} erecting a monument to Wren, whose only memorial {{at the time was}} in the basement. The existing Latin epitaph, Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice (reader, if you seek his monument, look around you), was re-used on a <b>tablet</b> <b>mounted</b> on the organ screen in 1810, although this was destroyed in the Blitz. He purchased over 200 of Wren's drawings, with his own money, and had them bound and presented to the Cathedral, thus recording the building's history for posterity. On the death of Lord Nelson at Trafalgar in 1805, Mylne was partly responsible for the state funeral, building Nelson's sarcophagus in the Cathedral basement, although the design of the monument fell to James Wyatt of the Office of Works. Mylne, together with the manufacturer Matthew Boulton, arranged for a secret deposit of commemorative medals, of Boulton's making, to be placed inside the sarcophagus prior to Nelson's interment.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Squeeze Me, a squeezable device used to grab {{attention from}} the mobile robot Care-Obot, providing ground for expressive values to be shared between person and robot in a smart environment. Squeeze Me consists of a soft rubbery interactive cover, that can be <b>mounted</b> on a <b>tablet,</b> to enable expression-rich communication. The cover embeds two specifically designed resistive analogue pressure sensors. The expressions exerted on the device by the person are mapped to movements of the robot {{as well as to}} an expressive mask displayed on the graphical user interface (GUI) of the tablet that is used to control the robot. This mask shows the robot's view on the environment as well as its internal states (feelings). A short pinch exercised by the person on the cover results in a sturdy movement of the robot. A hard squeeze results in a quick movement and a gentle touch in a slow approach. All changes in movement are mapped to the modifications in the expressions of the mask, e. g. from neutral to surprise, or joy, depending on the context of interaction.

40|$|For a blind swimmer {{to be able}} to {{exercise}} in a swimming pool today, human assistance is required to notifying the swimmer in due time when and if she is too close to the edge. The purpose of this thesis was {{to see whether or not}} it is possible to replace and even improve the human intervention using a warning system built around a <b>tablet</b> <b>mounted</b> next to the pool edge. A secondary goal was to evaluate how suitable a tablet pc is for robotic applications. The system proposed utilizes a tablet’s built-in frontal facing camera, OpenCV as vision library, FM modules for the wireless warning system and is intended for the Android environment. Videos of the real scenario have been analyzed on a computer using OpenCV and a detection algorithm searching for the swimmer’s red swimming cap has been developed. Next, the algorithm was implemented on an Android tablet. The result obtained shows that it is perfectly possible to use a cheap tablet to accurately detect and notify the blind swimmer in due time when she is too close to the edge. If calibrated thoroughly, the likelihood of a missed detection is actually lower with this system as compared to human intervention, as humans can only warn the swimmer when she is above the water. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractManual {{spot welding}} loses the {{comparison}} with automated spot welding, {{not because of}} a higher execution time, but due to an inferior quality of welded points, mostly a low repeatability. It is not a human fault. Human welder is compelled to operate without having at disposal the knowledge of significant process features that are known by the robot: exact position of the welding spot, electric parameters to be adopted for every specific point, quality of the welded spot and, based on it, possible need for repetition of a defective weld. The research shows that, using an augmented reality device, {{it is possible to}} display this very data to the human operator, in order to enhance the manual process execution. The adopted device is a <b>tablet</b> <b>mounted</b> on the welding gun. It displays the working area seen by the built-in camera.

40|$|Abstract. Handwriting {{experts are}} usually {{required}} {{to differentiate between}} authentic and forged signatures. Therefore, {{it is important to}} develop an objective system to identify forged handwriting, or at least to identify those handwritings that are likely to be forged. Forgers often forge handwriting in terms of shape and size by carefully copying or tracing the authentic handwriting. We hypothesize, therefore, that good forgeries – that is, those that retain the shape and size of authentic writing – are usually written more slowly than authentic writing. We also hypothesize that good forgeries are wrinklier (less smooth) than authentic handwriting. To examine these hypotheses we collected both online and offline data from the same handwriting samples. Experimental subjects wrote handwriting samples on paper <b>mounted</b> on a <b>tablet</b> digitizer, and the x-y coordinates of these online samples were used to calculate the speed of the handwriting. We found that the writing speed of the good forgeries was significantly slower than that of the authentic writings. The paper on which the handwriting samples were written was then digitally scanned at two different resolutions to calculate wrinkliness, which is a fractal number estimate of the jaggedness of the writing. We found that the wrinkliness of the good forgeries was significantly greater than that of the authentic writings, showing {{that it is possible to}} identify candidate forgeries from scanned documents. These studies employed the IBM ThinkPad TransNote, pen-enabled notebook computer. 1...|$|R
40|$|Marked Surfaces The artwork is a {{triptych}} {{of three}} computer <b>tablets</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the wall}} with power cables hanging from them. Each of the tablets was purchased on Ebay. co. uk using the search term 'tablet cracked'. The tablets show signs of previous use and all have damaged screens. Each device shows a sequence of drawings of faces (human and other animals) roughly categorised as full face, profile and sleeping. The drawings, initially made using pencil or pen on paper, were photographed/digitised using the camera of another computer tablet at close range, so that the texture of marks and paper are visible. The sensory modes of seeing and touching are brought together in the touch screen. These modes are also combined {{in the act of}} drawing. If seeing is a process of actively seeking out meaningful configurations (sometimes barely glimpsed), then drawing is a means of marking them in all their uncertainty, from a point of contact. The figure/background structure produced in drawing can be reproduced digitally and made visible in multiple devices of display. Each time a figure is materially reconstituted as part of a device, its meaning is contingent on this specific context. In this artwork, the physical properties of smooth or cracked screens, and plastic or metal bodies, manifest histories of previous ownership and commercial imperatives of hardware design and manufacture. They show evidence of the social, economic and technological developments that have resulted in handheld devices acting as prostheses of embodied relationships. Gallery statement: 'Drawology' exhibition: Drawing is said {{to have the ability to}} record both its own making and the movement of the thoughts and body of the drawer. Bringing together the work of several artists with differing practices Drawology aims to consider whether this premise is applicable to a specific process or genre of drawing or whether it is applicable to drawing generally. In this respect the works in the exhibition represent an expanded field of contemporary drawing in a Fine Art context to include: works on paper, performance, moving image, installation, projections and three-dimensional drawings. The exhibition is part of a larger research project currently being undertaken by Deborah Harty entitled ‘Drawing is phenomenology’.
