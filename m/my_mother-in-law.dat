500|$|In {{response}} to the report, Cheye Calvo issued the following statement: [...] "By commending his deputies for their actions, the Sheriff is placing other innocent families and innocent family pets at risk. There {{is no excuse for}} the no-knock entry into our home, the killing of Payton and Chase, and the prolonged handcuffing of <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> and myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Well, let’s see… the {{guy with}} the poodle on his head would be me. The very {{pregnant}} woman with the sunglasses is my wife Suzanne. The guy in the surgical scrubs is my friend Joel Miller. The woman in the foreground with her legs crossed is my first-cousin-once-removed Tammy (who also played Queen Amidala in my video for [...] "The Saga Begins"). Uh Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay's son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for The Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne's oldest friends. Bermuda's wife Leslie is in there too. Plus there’s <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> my father-in-law, my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt's boyfriend… I think we got maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Nash died in 1647, {{at the age}} of 53. In {{the will}} that he made on 20 August 1642 he bequeathed {{memorial}} rings (a common practice at the time) to Thomas and Judith Quiney, Shakespeare's son-in-law and daughter. Hall's property as if it were his own, and left New Place itself to his cousin, Edward Nash.}} Less straightforwardly, he also bequeathed property that did not belong to him, for example leaving New Place, the property of his mother-in-law Susanna Hall, to his cousin Edward Nash. Indeed, Nash even refers to Susanna in a letter as [...] "Mrs. Hall, <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> who lives with me". Susanna successfully retained the house, which Shakespeare had bought in 1597, after some legal wrangling.|$|E

"A {{very true}} word, Mrs Page; {{and by this}} token, that last Thursday I was here by half-past eleven, {{certainly}} afore noon, having only called at <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> in the way, and it was eight o'clock before I got home. Ah! it's cruel work, is the tommy shop." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following the 1980 presidential election, Bush and {{his family}} moved to Miami-Dade County, Florida. [...] He took a job in real estate with Armando Codina, a 32-year-old Cuban {{immigrant}} and self-made millionaire. Codina had made a fortune in a computer business, and then formed a new company, The Codina Group, to pursue opportunities in real estate. [...] During his time with the company, Bush focused on finding tenants for commercial developments. Codina eventually made Bush his partner in a new development business, which quickly became one of South Florida's leading real estate development firms. As a partner, Bush received 40% of the firm's profits. [...] In 1983, Bush said of his move from Houston to Miami: [...] "On the personal side, <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> and sister-in-law were already living here", and on the professional side, [...] "I want to be very wealthy, and I'll be glad to tell you when I've accomplished that goal." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{first true}} damned stupidity of my life, I had hit <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> lover {{a little too}} hard. I got five years! The prison, {{this is the place}} where I met the biggest number of tossers. A pack of pathetic ones, of losers. But I was put in a cell with a true tough guy. I said: [...] "This is it, my path" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was too distressed to say much. He fervently {{pressed my}} hand; he fervently thanked God {{that my father}} had not lived to hear what he had heard. Then, after a pause, he {{repeated}} <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> name to himself in a doubting, questioning tone. [...] "Macallan?" [...] he said. [...] "Macallan? Where have I heard that name? Why does it sound as if it wasn't strange to me?" ...|$|R

60|$|Just what <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> had said! {{just what}} Benjamin and Major Fitz-David had said! They were all against me. And still I held out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{would hardly}} suspect, Goldmore, that my wife, a Harley Baker, would ever make gin-punch? I think <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> would commit suicide if she saw her.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> {{put her arm}} round me, {{and held}} me to her tenderly. She knew me well enough not {{to speak to me}} at that moment.|$|E
6000|$|My {{companion}} {{shook his}} head, and entreated me to consider well beforehand what I proposed doing. His advice to me--so strangely do extremes meet!--was <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> advice, repeated almost word for word. [...] "Leave {{things as they}} are, my dear. In the interest of your own peace of mind be satisfied with your husband's affection. You {{know that you are}} his wife, and you know that he loves you. Surely that is enough?" ...|$|R
50|$|Much {{was written}} about Alexander's {{supposedly}} promiscuous ways. In her 1915 work Memories of forty years, Catherine Radziwill recalled that:"Alexander, though none too intelligent, was extremely fond of society, feminine society in particular. I {{remember that one}} day, at <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> house, he managed to decoy into an empty room a certain Madame von Wildenbruch, the wife of an illegitimate son of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, and began kissing her with fervour, to the extreme stupefaction and anger of the lady in question, who, it must be added, {{was at that time}} nearly seventy years of age".|$|R
60|$|Let me say {{for myself}} that I was really {{touched by the}} {{kindness}} of <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> letter, though I was not shaken by it in the smallest degree. As long as I lived, moved, and thought, my one purpose now was to make Miserrimus Dexter confide to me his ideas {{on the subject of}} Mrs. Eustace Macallan's death. To those ideas I looked as my guiding stars along the dark way on which I was going. I wrote back to Mrs. Macallan, as I really felt gratefully and penitently. And then I went out to the chaise.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> and I slept {{together}} under the only shelter that the inn could offer to us--a sort of loft {{at the top of}} the house. The night that followed our conversation was bitterly cold. We felt the chilly temperature, in spite of the protection of our dressing-gowns and our traveling-wrappers. <b>My</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> slept, but no rest came to me. I was too anxious and too wretched, thinking over my changed position, and doubting how my husband would receive me, to be able to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me? Nonsense," [...] {{said the}} other, easily. [...] "I was having {{tea in the}} parlour {{with my wife and}} <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> and my brother Joe and his young lady." ...|$|E
60|$|The post of {{the next}} morning decided my course of action. It brought me a letter from <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> which added one more to the memorable dates in my {{domestic}} calendar.|$|E
6000|$|Events had {{separated}} me from Major Fitz-David, {{after the}} date of the dinner-party which had witnessed my memorable meeting with Lady Clarinda. From that time I heard little or nothing of the Major; and I am ashamed to say I had almost entirely forgotten him--when I was reminded of the modern Don Juan by the amazing appearance of wedding-cards, addressed to me at <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> house! The Major had settled in life at last. And, more wonderful still, the Major had chosen as the lawful ruler of his household and himself--"the future Queen of Song," [...] the round-eyed, overdressed young lady with the strident soprano voice! ...|$|R
60|$|Besides, you're Rose's father, and I'm Gerald's sister. If we married I {{should be}} <b>my</b> brother's <b>mother-in-law,</b> and <b>my</b> step-{{daughter}} {{would be my}} sister. Your daughter would be your sister-in-law, and your brother would just snap his fingers at your fatherly advice.|$|R
60|$|The {{effort was}} beyond me. Worn out {{in mind and}} body alike, I was {{perfectly}} incapable of pursuing any regular train of thought. I vaguely felt--if I left things as they were--that I could never hope to remove the shadow which now rested on the married life that had begun so brightly. We might live together, so as to save appearances. But to forget what had happened, or to feel satisfied with my position, was beyond the power of my will. My tranquillity as a woman--perhaps my dearest interests as a wife--depended absolutely on penetrating the mystery of <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> conduct, and on discovering {{the true meaning of}} the wild words of penitence and self-reproach which my husband had addressed to me on our way home.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> had delicately left us together. When he {{said those}} words {{the temptation to}} tell him of the new hope {{that had come to}} {{brighten}} our lives was more than I could resist.|$|E
60|$|Mor. No, indeed; for <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> complains, {{that you}} are past teaching: But if you mistook my {{innocent}} embrace for sin, I wish heartily it had been given where {{it would have been}} more acceptable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that? Why, it {{was merely}} this,--they were on {{intimate}} visiting terms with <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> and I {{knew that it would}} be all up with my plans if they were to be often at the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|The little {{marquise}} stared {{an instant}} at the velvet ledge of the balcony, and then murmured, [...] "Not {{a man of}} stone, a man of wood." [...] Newman had taken her husband's empty chair. She made no protest, and then she turned suddenly and laid her closed fan upon his arm. [...] "I am very glad you came in," [...] she said. [...] "I {{want to ask you}} a favor. I wanted to do so on Thursday, at <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> ball, but you would give me no chance. You were in such very good spirits that I thought you might grant my little favor then; not that you look particularly doleful now. It is something you must promise me; now is the time to take you; after you are married you will be good for nothing. Come, promise!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wished {{very much}} to call upon you yesterday," [...] said he, [...] "but it was impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange; and we {{spent the rest of}} the day with Mrs. Ferrars. Harry was vastly pleased. THIS morning I had fully {{intended}} to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. I understand she is a woman of very good fortune. And the Middletons too, you must introduce me to THEM. As <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> relations, I shall be happy to show them every respect. They are excellent neighbours to you in the country, I understand." ...|$|R
500|$|Returning to the U.S., {{the newlyweds}} settled in a New York City {{house that was}} {{provided}} by Franklin's mother, {{as well as in}} a second residence at the family's estate overlooking the Hudson River in Hyde Park, New York. From the beginning, Eleanor had a contentious relationship with her controlling mother-in-law. The townhouse that Sara gave to Eleanor and Franklin was connected to her own residence by sliding doors, and Sara ran both households in the decade after the marriage. Early on, Eleanor had a breakdown in which she explained to Franklin that [...] "I did not like to live in a house which was not in any way mine, one that I had done nothing about and which did not represent the way I wanted to live", but little changed. Sara also sought to control the raising of her grandchildren, and Eleanor reflected later that [...] "Franklin's children were more <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law's</b> children than they were mine". Eleanor's eldest son James remembered Sara telling her grandchildren, [...] "Your mother only bore you, I am more your mother than your mother is." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> {{was sitting}} alone, near a work-table, knitting. The moment I {{appeared}} in the doorway she laid aside her work, and, rising, signed to me with a commanding gesture of her hand to let her speak first.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort," [...] said <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> {{as quietly}} {{as if she were}} {{addressing}} a perfectly reasonable being. [...] "I am your old friend, Mrs. Macallan; and I have brought Eustace Macallan's second wife to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Louis and I {{are not of}} {{the order}} of men who fear their mothers-in-law, Cary. Our foes never have been, nor will be, those of our own household. I doubt not <b>my</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> will make much of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However your pride may despise me," [...] she wrote, [...] "I am {{indebted to}} you for the rise in life that I have always desired. You may refuse to see me--but you can't prevent <b>my</b> being the <b>mother-in-law</b> of a gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{no need to}} apologise!

You'll like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say." ...|$|R
