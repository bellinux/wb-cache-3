40|$|AbstractPatient {{monitors}} {{in modern}} hospitals have become ubiquitous but they generate an excessive number of false alarms causing alarm fatigue. Our previous work showed that combinations of frequently co-occurring <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms,</b> called SuperAlarm patterns, {{were capable of}} predicting in-hospital code blue events at a lower alarm frequency. In the present study, we extend the conceptual domain of a SuperAlarm to incorporate laboratory test results along with <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms</b> so as to build an integrated data set to mine SuperAlarm patterns. We propose two approaches to integrate <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms</b> with laboratory test results and use a maximal frequent itemsets mining algorithm to find SuperAlarm patterns. Under an acceptable false positive rate FPRmax, optimal parameters including the minimum support threshold {{and the length of}} time window for the algorithm to find the combinations of <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms</b> and laboratory test results are determined based on a 10 -fold cross-validation set. SuperAlarm candidates are generated under these optimal parameters. The final SuperAlarm patterns are obtained by further removing the candidates with false positive rate>FPRmax. The performance of SuperAlarm patterns are assessed using an independent test data set. First, we calculate the sensitivity with respect to prediction window and the sensitivity with respect to lead time. Second, we calculate the false SuperAlarm ratio (ratio of the hourly number of SuperAlarm triggers for control patients to that of the <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms,</b> or that of regular <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms</b> plus laboratory test results if the SuperAlarm patterns contain laboratory test results) and the work-up to detection ratio, WDR (ratio of the number of patients triggering any SuperAlarm patterns to that of code blue patients triggering any SuperAlarm patterns). The experiment results demonstrate that when varying FPRmax between 0. 02 and 0. 15, the SuperAlarm patterns composed of <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms</b> along with the last two laboratory test results are triggered at least once for [56. 7 – 93. 3 %] of code blue patients within an 1 -h prediction window before code blue events and for [43. 3 – 90. 0 %] of code blue patients at least 1 -h ahead of code blue events. However, the hourly number of these SuperAlarm patterns occurring in control patients is only [2. 0 – 14. 8 %] of that of regular <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms</b> with WDR varying between 2. 1 and 6. 5 in a 12 -h window. For a given FPRmax threshold, the SuperAlarm set generated from the integrated data set has higher sensitivity and lower WDR than the SuperAlarm set generated from the regular <b>monitor</b> <b>alarm</b> data set. In addition, the McNemar’s test also shows that the performance of the SuperAlarm set from the integrated data set is significantly {{different from that of the}} SuperAlarm set from the regular <b>monitor</b> <b>alarm</b> data set. We therefore conclude that the SuperAlarm patterns generated from the integrated data set are better at predicting code blue events...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—IPv 6 is an {{attractive}} technology for innovative services {{such as health care}} <b>monitoring,</b> <b>alarm</b> systems, peer to peer applications, virtual machine systems and so on. The generalization of end to end paradigm, possible due to the length of IPv 6 addresses, eases the deployment of such services.

In this paper, we study some of the advantages of using the IPv 6 protocol in home networks but most particularly how to improve the security of home networks. We present an architecture allowing the definition of a partition between groups of applications and where communication between these groups is not permitted if there is no explicit delegation.

40|$|Background: Alarm {{interpretation}} and management are fundamental to managing critically ill patients. 1 There is little research {{as to the}} decision process nurses use to prioritize alarms or manage specific monitor parameters. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} is to gain insight into the intricacy of the intensive care unit (ICU) nurses'critical decision process, using a human performance framework, when responding to <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms.</b> Method: Design: Descriptive design using semi-structured interview. Open-ended questions were developed based on the critical decision method (CDM) to explore ICU nurses' critical decision making process related to <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms.</b> Sixteen ICU nurses at a community hospital were interviewed to elicit perceptions and thought processes related to <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms.</b> Results: Responses to <b>monitor</b> <b>alarms</b> were affected by nursing experience, tones of the alarm, nurses' knowledge of the patient's condition as well as immediate visualization of patient to judge the urgency of an alarm. Both advanced beginner and expert nurses had similar initial response to monitor alarms; however, expert nurses added depth to their immediate assessment process by using previous experiences, intuition, and clinical expertise. Advanced beginner nurses frequently look to expert nurses for advice, guidance, and examples of clinical expertise. The majority of nurses had little or no formal training on the cardiac monitors used by that facility and all felt it would be beneficial in <b>monitor</b> <b>alarm</b> management.

40|$|Abstract—Achieving {{accurate}} and efficient fault localization in large transparent all-optical networks (TONs) {{is an important}} and challenging problem due to unique fault-propagation, time constraints, and scalability requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for optimizing the speed of fault-localization through the selection of an active set of monitors for centralized and hierarchically-distributed management. The proposed technique is capable of providing multiple levels of fault-localization-granularity, from individual discrete optical components to the entire monitoring domains. We formulate and prove the NP-completeness of the optimal monitor acti-vation problem and present its Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation. Furthermore, we propose a novel heuristic whose solution quality is verified by comparing it with an ILP. Extensive simulation results provide supporting analysis and comparisons of achievable alarm-vector reduction, localization coverage, and time complexity, for flat and hierarchically distributed monitor-ing approaches. The impact of network connectivity on fault localization complexity in randomly generated topologies is also studied. Results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed technique in efficient and scalable monitoring of transparent optical networks.

40|$|Vocally {{signaling}} a predator's presence through alarm calls creates {{public information}} regarding {{risk in the}} environment. If having this information confers an advantage, eavesdropping behavior, the use of information in signals by individuals other than the primary target, is expected to evolve. Thus, eavesdropping for information on predation risk to avoid predators may be common. We describe the first study to quantify an effect of avian alarm calling on the perceived cost of predation in a mammalian receiver/eavesdropper using the eastern tufted titmouse [...] eastern chipmunk dyad. We used the technique of giving-up densities to quantify changes in chipmunks' perceived risk of predation while foraging under experimental playbacks of titmouse vocalizations (seet, mobbing, and contact calls), hawk calls, and wood thrush song (control). Titmouse mobbing calls significantly increased chipmunk's perceived risk of predation. Chipmunks also appeared to divert attention (i. e., cost of multitasking) to <b>monitoring</b> <b>alarm</b> call playbacks/assessing predation risk {{as shown by the}} absence of density-dependent foraging. In contrast, when foraging during hawk calls (a direct cue of predation risk), chipmunks showed no differences in foraging relative to controls. These results support other published studies that prey respond more strongly to indirect source of information about predation risk than to direct sources.
