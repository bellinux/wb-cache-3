40|$|Sheet 10 of the 1 : 50, 000 {{geological}} {{map series}} of the Geological Institute, Leiden University, is presented accompanied by a survey of structural, stratigraphic and morphologic features. The region includes part of the southern Axial Zone, {{the eastern end of}} the Nogueras Zone and part of the <b>marginal</b> <b>trough</b> adjacent to the south. Formations mapped range in age from Cambro-Ordovician to Pliocene. Detailed lithostratigraphic studies of the Cambro-Ordovician and Devonian rocks enabled correlations to be made with other regions of the Pyrenees. The Hercynian orogeny formed structures of variable shapes and orientation, which, however, have all be ascribed to stress accumulating in a N-S direction causing consecutive deformations. These can, to a certain extent, be correlated with the deformation phases known in other regions of the Axial Zone to the north. A first phase formed the largest folds of an order of 20 km down to less than 1 km wide. The slaty cleavage is generally parallel to the bedding and may possibly be related to this phase, in which case it is to be interpreted as a “concentric cleavage”. Second phase structures, generally characterized by an axial plane crenulation cleavage, indicate further compression. Temporary relief of the main stress after the first and second phases thought to be a result of accelerated strain rates due to folding, gave rise to cross folds and cascade folds. Gravity sliding of unstable structures in Devonian rocks from the Rabassa dome into the Arcabell syncline and Segre area, resulted in thick accumulations of Devonian material in these depressions. Strong deviations from the general E-W strike of first and second phase structures {{in the eastern part of}} the Orri dome and in the Segre unit are attributed to the influence of an inferred infrastructure rise thought to exist below the Orri dome. Epirogenic movements along the northern border of the <b>marginal</b> <b>trough,</b> were particularly important during the Permian and Cretaceous. The Devonian massif of the Monsech de Tost, amidst post-Hercynian deposits in the Nogueras Zone, is interpreted as a Hercynian gravity structure upthrusted during the Pyrenean (Middle Alpine) deformation. The Pedraforca structure is also explained as an upthrusted block. Later Alpine movements during the Neogene formed grabens in the Segre valley...|$|E
40|$|Differences in the {{geological}} {{structure of the}} hard-rock substratum of the Warmia and Mazury regions (NE Poland) resulted during the Pleistocene in different reactions on the load exerted by the land-ice masses. In the (western) Warmia province, vertical glacio-isostatic movements caused cyclic erosional events affecting the relatively thick sedimentary cover, which became more compacted. In contrast, the thinner sedimentary cover of the rigid crystalline basement favoured quiet sedimentation in the (eastern) Mazury province. The zone in between these two areas runs NNE-SSW for some 80 km. It is several kilometres wide and is composed of landforms that owe their origin to the sedimentary infilling of crevasses. This intermediate zone formed an interlobe are between the two huge ice lobes that covered the Warmia and Mazury areas during the last ice age. The basement of the zone coincides with the crystalline craton slope, which is accompanied to the west by a parallel <b>marginal</b> <b>trough.</b> Cyclic advances and retreats of the Pleistocene ice sheet induced neotectonic mobility. Glacio-isostatic processes resulted in the intermediate zone in block movements (uplift and subsidence) that affected the whole Cenozoic succession, creating mainly vertical discontinuity zones. Glacio-isostasy also induced vertical tectonic movements within the older deposits, reaching down to the crystalline basement. A tectonic graben thus developed. It is bounded by flexures accompanied on both sides by positive structures that may indicate transpressional movements with a strike-slip stress component...|$|E
40|$|The {{age of the}} non-metamorphic {{sedimentary}} {{series in}} the Cantabrian mountains ranges from the Cambrian through the Tertiary. The Lower Palaeozoic deposits mainly show a sandy or quartzitic facies, and were deposited in an extensive Cambro-Ordovician geosyncline of which only the miogeosynclinal part is accessible for investigation, the orthogeosynclinal part now being covered by the Mesozoic-Tertiary deposits of the Spanish Meseta. The Caledonian orogeny is expressed in phenomena resulting from igneous activity. The Hercynian orogeny started with epeirogenetic movements during the Upper Devonian (Bretonic phase of Stille). The uplift caused a varying hiatus on which Upper Famennian transgressive sediments are found unconformably overlying anything between the Lower Famennian and the Middle Cambrian. The E-W-trending León line {{played an important role}} during these epeirogenetic movements. In the Asturides north of it, a Central Asturian dome shows an almost constant amount of uplift. Over a very wide area the Upper Famennian rests unconformably on the Lower Ordovician quartzite. Two main stratigraphic and tectonic units are distinguished: 1. The Isidro-Tarna-Ponton subarea. 2. The Mampodre-Fontasguera-Ten subarea. The Upper Famennian transgression was followed by the sedimentation of a uniform limestone during the Visean and Namurian. In the Central Asturian dome region a period of non-deposition or slow sedimentation set in after the sedimentation of the Namurian limestone. Locally, even this limestone was deposited under such conditions. South of the León line, the sedimentation continued with a thick series of mainly clastic deposits (San Emiliano Formation). During the Upper Namurian-Lower Westphalian, tectonic forces (Sudetic phase of Stille) caused nappe and overthrust structures south of the León line, whereas the areas north of this line, the Central Asturian dome region included, acted as a <b>marginal</b> <b>trough</b> to this orogene. The Asturian folding phase started in the Upper Westphalian, during which the Carboniferous basins north of the León line became folded. In the Central Asturian dome region, for example, SW-NE-moving thrust sheets developed, and were refolded in a predominantly E-W direction. Stephanian intramontanous coal basins are found in the present area along the León line. These basins were folded in an E-W direction at some time between the Triassic and Upper Stephanian (Saalic phase of Stille). Features indicative of a Würm glaciation are frequently found in the area under consideration...|$|E
40|$|The role of rifting in the {{formation}} of the recent structure of the Mongolia-Okhotsk orogen is extremely high, but it is still underestimated with regard to flanks of the Dzhagda segment of this orogen. Current researches refer to a combination of physical and chemical processes in the depth of the lithosphere, as well as interactions between the Izanagi, Eurasian and Pacific plates as explanations of repeated rifting events in East Asia. Upwelling of the asthenosphere due to significant differences in the lithosphere thickness (150 – 200 km under cratons, and only 100 km under orogenic belts) was viewed as a cause of rifting. It was assumed that rifting was controlled by mantle plumes, volcanism and heat regime. Structures bordering the Mongolia-Okhotsk orogen from north and south were considered as superimposed or <b>marginal</b> <b>troughs.</b> Recent studies have revealed numerous riftogenic Late Mesozoic structures in the Central Asian orogenic belt, which resulted from the collision of the Siberian and North Chinese cratons. New geological survey and geochemical data on volcanites confirmed the riftogenic origin of the Zeya-Uda (or Uda) and Nora-Selemdzha troughs bordering the Mongolia-Okhotsk orogen from north and south, respectively (Fig. 1, and 2). Geology and geophysics of those troughs has been described. It is noted that riftogenic volcanites formed later in the east than those in the west. The Late Mesozoic rifting is widely manifested in North Eastern Asia across the area exceeding two million square kilometers, from Lake Baikal to the Sikhote-Alin region (west to east) and from the Southern Yakutia basins to North China (north to south). It is evidenced by intra-continental rifts of various trends, volcanic provinces and extension structures along large strike-slip faults [Ren et al., 2002]. The Uda and Nora-Selemdzha <b>marginal</b> <b>troughs</b> located along the Dzhagda segment of the Mongolia-Okhotsk orogen give evidence that compression was replaced by extension in the study area. Rifting structures may be due to physical and chemical processes, the development of plumes [Yarmolyuk et al., 2000], as well as the interaction between the Pacific and Eurasian lithospheric plates. Volcanic activity took place earlier in the west and then propagated to the east due to the shifting of the subduction zone in this direction. This paper analyzes regional and global geological events on the basis of new drilling data and the geochronological dating of volcanites. It describes the Late Mesozoic stage of rifting at the flanks of the Dzhagda segment of the Mongolia-Okhotsk collisional orogen. </p...|$|R
40|$|Simulated {{flow field}} {{characteristics}} at 2000 m depth, {{at the intersection}} of the Xi’sha Trough and the Northwest Sub-Basin, show a major anticyclonic gyre. These westward flowing deep currents sweep the South China Sea northern margins until they encounter the Xi’sha Trough and the Xi’sha Uplift. Some of them flow into the Xi’sha Trough and continue going westwards; others change their heading towards to the south and sweep the Xi’sha Uplift eastern margins. In the eastern margins, current velocities could exceed 2 cm. s- 1 as a result of bottom current intensification (after being deflected by the uplifted morphology). Hydrodynamics over the remaining parts of the Xi’sha Uplift zone (south of the Xi’sha Trough) are complex. Fortunately, high-resolution 2 D seismic data enable to reveal the depositional characteristics of bottom currents below 1800 m depth in this area, whereas <b>marginal</b> <b>troughs</b> and confined drifts are recognized {{in the vicinity of the}} obstacle terrains. Major troughs formed north of those obstacles, indicating mainly westward flowing bottom currents in this area. This study focuses on the analysis of deep-water depositional products, created by bottom currents and the relationship with the South China Sea Deep Water Circulation...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{provides}} an overview of glacial related seabed features and sedimentary sequences found along the formerly glaciated NW European margin and compare it with those found on contemporary glaciated margins from both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. A brief review of the seabed physiography and strata architecture of the margins under consideration is followed by comparison of the most relevant similarities and differences. Comparison of the present-day bathymetric setting of both former and contemporary glaciated margins reveals no clear link to the effect of neither ice sheet or sediment load. Three different types of glacially eroded shelf transverse troughs have been identified, while <b>marginal</b> <b>troughs</b> seem connected to similar geological settings everywhere. Beyond the shelf edge interaction between downslope and alongslope processes has occurred resulting, amongst others, in the formation of large sedimentary mounds on the rise. More frequent large-scale mass wasting occurs on the former glaciated NW European margin than the Greenland and Antarctic margins in the latest Neogene to recent times. A two-stage evolution of the shelf prograding wedges is observed on all margins under consideration, which may reflect a general development of an ice cover from an initial phase of non- to restricted glaciation, evolving to a mature stage of expansive glaciation. ...|$|R
40|$|The Middle-Late Jurassic North Sea Rift Dome was {{established}} by recognition of the near base Middle Jurassic erosional unconformity in the central North Sea. The distribution and range of the overlying hiatus illustrates the gross outline and duration of the exposed dome. The presence of Upper Jurassic deposits both in the central rifts and in the <b>marginal</b> <b>troughs</b> in the Sole Pit Basin and along the Tornquist Zone documents that the dome continued across the entire North Sea Basin. In addition, thick Lower Jurassic Series preserved beyond the erosional hiatus along the dome margins, suggests that the dome may have been initiated already in the Early Jurassic. The dome raised above sea level during the Middle Jurassic, and deflation of the dome associated with rifting {{took place during the}} Late Jurassic. Lower Cretaceous sequences onlap the Central Graben footwall blocks, and this relationship has been interpreted to illustrate that post-rift basin infilling was initiated in the Cretaceous. However, regional isopach maps illustrates that the Jurassic rift system down through the Viking Graben-Central Graben was continued in the Cretaceous. In addition, the marginal basins down the dome flanks indicates that the Jurassic dome continued through the Cretaceous across the entire North Sea Basin between the Sole Pit Basin to the west and the Egersund Basin and the Norwegian-Danish Basin to the east; the sea level was high, and the dome remained below sea level. Post-rift subsidence was not attained until the Tertiary a...|$|R

40|$|Existing surface {{heat flow}} {{determinations}} in north-east England indicate {{a difference in}} thermal structure between the Alston block of the North Pennines and the coastal regions. New heat flow determinations in the Askrigg block and on the coast support the original indications of higher heat flow in the positive blocks, which are underlain by 400 Myr old granites, than in their <b>marginal</b> sedimentary <b>troughs</b> along the present coastline. Although the two blocks are geophysically and geologically similar, surface heat flow in the Alston block is 300 mWm- 2 higher {{than it is in}} the Askrigg block 50 km to its south. Heat flow refraction around high conductivity plutons with high heat production may significantly affect the interpretation of heat flow measurements made on a regional scale but in the present case its effect, if any, is to emphasize the heat flow difference between the two otherwise similar blocks. The chemical differences between the Wensleydale and the Weardale granites - cupolas of the granites underlying the Askrigg and Alston blocks respectively - may be represenative of the granites as a whole and the difference in surface heat flows may result from a contrast in radiogenic head production between the two granites extending to mid-crustal depths. -Author...|$|R
40|$|Numerous glacial {{advances}} {{over the}} past 2 million years have covered the entire Canadian and Fennoscandian Shield outcrop. During glacial advance and retreat, permafrost is expected to form {{in front of the}} glacier. The question of how permafrost and freezing impact the formation and evolution of brines in natural systems may be vital to understanding the chemistry of groundwater in crystalline rocks. Investigations of groundwater conditions beneath thick permafrost can provide valuable information that can be applied to assessing safety of deep, underground nuclear waste repositories and understanding analogues to potential life-bearing zones on Mars. However, very little scientific investigation of cryogenic processes and hydrogeology deep within crystalline systems has been published. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the impacts of thick permafrost (> 300 m) formation on groundwater chemical and flow system evolution in the crystalline rock environment over geologic timescales. A field investigation was conducted at the Lupin Mine in Nunavut, Canada, to characterize the physical and hydrogeochemical conditions within and beneath a thick permafrost layer. Taliks, or unfrozen channels within the permafrost, are found beneath large lakes in the field area, and provide potential hydraulic connections through the permafrost. Rock matrix waters are dilute and do not appear to affect groundwater salinity. Permafrost waters are Na-Cl and Na-Cl-SO 4 type, and have been contaminated with chloride and nitrate by mining activities. Sulfide oxidation in the permafrost may be naturally occurring or is enhanced by mining activities. Basal permafrost waters (550 to 570 mbgs) are variably affected by mining. The less contaminated basal waters have medium sulfate concentrations and are Ca-Na dominated. This is similar to deeper, uncontaminated subpermafrost waters, which are Ca-Na-Cl or Na-Ca-Cl type {{with a wide range of}} salinities (2. 6 to 40 g•L- 1). The lower salinity subpermafrost waters are attributed to dissociation of methane hydrate and drawdown of dilute talik waters by the hydraulic gradient created by mine dewatering. This investigation was unable to determine the influence of talik waters to the subpermafrost zone in undisturbed conditions. Pressures are also highly variable, and do not correlate with salinity. Fracture infillings are scarce and calcite δ 18 O and δ 13 C values have a large range. Microthermometry indicates a large range in salinities and homogenization temperatures as well, indicative of a boiling system. In situ freezing of fluids and methane hydrate formation may have concentrated the remaining fluids. Field activities at the Lupin mine also provided an opportunity to study the nature of gases within crystalline rocks in a permafrost environment. Gases were generally methane-dominated (64 to 87), with methane δ 13 C and δ 2 H values varying between - 56 and - 42 ‰ VPDB and - 349 to - 181 ‰ VSMOW, respectively. The gases sampled within the Lupin mine have unique ranges of chemical and isotopic compositions compared with other Canadian and Fennoscandian Shield gases. The gases may be of thermogenic origin, mixed with some bacteriogenic gas. The generally low δ 2 H-CH 4 ratios are somewhat problematic to this interpretation, but the geologic history of the site, a metaturbidite sequence, supports a thermogenic gas origin. The presence of gas hydrate in the rock surrounding Lupin was inferred, based on temperature measurements and hydrostatic pressures. Evidence also suggests fractures near the mine have been depressurized, likely due to mine de-watering, resulting in dissipation of methane hydrate near the mine. Modeling results indicate methane hydrates were stable throughout the Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles, potentially limiting subglacial recharge. The effects of deep permafrost formation and dissipation during the Pleistocene glacial/interglacial cycle to deep groundwaters in the Canadian Shield were also investigated by compiling data from thirty-nine sites at twenty-four locations across the Canadian Shield. Impacts due to glacial meltwater recharge and surficial cryogenic concentration of fluids, which had been previously considered by others, and in situ freeze-out effects due to ice and/or methane hydrate formation were considered. At some Canadian Shield sites, there are indications that fresh, brackish, and saline groundwaters have been affected by one of these processes, but the data were not sufficient to differentiate between mixed, intruded glacial meltwaters, or residual waters resulting from either permafrost or methane hydrate formation. Physical and geochemical data do not support the cryogenic formation of Canadian Shield brines from seawater in glacial <b>marginal</b> <b>troughs.</b> The origin and evolution of Canadian and Fennoscandian Shield brines was explored with a survey of chlorine and bromine stable isotope ratios. The δ 37 Cl and δ 81 Br isotopic ratios varied between - 0. 78 ‰ and 1. 52 ‰ (SMOC) and 0. 01 ‰ and 1. 52 ‰ (SMOB), respectively. Variability of chlorine and bromine isotope ratios decreases with increasing depth. Fennoscandian Shield groundwaters tend to be more enriched than Canadian Shield groundwaters for both 37 Cl and 81 Br. Other sources and processes which may affect δ 37 Cl and δ 81 Br composition are also explored. Primary processes such as magmatic and/or hydrothermal activity are thought to be responsible for the isotopic composition of the most concentrated fluids at each site. Positive correlations between δ 81 Br, and δ 37 Cl with δ 2 H-CH 4 and δ 13 C-CH 4 were noted. At this time the cause of the relationship is unclear, and may be a result of changing redox, pH, temperature, and/or pressure conditions during hydrothermal, metamorphic, or volcanogenic processes. The data suggest solute sources and fluid evolution at individual sites would be better constrained utilizing a multi-tracer investigation of δ 37 Cl, δ 81 Br, and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios comparing fluids, rocks, and fracture filling minerals (including fluid inclusions) ...|$|R

Plates in pocketReconnaissance geologic mapping has produced new information on the sratigraphy, structure, and geologic history of the rocks from the northern Vizcaino Peninsula. All of the sedimentary rock units discussed have their type locality within the study area. Exposed Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks from the northern portion of the peninsula have a maximum thickness of approximately 10, 000 m and 600 m, respectfully. The Metamorphic Basement contains mafic to ultramafic rock types, including serpentine, gabbro, and amphibolite. Potassium/Argon age determinations indicate that these rocks originated 187 -+ 1. 4 m. y. B. P. This is the oldest dated specimen from Baja California. The oldest sedimentary unit is the Late Jurassic (Portlandian) Eugenia Formation (2325 m). It consists of basal pillow basalt and pebblestone overlain by interbedded mixed volcanic conglomerate, pebblestone, coarse volcanic arenite and shale. The age of the formation {{is based on the}} mollusc Buchia piochii arid deep-water radiolarian. Sediments were derived from pre-Cretaceous volcanic terrane and were deposited in a <b>marginal</b> marine <b>trough.</b> The Eugenia Formation was intruded by hornblende andesite dikes approximately 126 -+ 3. 2 m. y. ago. The Valle Formation lies unconformably upon the Eugenia Formation, and consists of a late Albian to Cenomamian (?) lower member (3500 m), and a Turonian middle member (4200 m). The lower member is comprised entirely of rhythmically alternating beds of feldspathic arenite and poorly laminated shale. The middle member contains similar feldspathic volcanic arenite and shale strata, with additional lenses of massive conglomerate. Uplift and erosion of the Alisitos Arc, provided the sediment represented in the lower member. Continuing uplift and tectonism generated conglomeratic material which migrated westward into the depositional basin. To the east, unroofing of the batholithic core supplied granitic debris to the middle member. No Paleogene rocks are known form the study area. South of the study area, continuous deposition is believed to have taken place from Late Cretaceous through Eocene time. The middle Miocene Tortugas Formation is represented by basal fossiliferous sandstone with overlying siliceous shale. Numerous fluctuations in water depth during this time, locally supported various horizons of diatoms, Foraminifera, Mollusca, and Mammalia. The Almejas Formation, of middle to late Pliocene age, was deposited in similar basins as the Tortugas Formation. The late Pliocene to Pleistocene Marine Terraces locally overlie all of the older formations. The structural pattern of the area consists of large northwest-trending right lateral slip faults with subordinate northeast-trending faults. Paleogeographic reconstructions indicate that Eugenia and Valle Formation depositional basins were located near the present mouth of the Gulf of California. These have since been mobilized along with all of Peninsular California...|$|R
