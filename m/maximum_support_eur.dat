40|$|Abstract. We define {{sporadic}} {{rules as}} those with low support but high confidence: for example, a rare association of two symptoms indicating a rare disease. To find such rules using the well-known Apriori algorithm, minimum support has to be set very low, producing {{a large number of}} trivial frequent itemsets. We propose “Apriori-Inverse”, a method of discovering sporadic rules by ignoring all candidate itemsets above a <b>maximum</b> <b>support</b> threshold. We define two classes of sporadic rule: perfectly sporadic rules (those that consist only of items falling below <b>maximum</b> <b>support)</b> and imperfectly sporadic rules (those that may contain items over the <b>maximum</b> <b>support</b> threshold). We show that Apriori-Inverse finds all perfectly sporadic rules much more quickly than Apriori. We also propose extensions to Apriori-Inverse to allow us to find some (but not necessarily all) imperfectly sporadic rules. ...|$|R

40|$|We propose simple polynomial-time {{algorithms}} for two linear conic feasibility problems. For {{a matrix}} A∈R^m× n, the kernel problem requires a positive vector in the kernel of A, {{and the image}} problem requires a positive vector {{in the image of}} A^. Both algorithms iterate between simple first order steps and rescaling steps. These rescalings improve natural geometric potentials. If Goffin's condition measure ρ_A is negative, then the kernel problem is feasible and the worst-case complexity of the kernel algorithm is O((m^ 3 n+mn^ 2) |ρ_A|^- 1); if ρ_A> 0, then the image problem is feasible and the image algorithm runs in time O(m^ 2 n^ 2 ρ_A^- 1). We also extend the image algorithm to the oracle setting. We address the degenerate case ρ_A= 0 by extending our algorithms to find <b>maximum</b> <b>support</b> nonnegative vectors in the kernel of A and in the image of A^. In this case the running time bounds are expressed in the bit-size model of computation: for an input matrix A with integer entries and total encoding length L, the <b>maximum</b> <b>support</b> kernel algorithm runs in time O((m^ 3 n+mn^ 2) L), while the <b>maximum</b> <b>support</b> image algorithm runs in time O(m^ 2 n^ 2 L). The standard linear programming feasibility problem can be easily reduced to either <b>maximum</b> <b>support</b> problems, yielding polynomial-time algorithms for Linear ProgrammingComment: major revisio...|$|R

40|$|Results of {{a series}} of tests on {{rectangular}} cross-section pultruded GRP cantilever beams are presented. The beams are loaded in their stiffer plane of symmetry by means of a single point load acting through the centroid of the cross-section at the free end. Each beam was loaded well into the lateral postbuckling regime and then unloaded. Throughout the loading and unloading regimes end displacements, i. e. horizontal and vertical translations and the rotation of the cross-section, were recorded. Plots of support moment versus free end rotation are presented for all 16 beams tested and critical support moments (calculated using a modified formula for the critical moment of an isotropic cantilever) are compared with experimental maximum moments. The <b>maximum</b> <b>support</b> moments applied in the tests are also compared with theoretical critical support moments for span to depth ratios ranging from 4 to 25.
