Manganates are the only known manganese(VI) compounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{market for}} olfoxacin {{was seen as}} {{difficult}} from its launch; it was approved as a [...] "1C" [...] drug, a new <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> {{with little or no}} therapeutic gain over existing therapies, and ciprofloxacin which had a broader spectrum was already on the market.|$|E
5000|$|A {{reaction}} step involving three <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> {{is called}} termolecular.|$|R

2500|$|In {{organic and}} {{inorganic}} chemistry, nucleophilic substitution {{is a fundamental}} class of reactions in which an electron rich nucleophile selectively bonds with or attacks the positive or partially positive charge of an atom {{or a group of}} atoms to replace a leaving group; the positive or partially positive atom is referred to as an electrophile. The whole <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> of which the electrophile and the leaving group are part is usually called the substrate.1 Mechanism, ACS Monograph Series No. 178, American Chemical Society, 1983[...]|$|E
50|$|A halogen bond {{occurs when}} there is {{evidence}} of a net attractive interaction between an electrophilic region associated with a halogen atom in a <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> and a nucleophilic region in another, or the same, <b>molecular</b> <b>entity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{reaction}} step involving one <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> {{is called}} unimolecular.|$|E

40|$|In essence, {{the virtual}} {{physiological}} human (VPH) is a multiscale representation of human physiology spanning from {{the molecular level}} via cellular processes and multicellular organization of tissues to complex organ function. The different scales of the VPH deal with different entities, relationships and processes, and in consequence the models used to describe and simulate biological functions vary significantly. Here, we describe methods and strategies to generate knowledge environments representing <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> {{that can be used}} for modelling the molecular scale of the VPH. Our strategy to generate knowledge environments representing <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> is based on the combination of information extraction from scientific text and the integration of information from biomolecular databases. We introduce @neuLink, a first prototype of an automatically generated, disease-specific knowledge environment combining biomolecular, chemical, genetic and medical information. Finally, we provide a perspective for the future implementation and use of knowledge environments representing <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> for the VPH...|$|R
5000|$|Again from IUPAC: [...] "The {{degree of}} {{precision}} necessary to describe a <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> depends on the context. For example 'hydrogen molecule' is an adequate definition of a certain <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> for some purposes, whereas for others {{it is necessary to}} distinguish the electronic state and/or vibrational state and/or nuclear spin, etc. of the hydrogen molecule." ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> is [...] "any constitutionally or isotopically {{distinct}} atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer, etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity". A <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> is any singular entity, {{irrespective of}} its nature, used to concisely express {{any type of}} chemical particle that can exemplify some process: for example, atoms, molecules, ions, etc. can all undergo a chemical reaction.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{species is}} the {{macroscopic}} equivalent of <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> and refers to sets or ensembles of molecular entities.|$|E
2500|$|According to the IUPAC gold book, a {{chemical}} reaction is [...] "a process {{that results in}} the interconversion of chemical species." [...] Accordingly, {{a chemical}} reaction may be an elementary reaction or a stepwise reaction. An additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the interconversion of conformers is experimentally observable. Such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient {{to use the term}} also for changes involving single <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> (i.e. 'microscopic chemical events').|$|R
5000|$|Often the [...] "new" [...] {{drugs that}} are {{submitted}} for approval include new <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> or old medications that have been chemically modified to elicit differential pharmacological effects or reduced side effects.|$|R

40|$|ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) is a {{database}} of &#x 2018;small&#x 2019; <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> structured around a chemical ontology. It contains almost 600, 000 entries, of which approximately 20, 000 have been manually curated, as well as entries for groups (parts of <b>molecular</b> <b>entities)</b> and classes of entities. It provides {{a wide range of}} information such as chemical nomenclature, structures and related chemical values, and establishes interrelationships between entities in the ontology, in terms of both structure and role. ChEBI places a strong focus on quality, with exceptional efforts being applied to upholding IUPAC nomenclature recommendations and best IUPAC practices when drawing chemical structures. |$|R
5000|$|Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, {{also known}} as ChEBI, is a {{database}} and ontology of <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> focused on 'small' chemical compounds, {{that is part of}} the Open Biomedical Ontologies effort. The term [...] "molecular entity" [...] refers to any [...] "constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer, etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity". The <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> in question are either products of nature or synthetic products which have potential bioactivity. Molecules directly encoded by the genome, such as nucleic acids, proteins and peptides derived from proteins by proteolytic cleavage, are not as a rule included in ChEBI.|$|R

50|$|A ketyl {{group in}} organic {{chemistry}} is an anion radical {{that contains a}} group =C−O• in which an oxygen radical is bonded directly to carbon, negatively charged. This <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> is very unstable and appears in chemical reactions as a reactive intermediate.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{developing}} new <b>molecular</b> <b>entities,</b> KV researches different modes of drug delivery.

50|$|Antigenic {{specificity}} is {{the ability}} of the host cells to recognize an antigen specifically as a unique <b>molecular</b> <b>entity</b> and distinguish it from another with exquisite precision. Antigen specificity is due primarily to the side-chain conformations of the antigen. It is measurable and need not be linear or of a rate-limited step or equation.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{cellular}} behavior from a systems perspective requires {{the identification of}} functional and physical interactions among diverse <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> in a cell (i. e. DNA/RNA, proteins and metabolites). Powerful and scalable technologies enabled the generation of genome-wide datasets that describe cellular systems by capturing the interactions of their building blocks under different environmental stimuli. The most straightforward way to represent such datasets is by means of molecular networks of which nodes correspond to <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> and edges to the interactions amongst those entities. In this review we give {{an overview of the}} different functional and physical interaction networks in bacteria that have been or potentially can be built by the integration of diverse omics datasets...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} {{required for the}} description of affinity reagent/target pairs can be divided into: o that which identifies {{the source of the}} report, o that which refers to the characteristics of the <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> involved, and o that which demonstrates both their individual properties and when in association in a binder/target pair (i. e. a report of experimental data which provides additional information as to the specificity of a reagent). Information about an affinity reagent/target pair can be represented as a set of two <b>molecular</b> <b>entities</b> (affinity reagent and target) and a relation (binding between them). As a consequence the information to be considered can be split into three categories (Table 3) ...|$|R
50|$|In chemistry, a {{reaction}} coordinate is an abstract one-dimensional coordinate which represents progress along {{a reaction}} pathway.
