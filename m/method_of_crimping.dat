40|$|Electrospun nanofibers {{represent}} {{a class of}} versatile scaffolds for tissue engineering applications owing {{to their ability to}} mimic the nanoscale features of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, nanofibers produced by electrospinning can be readily collected as uniaxially aligned assemblies to recapitulate the architecture of the ECM in tissues with anisotropic characteristics, such as tendon-to-bone insertions, tendons, and nerves. This dissertation focuses on the design, fabrication, functionalization, and assessment of various types of scaffolds consisting of aligned nanofibers, which can be used to augment regeneration in tissues with anisotropic structures. Briefly, for tendon-to-bone insertion repair, I assessed the capability of aligned nanofibers with a gradient in mineral content to induce spatially graded osteogenesis of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). I also developed an alternative approach to the production of a gradient in the density of osteoblasts. The graded pattern of osteoblasts generated using both approaches could mimic their distribution in the native tendon-to-bone insertion. To further enhance the stiffness of the scaffolds, a new solution was developed to coat the scaffold with a thicker mineral layer. In a third project, a novel <b>method</b> <b>of</b> generating <b>crimp</b> in aligned nanofibers was developed. A solvent plasticizer was employed to release the residual stress retained in the nanofibers during electrospinning, which led to the generation <b>of</b> <b>crimp.</b> Finally, the outgrowth of neurites derived from embryoid bodies (EBs) was studied using aligned nanofibers as the substrates. Depending on the strength of adhesion between nanofibers and neurites, two patterns of outgrowth [...] parallel and perpendicular (to the alignment) [...] were observed. Maturation of neurons derived from dissociated EBs was also investigated, as characterized by their extracellular action potential and the ability to form neuromuscular junctions with co-cultured muscle cells.

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [61077031]The {{stress state}} <b>of</b> <b>crimped</b> {{pultruded}} composite rods subjected to traction {{has been investigated}} analytically using the linear theory of elasticity of anisotropic body and the superposition principle. The theoretical solution is able to reproduce the finite element analysis results and clarify {{the relation between the}} stress state and the boundary stresses. It can be appreciated from the theoretical solution that a longitudinal compressive stress at the edge <b>of</b> the <b>crimping</b> zone is generated by the boundary shear stress induced by the flow of metal end-fitting. Thus it can be deduced that the stress concentration at the edge <b>of</b> <b>crimping</b> zone could be mitigated through appropriately increasing the extent of the flow of the metal end-fitting away from the middle <b>of</b> the <b>crimping</b> zone. Our research shows that a radial tensile stress existing at the edge <b>of</b> the <b>crimping</b> zone is corresponding to the area of the rod that axial splitting is taken place. Comparison between analytical and numerical results shows the analytical results are in good agreement with the numerical ones except for stress distribution {{at the edge of the}} loading zone.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{ultrasonic}} inspection provides a means <b>of</b> assessing electrical <b>crimp</b> quality that ensures the electrical and mechanical integrity <b>of</b> an initial <b>crimp</b> before the installation process is completed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating {{at right angles to}} the wire axis and through the junction <b>of</b> a <b>crimp</b> termination was shown to correlate with the results of destructive pull tests, which is a standard for assessing crimp wire junction quality. Of additional concern are crimps made at high speed assembly lines for wiring harnesses, which are used for critical applications, such as in aircraft. During high-speed assembly it is possible that many faulty crimps go undetected until long after assembly, and fail in service. The position and speed <b>of</b> the <b>crimping</b> jaw become factors as the high-speed crimp is formed. The work presented in this paper is designed to cover the more difficult and more subtle area <b>of</b> high-speed <b>crimps</b> by taking into account the rate change of the measurements.

Materials and methods: we investigated four models of polyester vascular prostheses {{in a continuous}} laminar flow circuit. The flow velocity was 80 ml/s for all experiments. We studied two fluids of different viscosity within the circuit. The speed of the particles was measured by a laser Doppler anemometer 2 to 52 mm from the prosthetic interface. We first established a calibrated flow-velocity profile corresponding {{to the study of}} the support inside the circuit without any prosthesis. We measured the velocity profiles for each prosthesis corresponding to four crimp densities obtained by stretching the grafts. Results: the <b>crimping</b> <b>of</b> PET textile prostheses led to a decrease of flow velocity especially closer to the prosthetic surface. The decrease of flow velocity was dependent on the model of prosthesis. This decrease of flow velocity is described by the following negative exponential law: ΔV=a·b−xwhere (a) is the crimp density and (b) the fluid viscosity. Conclusions: flow velocity near a prosthetic surface is influenced by the morphology <b>of</b> the <b>crimping.</b> The impact <b>of</b> <b>crimping</b> on the flow velocity in a vascular prosthesis can be predicted by computer simulation models. This may provide the optimal shape <b>of</b> <b>crimping</b> for each prosthesis...|$|R

Material and methods: Three types <b>of</b> <b>crimped,</b> braided sleeves from PET (BraidPET) or nylon (BraidGreyNylon and BraidNylon, with different monofilament diameters) were fabricated and tested including geometrical and microstructural characterisation <b>of</b> the <b>crimp</b> and braid, mechanical tests and medical scratching tests for organ damage of domestic pigs. Results: BraidPET caused some organ damage, sliding under normal force of 2 - 5 N; this was attributed to the high roughness of the braid pattern, the higher friction coefficient of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) compared to nylon, and the high frequency <b>of</b> the <b>crimp</b> peaks for this sleeve. No organ damage was observed for the BraidNylon, attributed to both the lower roughness of the braid pattern and the low friction coefficient of nylon. BraidNylon also required the lowest tensile force during its elongation to similar maximum strain as that of BraidPET, translating to low power requirements...|$|R

Although {{it has been shown that}} these valves can be safely delivered and implanted, studies of valve longevity are lacking because of the infancy of the technology. Particularly, the effects <b>of</b> stent <b>crimping</b> on the valve's leaflets have not yet been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we have characterized the effects <b>of</b> <b>crimping</b> on pericardial leaflets in time and through the depth <b>of</b> the tissue. <b>Methods</b> To test the structural changes at the surface and deep layers of bovine pericardial leaflets, scanning electron microscopy and second-harmonic generation microscopy were used. An uncrimped tissue sample was imaged, followed by imaging a segment <b>of</b> tissue after <b>crimping</b> in a stented transcatheter valve, immediately after, at 20 minutes, and 60 minutes after crimping. The crimping experiment was performed for multiple crimping sizes (ie, 14 F, 16 F, and 18 F). We defined a damage index that quantifies the level of leaflet structural changes as a result <b>of</b> <b>crimping.</b> Results Based on the calculated damage indices and analyses of the raw images, it was determined that crimping does measurable damage to the leaflet tissue that persists with time. Conclusions Significant tissue damage was observed at the surface layers of the leaflets. In the deeper tissue layers, damage was substantial for 14 F crimping; however, it became less significant but still visible for larger collapse profiles.
