5|$|At {{the same}} time, Werber was {{attempting}} to leverage the Trio's popularity as a club act into a recording contract. Both Dot Records and Liberty Records expressed some interest, but each proposed to record the Trio on 45 rpm (revolutions per minute) singles only, whereas Werber and the Trio members both felt that 33⅓ rpm albums had <b>more</b> <b>potential</b> for the group's music. Through Jimmy Saphier, agent for Bob Hope who had seen and liked the group at The Purple Onion, Werber contacted Capitol Records, which dispatched prominent producer Voyle Gilmore to San Francisco to evaluate the Trio's commercial potential. On Gilmore's strong recommendation, Capitol signed the Kingston Trio to an exclusive seven-year deal.|$|E

5|$|The railway came to Christchurch in 1847 {{although}} the nearest station, Christchurch Road, was at Holmsley and passengers were taken {{the rest of}} the way by omnibus. In 1862 a new station was built in the town close to where it stands today and was served by a branch line from Ringwood. Christchurch joined the mainline in 1883 and a third station had to be built. Christchurch, and in particular Mudeford, had been enjoying a modest tourist trade since King George III had patronised the town in the 1790s but the arrival of the railways made Christchurch accessible to <b>more</b> <b>potential</b> visitors. A power station was built in Christchurch in 1903 to power the public trams. The excess generated was sufficient to light the town and in 1940 it was added to the national grid.|$|E

5|$|When {{a patient}} {{unexpectedly}} dies in his care, Oliver breaks down. He confesses to Penny that he cheated {{in medical school}} by swapping one of their exam papers, so he passed on her merit while {{she was forced to}} repeat a year. Furious, Penny tells Oliver that he must confess to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry). He writes a letter of resignation, but deletes it after a positive day working alongside Frieda, who encourages him to repeat his F2 year. After giving Oliver a final chance to confess, Penny is called away to the site of a train crash. Oliver is left alone on AAU, where he successfully performs a difficult procedure. Hopeful that Penny will forgive him, Oliver is devastated to learn that she has been killed in an accident at the crash site. Unable to cope in the aftermath of her death, Oliver turns to drugs and alcohol. He sends Hanssen a letter of resignation, which includes a full confession. His father Tony (Simon Shepherd) offers him money to choose a new career, and claims that Oliver always had <b>more</b> <b>potential</b> than Penny. This angers Oliver, who endangers his own life to save a patient and feels reinvigorated. Hanssen is impressed by Oliver's patient treatment, and overlooks his cheating to allow him a fresh start.|$|E

40|$|Ethical core {{issues in}} {{research}} with human subjects {{are related to}} informed consent and risk-benefit assessment. This is valid {{for all types of}} studies. However, there has been much greater focus of ethical considerations on controlled clinical trials than on naturalistic trials, probably because the former are interventional in nature and may have unknown and perhaps severe somatic risks, whereas naturalistic studies seem not to intervene but only to observe, and therefore are assumed to have fewer or almost no risks. However, there are also ethical implications in naturalistic trials, although their weight is differently accentuated, <b>more</b> with <b>potential,</b> <b>more</b> with <b>potential</b> psychological burdens of the observational procedures and <b>more</b> with <b>potential</b> physical risks in interventional trials.

40|$|In bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), the anode {{potential}} {{can be set}} to a {{fixed voltage}} using a potentiostat, {{but there is no}} accepted method for defining an optimal potential. Microbes can theoretically gain more energy by reducing a terminal electron acceptor with a <b>more</b> positive <b>potential,</b> for example oxygen compared to nitrate. Therefore, <b>more</b> positive anode <b>potentials</b> should allow microbes to gain more energy per electron transferred than a lower potential, but this can only occur if the microbe has metabolic pathways capable of capturing the available energy. Our review of the literature shows that there is a general trend of improved performance using <b>more</b> positive <b>potentials,</b> but there are several notable cases where biofilm growth and current generation improved or only occurred at <b>more</b> negative <b>potentials.</b> This suggests that even with diverse microbial communities, it is primarily the potential of the terminal respiratory proteins used by certain exoelectrogenic bacteria, {{and to a lesser extent}} the anode potential, that determines the optimal growth conditions in the reactor. Our analysis suggests that additional bioelectrochemical investigations of both pure and mixed cultures, over a wide range of potentials, are needed to better understand how to set and evaluate optimal anode potentials for improving BES performance. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|R
