Before becoming Pope he opposed the free distribution of contraceptives when it was introduced by the Kirchner government. Francis emphasized that contraception involves [...] "destruction of the family through the privation of children." [...] At the same time, Francis teaches that [...] "responsible parenthood" [...] is important, and suggested that population experts recommend three children in a family, and added that Christians do not need to breed in excess. Francis encourages natural family planning such as avoiding sexual intercourse when the woman is fertile.|$|E

Beginning in about fourth grade, performance opportunities are often provided {{in the form of}} choirs or orchestral (especially wind) bands.There are several developed teaching <b>methods</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> use in elementary schools. The Kodaly Method was developed in Hungary by Zoltan Kodaly. The Orff-Schulwerk Method was developed by Carl Orff, the German composer who wrote Carmina Burana. The Dalcroze-Eurythmics Method was developed in Switzerland by Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, who was teaching at the Geneva Conservatory at the time. All three methods place an emphasis on activity and learning by doing. The Kodaly Method is known best for its use of solfege syllables and corresponding hand signals. The Orff-Schulwerk Method is most famous for its use of varying sizes of xylophones and glockenspiels, known as [...] "Orff instruments." [...] The Dalcroze-Eurythimics Method's most visible characteristic is its use of movement to music, ideally live music.|$|E
5000|$|If a class {{does not}} allow calling code to access {{internal}} object data and permits access through methods only, this is a strong form of abstraction or information hiding known as encapsulation. Some languages (Java, for example) let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example denoting internal data with the [...] keyword and designating <b>methods</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> use by code outside the class with the [...] keyword. Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as [...] (which allows access from the same class and its subclasses, but not objects of a different class). In other languages (like Python) this is enforced only by convention (for example, [...] methods may have names that start with an underscore). Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object. This facilitates code refactoring, for example allowing {{the author of the}} class to change how objects of that class represent their data internally without changing any external code (as long as [...] "public" [...] method calls work the same way). It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers. Encapsulation is a technique that encourages decoupling.|$|E

5000|$|A {{potentially}} {{lower cost}} alternative to using iodine-based water purification tablets {{is the use}} of iodine crystals. A small amount of water is poured into a small glass bottle (with a capacity of approximately 1 ounce or 30 cubic centimeters), containing approximately 0.25 ounces (7 grams) of iodine crystals, and then shaken vigorously to produce a saturated solution of iodine. At 25 C, 12.5 cubic centimeters of this solution is added to one liter of water to be disinfected. In 15 minutes the water may be consumed. At a temperature of 20 C let the water to be consumed stand for 20 minutes. At a temperature of 3 C let the water stand for 30 minutes or use 25 cubic centimeters of saturated solution per liter. (Do not store the saturated iodine solution in a plastic bottle as the iodine vapor will pass through the plastic and corrode steel that is in close proximity.) Note also that this method may not be adequate in killing Giardia cysts in cold water. One solution is to warm the water to be consumed to 20 C before treatment. Take care not to consume iodine crystals; the amount of iodine in the saturated solution may be two to four times the lethal dose. [...] Care must be taken to prevent the small glass bottle of iodine crystals covered with water from freezing in cold climates. An advantage of using iodine crystals is that only a small amount of iodine is dissolved from the iodine crystals at each use, giving this method of treating water a capability for treating very large amounts of water, around 2,000 liters (500 gallons), with but a small bottle of crystals. Unlike tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets, iodine crystals have essentially an unlimited shelf life {{as long as they are}} not exposed to air for long periods of time and are kept under water. (Iodine crystals will sublimate if exposed to air for long periods of time.) The large quantity of water that can be purified with iodine crystals at low cost makes this technique especially cost effective for point of use or emergency water purification <b>methods</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> use longer than the shelf life of tetraglycine hydroperiodide.|$|E
