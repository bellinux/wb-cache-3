5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E

25|$|Classical deism {{held that}} a human's {{relationship}} with God was impersonal: God created the world and set it in motion but does not actively intervene in individual human affairs but rather through divine providence. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> God will give humanity such things as reason and compassion but this applies to all and not to individual intervention.|$|E

25|$|What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{even if we}} have {{extracted}} {{all possible}} energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E
25|$|In short, {{even though}} some {{individual}} slaveowners grew rich and some family fortunes were founded on the exploitation of slaves, that {{is very different from}} saying that the whole society, or even its non-slave population as a whole, was more economically advanced {{than it would have been}} in the absence of slavery. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> whether employed as domestic servants or producing crops or other goods, millions suffered exploitation and dehumanization for no higher purpose than the...aggrandizement of slaveowners.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon {{is the way it}} is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E

25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} {{state that}} ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address these}} issues and limitations because, as these authors state, it is a comprehensive theory of human nature, and it is an open system that enables exploration of therapeutic intervention without deviating from the theory itself. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> therapists integrate multiple therapies simultaneously because what one theory lacks insight into, another theory provides; even though the theories may be contradictory among themselves. Ontological hermeneutics therapists, on the other hand, state that it is comprehensive enough to provide adequate insight into human nature as a starting point, but also provides a framework through dialogue to uncover truths about clients in therapy, therefore evading any problems of contradiction. Since ontological hermeneutics theory is a single theory, it avoids the problems of therapists creating their own forms of therapy.|$|E
25|$|Bucket : This {{pattern is}} similar to the bowl except that one of the planets is in the {{opposite}} hemisphere to all the others. This lone planet, or Singleton, serves as a handle, thus creating a 'bucket' form. The bucket pattern indicates a desire to become associated with activity in the mainstream of society, so that the person feels they belong. However, what this often <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the person expects the world to discover their own unique talents, rather than them trying to fit in. They will usually direct their efforts to a single purpose, and strive to achieve objectives rather than act solely for their own self-preservation. The person will probably behave according {{to the nature of the}} Singleton planet that forms the handle of the pattern. This planet will exercise a greater influence than normal in the chart, and will be an important part of the dynamic of the person's activities and basic energy.|$|E
25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E

25|$|The two {{arguments}} Sam and Sally in tree (a) {{are dependent}} on the predicate likes, whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on likes. What this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point {{in the same direction}} (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence big is a predicate in tree (b) that takes bones as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate on takes the two arguments the picture and the wall; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate to help in (d) takes the one argument Jim but is not directly connected to Jim in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.|$|E

500|$|Some have {{wondered}} if an anti-Christian sentiment lurks behind the thefts. Attorney Mike Johnson of the Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly the Alliance Defense Fund), a Christian legal group, stated, [...] "I suspect {{most of it}} is childish pranks. Clearly, there are adults with an agenda to remove Christ from Christmas. But they tend to occupy themselves with the courts and courtroom of public opinion." [...] Stephen Nissenbaum, the author of The Battle for Christmas and a retired professor, views Baby Jesus theft as neither innocent vandalism nor religious hate crimes. Nissenbaum writes that, [...] "What it <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's OK to go around violating even pretty important norms, as long as real human harm isn't being done. It's not exactly devaluing Christianity, but it is sort of a ritualized challenge to it. It could be Christian kids doing itand on January 2 they become good Christians again." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and it is something that their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might be what the Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to have become so closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however my impression is that the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by lawyers at Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not have a case on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E
