F-16s began {{flying with}} these IPE engines in the early 1990s. Altogether, of the 1,446 F-16C/Ds ordered by the USAF, 556 were fitted with F100-series engines and 890 with F110s. The United Arab Emirates’ Block 60 is powered by the General Electric F110-GE-132 {{turbofan}} with a <b>maximum</b> <b>thrust</b> of 32,500lbf (144.6kN), the highest thrust engine developed for the F-16.|$|E
5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate <b>maximum</b> <b>thrust,</b> if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E

Performance of ducted fan is compared with performance (with and without tail-pipe burner) of two hypothetical turbojet engines. At maximum power, the ducted fan has propulsive thrust per unit of frontal area between thrusts obtained by turbojet engines with and without tail-pipe burners.

25|$|The primary {{difference}} between the XF3-400 and the standard F3-30 is the inclusion of an afterburner.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare resistojet, arcjet and ion thruster systems for use as an active load on a flight demonstration of the SP- 100 nuclear power system. The dry masses of each propulsion system were calculated and assessments were made of the mission capabilities of each system based on the capabilities of a single Shuttle launch. From the analyses it was found that, for most systems, the dry mass accounted for less than 20 percent of the total propulsion system mass. The maximum velocity increments of the systems were up to 2300 m/s for resistojet, 4500 m/s for arcjet, and 24000 m/s for ion.

25|$|In 1951, CAC {{obtained}} a licence agreement {{to build the}} F-86F Sabre. In a major departure from the North American blueprint, {{it was decided that}} the CA-27 would be powered by a licence-built version of the Rolls-Royce Avon R.A.7, rather than the General Electric J47. In theory, the Avon was capable of more than double the <b>maximum</b> <b>thrust</b> and double the thrust-to-weight ratio of the US engine. This necessitated a re-design of the fuselage, as the Avon was shorter, wider and lighter than the J47. Because of the engine change the type is sometimes referred to as the Avon Sabre. To accommodate the Avon, over 60 percent of the fuselage was altered and there was a 25 percent increase {{in the size of the}} air intake. Another major revision was in replacing the F-86F's six machine guns with two 30mm ADEN cannon, while other changes were also made to the cockpit and to provide an increased fuel capacity.|$|E
