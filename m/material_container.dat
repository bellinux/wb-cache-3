50|$|This {{temperature}} is {{well beyond the}} physical limits of any <b>material</b> <b>container</b> that might contain the gasses, {{which has led to}} a number of different approaches to solving this problem. The main approach relies {{on the nature of the}} fuel at high temperatures. When the fusion fuel gasses are heated to the temperatures required for rapid fusion, they will be completely ionized into a plasma, a mixture of electrons and nuclei forming a globally neutral gas. As the particles within the gas are charged, this allows them to be manipulated by electric or magnetic fields. This gives rise to the majority of controlled fusion concepts.|$|E
5000|$|... 100 keV {{corresponds}} to a temperature of about a billion degrees. Due to the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, a bulk gas {{at a much lower}} temperature will still contain some particles at these much higher energies. Because the fusion reactions release so much energy, even a small number of these reactions can release enough energy to keep the gas at the required temperature. In 1944, Enrico Fermi demonstrated that this would occur at a bulk temperature of about 50,000,000 Celsius. The key problem was confining a plasma; <b>material</b> <b>container</b> could withstand those temperatures. But because plasmas are electrically conductive, they are subject to electric and magnetic fields which provide a number of solutions.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{material}} may expand 4-5 times under a vacuum, the mixing container must {{be large enough}} to hold a volume of four to five times the amount of the original material that is being vacuumed to allow for the expansion; if not, it will spill {{over the top of the}} container requiring clean-up that can be avoided. The <b>material</b> <b>container</b> is then placed into the vacuum chamber; a vacuum pump is connected and turned on. Once the vacuum reaches 29 inches (at sea level) of mercury, {{the material}} will begin to rise (resembling foam). When the material falls, it will plateau and stop rising. The vacuuming is continued for another 2 to 3 minutes to make certain all of the air has been removed from the material. Once this interval is reached, the vacuum pump is shut off and the vacuum chamber release valve is opened to equalize air pressure. The vacuum chamber is opened, the material is removed and is ready to pour into the mold.|$|E

40|$|The US {{government}} {{agreed to}} provide the Russian Federation with containers to support the dismantlement of Russian nuclear weapons {{as part of the}} Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program. In February 1996, the ``affirmation`` of the Russian Fissile <b>Material</b> <b>container</b> design was completed. The ``affirmation`` process allowed a joint program between the Russian and US governments to proceed without the exchange of sensitive weapons specific information. The Russian Fissile <b>Material</b> <b>container</b> program {{is an integral part of}} the Cooperative Threat Reduction program wherein the US government provides assistance to the states of the Former Soviet Union for dismantlement of their nuclear stockpile. The Cooperative Threat Reduction program is managed by the US Defense Special Weapons Agency.

The Department of Energy, which certifies containers for weapons shipments in the US, provided an independent assessment of the Sandia designed container to assure that it met the requirements of the August 31, 1993 AT- 4 OOR Container Requirements [Sandia National Laboratories, 1993] document which was agreed to by representatives of the US and Russian Federation. The ``affirmation`` process was undertaken in lieu of a certification process. This process was a formal review by the US Department of Energy of Sandia`s design and testing of the Russian Fissile <b>Material</b> <b>container.</b> The affirmation was intended to provide the Russian Federation with assurance that the container met the negotiated requirements including specific sections of IAEA Safety Series 6 [IAEA, 1985].

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{new ways}} for separating the different channels of optical dephasing of molecules in beams. It is shown {{that both the}} population loss and the optical phase relaxation rates can be obtained under collisionless conditions (molecular beams). These dephasing rates, which measure directly the homogeneous width of the prepared resonance, can be obtained with an energy resolution of better than one part in 108. Under these conditions {{the solution of the}} density matrix equations of motion is given for effusive and nozzle beams which represent a statistically open ensemble. The results, which we applied to our recent measurements of optical T 1 and T 2, are discussed in different limits of power broadening, beam geometry, detector characteristics, temperature of the oven (or <b>material</b> <b>container),</b> and the transit time the molecules of different velocities spend in the laser beam. Furthermore, we indicate that the treatment of coherent transients in beams utilizing conventional Bloch equations is not valid since there is a loss of optically excited molecules. Finally, we discuss possible differences between small and large molecules when they undergo radiationless (or reactive) processes following the selective laser excitation (~ 10 kHz– 10 MHz) ...|$|E
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the nucleation and behavior of quantized vorticies and surface excitations in free drops of superfluid helium. We have constructed an apparatus to maintain liquid helium drops isolated from any <b>material</b> <b>container</b> in the Earth's gravitational field, and have investigated two techniques for generating and introducing liquid drops into the region of confinement. The levitation apparatus utilizes the electrostatic force acting upon a charged liquid drop to counteract the gravitational force, with drop position stability provided by a static magnetic field acting upon the helium diamagnetic moment. Electrically neutral superfluid drops have been produced with a miniature thermomechanical pump; for a given configuration the liquid initial velocity has been varied up to several centimeters per second. Liquid drops carrying either net positive or negative charge are produced by an electrode which generates a flow of ionized liquid from the bulk liquid surface. Potentials of less than one thousand volts to several thousand volts are required. The mass flow is controlled by varying duration of the ionizing voltage pulse; drops as small as 30 micrometers diameter, charged to near the Rayleigh limit, have been observed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} theatrical queer feminist {{interpretations of}} architecture staged within {{a series of}} architectural scenes: architect Eileen Gray’s building E. 1027 {{in the south of}} France (1926 - 29); author Natalie Barney’s literary salon at 20 rue Jacob, Paris (1909 - 1968); and author Selma Lagerlöf’s former home and memorial estate Mårbacka, situated in mid-west Sweden and transformed between 1919 and 1923. Interpreted as queer performative acts, or enactments of architecture, these cases bring into play the interconnectedness of <b>material</b> <b>container,</b> the setting, the deeds and the actors. A broad aim of the thesis is to explore the role played by architecture in the social and cultural constructions of bodies, in particular in relation to gender and sexuality. Architecture is investigated as one of the subjectivating norms that constitute gender performativity. The thesis is thus not only about but also operates through enactment. It masquerades as a series of lectures written in the form of scripted drama. The aim of this formal experiment is not only to explicate and critique from a detached perspective but also to represent architecture {{in the process of being}} enacted. Architecture is investigated not only as a theoretical metaphor but also as a concrete material practice always entangled with subject positions. With this exploration into the queerness and the theatricality of architecture, Behind Straight Curtains seeks to affect both the analysis and enactment of architecture and contribute to an architectural shift towards a built environment that does not simply repeat repressive structures but attempts to resist discrimination and dismantle hierarchies.
