500|$|Usher toured {{fourteen}} {{cities in}} North America, coining the trip One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour. Mainly targeting women, the tour commenced on November2,2008 and concluded on November25,2008. The tour's female-focused concept {{was inspired by}} other male recording artists who [...] "did things special like this for their female fans", such as Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye and Prince. Enjoying the challenge of a female-only tour, Usher said, [...] "There [...] only a few artists that can pull that off, I feel like I've had such a connection with <b>my</b> <b>audience.</b> This album, I felt like, was definitely the type of one that was more intimate. So {{what better way to}} get up close and personal than to make it all women?" [...] Usher performed the tour with a Dsquared2 wardrobe. At each show, one fan was brought onstage [...] "for an even more intimate experience with the singer". This took place during [...] "Superstar"; a female fan was served champagne and strawberries by Usher while sitting on his lap as he sang to her. Among Usher's own songs, the setlist also included portions of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Rocket Love", Gaye's [...] "I Want You" [...] and Prince's [...] "Do Me, Baby". At the Detroit show he also gave T-Baby's [...] "It's So Cold in the D". Usher was supported by a five-piece band, three backing vocalists and four backup dancers.|$|E

[...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and <b>my</b> <b>audience</b> fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E

He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who <b>my</b> <b>audience</b> was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E

2500|$|On December 16, 2000, Stern's last live {{radio show}} of the year, he {{announced}} the signing of his new contract with Infinity Broadcasting to continue his show for five years after four months of negotiations. Forbes estimated his new earnings ranged between $17 million and $20 million a year. Stern spoke at The Concert for New York City in October 2001 in a hazmat suit with his buttocks exposed {{in a similar fashion}} to his 1992 MTV Music Video Awards appearance. In November 2001, Stern's production company had begun development on a weekly television sitcom titled Kane for CBS, originally intended to replace The Howard Stern Radio Show following its cancellation, with Ron Zimmerman as the writer of its pilot episode. Its premise followed [...] "an oddball southern family and its strong-willed patriarch. The lead character's life is altered when his previously long-lost wife returns home to him and their group of eccentric children". The project was cancelled before the filming stage. In late 2002, Stern acquired the rights to the comedy films Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979) and Porky's (1982) with Arclight Films. He expressed a wish to use a remake of the former as a launchpad for an unknown band. Under the deal, Stern was served as executive producer and was allowed to place [...] "Howard Stern Presents" [...] in the titles. He reasoned, [...] "If I say to ... <b>my</b> <b>audience,</b> this is 'Howard Stern Presents', it means something to them ... it's going to be crazy.
