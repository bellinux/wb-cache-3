5|$|The <b>Moche</b> {{people of}} ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed {{emphasis}} on animals and often depicted pelicans in their art.|$|E
5|$|Along with maize and beans, squash {{has been}} {{depicted}} in the art work of the native peoples of the Americas for at least 2,000 years. For example, cucurbits are often represented in <b>Moche</b> ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Web-spinning {{also caused}} the {{association}} of the spider with creation myths, as {{they seem to have}} the ability to produce their own worlds. Dreamcatchers are depictions of spiderwebs. The <b>Moche</b> people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art.|$|E
5|$|Huaca de la Luna {{in what is}} now {{northern}} Peru is a large adobe temple {{built by}} the <b>Moche</b> people. The building went through a series of construction phases, growing eventually to a height of about , with three main platforms, four plazas and many smaller rooms and enclosures. The walls were covered by striking multi-colored murals and freizes; those visible today date from about 400–610 AD.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Peruvian <b>Moche</b> people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were {{feared for}} their size and power. Sailors {{believed}} that they ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California {{found them to be}} placid and that they could interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} how {{important}} birds are to individual societies, touching on {{all aspects of}} life. In Andean societies such as the <b>Moche</b> (1–800 AD), Nazca (100–700 AD) and Chimu (1150–1450 AD), bright parrot and macaw feathers were traded from the Amazon rainforest to {{the mountains and the}} Pacific coast, while guano was collected as a fertiliser, and artists and craftsmen were inspired to create textiles, metal jewellery, and ceramics depicting condors, cormorants, ducks, hummingbirds, owls, vultures, and waders. Their religions, too, endowed birds with symbolic meaning.|$|E
5|$|Various human {{cultures}} have depicted pinnipeds for millennia. The anthropologist, A. Asbjørn Jøn, has analysed {{beliefs of the}} Celts of Orkney and Hebrides who believed in selkies—seals that could change into humans and walk on land. Seals are also of great importance {{in the culture of}} the Inuit. In Inuit mythology, the goddess Sedna rules over the sea and marine animals. She is depicted as a mermaid, occasionally with a seal's lower body. In one legend, seals, whales and other marine mammals were formed from her severed fingers. One of the earliest Ancient Greek coins depicts the head of a seal, and the animals were mentioned by Homer and Aristotle. The Greeks believed that seals loved both the sea and sun and were considered to be under the protection of the gods Poseidon and Apollo. The <b>Moche</b> people of ancient Peru worshipped the sea and its animals, and often depicted sea lions in their art. In modern popular culture, pinnipeds are often depicted as playful and comical figures based on their performances in zoos, circuses and marine mammal parks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moche</b> {{history may}} be broadly {{divided into three}} periods – the {{emergence}} of the <b>Moche</b> culture in Early <b>Moche</b> (100–300 AD), its expansion and florescence during Middle <b>Moche</b> (300–600 AD), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in Late <b>Moche</b> (500–750 AD).|$|E
25|$|<b>Moche</b> {{history is}} broadly {{divided into three}} periods– the {{emergence}} of the <b>Moche</b> culture in the Early <b>Moche</b> (AD100–300), its expansion and florescence during the Middle <b>Moche</b> (300–600), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in the Late <b>Moche</b> (500–750). <b>Moche</b> society was agriculture-based, and the cultural leaders invested in the construction of a network of irrigation canals for the diversion of river water to supply the crops. Their culture was sophisticated; and their artifacts fully express their lives, including scenes of hunting, fishing, fighting, sacrifice, elaborate ceremonies, and sexual acts.|$|E
25|$|Trujillo is crossed by the <b>Moche</b> River {{that passes}} {{to the south}} of the city; its waters have been used since ancient times by the <b>Moche</b> and Chimu who {{inhabited}} this area, who took its waters to irrigate their fields; today the river is part of the countryside of <b>Moche</b> and its waters continue to be used for irrigation. The river empties into the Pacific Ocean right on the boundary between the districts of <b>Moche</b> and Víctor Larco Herrera.|$|E
25|$|Pampa Grande, in the Lambayeque Valley, on {{the shore}} of the Chancay River, became one of the largest <b>Moche</b> sites anywhere, and {{occupied}} the area of more than 400 ha. It was prominent in the <b>Moche</b> V period (600-700 AD), and features an abundance of <b>Moche</b> V ceramics.|$|E
25|$|San Jose de Moro {{is another}} {{northern}} {{site in the}} Jequetepeque valley. It was prominent in the Middle and Late <b>Moche</b> Periods (400-850 AD). Numerous <b>Moche</b> tombs have been excavated here, including several burials containing high status female individuals. These women were depicted in <b>Moche</b> iconography as the Priestess.|$|E
25|$|Two {{distinct}} {{regions of}} the <b>Moche</b> civilization have been identified, Southern and Northern <b>Moche,</b> with each area probably corresponding to a different political entity.|$|E
25|$|The Piura {{was fully}} {{part of the}} <b>Moche</b> {{phenomenon}} only {{for a short time}} — during its Early <b>Moche,</b> or Early Moche-Vicús phase — and then developed independently.|$|E
25|$|The coastal <b>Moche</b> culture also co-existed (or {{overlapped}} in time) {{with the}} slightly earlier Recuay {{culture in the}} highlands. Some <b>Moche</b> iconographic motifs {{can be traced to}} Recuay design elements.|$|E
25|$|Dominating Peru's {{north coast}} from 1–600 CE, the <b>Moche</b> culture excelled {{at the art}} of ceramics, which was {{characterized}} by symbolic, religious imagery. <b>Moche</b> artists produced {{some of the more}} naturalistic, i.e. faithfully representational, artwork of the precolumbian Americas. <b>Moche</b> portrait vessel were so realistic that individuals portrayed at different stages of their life are identifiable. Their paintings on ceramics were narrative and action-packed. Ceramics produced by two-press molds were identical in shape but individualized through unique surface painting. Tens of thousands of <b>Moche</b> ceramics have survived today. The stirrup-spout vessel continued to be {{the most common form of}} clay vessel, but <b>Moche</b> artists also created bowls, dippers, jars with long necks, spout-and-handle vessels, and double-chambered vessels that whistled when liquid was poured. Vessels were often effigies portraying elaborate scenes. A fineline painting tradition emerged, which resembles Greek black-figure pottery. A 29,000-square-foot <b>Moche</b> ceramics workshop with numerous kilns was discovered in at the mountain Mayal in the Chicama Valley. The workshop specialized in female figurines.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Moche</b> wove textiles, mostly using wool from vicuña and alpaca. Although {{there are}} few {{surviving}} examples of this, descendants of the <b>Moche</b> people have strong weaving traditions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Moche</b> people {{frequently}} placed llamas and llama {{parts in}} the burials of important people, as offerings or provisions for the afterlife. The <b>Moche</b> culture of pre-Columbian Peru depicted llamas quite realistically in their ceramics.|$|E
25|$|Trujillo {{is a city}} {{in coastal}} northwestern Peru and the capital of La Libertad Region. It is the third most populous city and center of the second most populous {{metropolitan}} area of Peru. It {{is located on the}} banks of the <b>Moche</b> River, near its mouth at the Pacific Ocean, in the <b>Moche</b> Valley. This was a site of the great prehistoric <b>Moche</b> and Chimu cultures before the Inca conquest and subsequent expansion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Moche</b> {{cultural}} sphere {{is centered}} on several valleys on the north coast of Peru in regions La Libertad, Lambayeque, Jequetepeque, Chicama, <b>Moche,</b> Virú, Chao, Santa, and Nepena and occupied 250 miles of desert coastline and up to 50 miles inland.|$|E
25|$|The Southern <b>Moche</b> region, {{believed}} to be the heartland of the culture, originally comprised the Chicama and <b>Moche</b> valleys, and was first described by Rafael Larco Hoyle. The Huaca del Sol-Huaca de la Luna site was probably the capital of this region.|$|E
25|$|Other {{evidence}} {{demonstrates that}} these events {{did not cause}} the final <b>Moche</b> demise. <b>Moche</b> polities survived beyond 650 AD in the Jequetepeque Valley and the <b>Moche</b> Valleys. For instance, in the Jequetepeque Valley, later settlements are characterized by fortifications and defensive works. While {{there is no evidence}} of a foreign invasion, as many scholars have suggested in the past (i.e. a Huari invasion), the defensive works suggest social unrest, possibly the result of climatic changes, as factions fought for control over increasingly scarce resources.|$|E
25|$|El Brujo, is an Archaeological Complex {{located about}} 45km north of Trujillo, {{is an ancient}} {{monument}} of the <b>Moche</b> culture. It includes Huaca Prieta (from preceramic times and later extended by the Cupisnique culture) and the nearby colonial remains of Salinar, <b>Moche,</b> Lambayeque, Chimú. Huaca El Brujo (or Cortada/Partida) and Huaca Cao Viejo (or Huaca Blanca) were built by the <b>Moche</b> sometime between 1 and 600 AD. Huaca Cao Viejo {{is famous for its}} polychrome reliefs and mural paintings, and the discovery of the Dama de Cao, the first known Governess in Peru.|$|E
25|$|Sweet {{potatoes}} or camotes {{are often}} found in <b>Moche</b> ceramics.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} there was a lot of {{independent}} development among these various <b>Moche</b> centres (except the eastern regions). They all likely had ruling dynasties of their own, related to each other. Centralized control of the whole <b>Moche</b> area may have taken place from time to time, but appears infrequent.|$|E
25|$|Located at {{the foot}} of the Huaca de la Luna in the <b>Moche</b> District, this modern museum was opened in 2010 and it shows the recent archaeological discoveries of the <b>Moche</b> {{ceremonial}} religious center. Next to the Mochica monuments is a great touristic circuit for not stop visiting in Trujillo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moche</b> pottery {{is some of}} {{the most}} varied in the world. The use of mold {{technology}} is evident. This would have enabled the mass production of certain forms. But <b>Moche</b> ceramics vary widely in shape and theme, with most important social activities documented in pottery, including war, metalwork, weaving and sex.|$|E
25|$|Some men wolde say, that in mediocritie, whiche I haue so <b>moche</b> praised in shootynge, why shulde nat boulynge, claisshe, pynnes, and koytyng be as <b>moche</b> commended?

25|$|The <b>Moche</b> {{people of}} ancient Peru worshipped animals and often {{depicted}} frogs in their art.|$|E
25|$|There's {{considerable}} parallelism between <b>Moche</b> and Cupisnique iconography and ceramic designs, {{including the}} iconography of the 'Spider god'.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{highlights}} typical drinks are chicha of <b>Moche,</b> made of jora; chicha of Magdalena de Cao, etc.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Moche</b> {{people of}} ancient Peru worshipped {{the sea and}} often {{depicted}} conch shells in their art.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{north coast}} Peruvian ceramic art uses a limited palette, relying {{primarily}} on red and white; fineline painting, fully modeled clay, veristic figures, and stirrup spouts. <b>Moche</b> ceramics created between 150–800 AD epitomize this style. <b>Moche</b> pots {{have been found}} not just at major north coast archaeological sites, such as Huaca de la luna, Huaca del sol, and Sipan, but also at small villages and unrecorded burial sites as well.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Moche</b> also {{interacted with}} the {{neighbouring}} Virú culture. Eventually, by 700 CE, they established {{control over the}} Viru.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moche</b> {{society was}} agriculturally based, with a {{significant}} level of investment {{in the construction of}} a network of irrigation canals for the diversion of river water to supply their crops. Their culture was sophisticated; and their artifacts express their lives, with detailed scenes of hunting, fishing, fighting, sacrifice, sexual encounters and elaborate ceremonies. The <b>Moche</b> are particularly noted for their elaborately painted ceramics, gold work, monumental constructions (huacas) and irrigation systems.|$|E
25|$|Theologian soup: broth {{turkey and}} / or chicken with soaked bread, potatoes, milk and cheese, is {{traditionally}} prepared {{in the district}} of <b>Moche.</b>|$|E
