500|$|The Hungarian {{linguists}} Katalin Balogné Bérces and Zsuzsa Szamosfalvi {{found in}} a preliminary survey of Serbian usage that {{the most commonly used}} [...] "animal vocatives" [...] were, in order, 1. pig, 2. chick(en), 3. dog/puppy, 4. cow, 5. monkey, 6. hen, 7. rat, 8. turkey, 9. mouse, 10. snake, 11. cat/kitten, 12. fox, 13. lamb, 14. vixen, 15. worm. Of these, using the classification devised by Sabina Halupka-Resetar, and Biljana Radic, lamb was always used positively; cow and vixen referred to a person's appearance; pig indicated a person's eating habits; calling someone a fox or a turkey related to their intelligence, or lack of it; and names like cat, snake, worm, <b>monkey,</b> <b>dog,</b> mouse, chicken, lamb and rat were used to indicate a person's character.|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{permeability}} {{of a series}} of both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds, as defined by the octanol/water partition coefficient, was measured in four segments of rabbit, <b>monkey,</b> and <b>dog</b> intestine using a side-by-side diffusion cell. A linear relationship was established for tissue resistance to hydrophilic compound diffusion in jejunum and colon among rabbit, <b>monkey,</b> and <b>dog.</b> The results suggest that rabbit jejunum is twice as permeable as <b>monkey</b> and <b>dog</b> jejunum. The colonic tissues of <b>monkey,</b> rabbit, and <b>dog</b> demonstrate similar permeabilities. Measuring the permeabilities of different tissues with compounds of similar physicochemical properties allows comparison of tissue restriction to transport. Thus, in vitro permeability measurements may be used to investigate physiological differences of various intestinal tissue segments that influence tissue permeability. Investigating the permeability of different intestinal segments from various species could allow the identification of an appropriate in vitro intestinal permeability model that will lead to the prediction of intestinal absorption in humans, eliminating the need for extensive and often misleading in vivo animal testing...|$|R
