Those expecting a racy tell-all were disappointed, although Crawford's meticulous ways were revealed in her advice on grooming, wardrobe, exercise, and even food storage. Upon her death there were found in her apartment photographs of John F. Kennedy, for whom she had reportedly voted in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E

Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. <b>My</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> dealing with it was {{to see that it}} was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E

He learned that his depiction of the Green Beret wasn't at all accurate. Blumberg invited them to his studio where they worked closely with him {{to be sure he}} got the horse and soldier precisely correct. Blumberg took six weeks to re-sculpt the piece until he was sure it was accurate in every detail. It depicts a Special Forces Green Beret on horseback leading the invasion into Afghanistan. He is holding field glasses in one hand. An M4 with an attached grenade launcher is slung under his shoulder. An outline of a wedding band is visible under the glove of the soldier's left hand. Blumberg said, “That’s <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> tipping my hat to wives, marriages and strain on families. It’s to acknowledge the stresses caused by multiple deployments.” Blumberg created the sculpture's face without using a model or photos. It does not represent the face of a specific individual.|$|E

[...] "Gypsy" [...] was written by Shakira, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers, and produced by Shakira, Ghost, Lukas Burton and Future Cut. Written in a ballad-like form, the lyrics of the song describe life travelling on the road as a [...] "gypsy". Shakira explained the song, saying [...] "(The song represents <b>my)</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> living and seeing life. I've {{been on the road}} since I was very young so that's where the gypsy metaphor comes from." [...] Musically, [...] "Gypsy" [...] is heavily influenced by Indian and Middle Eastern music, and features instrumentation from the mandolin, banjo, sitar and tabla. According to the music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Gypsy" [...] is a midtempo song written in the key of C major, with a metronome of 100 beats per minute.

Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, described them as a [...] "feminist call-to-arms", with Madonna dismissing the satin sheets and gold baubles of material pleasures. As she said in the interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "the lyrics are <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> saying if it doesn't work, then you're better off on your own. Quite possibly there were some personal feelings mixed in the lyrics as well."

[...] During his youth, Leto had been a devoted fan of progressive rock and blues music, listening to artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Boz Scaggs. He is inspired by electronic music, including Depeche Mode and The Cure. His major influences also include jazz band Steely Dan, as well as heavy metal groups Mountain, Iron Maiden and Kiss. According to Leto, these artists were commercially viable but also respected for their statements and contributions. He explained that he [...] "never focused on the drummers," [...] saying that he felt more connected to music than a particular drummer.|$|E

In a 1996 The Washington Post gig review, Mark Jenkins wrote that Stereolab started out favoring an [...] "easy-listening syncopation", but eventually reverted to a [...] "messier, more urgent sound" [...] characteristic of their earlier performances. In another review Jenkins said that the band's live songs [...] "frequently veer into more cacophonous, guitar-dominated territory", in contrast to lighter albums like Cobra and Phases Group.... In the Minneapolis Star Tribune Jon Bream compared the band's live sound to feedback-driven rock bands like The Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine. Several critics have said that Stereolab lacked stage presence, arguing that Sadier's vocal delivery was too subdued and that the band tended to play instead of perform its music.

The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [...] It's <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing".

The Struts co-wrote, produced and programmed the track, and additionally played the keys. Filip Runesson played the strings, with Lars Norgren mixing the song and Björn Engelmann mastering it.

[...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E
