This CSI can be of different types such as instantaneous channel coefficients or user’s average achievable downlink data rates, among others. In practical downlink networks, where perfect global knowledge of the instantaneous channel coefficients is not available at the BSs, CSI is typically obtained in form of achievable data rate <b>measurement</b> <b>reports</b> generated by the UEs, averaged over multiple time/frequency/space dimensions and quantized to reduce the signaling overhead. In this work, the CoMP problem formulation is based on practical considerations of the CSI, in form of periodic achievable data rate <b>measurement</b> <b>reports,</b> in the following referred to as CSI reports.|$|R
