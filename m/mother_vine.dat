50|$|<b>Vine's</b> <b>mother,</b> who {{had been}} ill with Crohn's disease, died {{suddenly}} from bowel cancer around this time which led to Vine's high creative drive {{and the creation of}} her darkest paintings. In November 2003 she made the first of her Diana, Princess of Wales paintings and those of teenage girls like Rachel Whitear who suffered tragic deaths. She painted as many as 30 of Diana alone, having become fascinated by conspiracy theories into the Princess' tragic car crash which she had read on the Internet. Vine destroyed many of these paintings soon after they were created. She put them all, apart from one, in a skip as she did not have enough space to dry nor store the wet paintings.|$|R

First one was selection nominees of <b>mother</b> clone <b>vine</b> and second was establishing of clonal collection vineyard. The first stage {{studies were carried out}} at grower vineyards of İsparta, Turkey surroundings where “Siyah Gemre” is grown wide spread, between 2001 and 2003. Clonal nominees were selected by using counting the cluster and shoot {{at the end of the}} project. After that, the clonal collection vineyard was established with spacing 3. 0 m × 1. 65 m in 2004. Twelve vines of each clonal nominees were grafted onto 110 R rootstock. In the study the values of yield, number of cluster, weight of cluster, 100 berry weight, index of maturity, sensory analysis, weight of pruning and bud productivity were evaluated between 2007 – 2012.

In the secondary story, Mongul frees himself of <b>Mother</b> Mercy's <b>vines</b> after being imprisoned in Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, issue #26 (September 2008). Ravenous after his imprisonment, he destroys a space craft belonging to newlyweds Kered and Miri Riam (on their way to their honeymoon) in order to ransack it for food. Kered approaches Mongul to ask him to spare their jet packs and enough food for them to find help. In response, Mongul cracks the face plate of Kered's pressure suit, killing him. After Mongul leaves, Miri drifts in space alone for two days before deciding to kill herself out of grief. Before she is able to complete her suicide, a violet power ring finds her and offers to fill the hole in her heart with violet light. Miri accepts and becomes the first new recruit to the Star Sapphires. Miri quickly finds herself fighting for love as she assists a group of Green Lanterns attempting to apprehend Sinestro Corps member: Kryb. Through their temporary partnership they are able to defeat the yellow ring wielder. Though an argument ensues between Miri and Kyle Rayner (one of the Green Lanterns involved in the incident) over whether Kryb should be sent to Oa or Zamaron for detainment, it's agreed that Miri will escort Kryb back to Zamaron for reconditioning and re-education.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{similarities}} in synonyms to the Beaujolais wine grape Gamay, DNA evidence has confirmed {{that there is}} no direct relationship between the two grape varieties. However, testing completed in 2009 did show a potential parent-offspring relationship between Abouriou and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes though it is not yet clear which vine is the parent and which is the offspring. As Magdeleine Noire des Charentes has been confirmed as the <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> to the notable international varieties Malbec and Merlot this means that Abouriou is either a half-sibling or grandparent to those varieties.|$|E

[...] "Gm" [...] {{is used in}} breeding {{codes for}} grapes from the Geisenheim grape breeding institute, but Gm 6494 was originally created in Czechoslovakia in 1964 by Professor V. Kraus by crossing Zarya Severa and St. Laurent. Kraus offered several of his crosses to Dr. Helmut Becker in Geisenheim, where additional work was carried out, and where his plants were given serial numbers. The grape variety Rondo was created by selecting a Gm 6494 plant with particular properties.|$|E
5000|$|Landot noir is {{considered}} a [...] "complex" [...] interspecific hybrid which means that its pedigree includes several species from the Vitis genus. The father vine, Landal, {{was a result of}} a crossing of two Seibel grapes, Seibel 8216 (itself a complex hybrid that contains Vitis vinifera, Vitis rupestris and Vitis aestivalis in its lineage) and Plantet (another complex hybrid that includes Vitis berlandieri and Vitis cinerea in its lineage). Landot noir's <b>mother</b> <b>vine,</b> Villard blanc, was the result of crossing two Seibel grapes, Seibel 6905 and Seibel 6468, which both have similarly complex lineages.|$|E

This clone may have been selected deliberately from a grapevine that has demonstrated desirable traits (good yields, grape disease resistance, small berry size, etc.) and propagated as cuttings from that <b>mother</b> <b>vine.</b> Varieties such as Sangiovese and Pinot noir are well known to have a variety of clones. While there may be slight mutations to differentiate the various clones, all clones are considered genetically part of the same variety (i.e. Sangiovese or Pinot noir).|$|E

40|$|Species of Cylindrocladiella {{occur on}} a variety of hosts, where they are known to act as {{pathogens}} or saprobes. Eight species from this genus are currently recognised, of which five have been reported previously in South Africa: C. camelliae, C. elegans, C. lageniformis, C. parva and C. peruviana. Isolates of Cylindrocladiella were obtained from a newly established 99 -Richter grapevine <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> block exhibiting decline symptoms. The DNA phylogeny of these and additional isolates, also obtained from declining grapevines, was determined by sequencing the ITS (ITS 1, ITS 2 and 5. 8 S) as well as ß-tubulin and histone H 3 gene regions. This identified four species of Cylindrocladiella on grapevines in South Africa: C. lageniformis, C. parva, C. peruviana and a new species described here as C. viticola, which forms part of the C. infestans species complex. Pathogenicity trials, using stem inoculations on green and 1 -year-old 99 -Richter cuttings to determine the pathogenicity of selected isolates of these species, gave inconclusive result...|$|E
40|$|A grapevine {{accession}} of cv. Mavro from Cyprus showing mild leafroll {{symptoms and}} containing clos-terovirus-like virus particles failed to react with com-mercial antisera to Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1,- 2,- 3,- 5 and- 7. The virus, denoted GLRaV-Cyp 1, was not mechanically transmissible to herbaceous hosts but was successfully transferred by chip-bud grafting and through Planococcus ficus to healthy rooted cutting of cv. Cabernet sauvignon {{in which it}} induced leafroll symptoms as mild as those seen in the <b>mother</b> <b>vine.</b> Three different fragments of the viral genome, corre-sponding to the heat shock protein 70 homologue (HSP 70 h), major coat protein (CP) and p 23 genes were amplified using degenerate and specific primers, cloned and sequenced. In a comparative analysis, GLRaV-Cyp 1 showed amino acid sequence identity never higher than 86 % with the HSP 70 h and 70 % with CP and p 23 genes of other GLRaVs species and strains, with the ex-ception of a GLRaV isolate from a Greek grapevine, with which it showed 94 % identity. In phylogenetic trees constructed with sequences of HSP 70 h, CP and p 23 genes, GLRaV-Cyp 1 consistently grouped in a clus-ter comprising sequences of the “type strains ” of GLRaV- 4,- 5,- 6, and- 9 and of several other viral iso-lates regarded as molecular variants {{of one or more}} of the above species. This supports the notion that GLRaV-Cyp 1 may not be a new ampelovirus species. In a small-scale survey carried out by PCR on a collection of vines from ten Mediterranean countries, GLRaV-Cyp 1 was detected in 5 out of 121 vines tested...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, trunk {{diseases}} of grapevines {{are becoming increasingly}} important. Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum causes black goo decline and is very common in newly planted vineyards in which establishment is slow and uneven. It is apparently introduced to these vineyards as infections of the propagating material. We have isolated the fungus many times from rootstock mother vines and speculate that it spreads from {{the trunk of the}} <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> to the canes which are later harvested as cuttings. Histological studies of inoculated vine shoots in tissue culture, show that the fungus infects the xylem parenchyma cells as intracellular hyphae, and these cells produce tyloses in the adjacent xylem vessels. The hyphae also penetrate the vessels, often by way of the tyloses. Brown deposits (black goo) are seen in vessels and cells, often some distance from active hyphae. Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum has also been found to produce pycnidia on the surfaces of infected wood when moist incubated. The same pycnidia were also found on the surfaces of inoculated tissue culture vines, proving that they are pycnidia of P. chlamydosporum. The spores produced by the pycnidia appear to be conidial rather than spermatial as they germinate readily on agar and develop normal colonies. Esca was formally diagnosed {{for the first time in}} Australia in 1999, although it is believed to have been present for many years. In addition to Phellinus (Fomitiporia) punctatus, we have also found a second species of Phellinus associated with similar symptoms. This species differs from P. punctatus in the production of setae on host tissue and in culture. Like P. punctatus it has a close association with Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum. Eutypa dieback appears to be increasing in severity in Australian vineyards and may be a major limiting factor in the sustainability of Australian wine production. A national trunk disease project has commenced to develop management strategies for black goo decline, esca, Eutypa dieback and other trunk diseases...|$|E
