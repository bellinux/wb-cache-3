Here we present {{an analysis of}} PSC size distribution, composition, and particle phase based on near coincident measurements using the Multiangle Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (MASP) and Focused Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer (FCAS III) on board the ER- 2 as well as lidar instruments on board the DC- 8 and Falcon aircrafts. We calculate the aerosol backscatter ratios and aerosol depolarization ratios at infrared and visible wavelengths based on the particle size distributions measured by the MASP and FCAS III instruments.

40|$|Cirrus and <b>mixed</b> phase <b>clouds</b> {{represent}} a major uncertainty in climate and weather models. This uncertainty {{can be reduced}} with {{a better understanding of}} the lifecycle and radiative properties of cirrus and <b>mixed</b> phase <b>clouds,</b> and by inputting local measurements into models. A cloud’s radiative properties are dependent on the thermodynamic phase of the cloud particles. Measurements made with a polarimetric lidar can be used to determine thermodynamic phase and improve our understanding of cirrus and <b>mixed</b> phase <b>clouds.</b> Few polarimetric lidar instruments are used in the southern hemisphere, representing a gap in understanding and measurements. An existing lidar instrument was upgraded and run for 6 months; 3 months with polarisation measurements. Important properties such as height, frequency of occurrence and thermodynamic phase have been measured up to heights of around 6 km. These measurements are consistent with ground and satellite based lidar, and with radiosonde measurements. Methods for determining additional properties of the clouds, such as the optical thickness and lidar ratio were researched. Sufficient measurements of cloud macrophysical properties allow for the determination of cloud microphysical properties, such as particle density and shape. To assist with determining these properties a polarimetric lidar simulation was written. Microphysical properties were not determined due to the lidar lacking sufficient range and resolution. Due to the low peak power of the laser used, increasing the range and resolution by increasing the peak power of the laser would be relatively easy. Thesis (M. Phil.)
