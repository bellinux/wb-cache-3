50|$|Ecke faced {{significant}} problems preparing his research in wartime. There were few reference works to rely on, little money for research assistance, travel was dangerous, and printing resources few. Ecke took apart and measured the furniture {{in his own}} collection to give detailed drawings of its construction. Photographs, some full-page, and drawings by Ecke’s collaborator Professor Yang Yue, show the construction of beds, chairs, tables, wardrobes, wash stands, <b>clothes</b> <b>racks</b> and other domestic items. Chinese Domestic Furniture in Photographs and Measured Drawings was published in a limited portfolio edition of 200 copies in Beijing in 1944, then reprinted as a standard book by Tuttle in 1962 and Dover Publications in 1985.

The classical style of furniture came to dominate the tastes of American collectors after the war partly because of this Bauhaus influence which Ecke and other scholars trained in Europe conveyed.|$|R

Later that night, Clarkson and Hammond, feeling that he should suffer like them, successfully sabotaged the Cadillac's air-con, much to May's annoyance in the morning.|$|R
