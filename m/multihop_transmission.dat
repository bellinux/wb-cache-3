40|$|Abstract — <b>Multihop</b> <b>transmissions</b> over {{wireless}} mesh networks present limited end-to-end (E 2 E) data rates, {{as every}} hop waits {{for an entire}} packet to arrive before starting retransmission. That is, the E 2 E data rate drops when every hop stores and then forwards packets, thus making such transmissions unsuitable for multimedia applications. In this work, {{in order to increase}} data rates, we present an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio transceiver capable of concurrently transmit and receive (cTxRx) packets. However, concurrently receiving and transmitting comes at the cost of a channel model with increased interference level. Herein, we explain a new interference model and propose a transceiver that compensates for it. We describe the transceiver mathematically and analyze its performance via simulations. Also, we demonstrate that the E 2 E data rate exceeds that of current <b>multihop</b> <b>transmissions,</b> thus allowing multimedia traffic to be transmitted over a multi-hop wireless mesh network.

30|$|Time {{division}} {{multiple access}} (TDMA)-based medium access control (MAC) protocols can guarantee quality of service (QoS) in wireless environments. However, {{in an environment where}} <b>multihop</b> packet <b>transmissions</b> are necessary for real-time communications, each node may experience the well-known queuing delay. This queuing delay increases <b>multihop</b> packet <b>transmission</b> delay, resulting in not meeting the delay bound of real-time applications in multihop wireless networks. This article first introduces two kinds of queuing delays that can occur in multihop wireless networks. Then, this article proposes a new delay-efficient TDMA-based distributed scheduling scheme to eliminate the secondary queuing delay. For the performance analysis of the proposed scheme, the scheduling overhead is first evaluated in terms of power consumption. Next, the <b>multihop</b> packet <b>transmission</b> delay of the proposed scheduling scheme is derived and validated through a simulation, before comparing the result with that of the conventional minimum length scheduling scheme which employs distance- 2 graph coloring. According to the simulation and analysis results, for a deterministic packet arrival, the proposed scheme works well irrespective of the packet interarrival rate and outperforms the conventional graph coloring. However, in case of a non-deterministic packet arrival, the <b>multihop</b> packet <b>transmission</b> delay of the proposed scheme is slightly higher than that of the conventional graph coloring because the probability that each node has more than two packets increases {{at the beginning of the}} frame. However, the <b>multihop</b> packet <b>transmission</b> delay of the conventional graph coloring is intolerable when the packet interarrival rate is high.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} transmission in relatively wide-stretched {{power line communication}} (PLC) networks, where repeaters are required to bridge the source-to-destination distance. In particular, {{it is assumed that}} each network node is a potential repeater and that <b>multihop</b> <b>transmission</b> is accomplished in an ad hoc fashion without the need for complex routing protocols. In such a scenario, due to the broadcasting nature of the power line channel, multiple repeater nodes may receive and retransmit the source message simultaneously. It is shown that, if no further signal processing is applied at the transmitter, simultaneous retransmission often deteriorates performance compared with single-node retransmission. We therefore advocate the application of distributed space–time block codes (DSTBCs) to the problem at hand. More specifically, we propose that each network node is assigned a unique signature sequence, which allows efficient combining at the receiver. Most notably, DSTBC-based retransmission does not require explicit collaboration among network nodes for <b>multihop</b> <b>transmission</b> and detection complexity is not increased compared with single-node retransmission. Numerical results for <b>multihop</b> <b>transmission</b> over PLC networks show that DSTBC-based retransmission achieves a considerably improved performance in terms of required transmit power and multihop delay compared with alternative retransmission strategies.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a decode-and-forward based wireless multihop network {{with a single}} source node, a single destination node, and N intermediate nodes. To increase the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of the system, we propose a cooperative multihop communication with spatial reuse, in which interference is treated as noise. The performance of spatial-reused space-time coded cooperative multihop network is analyzed over Rayleigh fading channels. More specifically, the exact closedform expression for the outage probability at the nth receiving node is derived when there are multiple interferences over noni. i. d. Rayleigh fading channels. Moreover, in high SNR scenario, closed-form asymptotic formulas for the outage probability are derived, from which, we show that the full-spatial diversity is still achievable given interferences from the transmission of concurrent packets. In addition, we propose a simple power control scheme which is only dependent on the statistical knowledge of channels. Finally, the analytic results were confirmed by simulations.

30|$|Cooperative {{communication}} is a promising and emerging technique for enhancing the coverage and reliability in wireless networks [1, 2]. In particular, dual-hop transmission systems employing amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying, where a relay simply retransmits a scaled {{version of the}} received signal to the destination, are being spotlighted, due to their low complexity and delay benefits. In addition, the performance analysis of dual-hop AF systems {{has been an important}} area of research in recent years [3 – 5]. However, since dual-hop transmission over long distances requires a very high transmission power, <b>multihop</b> <b>transmission</b> in which a source communicates with a destination via a number of relays has been proposed as an effective method of establishing connectivity between the nodes of a network [6, 7]. More recently, the <b>multihop</b> <b>transmission</b> with AF strategy has drawn considerable attention in the literature [8 – 10]. In [8, 9] examined the ergodic capacity and outage probability of <b>multihop</b> <b>transmission</b> with AF strategy using Jensen’ inequality and the inequality between the harmonic and geometric means. [10] computed the optimal number of hops for linear multihop AF relaying with equal resource allocation in terms of the random coding error exponent. All of these previous works on multihop AF relaying focused on noise-limited fading environments for ideal configurations without interference. Since network interference is inevitable in practical wireless networks, due to spectral reuse, AF relaying in the presence of co-channel interference has been studied [11 – 14]. However, [11, 12] considered only dual-hop transmission and [11 – 13] neglected either noise or interference at each node for analytical tractability. Furthermore, most of the prior works on AF relay networks, including [14], analyzed the outage probability using some approximation methods, such as the harmonic mean, and assumed that the locations of the network nodes are deterministic without spatial randomness.|$|E

However, the proposed scheduling scheme shows a shorter <b>multihop</b> packet <b>transmission</b> delay, even though it starts the packet transmission with slightly greater frame length than that in case of graph coloring. As mentioned before, graph coloring shares slots (resources) for multiple flows in a link [9]. Therefore, {{an increase in the}} frame delay caused by the secondary queuing delay causes an increase in the <b>multihop</b> packet <b>transmission</b> delay. For the NON-DPA case, the proposed scheme shows slightly longer <b>multihop</b> packet <b>transmission</b> delay. The proposed scheduling scheme is more efficient when there is only one packet waiting for the packet transmission {{at the beginning of each}} frame. If there are more than two packets at the beginning of each frame, then all packets but one packet to be transferred in the current frame experience a long delay because of long frame length. When considering the NON-DPA case in the source node, each source node has the chance to see more than two packets; that is, the primary queuing delay may occur. Therefore, the proposed scheduling scheme shows a slightly lower delay performance for the NON-DPA case. However, the proposed scheme is more tolerable for a high packet interarrival rate than graph coloring.|$|R
