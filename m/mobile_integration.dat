40|$|This is a {{book review}} on The new {{landscape}} of mobile learning: Redesigning education in an app-based world, by editors Charles Miller and Aaron Doering. This is an edited book, but one for which the editors sought out specific authors to write about their experiences and expertise on mobile learning. One of Miller and Doering’s goals is to promote greater thinking about mobile learning through the understanding that learning is a complex process built from pedagogical foundations that integrate social interactions with technology. The editors argue that a fundamental aspect to mobile learning is mobility, which {{is the ability to}} freely move about and collaborate in an authentic environment in which learners gain insight and construct knowledge. The authors try to address problems in mobile learning and put forth solutions, but this also highlights the fragmented problems of mobile learning as the book in itself is fragmented. Instead of treating mobile learning as its own system or field, it becomes evident that one should be describing mobile learning as <b>mobile</b> <b>integration</b> and explore how to use mobility in the everyday learning context. From the perspective of <b>mobile</b> <b>integration,</b> this book is very practical as the authors did an outstanding job of providing information about and steps of integrating mobile devices into specific areas to assist or augment learning. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>mobile</b> technology <b>integration</b> in schools {{has been widely}} researched. However, the sustainability of <b>mobile</b> technology <b>integration</b> in resource-constrained environments has received less attention. Diverse contexts and devices complicate {{the construction of a}} consolidated view of how to sustain the pedagogical practice of learning with mobile devices in these environments. The {{purpose of this article is}} to indicate how feedback from teachers and district officials informed the development of a sustainability framework for <b>mobile</b> technology <b>integration</b> in schools (SFMTIS) in resourceconstrained environments in South Africa. Employing design science research as methodology, an initial sustainability framework was synthesised from the existing literature. Teachers’ views were obtained regarding the <b>integration</b> of <b>mobile</b> technology in their schools and were subsequently processed to inform the further development of the framework. Teachers, who were trained, and had previously participated in an initiative that introduced mobile tablet use, and where information and communication technology infrastructure was provided to their schools, were purposively selected for the study. The Department of Basic Education officials based at district offices were also interviewed for their views on the sustainable <b>integration</b> of <b>mobile</b> technology. The findings were used to refine the initial SFMTIS. Besides the refined sustainability framework, the research contributes novel insights into the different perspectives of the teachers and the district officials, and how those can impact the sustainability of <b>mobile</b> technology <b>integration</b> in resource-constrained environments.

At ASC there is a relative topographical variation, coastal cliff, which modifies the atmospheric boundary layer characteristics and can cause interference for operations of rockets. In the present work, a simplified model (mock-up) was studied in a wind tunnel. A scale factor of 1 : 1000 was used and the atmospheric flow was measured using the hot wire anemometer (HWA) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. Using of HWA {{it was possible to}} calculate values of average wind speed and fluctuations in a set of points of the section of tests that representing the region of the ASC. Through these measures, other meteorological parameters that represent the atmospheric flow, such as the friction velocity (u*), the roughness length (z 0) from the logarithmic profile and the alpha exponent (ɑ) of the power law were calculated. With the use of the PIV´s technique, the streamlines and the vorticity fields were obtained and it was noticed that the vorticity generated downwind of the coastal cliff has a strong turbulence (vorticities around 2000 sˉ¹).

In fully connected environments, connectivity is static and permanently established through wired networks. Appli-cations simply “assume ” that they are online continuously. This assumption is clearly invalid in mobile environments that use wire-less connections. While decreases in computer size and cost have made it more practical to use a portable computer as a mobile workstation, and advances in wireless technologies {{have made it possible}} to access networks outside the reach of wired connections, the development of software for use in a mobile environment has lagged behind these technologies.
