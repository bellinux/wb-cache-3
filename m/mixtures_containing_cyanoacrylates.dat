Laboratory flow‐through experiments {{were conducted to}} quantify infiltration, bulk density, and moisture holding capacity {{as a function of}} different composite mixtures of sand, soil, and compost, and to assess the effect of compaction on bulk density, moisture holding capacity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Eleven mixtures were evaluated that varied in volumetric proportions of sand (30 % to 70 %), sandy or silt loam soil (0 % or 20 %), and organic compost (20 % to 70 %). Steady‐state infiltration rates were high for all mixtures, ranging from 87 to 178 cm h- 1, and followed the order of <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand and compost only> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and sandy soil> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and silt loam soil. Infiltration rates for <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand and compost only and <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and sandy soil exhibited a significant linear relationship with the ratio of sand to compost. Bulk density of the mixtures was inversely related to the proportion of compost and followed the order of <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and silt loam soil> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and sandy soil> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand and compost only. Conversely, moisture holding capacity increased with the proportion of compost and followed the order of <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand and compost only> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and sandy soil> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and silt loam soil. Compaction {{as a result of an}} initial wetting process and the infiltration tests led to increases in bulk density and decreases in moisture holding capacity, with <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> a silt loam component showing the greatest resistance to these effects.

40|$|Experimental and {{computational}} {{work was}} performed to help understand why sub-inerting concentrations of HFC- 125 (C 2 HF 5) produced overpressures in the FAA aerosol can explosion test. The fire suppression performance of HCFC- 123 (C 2 HCl 2 F 3) was also investigated {{to determine whether it}} may perform better than HFC- 125. Thermodynamic analysis shows that both agents increase the overall heat release for lean <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> the aerosol can contents. HFC- 125 also increases the overall reaction rate when added to lean mixtures. The overall reaction rate of <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> HCFC- 123 is generally lowered when sub-inerting concentrations are added. Experimental results showed that HCFC- 123 has a lower minimum inerting concentration (8. 9 %) than HFC- 125 (13. 5 %). <b>Mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> HCFC- 123 were found to produce peak pressures in the 2 L chamber that were estimated to cause overpressures in the FAA chamber.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{ecofriendly}} ultra-high-performance glass concrete (UHPGC) was developed at the Université de Sherbrooke using waste glass with varying particle-size distributions (PSD). The compressive strength was higher than 150 MPa and mini-slump spread diameter higher than 250 mm (which resulted into a good self-compacting ability of the fluid mixture). This paper presents the characterization of the tensile behavior of this advanced cementitious composite, since the post-cracking tensile performance is a fundamental mechanical characteristic of ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC).

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringMustaque A. HossainThe use of {{economical}} {{and environmentally}} friendly recycled asphalt materials {{has become increasingly}} popular for asphalt pavement construction. Although reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and recycled asphalt shingles (RAS) are typically used in hot-mix asphalt, {{increasing the amount of}} RAP and RAS materials increases the potential for premature pavement distresses, especially cracking. This research evaluated four recycled Superpave mixtures with different RAP and RAS contents from Kansas Department of Transportation projects. Two of the <b>mixtures</b> <b>contained</b> 10 % RAP and 5 % RAS, while the other two <b>mixtures</b> <b>contained</b> 25 % RAP but no RAS. Illinois semicircular bending and Florida indirect tension tests were performed to assess mixture cracking and fracture properties. Results showed that <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> 10 % RAP and 5 % RAS have relatively low fracture energy, creep compliance, energy ratio, and flexibility index but high resilient modulus. These results indicate that <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> 10 % RAP and 5 % RAS are stiffer, more prone to cracking, and tend to absorb less fracture energy. Mixtures with 25 % RAP and no RAS showed the opposite behavior...|$|R

Temperature scans over the range 10 – 75 °C showed that the gel to liquid–crystalline phase transition decreased from 25 to 10 °C {{in the presence of}} 20 mol% cholesterol, and no gel phase could be detected in the wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) intensity profile of <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> 35 mol% cholesterol. The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) intensity profiles showed that the lamellar to nonlamellar phase transition temperature was also decreased in <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> up to 30 mol% cholesterol but the trend was reversed in <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> a higher proportion of cholesterol. There was evidence that the transition of the lamellar liquid–crystal phase is to cubic phases in <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> less than 30 mol% cholesterol.
