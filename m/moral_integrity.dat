5|$|Grant was {{president}} during the Gilded Age, {{a time of}} massive industrial wealth, railroad speculation, and extravagance that fueled unethical behavior and influence in government offices. Although Grant was not personally involved in scandal, multiple corruption charges swept through his administration, clouding Grant's historical reputation. Grant was greatly trusting of men involved in speculation, particularly wealthy Gilded Age tycoons, loyally defending his corrupt cabinet or appointees whom he believed were innocent. Grant's failure was in his poor selection of cabinet officers and how he responded to their downfalls. Grant did not stop the guilty parties prosecutions, but was often insistent about having them prosecuted. His political enemies, outraged over the scandals, were eager to discredit Reconstruction, and the <b>moral</b> <b>integrity</b> of his administration. No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock, who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed federal investigations. Historians debate how effective he was at halting corruption.|$|E

40|$|Novel {{is one of}} {{literary}} work which was known by most of people. It presents some values of character buildings, especially those which are presented by a particular cast of the novel. Moral value might {{be found in the}} novel. One of many <b>moral</b> values is <b>integrity</b> <b>moral</b> value. The <b>integrity</b> <b>moral</b> value has important role in this life. It gives us a good reputation and can make us to be a better person. In this study, The Rainbow Troops novel was taken as an object of research. Therefore, there are two research objectives of this research namely: (1) To know the <b>integrity</b> <b>moral</b> values conducted by Bu Mus as a teacher found in The Rainbow Troops novel and (2) To know the impact of <b>integrity</b> <b>moral</b> values conducted by Bu Mus as a teacher for the students found in The Rainbow Troops novel. This research used descriptive qualitative research design because this study only focused on a particular phenomenon only in The Rainbow Troops novel. In analyzing the novel, the researcher used the objective approach. It is because the researcher focused on the literary itself, where the writer only describing <b>integrity</b> <b>moral</b> values conducted by Bu Mus. After the researcher analyzed the novel, the researcher found the <b>integrity</b> <b>moral</b> values conducted by Bu Mus as a teacher found in The Rainbow Troops novel such as kept teaching in every circumstances, gave advice to the students, struggled for the school whatever happens, always inspiring the students. Moreover, the researcher also found the impacts of <b>integrity</b> <b>moral</b> value conducted by Bu Mus as a teacher in The Rainbow Troops novel such as students were happy in school and students were growing up with good attitude. To sum up, having an integrity {{is the most important thing}} in life. It builds personal character, especially for the teachers.

500|$|After 1945, many of {{the films}} of the {{immediate}} post-war period can be characterised as [...] Trümmerfilm (rubble film). Such films included Wolfgang Staudte's Die Mörder sind unter uns (The Murderers are among us, 1946) and Irgendwo in Berlin (Somewhere in Berlin, 1946) by Werner Krien. Notable East German films were largely produced by DEFA and included Ehe im Schatten (Marriage in the Shadows) by Kurt Maetzig (1947), Der Untertan (1951); Die Geschichte vom kleinen Muck (The Story of Little Muck, 1953), Konrad Wolf's Der geteilte Himmel (Divided Heaven) (1964) and Frank Beyer's Jacob the Liar (1975). The defining film genre in West Ger{{many of the}} 1950s was arguably the Heimatfilm ("homeland film"); these films depicted {{the beauty of the}} land and the <b>moral</b> <b>integrity</b> of the people living in it. Characteristic for the films of the 1960s were genre films including Edgar Wallace and Karl May adaptations. One of the most successful German movie series of the 1970s included the sex reports called Schulmädchen-Report (Schoolgirl Report). During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.|$|E
500|$|As to why Proba {{arranged}} {{in the poem}} in the first place, scholars are still divided. The Latinist R. P. H. Green argues that the work was {{a reaction to the}} Roman emperor Julian's law forbidding Christians from teaching classical Greek and Latin mythological literature which they did not believe to be true. Proba's goal, Green writes, was to present Virgil [...] "without [...] gods, and [...] a [...] no longer vulnerable to Christian criticism". In this way, a Christian teacher could use the text to discuss Virgil without compromising their <b>moral</b> <b>integrity.</b> A somewhat related hypothesis, proposed by the classicist Aurelio Amatucci, suggests that Proba composed the cento to teach her children stories from the Bible. However, there is no direct evidence that the poem was a teaching tool. Clark and Hatch postulate that Jesus's Virgilian nature in the cento may have been Proba's attempt to rebut the unflattering, demonizing descriptions of Jesus in Julian's Caesares and Contra Galilaeos. They conclude that the hypothesis is intriguing but unverifiable {{due to the lack of}} information about Proba, the date of the cento's creation, and her intentions.|$|E

It may involve spinning information that is technically true, but that is presented in a misleading manner or is presented without the necessary context. For example, it might be said that a person refused to pay any income tax during a specific year, without saying that no tax was actually owed due to the person having no income that year, or that a person was sacked from a firm, even though {{he may have been}} made redundant through no fault of his own, rather than being terminated for cause.|$|R

500|$|IGNs Dan Stapleton liked Marcus Holloway {{more than}} Aiden Pearce {{of the first}} game, and {{similarly}} appreciated the supporting characters of DedSec. Marcus' penchant for <b>moral</b> <b>integrity</b> was a noticeable contradiction for Stapleton, though, {{in light of the}} prospect to have him kill innocent people if one so chooses. Therefore, the character's personality was observed as the only preclusion to violence and an axiomatic push toward the stealth approach, which Stapleton insisted was the most accommodating of available tools. Writing for Polygon, Philip Kollar saw that Watch Dogs 2 could appeal to those able to connect with [...] "being young, angry at the system and certain that you know what's best for the world".

San Francisco – the spaces of which were described as [...] "cleverly designed" [...] – never felt overwhelming in size to Kollar but inspired joy as he took advantage of the immediate ability to explore it entirely.

2500|$|The {{television}} series {{differs from the}} film versions in one fundamental aspect: Nikita (Peta Wilson) is innocent. She is not a killer, nor a drug user, just a homeless young woman {{in the wrong place}} at the wrong time. Section One —an elite, top-secret counter-terrorism organization— sets Nikita up to be accused of murdering a police officer and sentenced to life in prison where she supposedly commits suicide and is brought into Section One. Because Nikita will be killed (or [...] "cancelled") if she fails to comply, she is forced to carry out the organization's ruthless methods of fighting terrorism, while attempting to keep her <b>moral</b> <b>integrity</b> intact. This personal struggle becomes the primary conflict of the series. A key scene in the two theatrical films involves Nikita's first assignment —to murder a VIP in a crowded restaurant. Although the Nikita of the {{television series}} eventually does become, by necessity, a ruthless killer, in the television version of this first mission she uses her ingenuity to avoid having to kill the VIP (whereas the film versions of the character complete the assignment). However, despite the machinations of others in power around her, Nikita retains her compassion and humanity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{influences}} of the antebellum and wartime South, which Andrews {{describes as a}} [...] "unique society," [...] are evident in her work, {{from the beginning of}} her writing career to her last pieces. [...] Between the Confederate surrender in April 1865, {{and the end of the}} 1860s, Andrews wrote for several local and national magazines and newspapers, including the New York World and Scott's Monthly, providing commentary on issues the South faced during the early years of Reconstruction; she expressed concerns about universal male suffrage due to African Americans' ignorance of informed voting practices. [...] Her views regarding black Americans reflect contemporary Southern fears of black enfranchisement. [...] Similarly, Andrew's essays and novels about women's roles provide strong, often conflicting opinions about ideal females, reflecting the contrast in her commitments to both Southern idealism and her own professional independence. [...] For example, her early works in the late 1860s argued against women's suffrage, as women's position under the protection of men granted them social privileges, such as perceived superior <b>moral</b> <b>integrity,</b> that they would forfeit if given the right to vote. [...] These ideas contrast with her stated belief that women have similar governing potential to men and were capable of advancing society through private, professional work as teachers, doctors, and merchants.|$|E
