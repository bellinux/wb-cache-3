5|$|Following the war, the 1950s and 1960s {{saw many}} large scale {{developments}} in the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and {{a new system of}} roads, including the Inner Ring Road, were laid out. Also at this time <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> slums were cleared and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats, and the Gleadless Valley estate.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 the Silver Jubilee Bridge {{replaced}} the outdated Transporter Bridge {{and in recent}} years <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> heavy chemical factories have closed to be replaced by more modern factories. Much of the land previously polluted by the old dirty chemical processes has been reclaimed, and there have been improvements in the cleanliness and environment of the town.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{domination}} of the print industry, other businesses were also established on Fleet Street. The Automobile Association was established at No.18 Fleet Street in 1905. Since the post-Wapping migration, Fleet Street is now more associated with the investment banking, legal and accountancy professions. For example, The Inns of Court and barristers' chambers are down alleys and around courtyards off Fleet Street itself and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> newspaper offices have become the London headquarters for various companies; e.g. Goldman Sachs is in the old Daily Telegraph and Liverpool Echo buildings of Peterborough Court and Mersey House.|$|E
50|$|The Heritage Walk is also {{popular with}} {{tourists}} and residents. <b>The</b> walk features <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town.|$|R
50|$|A central element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{landscape}} in Kalvola is lake Vanajavesi near which <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> settlements in <b>the</b> area are concentrated.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> Great Depression, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> mansions were {{subdivided}} into apartments, and as {{demand for housing}} fell after World War II.|$|R
5|$|During {{the years}} between World War I and World War II, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> mansions were hastily {{converted}} into apartments to house the growing labor supply, a practice encouraged {{by the federal government}} at the time through low-interest loans. However, after World War II, with the housing shortage solved by large-scale suburban development affordable to the middle class, vacancy rates in Old Louisville surged. To attract renters, landlords had to lower rents dramatically, attracting less affluent tenants with less funds to maintain the homes.|$|E
5|$|In {{previous}} works, Hergé {{had drawn}} upon {{a variety of}} pictorial sources, such as newspaper clippings, from which to draw the scenes and characters; for The Secret of the Unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources. In drawing <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> vessels, Hergé initially consulted the then recently published L'Art et la Mer ("Art and the Sea") by Alexandre Berqueman. Seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels, Hergé consulted a friend of his, Gérard Liger-Belair, who owned a Brussels shop specialising in model ships. Liger-Belair produced plans of a 17th-century French fifty-gun warship for Hergé to copy; Le Brillant, which had been constructed in Le Havre in 1690 by the shipwright Salicon and then decorated by Jean Bérain the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Jellyvision Games did {{not want}} to change much of the older games for the 2011 version. They sought to keep as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> game {{question}} types, such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions, updating the games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles: they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in-game achievements.|$|E
50|$|In 1896, the Zig-Zag was {{replaced}} by the semi-automatic Broomhandle Mauser, but <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> revolvers remained in use until after World War I.|$|R
50|$|As {{some early}} texts such as {{newspapers}} spelled Beaver Bank as one word, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> residents still consider that spelling to be correct.|$|R
50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> streets <b>of</b> Shawinigan were numbered, like <b>the</b> streets <b>of</b> Manhattan, New York. Similarly, Avenue Broadway {{was named}} after the famous Manhattan thoroughfare.|$|R
5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem {{of what to do with}} ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways, or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.|$|E
5|$|Modern cottage garden {{plants are}} {{typically}} flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many modern day gardeners use heirloom or 'old-fashioned' plants and varieties—even though these {{may not have}} been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants. In addition, there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look. For example, modern roses developed by David Austin have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragrance—combined with modern virtues of hardiness, repeat blooming, and disease-resistance. Modern cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate, rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment—though <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> favorites thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|The city of Tiruchirappalli lies on {{the plains}} between the Shevaroy Hills {{to the north and}} the Palni Hills to the south and south-west. Tiruchirappalli is {{completely}} surrounded by agricultural fields. Densely populated industrial and residential areas have recently been built {{in the northern part of}} the city, and the southern edge also has residential areas. The older part of Tiruchirappalli, within the Rockfort, is unplanned and congested while the adjoining newer sections are better executed. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> houses in Srirangam were constructed according to the shilpa sastras, the canonical texts of Hindu temple architecture.|$|E
50|$|In 1901 <b>the</b> {{population}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parish was 6,155 and in 1971, after <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> {{houses in}} <b>the</b> neighbourhood had been demolished, it was 1,335.|$|R
50|$|By 1919, the {{standard}} British field gun was the 18 pounder Mk IV gun on Mk IV carriage but Britain still possessed <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Marks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> albums {{that were}} {{originally}} on vinyl have been re-issued as CDs {{and a number}} of tracks from certain albums are available as MP3s.|$|R
5|$|The {{last show}} on 15 September 2001 saw <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> {{features}} and presenters return including leprechauns Mr Sage and Mr Onion who acknowledged {{in the final}} few minutes of the show {{that they were the}} longest serving presenters of the show. The show then ended with Mr Onion pulling the 'Off' switch plunging the studio into darkness. A match was then struck revealing Cawood, Suttie, Farley and Deley standing in the darkness. After saying Missed It? Missed Out!', a reference to the show's former catchphrase, they blew the match out sending the studio back into darkness symbolising {{the end of the show}} and the end of an era.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{restored}} <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> {{financial institutions}} {{of his grandfather}} Henry I and undertook further, long-lasting reforms {{of the way that}} the English currency was managed; one result was a long-term increase in the supply of money within the economy, leading to a growth both in trade and inflation. Medieval rulers such as Henry enjoyed various sources of income during the 12th century. Some of their income came from their private estates, called demesne; other income came from imposing legal fines and arbitrary amercements, and from taxes, which at this time were raised only intermittently. Kings could also raise funds by borrowing; Henry did this far more than earlier English rulers, initially through moneylenders in Rouen, turning later in his reign to Jewish and Flemish lenders. Ready cash was increasingly important to rulers during the 12th century to enable the use of mercenary forces and the construction of stone castles, both vital to successful military campaigns.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{agriculture}} base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town {{changed in}} the 16th century with a brick-making industry developing around Luton; <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> wooden houses were rebuilt in brick.|$|R
25|$|Also, {{because of}} {{internal}} {{differences in the}} society, in <b>the</b> 1910s, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> legitimate chapters reorganized themselves as independent organizations which were loosely allied across campuses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> {{generation}} Chinese (mainly {{those born}} before WWII), whether pure or mixed, can also understand some Spanish, {{due to its}} importance in commerce and industry.|$|R
25|$|Post-Bologna: {{no longer}} used. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> bacharelato programes were {{converted}} in post-Bologna licenciatura programs.|$|E
25|$|General Dynamics {{occupies}} <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> GE buildings, and {{its workforce}} is expanding. Much of General Dynamics' local success {{is based on}} the awarding of government contracts related to its advanced information systems.|$|E
25|$|Five {{months after}} that, it premiered on September 17, 2006 at 8pm. With its {{editorial}} policy, TV Avala initially reminded <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> RTS's third channel (3K), which ceased operations on May 5, 2006 at twelve midnight.|$|E
50|$|In {{its natural}} geography, Petaling Hill, on which MBS now stands, the school overlooks one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> {{business}} sections <b>of</b> Kuala Lumpur which consists <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> Chinese business establishments.|$|R
50|$|Further {{south is}} {{a stretch of}} road that has <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> motels, bars and wedding chapels that were among <b>the</b> high points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Vegas before <b>the</b> era <b>of</b> <b>the</b> megaresorts.|$|R
50|$|But <b>the</b> {{leadership}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights recalled numerous failures before 1885, {{and remained}} timid. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights {{was seen as}} a threat by <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> craft unions.|$|R
25|$|In the 16th {{century the}} abbey was raided by Calvinist groups, which {{scattered}} <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> books. In 1530, abbot Diethelm began a restoration that stopped the decline {{and led to}} {{an expansion of the}} schools and library.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{additional}} {{people have}} been attracted to Bisbee, leading it to develop such amenities as coffee shops and live theatre. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> houses have been renovated, and property values in Bisbee now greatly exceed those of other southeastern Arizona cities.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversion}} of the Market Street streetcar lines into tunnel and {{the replacement of}} the existing streetcars with new light rail cars was completed by November 1982. However, the street trackage on Market Street was retained, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> streetcars were still in storage.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Burial Act <b>of</b> 1855 {{resulted}} in <b>the</b> closure <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> churchyards in Dublin and surrounds due to overcrowding. This drove {{the need to}} find new lands for cemeteries.|$|R
