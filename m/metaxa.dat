5|$|Meksi {{was born}} in 1770 in Labovë, a village near Gjirokastër, and pursued {{secondary}} studies in Ioannina, then an important Ottoman provincial center (now in Greece). His first employment was as a folk physician {{to the court of}} Ali Pasha, the Albanian ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina, a position he held until 1803. Armed with a letter of recommendation from Ali Pasha, Meksi was admitted to the University of Naples in Italy, where he studied medicine under Dr. Nicola Acuto and practiced in a hospital administered by the parish of San Giovanni a Carbonara. After completing his studies in 1808, Meksi returned to Yanina and once again served in Ali Pasha's court, this time as one of his four physicians. His colleagues were Dr. <b>Metaxa,</b> (degree in medicine from the University of Paris), Dr. Saqeralliu (degree in medicine from the University of Vienna), and Dr. Loukas Vagias, (brother of Thanasis Vagias, with a degree in medicine from Leipzig University).|$|E
25|$|In 2008, <b>Metaxa</b> {{launched}} a special Reserve, the <b>METAXA</b> AEN, celebrating 120 {{years of the}} brand. For this occasion, {{and for the first}} time in Metaxa's long history, 1888 crystal decanters were filled solely with the liquid of Cask No.1 of the <b>Metaxa</b> cellars. <b>Metaxa</b> AEN is the oldest product ever to be released by <b>Metaxa</b> with blends of over 80 years old. Packaged in Crystal de Sevres decanters with a gold painted stopper, the retail prices easily exceeded the $1,000 benchmark as only 1888 decanters of AEN <b>METAXA</b> had been available worldwide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metaxa</b> {{comes in}} nine major varieties: Three Stars, Five Stars, Five Stars Honey Shot, Seven Stars, Twelve stars, Grande Fine, Private Reserve, Angels Treasure and AEN. The number of stars {{represents}} {{the number of}} years the blend is matured. The three and 5 star are not as different, but the 5 star is notably drier, making the alcohol more pronounced. The seven and twelve star are more flavoursome and complex, while the Twelve-star G.O.R. is again more dry, in this case because there is no addition of wine. In either of the two latter varieties, the smell and taste of the barrel in which the brandy matured is noticeable. The house of <b>Metaxa</b> has recently launched a new product, the <b>Metaxa</b> Twelve Star containing distillates matured for 12 years adding Muscat wine from the island of Samos, unlike the <b>Metaxa</b> Twelve Stars Grand Olympian Reserve. <b>Metaxa</b> Private Reserve is the most oldest member of <b>Metaxa</b> family. Only 5.000 numbered decanters of <b>Metaxa</b> Private Reserve are on the market containing distillates aged for 30 years from Spyros Metaxas' family barrels.|$|E
40|$|General <b>Metaxa's</b> regime, {{pursuing}} fascist archetypes in {{the construction}} of its image and causing a repercussion of nationalistic principles on the organization of the state, attempted to centralize the agricultural economy in order to achieve a large-scale protectionism. The main axes of its agricultural policy were the protection of some agricultural products (in particular that of grains), regulation of rural debts and expansion of the Agricultural Bank's net. In {{spite of the fact that}} such axes had also been objectives of the previous liberal governments, in the conjuncture of the international economic crisis, <b>Metaxa's</b> dictatorship enveloped ideological principles and «theoretical" interpretations within its paternalistic politics. In fact, this regime attempted to approach the rural population by means of strategies like ceremonies, parades and a strongly populist discourse...|$|R
25|$|<b>Metaxa's</b> {{smoothness}} {{comes from}} its Muscat wine. The resulting distillates {{are kept in}} cellars, in limousin French oak barrels. French barrels are considered more desirable than those made in North America since French Oak has smaller pores than its American counterpart. This slows the transfer of flavor between the barrel and the liquor contained within.|$|R

I have one client, a sporting man, who would be very likely to take it up if we could agree upon terms. Of course, I must follow <b>Metaxa's</b> example by sending for a doctor." ...|$|R
25|$|The House of <b>Metaxa</b> has won several {{gold medals}} in {{international}} spirit competitions. Among them was the Grand Prix in 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. <b>Metaxa</b> was the official Sponsor of 1982 FIFA World Cup held in Spain. <b>Metaxa</b> has been an official supplier of many of European royal houses. In 1989 the company was bought by the British drinks group Grand Metropolitan (now called Diageo) and was later sold to the Rémy Cointreau group.|$|E

From the Pliocene, the species Marshallora adverse (MONTAGU, 1803), Triphora radiospirata sp. nov., Triphora antwerpiensis sp. nov., Obesula scaldensis sp. nov., Norephora pliocaenica sp. nov., Subuliphora fritschi (von KOENEN, 1882), Inella vandermarki sp. nov., and Metaxia <b>metaxae</b> (DELLE CHIAJE, 1828) are described from the Kattendijk Formation and the Luchtbal and Oorderen Sand Members. Three Miocene species are studied: Subuliphora fritschi (von KOENEN, 1882), Triphora borealis KAUTSKY, 1925 and Metaxia degrangei (COSSMANN & PEYROT, 1922) ...|$|R

Another is the Puerto Rican-influenced jibarito, a sandwich made with flattened, fried green plantains instead of bread. There is also the mother-in-law, a tamale topped with chili and served on a hot dog bun. The tradition of serving the Greek dish, saganaki while aflame, has its origins in Chicago's Greek community. The appetizer, which consists of a square of fried cheese, is doused with <b>Metaxa</b> and flambéed table-side.|$|E

2500|$|The House of <b>Metaxa</b> {{was founded}} by a Greek {{merchant}} and entrepreneur named Spyros Metaxas, born {{on the island of}} Euboea. The name [...] "Metaxas" [...] means [...] "silker". He created the first Greek brandy and was involved in the foundation of the first distillation facility in 1888, a little over 50 years after the Greek War of Independence. The business soon expanded with new factories in Constantinople and Odessa.

6000|$|... "Oh, we {{may as well}} do it at once. It {{would be}} absurd to {{postpone}} it now," [...] <b>Metaxa</b> spoke with some heat, and his eyes glinted angrily from between his narrow lids at the imperturbable Charles. The Admiral was simple in money matters, but he had seen much of men and had learned to read them. He saw that venomous glance, and saw too that intense eagerness was peeping out from beneath the careless air which the agent had assumed.|$|E
