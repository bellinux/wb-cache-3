5000|$|The 2006 {{observation}} {{of a pair}} of colliding galaxy clusters known as the [...] "Bullet Cluster", poses a significant challenge for all theories proposing a modified gravity solution to the <b>missing</b> <b>mass</b> problem, including MOND. Astronomers measured the distribution of stellar and gas mass in the clusters using visible and X-ray light, respectively, and in addition mapped the inferred dark matter density using gravitational lensing. In MOND, one would expect the <b>missing</b> <b>mass</b> (which is only apparent since it results from using Newtonian as opposed to MONDian dynamics) to be centred on the visible mass. In ΛCDM, on the other hand, one would expect the dark matter to be significantly offset from the visible mass because the halos of the two colliding clusters would pass through each other (assuming, as is conventional, that dark matter is collisionless), whilst the cluster gas would interact and end up at the centre. An offset is clearly seen in the observations. It has been suggested, however, that MOND-based models may be able to generate such an offset in strongly non-spherically-symmetric systems, such as the Bullet Cluster.|$|E

5000|$|Classically, a bound {{system is}} {{at a lower}} energy level than its unbound constituents. Its mass must be less than the total mass of its unbound constituents. For systems with low binding energies, this [...] "lost" [...] mass after binding may be fractionally small. For systems with high binding energies, however, the <b>missing</b> <b>mass</b> may be an easily {{measurable}} fraction. This <b>missing</b> <b>mass</b> may be lost {{during the process of}} binding as energy in the form of heat or light, with the removed energy corresponding to removed mass through Einstein's equation E = mc2. Note that in the process of binding, the constituents of the system might enter higher energy states of the nucleus/atom/molecule, but these types of energy also have mass. It is necessary that they be removed from the system before its mass may decrease. Once the system cools to normal temperatures and returns to ground states in terms of energy levels, there is less mass remaining in the system than there was when it first combined and was at high energy. In that case, the removed heat represents exactly the mass [...] "deficit" [...] and the heat itself retains the mass which was lost (from {{the point of view of}} the initial system). This mass appears in any other system which absorbs the heat and gains thermal energy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We analyse {{the scatter}} in the {{correlation}} between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and bulge stellar mass of the host galaxy, and infer that it cannot {{be accounted for by}} mergers alone. The merger-only scenario, where small galaxies merge to establish a proportionality relation between the SMBH and bulge masses, leads to a scatter around the linear proportionality line that increases with the square root of the SMBH (or bulge) mass. By examining a sample of 103 galaxies, we find that the intrinsic scatter increases more rapidly than expected from the merger-only scenario. The correlation between SMBH masses and their host galaxy properties is therefore more likely to be determined by a negative feedback mechanism that is driven by an active galactic nucleus. We find, a hint, that some galaxies with <b>missing</b> stellar <b>mass</b> reside close to the centre of clusters and speculate that ram-pressure stripping of gas off the young galaxy as it moves near the cluster centre, might explain the <b>missing</b> stellar <b>mass</b> at later times...|$|R
