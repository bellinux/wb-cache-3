50|$|This {{structure}} {{was designed for}} any digital VBI data and was optimized to carry three or more 43-byte Teletext packets. e.g. a page header and two associated lines. <b>For</b> <b>Teletext</b> subtitles, the data_unit_id is set to 3.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis project {{offers a}} stylebook <b>for</b> <b>teletext.</b> From February to July 1982, Los Angeles, California, {{was the site}} of a unique {{three-way}} teletext broadcast. Two network stations and one public broadcasting station participated in a joint but competitive effort to test the dimensions of this medium that utilizes the technologies of television and computers to broadcast words on home video screens, at the viewer's demand. The research for this project centered on how news and advertising messages were prepared and broadcast. It included reviewing a wide variety of literature, on-the-job experience composing pages <b>for</b> <b>teletext,</b> and interviewing principals involved in management, composition, editing and design of the teletext broadcasts. Job skills for the new medium were evaluated before the broadcasts began and after they were under way. A large quantity of literature, almost entirely in periodicals, was reviewed to establish the attitudes of media professionals and others on the effectiveness of teletext as a mass communications medium and on its projected uses. The combined impact of the futurist views depicted in the literature and the actual experience of working in teletext {{led to the creation of}} a two-level stylebook for this new medium. One level is a transition form to serve as a bridge from current journalism usage to a future style the second level stresses brevity, clarity and ease of use by non-professionals who will likely be working in the teletext studios of the future...|$|R
