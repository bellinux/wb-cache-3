5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of <b>melanogenesis</b> in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} mechanisms involved. Firstly, the UVA-radiation creates oxidative stress, which in turn oxidizes existing melanin and leads to rapid darkening of the melanin, also known as IPD (immediate pigment darkening). Secondly, there {{is an increase in}} production of melanin known as <b>melanogenesis.</b> <b>Melanogenesis</b> leads to delayed tanning and first becomes visible about 72 hours after exposure. The tan that is created by an increased <b>melanogenesis</b> lasts much longer than the one that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin. Tanning involves not just the increased melanin production in response to UV radiation but the thickening of the top layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} process, {{triggered}} primarily by UVB, {{there is an}} increase in production of melanin (<b>melanogenesis),</b> which is the body's reaction to direct DNA photodamage (formation of pyrimidine dimers) from UV radiation. <b>Melanogenesis</b> leads to delayed tanning, and typically becomes visible two or three days after exposure. The tan that is created by increased <b>melanogenesis</b> typically lasts for a few weeks or months, much longer than the tan that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin, and is also actually protective against UV skin damage and sunburn, rather than simply cosmetic. Typically, it can provide a modest Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 3, meaning that tanned skin would tolerate up to 3 times the UV exposure as pale skin. However, in order to cause true melanogenesis-tanning by means of UV exposure, some direct DNA photodamage must first be produced, and this requires UVB exposure (as present in natural sunlight, or sunlamps that produce UVB).|$|E
25|$|HMB-45 is nonreactive {{with almost}} all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the {{exception}} of rare tumors showing evidence of <b>melanogenesis</b> (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).|$|E
25|$|Whilst not all {{of these}} genes {{directly}} affect melanin production, most of them code for proteins that may {{play a significant role in}} <b>melanogenesis</b> and control melanin concentration. Some of these genes are found to be more prevalent in certain population than others.|$|E
25|$|MC1R {{is one of}} the key {{proteins}} {{involved in}} regulating mammalian skin and hair color. It is located on the plasma membrane of specialized cells known as melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin through the process of <b>melanogenesis.</b> It works by controlling the type of melanin being produced, and its activation causes the melanocyte to switch from generating the yellow or red phaeomelanin by default to the brown or black eumelanin in replacement.|$|E
25|$|Solute carrier family 24 member 5 (SLC24A5) regulates calcium in melanocytes and is {{important}} in the process of <b>melanogenesis.</b> The SLC24A5 gene's derived Ala111Thr allele (rs1426654) {{has been shown to be}} a major factor in light skin pigmentation and is common in Western Eurasia. Recent studies have found that the variant represents as much as 25–40% of the average skin tone difference between Europeans and West Africans. This derived allele is a reliable predictor of phenotype across a range of populations. It has been the subject of recent selection in Western Eurasia, and is fixed in European populations.|$|E
25|$|Studies by Samaraweera, et al. {{revealed}} OA1 as an endolysosomal protein. Schiaffino, et al. already {{proved that}} it is an integral membrane protein. Newton et al. have shown that it has three probable glycosylation sites. Furthermore, OA1 was found to be stimulated by α-melanocortin stimulating hormone but inhibited by agouti signal protein. The fact that OA1 responds to melanin modifiers indicates its probable role in <b>melanogenesis.</b> Just like other melanosomal proteins TYR and TRP-1, processing of OA1 also occurs in the golgi. Endogenous OA1 protein expressed by normal human melanocytes is detected as a 60kDa protein.|$|E
25|$|Melanin is {{produced}} by cells called melanocytes in a process called <b>melanogenesis.</b> Melanin is made within small membrane–bound packages called melanosomes. As they become full of melanin, they move into the slender arms of melanocytes, from where they are transferred to the keratinocytes. Under normal conditions, melanosomes cover {{the upper part of}} the keratinocytes and protect them from genetic damage. One melanocyte supplies melanin to thirty-six keratinocytes according to signals from the keratinocytes. They also regulate melanin production and replication of melanocytes. People have different skin colors mainly because their melanocytes produce different amount and kinds of melanin.|$|E
25|$|Melanin is {{a natural}} pigment {{produced}} by cells called melanocytes in a process called <b>melanogenesis.</b> Melanocytes produce two types of melanin: pheomelanin (red) and eumelanin (very dark brown). Melanin protects the body by absorbing ultraviolet radiation. Excessive UV radiation causes sunburn along with other direct and indirect DNA damage to the skin, and the body naturally combats and seeks {{to repair the damage}} and protect the skin by creating and releasing further melanin into the skin's cells. With the production of the melanin, the skin color darkens. The tanning process can be triggered by natural sunlight or by artificial UV radiation, which can be delivered in frequencies of UVA, UVB, or a combination of both. The intensity is commonly measured by the UV Index.|$|E

2500|$|The cream locus is on exon 2 of the MATP gene; {{a single}} {{nucleotide}} polymorphism results in an aspartic acid-to-asparagine substitution (N153D). The DNA test offered by various laboratories detects this mutation. The MATP gene encodes a protein illustrated to have roles in <b>melanogenesis</b> in humans, mice, and medaka. Mice affected by a condition homologous to cream exhibit irregularly shaped melanosomes, which are the organelles within melanocytes that directly produce pigment.|$|E
2500|$|Glutathione {{plays an}} {{important}} role in preventing oxidative damage to the skin. In addition to its many recognized biological functions, glutathione has also been associated with skin lightening ability. The role of glutathione as a skin whitener was discovered as a side effect of large doses of glutathione. Glutathione utilizes different mechanisms to exert its action as a skin whitening agent at various levels of <b>melanogenesis.</b> It inhibits melanin synthesis by means of stopping the neurotransmitter precursor L-DOPA's ability to interact with tyrosinase in the process of melanin production. Glutathione inhibits the actual production as well as agglutination of melanin by interrupting the function of L-DOPA. Another study found that glutathione inhibits melanin formation by direct inactivation of the enzyme tyrosinase by binding and chelating copper within the enzyme's active site. Glutathione's antioxidant property allows it to inhibit melanin synthesis by quenching of free radicals and peroxides that contribute to tyrosinase activation and melanin formation. [...] Its antioxidant property also protects the skin from UV radiation and other environmental as well as internal stressors that generate free radicals that cause skin damage and hyperpigmentation. In most mammals, melanin formation consists of eumelanin (brown-black pigment) and pheomelanin ( [...] yellow-red pigment) as either mixtures or co-polymers. Increase in glutathione level may induce the pigment cell to produce pheomelanin instead of eumelanin pigments. A research by Te-Sheng Chang found lowest levels of reduced glutathione to be associated with eumelanin type pigmentation, whereas the highest ones were associated with the pheomelanin. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that depletion of glutathione would result in eumelanin formation. Prota [...] observed that decreased glutathione concentration led to the conversion of L-Dopaquinone to Dopachrome, increasing the formation of brown-black pigment (eumelanin).|$|E
50|$|Through {{a process}} called <b>melanogenesis,</b> melanocytes produce melanin, which is a pigment found in the skin, eyes, and hair. This <b>melanogenesis</b> leads to a {{long-lasting}} pigmentation, which {{is in contrast to}} the pigmentation that originates from oxidation of already-existing melanin.|$|E
50|$|There {{are both}} basal and {{activated}} levels of melanogenesis; in general, lighter-skinned people have low basal levels of <b>melanogenesis.</b> Exposure to UV-B radiation causes an increased <b>melanogenesis.</b> The {{purpose of the}} <b>melanogenesis</b> {{is to protect the}} hypodermis, the layer under the skin, from the UV-B light that can damage it (DNA photodamage). The color of the melanin is black, allowing it to absorb a majority of the UV-B light and block it from passing through this skin layer.|$|E
50|$|Melanocytes express {{serotonin}} receptors and {{are capable}} of producing serotonin. Pharmacological interference with the serotonin system of melanocytes can result in either increased or decreased melanin synthesis. Serotonin itself is a weak inhibitor of tyrosinase with 0.11 times the potency of kojic acid. Nonetheless, serotonin increases synthesis of melanin when its overall effect on melanocytes (as opposed to isolated tyrosinase) is evaluated. Activation of 5-HT2B receptors with BW-723C86 inhibits <b>melanogenesis</b> while activation of 5-HT2A receptors with the amphetamine structural analog DOI promotes <b>melanogenesis.</b> The serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) 6-nitroquipazine inhibits <b>melanogenesis</b> in-vitro.|$|E

50|$|Numerous stimuli {{are able}} to alter <b>melanogenesis,</b> or the {{production}} of melanin by cultured melanocytes, although the method by which it works is not fully understood. Certain melanocortins have been shown in laboratory testing to have effect on appetite and sexual activity in mice. Vitamin D metabolites, retinoids, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, forskolin, cholera toxin, isobutylmethylxanthine, diacylglycerol analogues, and UV irradiation all trigger <b>melanogenesis</b> and, in turn, pigmentation. Increased melanin production is seen in conditions where Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) is elevated, such as Cushing's disease. This is mainly a consequence of alpha-MSH being secreted along with the hormone associated with reproductive tendencies in primates. Alpha-MSH is a cleavage product of ACTH that has an equal affinity for the MC1 receptor on melanocytes as ACTH.|$|E
