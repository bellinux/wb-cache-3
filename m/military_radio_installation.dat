40|$|This work {{considers}} the distortion created by an unmatched transmission line {{system at the}} receiver of a <b>military</b> data <b>radio.</b> The <b>installation</b> requirements for these types of systems are such that manual tuning of the antenna is impracticable. The antenna impedance may not match that of the cable and radio receiver, resulting in electrical reflections in the cable. These reflections create intersymbol interference (ISI), which distorts the received signal and limits {{the performance of the}} communication link. It is shown that this distortion can be modelled using only four parameters: the transit time, the amplitude and the angle of the reflection coefficient and the synchronization offset. A joint maximum likelihood (ML) block estimator for the parameters is presented with the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound. The performance of the estimator is evaluated using simulations and compared to the bound. A more practical iterative estimator algorithm for the joint estimation of the parameters is also suggested. To compensate for the distortion at the receiver, a filter design technique based on the estimated parameters is introduced. The method, obtained from the least squares procedure, produces an approximate inverse filter for the channel, minimizing the distortion at the receiver. Results comparing the proposed method to traditional adaptive equalizers are presented. They show that the minimum mean squared error (MSE) achieved by the proposed method approaches the power of the noise, the minimum value attainable...|$|R
