Since CSF- 1 plays {{important role in}} embryonic development and implantation, we investigated its role in gram-negative bacterial LPS-induced implantation failure. The effect of LPS on normal (nonsuperovulated) and superovulated in vivo-produced embryos was assessed by signs of morphological degeneration. A significantly similar number of <b>morphologically</b> <b>degenerated</b> embryos recovered from both nonsuperovulated and superovulated LPS treated animals on day 2. 5 of pregnancy onwards were morphologically and developmentally abnormal as compared to their respective controls (P <. 001.

This deviation from the normal pattern and level of CSF- 1 expression in the preimplantation embryos and uterine tissues suggest a role for CSF- 1 in LPS-induced implantation failure.

The pathological changes associated with {{the early stages of}} experimental infection have previously been reported in detail, and this article describes the lesions associated with later chronic stages of experimental infection. Chronic infection is characterised by extravascular granuloma formation and proliferation of fibrovascular tissue around intact and fragmented, <b>degenerate</b> <b>parasites</b> within both the gill arch and cardiac region. The majority of parasite granulomas are located within connective tissues of the gill arch or pericardium; however, low numbers are present within the wall of large vessels. The intraluminal parasites and thrombi of early stage infection are largely absent in these later lesions. We propose that organisation and incorporation of the parasite thrombus into the vessel wall with subsequent granuloma formation and extrusion into the surrounding connective tissue leads to the elimination of the parasite from the vascular system. Thus, rather than being a negative consequence of infection thrombosis is protective, allowing the host to survive the substantial initial vascular insult...|$|R

Blood samples were taken from eight inoculated deer every two weeks up to 16 weeks postinoculation. Eosinophilia with a mild transitory anemia were the main clincopathological features. Postmortem examination at two weeks postinoculation revealed extensive migration of immature flukes. Subcapsular tracks in the liver, nodules on the blind sacs of the rumen, as well as retroperitoneal granulomas on flanks and necrotic tracks on the diaphragm were found.

Flukes migrating into tissues other than the liver were destroyed in large granulomas, although remnants of <b>degenerating</b> <b>parasites</b> were not found. At eight weeks postinoculation, widespread granuloma formation characterized the infection with this lesion present in nodes along the gastrointestinal tract, in the mesentery, flanks, psoas muscles, diaphragm, between the ribs and in the lungs.

Although the World Health Organization has been {{successful}} in reducing onchocerciasis as a public health problem in parts of West Africa, there remain an estimated 17 million people infected with Onchocerca volvulus, the parasite that causes this disease. Ocular pathology can be manifested in any part of the eye, although disease manifestations are frequently characterized as either posterior or anterior eye disease. This review focuses on onchocerca-mediated keratitis that results from an inflammatory response in the anterior portion of the eye and summarizes what is currently known about human disease. This review also describes studies with experimental models that have been established to determine the immunological mechanisms underlying interstitial keratitis. The pathogenesis of keratitis is thought to be due to the host inflammatory response to <b>degenerating</b> <b>parasites</b> in the eye; therefore, the primary clinical symptoms of onchocercal keratitis (corneal opacification and neovascularization) are induced after injection of soluble O. volvulus antigens into the corneal stroma. Experimental approaches have demonstrated an essential role for sensitized T helper cells and shown that cytokines can regulate the severity of keratitis by controlling recruitment of inflammatory cells into the cornea. Chemokines are also important in inflammatory cell recruitment to the cornea, and their role in onchocerciasis is being examined. Further understanding of the molecular basis of the development of onchocercal keratitis may lead to novel approaches to immunologically based intervention...|$|R
40|$|The apicomplexan {{parasite}} Toxoplasma gondii {{is regularly}} transmitted to humans via the ingestion of contaminated meat products from chronically infected livestock. This route of transmission requires intracellular development and long-term {{survival of the}} parasite within muscle tissue. In this study, we determined the cell-autonomous immunity of mature primary embryonic or C 2 C 12 skeletal muscle cells (SkMCs) to infection with T. gondii. Non-activated SkMCs and control fibroblasts sustained parasite replication; however, interferon (IFN) -γ significantly inhibited parasite growth in SkMCs but not in fibroblasts. Intracellular parasite replication was diminished by IFN-γ whereas host cell invasion was not affected. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) did not further increase the IFN-γ-triggered host defense of SkMCs against Toxoplasma. Remarkably, IFN-γ alone or in combination with TNF decreased {{the high level of}} T. gondii bradyzoite formation being observed in non-activated SkMCs. Stimulation of SkMCs with IFN-γ strongly triggered expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transcripts, and induced significantly higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) in SkMCs than in fibroblasts. Consequently, pharmacological inhibition of iNOS partially abrogated the IFN-γ-induced toxoplasmacidal activity of SkMCs. In addition, SkMCs strongly up-regulated immunity-regulated GTPases (IRGs) following stimulation with IFN-γ. IRGs accumulated on Toxoplasma-containing vacuoles in SkMCs in a parasite strain-dependent manner. Subsequent vacuole disruption and signs of <b>degenerating</b> <b>parasites</b> were regularly recognized in IFN-γ-treated SkMCs infected with type II parasites. Together, murine SkMCs exert potent toxoplasmacidal activity after stimulation with IFN-γ and have to be considered active participants in the local immune response against Toxoplasma in skeletal muscle...|$|R

The inflammatory reaction {{was characterized by}} early predominance of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) at 2, 6 and 12 hours of infection, mixed infiltrate of PMN and mononuclear cells (MN) at 24 hours, followed by predominance of MN at 48 and 72 hours after infection. The group depleted of complement showed a higher number of PMN at 2 hours and lower numbers of MN at 72 hours after infection (P< 0. 0001). In the depleted group the phagocytosis by PMN was lower at 2 and 24 hours and by MN was lower at 24, 48 and 72 hours after infection. Electron microscopy showed extracellular intact and <b>degenerated</b> <b>parasites,</b> and lysed intracellular parasites, in PMN; and, rarely, preserved intracellular parasites in MN at 2, 6 and 12 hours after infection.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{dexamethasone}} (dex) treatment on infections with the microsporidian parasite, Loma salmonae {{and the effects}} of dex on initiation of the adaptive immune response were investigated in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss experimentally infected with the parasite. Dex treatment resulted in significantly higher infections with the parasite in the gills and other internal organs, suggesting that dex inhibits aspects of the innate immune response to L. salmonae; the heavier infections in the gills and organs of rainbow trout resembled infections seen in Chinook salmon. Mean xenoma counts per microscope field in the gills of fish infected with L. salmonae treated with dex or left untreated were 169 and 30, respectively. Although higher numbers of xenomas were observed in dex treated fish, the xenomas were generally smaller in size than in infected control fish. The xenomas in dex treated fish showed morphological signs of degeneration including loss and degeneration of early parasite stages, accumulation of amorphous material in xenomas, and infiltration with phagocytic cells containing <b>degenerated</b> <b>parasites.</b> The xenomas in infected untreated fish had larger xenomas with a more uniform size and contained identifiable parasite stages in the cytoplasm. According to this study, once fish have developed an adaptive immune response to the parasite by previous exposure, then fish have 100 % protection to reinfection even when treated with heavy doses of dex. L. salmonae immune fish treated or untreated with dex during reinfection with the parasite developed no xenomas in the gills 6 weeks post reinfection. These results indicate that once the cellular response is primed to L. salmonae, then dex related immunosuppression does not reduce the effectiveness of the adaptive immune response...|$|R
40|$|Neurocysticercosis, {{caused by}} Taenia solium, {{is one of}} the most common causes of {{seizures}} worldwide. The symptoms result from granulomatous inflammation associated with dying cyst forms of the parasite. Although the invasive larvae can be killed by immune serum plus complement, immunity to the cyst stage depends on a cellular response. This dichotomous immune response is reminiscent of the extremes of the immune response associated with T helper 1 (Th 1) and Th 2 cytokine profiles. To characterize the cytokine response in cysticercosis, granulomas were removed from the peritoneal cavity of mice infected with Taenia crassiceps cysts and examined for cytokine message by in situ hybridization using 35 S-labeled RNA probes. The granulomas were staged based on histologic appearance of the <b>degenerating</b> <b>parasite.</b> Message for gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) was identified by light microscopy in 11 of the 12 granulomas, and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) message was identified in 9 of the 12. By laser scanning confocal microscopy, significantly increased IFN-gamma and IL- 2 pixel intensity was identified in nearly all of the granulomas from early histologic stages. Message for IL- 4 was seen in 6 of the 12 granulomas. Only granulomas with complete destruction of the parasite architecture displayed more than minimal amounts of IL- 4 message by light microscopy, and only 2 of 12 granulomas had IL- 4 pixel intensity significantly above background. Only minimal amounts of IL- 10 message were detected in 4 of 11 granulomas. Thus, early granulomas in cysticercosis are predominantly associated with a Th 1 response, whereas later granulomas, in which parasite destruction is complete, have a mixture of Th 1 and IL- 4. The Th 1 response appears to play an important role both in the pathogenesis of disease as well as in the clearing of the parasites, with IL- 4 involved in downregulation of the initial response...|$|R

O número médio de parasitas intatos/macrófago também diferiu significantemente entre as células infectadas com AM e aquelas infectadas com promastigotas viáveis ou fixadas.

Esses resultados sugerem que os eventos cruciais que determinam a evolução da infecção ocorrem durante as primeiras 24 horas da interação parasito-hospedeiro.

The latter group includes inflammatory cells like neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, and epithelial cells. A comparison was made between non-spermatogenic cells in semen samples and inflammatory cells in blood smears, using various staining procedures commonly used in routine andrology laboratories. The result presented in this review confirmed previously published data. In blood smears {{as well as in}} semen samples, only neutrophil leukocytes (both eosinophilic and basophilic) showed a positive reaction when exposed to the peroxidase stain.

There are many points of similarity between the nonspecific protection BCG and Corynebactium parvum provide against Babesia species and inhibition of tumor growth by these agents.

Both <b>morphologically</b> intact and <b>degenerating</b> rickettsiae were present in the phagosomes in PMNs, but only the viable-appearing rickettsiae were free in the cytoplasm. The intact rickettsiae were singly and selectively phagocytized in tightly enclosed phagosomal membranes which usually excluded the tracers, except when ThO 2 or ferritin was used. When ThO 2, which labels the plasma membrane of PMNs, was used. ThO 2 -labeled phagosomal membranes enclosing rickettsiae were observed and short membrane fragments still labeled with this tracer were found in the vicinity of rickettsiae in the cytoplasmic matrix of PMNs. When ferritin or ThO 2 was used as a tracer, some of the phagosomes contained rickettsiae still enclosed in an envelope of BHK- 21 cytoplasm and cell membrane. Phagolysosomes preloaded with electron-dense markers fused with subsequently formed phagosomes containing degenerated rickettsiae but not with those containing intact rickettsiae.

In parasitic organisms, proteins containing repeats play important roles such as cell adhesion and invasion and immune evasion. Therefore, extracellular and intracellular parasites {{are expected to}} be under different selective pressures regarding the repetitive content in their genomes. Here, we investigated whether there is a bias in the repetitive content found in the predicted proteomes of 6 exclusively extracellular and 17 obligate intracellular protozoan parasites, as well as 4 free-living protists. We also attempted to correlate the results with the distinct ecological niches they occupy and with distinct protein functions. We found that intracellular parasites have higher repetitive content in their proteomes than do extracellular parasites and free-living protists. In intracellular parasites, these repetitive proteins are locatedmainly at the parasite surface or are secreted and are enriched in amino acids known to be part of N- and O-glycosylation sites. Furthermore, in intracellular parasites, the developmental stages that are able to invade host cells express a higher proportion of proteins with perfect repeats relative to other life cycle stages, and these proteins have molecular functions associated with cell invasion.
