The tumors of kidney, cervix, colon, ovary, and lung were analyzed in our work, using the chromosome 3 specific NotI microarrays (NMA). We have found loci/genes with essential changes in gene methylation of tumor samples. Changes in expression for these genes were confirmed. The Not-I microarray results {{have been used to}} develop epigenetic marker panels for the early detection of different tumor types (ovary and lung cancer), to discriminate the stages of tumor growth and to determine whether the tumor is metastasizing. <b>Marker</b> <b>panel</b> designing is of great perspective in clinical medicine...|$|R

40|$|Genomic {{prediction}} estimates breeding {{values by}} exploiting linkage disequilibrium (LD) between quantitative trait loci (QTL) and {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs). High LD cannot occur when QTL and SNPs have different minor allele frequencies (MAF). <b>Marker</b> <b>panels</b> tend to use SNPs with high MAF and will have limited ability to predict rare QTL alleles. In practice, increasing SNP density has not improved prediction accuracy. A possible reason is that many traits are characterized by rare QTL. In that case, linear models fitting haplotypes could have advantage because haplotypes can be in complete LD with QTL alleles. SNP genotypes were simulated to resemble 600 K chip for the bovine genome. Genomic breeding values were predicted using either SNP genotypes or non-overlapping haplotypes. When QTL had low MAF, the haplotype model had significantly higher accuracy than the SNP model. Results show that fitting haplotypes can improve the accuracy of genomic prediction for traits controlled by rare QTL...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe use of {{biomarkers}} {{might help}} to avoid antibiotic misuse and overuse and to curb the rising incidence of microbial resistance. Among > 100 biomarkers proposed for use as infection/sepsis markers, procalcitonin is the most frequently evaluated. It has been tested in 11 randomized controlled trials with more than 3500 patients and resulted in a considerable 35 - 70 % reduction in antibiotic use without an apparent negative impact on patient outcome. Testing {{was carried out in}} hospital, intensive care unit, emergency and primary care settings; most of the patients had lower respiratory tract infections and only smaller studies exist in surgical patients with infectious complications, immunocompromised patients and patients with sepsis. There are, however, concerns-trials designed to show non-inferiority of procalcitonin to standard management allowed rather large differences for mortality rates, in the range of 7. 5 - 10 %, thus clinically relevant excess mortality by procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy cannot be completely ruled out. <b>Marker</b> <b>panels</b> derived from transcriptomic or proteomic profiling hold promise in overcoming the limitations of procalcitonin for differentiating non-infectious from infection-associated inflammation. However, the utility of these novel diagnostic tools in the clinical setting remains to be proven...|$|R
50|$|The exams are {{conducted}} {{each year in}} August, in selected national schools across the country. Invigilators and supervisors are appointed by the Department of examinations and they are typically qualified teachers of the local school system. The students are allowed to {{sit for the exam}} 3 times to qualify for a state university, i.e. the student can attempt 3 times in 3 years. Students can sit for the examination any number of times in order to qualify for private courses or any other job requirements. If a student fails to gain entrance to a state university or a desired course in his/her first attempt, he/she has two more opportunities to attempt again and gain the required marks to make up for his desired course/university. The test assessments are carried out by <b>marking</b> <b>panels</b> usually consisting of qualified and experienced school teachers in service who are guided by supervisors (usually university lecturers). It takes about 4-5 months for the final results of this islandwide examination to be released and students have to wait for around one year to enter a local university, depending on the university and the course/field of study.|$|R

5000|$|Hitch {{begins with}} {{multiple}} rough sketches employing different camera angles on {{paper with a}} blue pencil, which tends to be less visible in photocopies or scans, and then select the desired elements from the rough sketch with a graphite pencil. After picking the initial shapes, he will further emphasise his selections with a red marker pen and other coloured pens, continuing to attempt different variations. He will then, depending on how {{late in the day}} it is, either redraw the illustration on a sheet of layout paper or use his lightbox to tighten and clean up the drawing, emphasising that the lightbox should not be a mere exercise in tracing, but an opportunity to refine or change elements in the drawing to make it [...] "clean" [...] enough to be inked. When Hitch transfers the drawing to the final art board, he does initial layouts with a 2H pencil, which feels provides the necessary accuracy and detail, and uses an erasable blue pencil to <b>mark</b> <b>panel</b> frames and vanishing points, which he introduces after the rough stage. He chooses not to put too much time or polish into this stage, preferring to work quickly, lightly and instinctively. He uses a mechanical pencil with 0.9mm 2H lead at this stage for fine outlines and detail work, and a traditional pencil for more organic work, including softer lines, shading large areas and creating more fluid motion. The [...] "best tool of all", according to him, is a traditional pencil cut with a craft knife, which he says can produce a variety of marks, and be used for detail, shading and general sketching. Hitch believes the best results combine both the mechanical and the knife-sharpened traditional pencil.|$|R
5|$|Following the Battle of the Java Sea, the Japanese {{were able}} to land a force around Banten Bay and Marek, on the western tip of Java, and {{subsequently}} began advancing east towards Batavia and Buitenzorg, forcing Blackforce to reorientate itself east of the Tjianten River, to make a stand south of Buitenzorg. On 3 March, the battalion went into action around Leuwiliang {{for the first time}} as Dutch troops began to withdraw. Occupying positions in support of the 2/2nd Pioneers who held the bridge over the Tjianten River, they were alerted to the advancing Japanese by the presence of fifth columnists, who were seen to be laying out <b>marking</b> <b>panels.</b> A short time later, a force of five Japanese light tanks attempted to cross the river, but were rebuffed by anti-tank rifles and small arms. The plan had been for the Dutch troops to make a stand at Djasinga, but faulty intelligence resulted in a rout and the Dutch began to withdraw back to Bandung, flooding through Blackforce's lines. In the ensuing chaos, Dutch engineers blew up the bridge at the Tjianten River. For the next couple of days, the battalion fought several skirmishes with 'C' Company bearing the brunt of the Japanese attacks, suffering seven killed and 28 wounded, while inflicting about 200 casualties on the Japanese. As the Allied defence of the island began to collapse, the machine gunners were ordered to hold up the Japanese around Leuwiliang for a day. After this, Blackforce began moving towards Soekaboemi on 5 March, as part of efforts to reach Tjilatjap on the southern coast of the island to secure passage back to Australia. Ultimately, this never eventuated and Blackforce was ordered to surrender on 9 March 1942 following the Dutch capitulation the day before. They would subsequently endure three-and-a-half years in captivity as Japanese prisoners of war, being sent to camps across south-east Asia, including the infamous Thai–Burma Railway. Forced to endure brutal conditions, over worked in labour camps, and inadequately provided for, casualties amongst these men were high.|$|R

Near La Specola there are two olive trees which, according to the State Forestry Department, are older than 500 years. All the olive trees in the garden of the villa belong to the taggiasca variety, which has a very slow growth.
