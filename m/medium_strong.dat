40|$|A {{spectral}} {{principal component}} analysis (SPCA) of a sample of 87 PG QSOs at z < 0. 5 is presented for their mid-infrared spectra from Spitzer Space Telescope. We have derived the first five eigenspectra, which account for 85. 2 % of the mid-infrared spectral variation. It is found that the first eigenspectrum represents the mid-infrared slope, forbidden emission line strength and 9. 7 μ m silicate feature, the 3 rd and 4 th eigenspectra represent the silicate features at 18 μ m and 9. 7 μ m, respectively. With the principal components (PC) from optical PCA, we find {{that there is a}} <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> correlation between spectral SPC 1 and PC 2 (accretion rate). It suggests that more nuclear contribution to the near-IR spectrum leads to the change of mid-IR slope. We find mid-IR forbidden lines are suppressed with higher accretion rate. A <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> correlation between SPC 3 and PC 1 (Eddington ratio) suggests a connection between the silicate feature at 18 μ m and the Eddington ratio. For the ratio of the silicate strength at 9. 7 μ m to that at 18 μ m, we find a strong correlation with PC 2 (accretion rate or QSO luminosity). We also find that there is a <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and PC 2.

40|$|The {{variability}} of broad absorption lines is investigated for {{a sample of}} 188 broad-absorption-line (BAL) quasars (QSOs) (z > 1. 7) with at least two-epoch observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR 7), covering a time-scale of about 0. 001 [...] 3 years in the rest frame. Considering only the longest time-scale between epochs for each QSO, 73 variable regions in the BAL troughs are detected for 43 BAL QSOs. The proportion of BAL QSOs showing variable regions increases with longer time-interval than about 1 year in the rest frame. The velocity width of variable regions is narrow compared to the BAL-trough outflow velocity. For 43 BAL QSOs with variable regions, {{it is found that}} there is a <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> correlation between the variation of the continuum luminosity at 1500 Å and the variation of the spectral index. With respect to the total 188 QSOs, larger proportion of BAL QSOs with variable regions appears bluer during their brighter phases, which implies that the origin of BAL variable regions is related to the central accretion process. For 43 BAL QSOs with variable regions, it is possible that there is a negative <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> correlation between the absolute variation of the equivalent width and the -based black hole mass, and a <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> correlation between the maximum outflow velocity of variable regions and the Eddington ratio.

40|$|Background and purpose: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to estimate correlations between kernel oil content and morphological traits in two studied maize populations, and to estimate direct and indirect effects of yield components on kernel oil content. Materials and methods: The material for this study was developed by crossing progenies of high oil maize populations with two testers. The traits analyzed were kernel row number, 100 -kernel weight, grain yield per plant and kernel oil content. Correlation coefficients were based on the ratio of joint variation and summary of individual variation of two traits (8). Standardized partial regression coefficients and levels of their significance were calculated according to the method of the inverse matrix (10).

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{establish}} the effects of carbonated drinks and fruits drinks on the onset {{and the level of}} dental erosions on the central incisors and the first permanent molars. In order to objectify the existence of dental erosion among the population, research was made in different urban environments in the city of Shtip and its surrounding. The total sample consisted of 31 respondents (17 male and 14 female) with positive signs of dental erosion. In the methodology we used specially constructed questionnaires in which we input the data about the consumption of carbonated and fruits drinks and from a clinical standpoint we input data about the depth of the dental erosions according to teeth and surfaces. The monitoring of the distribution of dental erosions that were diagnosed on the central incisors and the first permanent molars, in correlation to the gender of the examinees, did not show a significant difference (p> 0. 05). The results we got for the existence of dental erosions according to surfaces of the examined teeth, in correlation to the gender of the examinees, did not show a significant difference (p> 0. 05). The correlation between the use of carbonated drinks and dental erosions on the central incisors was with a <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> negative insignificant correlation p> 0. 05. The data which represents the association of dental erosions, according to tooth surface, and the consumption of carbonated drinks during the whole week and of fruit drinks during the whole day,on the central incisors, showed, that there is no statistically significant difference p> 0. 05. In the examined correlation between the consumption of carbonated drinks and dental erosions of the first permanent molar, we can see that there is a <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> negative significant correlation p 0. 05). The correlation between the use of fruit drinks and dental erosions of the first permanent molar was with a <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> negative significant correlation p< 0, 05, where the increase of the use of fruit drinks is followed by a decrease in the level of erosive changes.
