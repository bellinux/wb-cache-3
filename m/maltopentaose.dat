The method presented is investigated with respect to all reaction parameters, including possible influence of protein, and shows zero order reaction kinetics after a 5 — 6 minute lag phase. The blank reaction from <b>maltopentaose</b> Substrate is constant and is 13 % of the upper limit of the reference interval for serum. The course of the blank reaction {{can be used to}} check that the <b>maltopentaose</b> is of adequate purity for use in the assay. Km for <b>maltopentaose</b> is 0. 48 mmol/ 1. There is no interference from endogenous glucose when the total NADP turnover is less than 0. 25 mmol/ 1.

It is a dimer with a subunit Mr of ca. 50, 000. Optimal activity is between pH 7. 5 and 8. 0 with maltotriose as substrate and the enzyme's Km for maltotriose is 3. 3 millimolar. Chloroplast D-enzyme converts maltotriose to <b>maltopentaose</b> and glucose via {{the exchange of}} α- 1, 4 -glycosidic linkages. Maltotriose acts either as a donor or acceptor of a maltosyl group. The enzyme has highest activity with maltotriose as substrate.

The current noise through the open channels had a rather small spectral density, which was {{a function of the}} inverse frequency up to about 100 Hz. The spectral density of the noise of the open LamB channels was a quadratic function of the applied voltage. Its magnitude was not correlated to the number of channels in the lipid bilayer membrane.

40|$|Glycation of {{proteins}} by the Maillard reaction is often {{considered as a}} method to prevent flocculation of protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions. The effect has been suggested, but not proven, {{to be the result}} of steric stabilization, and to depend on the molecular mass of the carbohydrate moiety. To test this, the stabilities of emulsions of patatin glycated to the same extent with different mono- and oligosaccharides (xylose, glucose, maltotriose, and <b>maltopentaose)</b> were compared under different conditions (pH and electrolyte concentration). The emulsions with non-modified patatin flocculate under conditions in which the zeta potential is decreased (around the iso-electric point and at high ionic strength). The attachment of monosaccharides (i. e., glucose) did not affect the flocculation behavior. Attachment of maltotriose and <b>maltopentaose</b> (Mw > 500 Da), on the other hand, provided stability against flocculation at the iso-electric point. Since the zeta potential and the interfacial properties of the emulsion droplets are not affected by the attachment of the carbohydrate moieties, this is attributed to steric stabilization. Experimentally, a critical thickness of the adsorbed layer required for steric stabilization against flocculation was found to be 2. 29 – 3. 90 nm. The theoretical determination based on the DLVO interactions with an additional steric interaction coincides with the experimental data.

Experiments on three trisaccharides (isomaltotriose, maltotriose, and panose), a tetrasaccharide (isomaltotetraose), and a pentasaccharide (<b>maltopentaose)</b> show that tandem mass spectrometry provides all available linkage information and MSn can provide selected linkage information. The mode of alkali binding is examined via semiempirical calculations and by measuring alkali-carbohydrate relative cation affinities...|$|E

A model of this protein, based on sequence similarity and the amphipathy profile, was constructed. The model depicts a beta-barrel composed of 14 antiparallel beta-strands. The accuracy {{of this model}} was tested by the chemical labelling of cysteine residues introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The protein has seven surface-exposed loops. They are rather small {{with the exception of}} one, loop L 6. Deletion of this loop allowed the entry of <b>maltopentaose</b> into the bacteria, a molecule too large to enter through the wild-type KdgM. Loop L 6 could fold back into the lumen of the pore and play the role of the constriction loop L 3 of general porins.

Incubation of the reconstituted enzyme alone resulted in the gradual cleavage of the synthetic cofactor to pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate, which caused slow reactivation of the enzyme. The addition of <b>maltopentaose</b> or glycogen altered the mode of cleavage; the cofactor was rapidly decomposed to pyridoxal 5 '-diphosphate. The radioactive glucose moiety released from pyridoxal(5 ') diphospho(1) -alpha-D-[14 C]glucose was incorporated into the outer chain of glycogen, forming an alpha- 1, 4 -glucosidic linkage. These {{results show that the}} glucosyl transfer reaction discovered mimics the normal catalysis of this enzyme, and they strongly support the catalytic mechanism in which the coenzyme phosphate acts as a catalyst by direct interaction with the phosphate of the substrate, forming the pyrophosphate-like transition intermediate...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus {{colonization}} {{of the lower}} female genital tract provides protection from the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus, and from adverse pregnancy outcomes. While glycogen in vaginal epithelium is thought to support Lactobacillus colonization in vivo, many Lactobacillus iso-lates cannot utilize glycogen in vitro. This study investigated how glycogen could be utilized by vaginal lacto-bacilli in the genital tract. Several Lactobacillus isolates were confirmed to not grow in glycogen, but did grow in glycogen-breakdown products, including maltose, maltotriose, <b>maltopentaose,</b> maltodextrins, and glycogen treated with salivary α-amylase. A temperature-dependent glycogen-degrading activity was detected in genital fluids that correlated with levels of α-amylase. Treatment of glycogen with genital fluids resulted in production of maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose, the major products of α-amylase digestion. These studies show that human α-amylase {{is present in the}} female lower genital tract and elucidates how epithelial glycogen can support Lactobacillus colonization in the genital tract...|$|E
40|$|The LamB {{protein is}} {{normally}} {{required for the}} uptake of maltodextrins. Starting with a LamB- OmpF- strain, we have isolated mutants that will grow on maltodextrins. The mutation conferring the Dex+ phenotype {{in the majority of}} these mutants has been mapped to the ompC locus. These mutants, unlike LamB- OmpF- strains, grew on maltotriose and maltotetraose, but not on <b>maltopentaose,</b> and showed a significantly higher rate of [14 C]maltose uptake than the parent strain did. In addition, these mutants showed increased sensitivity to certain beta-lactam antibiotics and sodium dodecyl sulfate, but did not exhibit an increase in sensitivity to other antibiotics and detergents. The nucleotide sequence of these mutants has been determined. In all cases, residue 74 (arginine) of the mature OmpC protein was affected. The results suggest that this region of the OmpC protein is involved in the pore domain and that the alterations lead to an increased pore size...|$|E

30|$|Noncovalent {{interactions}} between ligands and targeting proteins {{are essential for}} understanding molecular mechanisms of proteins. In this work, we investigated the interaction of Cytochrome c (Cyt c) with maltoligosaccharides, namely maltose (Mal II), maltotriose (Mal III), maltotetraose (Mal IV), <b>maltopentaose</b> (Mal V), maltohexaose (Mal VI) and maltoheptaose (Mal VII). Using electrospray ionization mass spetrometry (ESI–MS) assay, the 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 complexes formed by Cyt c with maltoligosaccharide ligand were observed. The corresponding association constants were calculated according to the deconvoluted spectra. The order of the relative binding affinities of the selected oligosaccharides with Cyt c were as Mal III > Mal IV > Mal II > Mal V > Mal VI > Mal VII. The {{results indicated that the}} stability of noncovalent protein complexes was intimately correlated to the molecular structure of bound ligand. The relevant functional groups that could form H-bonds, electrostatic or hydrophobic forces with protein’s amino residues played an important role for the stability of protein complexes. In addition, the steric structure of ligand was also critical for an appropriate interaction with the binding pocket of proteins.|$|E

Am J Reprod Immunol 2011; 65 : 54 – 64 To better {{understand}} the immunoregulatory properties of trophoblasts, we have searched for small immunologically active carbohydrates derived from intact trophoblast-like cells. Using solid phase extraction coupled with HPLC and mass spectrometry methods, we have characterized a low molecular weight carbohydrate-rich fraction associated with JEG- 3 cells. We have also tested the bioactivities of selected authentic oligosaccharides found in the oligosaccharide fraction. The most abundant components of the low molecular weight carbohydrate-rich fraction were maltotriose and maltotetraose, with detectable amounts of <b>maltopentaose.</b> When authentic maltooligosaccharides were tested using lymphocytes, IL- 2 inhibition was observed. This activity was dependent upon the number of saccharide subunits, stereochemistry, and concentration. To further test maltooligosaccharide properties, maltopentose was attached to glass cover slips. Although spontaneous neutrophil motility was observed on unmodified and control surfaces, it was inhibited on maltooligosaccharide-derivatized surfaces.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} studywas {{to monitor}} {{for the first time}} the {{oligosaccharide}} pattern in the northwestern Adriatic Sea. Oligosaccharides are components of the low-molecular-weight fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM). They perform an important ecological function in the microbial loop prompting substrates for bacterial degradation. In particular, our investigation focused on maltooligosaccharides (glucose α 1 – 4 linked). The analyses were carried out using a dialysischarcoal column sorption pre-concentration method, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode. During the study period, the concentration of maltooligosaccharides with a low degree of polymerisation (ranging from maltose to maltotetraose) was higher than other maltooligosaccharides (<b>maltopentaose</b> and maltoeptaose) and all together they reached their highest concentration in June. This concentration was temporally shifted from a long period of diatom bloom (from January to April). Furthermore, the annual maltooligosaccharide trend was monitored together with several chemical, physical and biological parameters to investigate their potential role on the maltooligosaccharide accumulation. Our results suggested that the maltooligosaccharide accumulation could be related to the water column stratification...|$|E
40|$|A maltogenic amylase (MAG 1) from alkaliphilic Bacillus lehensis G 1 was cloned, {{expressed}} in Escherichia coli, purified and characterised for its hydrolysis and transglycosylation properties. The enzyme exhibited high stability at pH values from 7. 0 to 10. 0. The hydrolysis of b-cyclodextrin (b-CD) produced malto-oligosaccharides of various lengths. In addition to hydrolysis, MAG 1 also demonstrated transglycosylation activity for {{the synthesis of}} longer malto-oligosaccharides. The thermodynamic equilibrium of the multiple reactions was shifted towards synthesis when the reaction conditions were optimised and the water activity was suppressed, {{which resulted in a}} yield of 38 % transglycosylation products consisting of malto-oligosaccharides of various lengths. Thin layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed the presence of malto-oligosaccharides with a higher degree of polymerisation than maltoheptaose, which has never been reported for other maltogenic amylases. The addition of organic solvents into the reaction further suppressed the water activity. The increase in the transglycosylation-to-hydrolysis ratio from 1. 29 to 2. 15 and the increased specificity toward <b>maltopentaose</b> production demonstrated the enhanced synthetic property of the enzyme. The high transglycosylation activity of maltogenic amylase offers a great advantage for synthesising malto-oligosaccharides and rar...|$|E

The addition of maltose, maltotriose, maltohexaose, <b>maltopentaose,</b> and maltotetraose (all at 10 − 4 m) to cultures growing in a chemically defined medium resulted in a stimulation in the differential rate of α-amylase synthesis by 1. 2, 1. 6, 1. 9, 2. 3, and 3. 0 times that of the sucrose control, while glucose had no effect.
