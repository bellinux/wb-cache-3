50|$|The gingival cavity <b>microecosystem,</b> {{fueled by}} food {{residues}} and saliva, can support {{the growth of}} many microorganisms, of which some can be injurious to health. Improper or insufficient oral hygiene can thus lead to many gum and periodontal disorders, including gingivitis or periodontitis, which are major causes for tooth failure. Recent studies have also shown that anabolic steroids are also closely associated with gingival enlargement requiring a gingivectomy for many cases. Gingival recession is {{when there is an}} apical movement of the gum margin away from the biting (occlusal) surface. It may indicate an underlying inflammation such as periodontitis or pyorrhea, a pocket formation, dry mouth or displacement of the marginal gums away from the tooth by mechanical (such as brushing), chemical, or surgical means. Gingival retraction, in turn, may expose the dental neck and leave it vulnerable to the action of external stimuli, and may cause root sensitivity.|$|E

The system chosen was of a hypersaline type, where all the species present live at high salt concentration; it comprises different bacteria; a producer, the photosynthetic green alga Dunaliella salina; and a consumer, the ciliated protozoan Fabrea salina, which form a complete food chain. We were able to establish the initial conditions {{that give rise to}} a self-sustaining <b>microecosystem,</b> stable for at least 3 weeks. We then determined the effect of UV irradiation on this <b>microecosystem</b> under laboratory-controlled conditions, in particular by measuring the critical UV exposure for the two main components of the <b>microecosystem</b> (algae and protozoa) under UV-B irradiances comparable to those of solar irradiation. In our experiments, we varied irradiance, total dose and spectral composition of the actinic light. The critical doses at irradiances of the order of 56 kJ/m 2 (typical average daily irradiance in a sunny summer day in Pisa), measured for each main component of the <b>microecosystem</b> (algae and ciliates), turned out to be around 70 kJ/m 2 for ciliates and 50 kJ/m 2 for D. salina. By exposing microecosystems to daily UV-B irradiances of the order of 8 kJ/m 2 (typical average daily irradiance in a sunny winter day in Pisa), we found no effect at total doses of the order of the critical doses at high irradiances, showing that the reciprocity law does not hold.

40|$|A <b>microecosystem</b> was {{designed}} to study the behavior of pesticides, fertilizers, or related compounds applied to plant stands. The system consists of three parts: a brass base that holds the plant growth media, a glass atmospheric chamber that rests on the base, {{and a set of}} analytical traps. The brass base is fitted with a porous ceramic plate so that tension {{can be applied to the}} water in the growing media. Air enters the bottom of the glass atmospheric chamber and exits through the top into appropriate trapping systems to recover volatilized pesticides, ammonia, or metabolized 14 CO 2 from labeled compounds. A port at the base of the chamber allows collection of leachate. The <b>microecosystem</b> was evaluated by applying N sources or a pesticide to intact turfgrass profiles and monitoring the fate of the applied compound. Leaching and volatilization losses of N ranged from 0 to 17 % and 0. 1 to 17 % of the applied N, respectively, depending on N source, soil conditions, and whether tension was applied to the base of the system. Three weeks after the application of radiolabeled diazinon [O,O-diethyl- 0 -(2 -isopropyl- 4 -methyl• 6 primidinyl) phosphorothiote] to a turf, 47 % of the label remained in the form of the parent compound, 22 % had been metabolized and lost as 14 CO 2, 1 % had leached through the profile, 2 % had been lost through volatilization, and 28 % remained in the soil as a metabolite or in unextractable compounds.

We studied the effects of atmospheric phenanthrene (PHE) deposition on the <b>microecosystem</b> "moss/soil interface-testate amoebae (TA) community" over a 1 -month period under controlled conditions. We found that PHE {{had an impact on}} the <b>microecosystem.</b> PHE was accumulated by the moss/soil interface and was significantly negatively correlated (0. 4 < r 2 < 0. 7) with total TA abundance and the abundance of five species of TA (Arcella sp., Centropyxis sp., Nebela lageniformis, Nebela tincta and Phryganella sp.). Among sensitive species, species with a superior trophic level (determined by the test aperture size) were more sensitive than other TA species. This result suggests that links between microbial groups in the microecosystems are disrupted by PHE and that this pollutant had effects both direct (ingestion of the pollutant or direct contact with cell) and/or indirect (decrease of prey) on the TA community. The TA community seems to offer a potential integrative tool to understand mechanisms and processes by which the atmospheric PHE deposition affects the links between microbial communities...|$|E

The pattern of γ-diversity, the cumulative species richness of entire connected systems, is similarly higher than that of fragmented systems, despite the homogenizing effects of movement.

Compared to the control group, the different prebiotics diets had varying effects on the structure and diversity of intestinal microbiota. GI and PF supplementation led to significant changes in intestinal microbiota, including an increase of Bacteroides and a decrease of Alloprevotella in the GI-fed, but those changes were opposite in PF fed group. Intriguing, in the GI/PF mixture-fed group, intestinal microbiota had the similar structure as the control groups, and flora diversity was upregulated. Fecal metabolic profiling showed that the diversity of intestinal microbiota was helpful in maintaining the stability of fecal metabolites.

The surfaces of artificial or natural substrates immersed in the aquatic environments are rapidly colonized by microorganisms, primarily bacteria, forming many unique microbial ecosystems, such as epiphyton, epipelon, epixylon, epilithon, epipsammon, and so on (Azim et al. 2005; Li et al. 2014; Pohlon et al. 2010; Qian et al. 2007; Salta et al. 2013). The bacterial communities within these <b>microecosystems</b> are highly sensitive to environmental fluctuations (Araya et al. 2003; Paerl et al. 2003). They are also hot spots for the turnover of allochthonous organic matter and mineral nutrients (Augspurger et al. 2008; Geesey et al. 1978; Pohlon et al. 2010) including anthropogenic pollutants, particularly in hypereutrophic urban rivers lacking macroorganisms.

40|$|Relevance of the studied {{problem is}} caused by the fact that {{stability}} of natural ecosystems strongly depends on functioning of their destructive block which closes a biological circulation. The organisms that ensure functioning of the destructive block are very different and numerous. All of them partly supplement, partly duplicate functions of each other that is an important factor of reliability of this ecosystem block. Shallow arthropods are important regulators of fossils mineralization and immobilizations of various biogens. Experiments demonstrate that if there are microarthropods, humification processes amplify and the optical density of humic acids raises. The aim of the article is to show degree and depth of change of mineralization and humification processes at the interaction of microarthropods and some mesofauna representatives in the processes of transformation of organic substance of vegetable oddments on the basis of experimental research. The most popular method to a research of this problem is the creation of laboratory <b>microecosystems</b> which have a clear boundary, which are easily reproduced and convenient for experimenting with subsequent instrumental determination of quantitative and qualitative humification parameters. In the course of experimental work it is revealed that the activity of soil-forming invertebrates results in strengthening humification processes. Humification rates, transformation depth of organic substance directly depend on cenotic organization of destructors. It is obvious that, the more complete the composition of biodegradative agents, the more intensive the decomposition process, the stronger the humification processes prevail over mineralization, the higher their maturity degree.
