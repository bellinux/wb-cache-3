5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter is {{the final}} id-developed game, {{released}} in December 1991 for MS-DOS. Originally planned to be the third episode of Goodbye, Galaxy and sixth episode overall, it was changed before development began to be a stand-alone game—stylized as Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter!—published as a retail title through FormGen. Due to differing timelines between FormGen and Apogee, despite being numbered as the sixth episode it was developed in between the fourth and fifth; it also features a <b>modified</b> <b>engine</b> from Goodbye, Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a ramjet engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed to operate at high temperatures {{for at least an hour}} and a half at high altitudes. The <b>modified</b> <b>engine</b> was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 an IA-58 of the Argentine Air Force was {{converted}} {{to carry a}} <b>modified</b> <b>engine</b> operating on soy-derived bio-jet fuel.

25|$|GSP (Ob'yekt 55) or GSP-55 - This is a tracked {{self-propelled}} amphibious ferry. It {{consists of}} two non-interchangeable left and right half units with large outer pontoons.

25|$|The first Griffon-powered Spitfires {{suffered}} from poor high altitude performance due to having {{only a single}} stage supercharged engine. By 1943, Rolls-Royce engineers had developed a new Griffon engine, the 61 series, with a two-stage supercharger. In {{the end it was}} a slightly <b>modified</b> <b>engine,</b> the 65 series, which was used in the Mk XIV. The resulting aircraft provided a substantial performance increase over the Mk IX. Although initially based on the Mk VIII airframe, common improvements made in aircraft produced later included the cut-back fuselage and tear-drop canopies, and the E-Type wing with improved armament.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in {{commercial}} aviation, both engine types will have a standard interface with the aircraft, allowing any 787 to be fitted with either a GE or Rolls-Royce engine at any time as long as the pylon is also <b>modified.</b> <b>Engine</b> interchangeability makes the 787 a more flexible asset to airlines, allowing them to change from one manufacturer's engine to the other's in light of any future engine developments which conform more closely to their operating profile. The cost of such a change would require a significant operating cost difference between the two engine types to make it economical - a difference that does not exist with the engines today.|$|E
500|$|A side-scrolling browser game {{interpretation}} of Mirror's Edge titled Mirror's Edge 2D {{was released by}} Electronic Arts in conjunction with independent developer Borne Games.

A one-level beta was released on November 11, 2008, with an expanded three-level beta released on February 24, 2009.

50|$|Another variant was the Fahrschulpanzer VI Tiger tanks (driving school Tiger tanks). These {{tanks were}} tigers with <b>modified</b> <b>engines</b> {{to run on}} either Compressed Towngas gas (Stadtgas System) or wood gas (Holzgas System). This was due to {{shortages}} in fuel supply. They used a mixture of turreted and turretless hulls. They were used to train tiger tank crews. They were not used in combat.|$|R
500|$|In addition, an {{exhaust system}} to reduce noise levels to below those from ejector {{exhausts}} was devised for the North Star/Argonaut. This [...] "cross-over" [...] system took the exhaust {{flow from the}} inboard bank of cylinders up-and-over the engine before discharging the exhaust stream on the outboard side of the UPP nacelle. As a result, sound levels were reduced by between 5 and 8 decibels. The modified exhaust also conferred an increase in horsepower over the unmodified system of , resulting in a 5 knot improvement in true air speed. Still-air range of the aircraft was also improved by around 4 per cent. The <b>modified</b> <b>engine</b> was designated the [...] "TMO" [...] and the modified exhaust system was supplied as kit that could be installed on existing engines either by the operator or by Rolls-Royce.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012 General Motors began {{deliveries}} {{of a low}} emission version {{destined for}} California that features a new low emissions package that allows the 2012 Chevrolet Volt to qualify as an enhanced, advanced technology –partial zero emissions vehicle (enhAT-PZEV) and have access to California’s high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV). The new standard California version of the Volt features a <b>modified</b> <b>engine</b> and exhaust components. The catalytic converter was modified to add a secondary air-injection pump that [...] "streams ambient air into the exhaust stream to increase its ability to remove pollutants." [...] Owners of a 2012 Volt with the low emissions package are eligible to apply for one of 40,000 available HOV lane stickers issued to vehicles that qualify as a California AT-PZEV. The permits are handed out on a first-apply, first-served basis. Additionally, the new low emissions package makes the 2012 Volt eligible for owners to receive up to [...] in state rebates through the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP). This incentive is {{in addition to the}} federal government’s [...] tax credit. Only the 2012 Volts manufactured after February 6, 2012, are fitted with the low emission package and sold as standard models in California. Other states where the Volt has solo driving access to HOV lanes are Florida, Georgia, New York and Virginia.|$|E

2500|$|A second {{cylinder}} {{was added to}} Hyper No. 1 to make a horizontal-opposed engine for evaluation of an opposed-piston 12-cylinder engine. After running the <b>modified</b> <b>engine</b> with different combinations of cylinder bore and stroke, {{it was found that}} the high coolant temperatures required to maintain the required output were impractical. A third high-performance single-cylinder engine was then constructed with lower operating parameters. This one-cylinder engine was designated [...] "Hyper No. 2", and became the test bed for developing the cylinders that would become the Continental O-1430 ("O" [...] for [...] "opposed") engine. It would require a ten-year development period which changed the layout to first an upright V-12 engine and later, an inverted V-12 engine, before becoming reliable enough to consider for full production as the Continental I-1430 in 1943.|$|E
5|$|In December 1990, B-1B (s/n 83-0071) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, {{experienced}} a jolt {{that caused the}} #3 engine to shut down with its fire extinguisher activating.
