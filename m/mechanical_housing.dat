40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of defects (scratches and impacts) {{is vital}} to the certification of flight hardware and other critical components. The amount of damage to a particular component contributes to the performance, reliability, and safety of a system, which ultimately affects {{the success or failure of}} a mission or test. The launch-commit criteria on a Space Shuttle Orbiter window are governed by the depth of the defects that are identified by a visual inspection. This measurement of a defect is not easy to obtain given the environment, size of the defect, and location of the window(s). The determination of depth has typically been performed by taking a mold impression and measuring the impression with an optical profiling instrument. Another method of obtaining an estimate of the depth is by using a refocus microscope. To use a refocus microscope, the surface of the glass and bottom of the defect are, in turn, brought into focus by the operator. The amount of movement between the two points corresponds to the depth of the defect. The refocus microscope requires a skilled operator and has been proven to be unreliable when used on Orbiter windows. White light interferometry was chosen as a candidate to replace the refocus microscope. The White Light Interferometer (WLI) was developed to replace the refocus microscope as the instrument used for measuring the depth of defects in Orbiter windows. The WLI consists of a broadband illumination source, interferometer, detector, motion control, displacement sensor, <b>mechanical</b> <b>housing,</b> and support electronics. The illumination source for the WLI is typically a visible light emitting diode (LED) or a near-infrared superluminescent diode (SLD) with power levels of less than a milliwatt. The interferometer is a Michelson configuration consisting of a 1 -in. (2. 5 -cm) cube beam splitter, a 0. 5 -in. (1. 3 -cm) optical window as a movable leg (used to closely match the return intensity of the fixed leg from the window), and a mirrored prism to fold the optics into the <b>mechanical</b> <b>housing.</b> The detector may be one of many C-mount CCD (charge-coupled device) cameras. Motion is provided by a commercial nanostepping motor with a serial interface. The displacement sensor is a custom device specifically designed for this application. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>housing</b> and support electronics were designed to integrate the various components into an instrument that could be physically handled by a technician and easily transported...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{spacecraft}} {{consists of}} a number of electronic packages to meet the functional requirements. An electronic package is generally an assembly of printed circuit boards placed in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>housing.</b> A number of electronic components are mounted on the printed circuit board (PCB). A spacecraft experiences various types of loads during its launch such as vibration, acoustic and shock loads. Prediction of response for printed circuit boards due to shock loads is important for mechanical design and reliability of electronic packages. The modeling and analysis of printed circuit boards is required for accurate prediction of response due to shock loads. The validated finite element model of the PCB can be adopted to perform response spectrum analysis. Shock response spectrum analysis of printed circuit boards subjected to a half-sine pulse excitation is carried out using finite element method.

40|$|In the National Ignition Facility (NIF), {{currently}} under {{design and construction}} at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), 192 high-power laser beamlines incorporating over 8, 000 large optics, are focused onto a target smaller than a dime. The actual laser path will be contained within the Laser Target Area Building (LTAB), but the smaller adjacent building, the Optics Assembly Building, is where the optic modules are assembled and aligned. After the optics are finished in the OAB they must be transported and installed into the LTAB. While this is done strict cleanliness and handling conditions must be maintained. To maximize the efficiency of this process the optics are assembled into Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), which typically consist of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>housing,</b> laser optics, utilities, actuators and kinematic mounts. In this paper the Optical Transport and Material Handling designs {{that will be used}} to deliver the LRUs into the NIF laser bays are presented. Five types of delivery systems have been developed to deliver the LRUs to their locations in the LTAB. They are top loading, bottom loading, side loading, switchyard loading and target area loading. The first three operate in the laser bay of the LTAB and are transported between the OAB and the LTAB by the Laser Bay Transport System (LBTS). All delivery systems must maintain each optical LRU assemblies' specified shock, vibration, cleanliness, and environmental requirements. The design for each delivery system must take into consideration the cleanliness, functionality and alignment of the LRUs while maximizing commonality {{in order to meet the}} beamline installation schedule.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a MEMS-based micro propulsion system with closed-loop thrust control. It {{is a cold}} gas system with butane as propellant packaged in module with the size one third of a 1 U CubeSat. The module is {{described in terms of}} design, manufacturing, and test results. The development of this product is on-going but recent achievements have demonstrated that besides miniaturization also unique performance and functionality can be achieved. By using MEMS components in a closed-loop control configuration, the combination of milli-Newton thrust range, sub micro-Newton resolutions, and fast response time can be achieved. In our view, using MEMS technology and integrating the flow control valve, mass flow sensor and chamber/nozzle on a single chip is the best âif not the only- way to realize a closed-loop control thruster that can meet new tough small satellite propulsion requirements. Today, most thrusters and fluid control components are operated in ON/OFF mode and in a control system where the feed-back signal comes from sensors (such as accelerometers, sun sensors or star trackers) on-board the spacecraft. The novel MEMS devices presented here do enable both continuous/proportional and closed-loop flow control. In the application of a thruster (cold gas or chemical) this enables continuous throttling capability with a real time measurement of the delivered thrust. Such functionality does enable advanced missions such as precise formation flying or drag free flights. Furthermore, the miniaturization that comes along with the MEMS technology does also in general open up for propulsion on-board CubeSats. The MEMS-based micro propulsion module comprises four complete MEMS thruster and one centralized tank.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{demonstrate}} the possibility of ejecting liquid metals using drop on demand printing technology. The plan was to make transducers for operation in the 100 MHz frequency range and to use these transducers to demonstrate the ability to eject drops of liquid metals such as gallium. Two transducers were made by indium bonding piezoelectric lithium niobate to quartz buffer rods. The lithium niobate plates were thinned by mechanical polishing to a thickness of 37 microns for operation at 100 MHz. Hemispherical lenses were polished in the {{opposite ends of the}} buffer rods. The lenses, which focus the sound waves in the liquid metal, had an F-number equals 1. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>housing</b> was made to hold the transducers and to allow precise control over the liquid level above the lens. We started by demonstrating the ability to eject drops of water on demand. The drops of water had a diameter of 15 microns which corresponds to the wavelength of the sound wave in the water. A videotape of this ejection was made. We then used a mixture of Gallium and Indium (used to lower the melting temperature of the Gallium) to demonstrate the ejection of liquid metal drops. This proved to be difficult because of the oxide skin which forms {{on the surface of the}} liquid. In some instances, we were able to eject metal drops, however, this was not consistent and reproducible. An experiment was set up at NASA-Lewis to stabilize the process of drop on demand liquid metal ejection. The object was to place the transducer and liquid metal in a vacuum station so that no oxide would form on the surface. We were successful in demonstrating that liquid metals could be ejected on demand and that this technology could be used for making sheet metal in space...|$|E
