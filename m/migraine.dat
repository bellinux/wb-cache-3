5|$|A <b>migraine</b> is {{a primary}} {{headache}} disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, the headaches affect {{one half of the}} head, are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Among primary {{headache}}s, the International Classification of Headache Disorders {{distinguishes between}} tension headache (the most common), <b>migraine,</b> and cluster headache. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are {{widely recognized as}} effective {{for the treatment of}} tension headache.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 12–18% {{of people}} in the world have <b>migraines.</b> More women than men {{experience}} <b>migraines.</b> In Europe and North America, 5–9% of men experience <b>migraines,</b> while 12–25% of women experience <b>migraines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mixed tension <b>migraines</b> {{are also}} known as mixed <b>migraines</b> or mixed headaches. They combine {{characteristics}} of tension headaches and <b>migraines.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Migraines</b> with aura {{appear to}} be a risk factor for ischemic stroke {{doubling}} the risk. Being a young adult, being female, using hormonal birth control, and smoking further increases this risk. There also appears to be an association with cervical artery dissection. <b>Migraines</b> without aura do not {{appear to be}} a factor. The relationship with heart problems is inconclusive with a single study supporting an association. Overall however <b>migraines</b> do not appear to increase the risk of death from stroke or heart disease. Preventative therapy of <b>migraines</b> in those with <b>migraines</b> with auras may prevent associated strokes. People with <b>migraines,</b> particularly women, may develop higher than average numbers of white matter brain lesions of unclear significance.|$|R
5|$|Aspirin, {{especially}} {{as a component}} of an aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of <b>migraine,</b> and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.|$|E
5|$|Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss of {{short-term}} memory. Various causes have been hypothesized including ischemia, epilepsy, <b>migraine</b> and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to ischemia of {{structures such as}} the hippocampus {{that are involved in}} memory.|$|E
5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of <b>migraine</b> headaches.|$|E

40|$|What are {{the risks}} of oral {{contraceptives}} in females with <b>migraines?</b> Evidence-based answer: Oral contraceptive use in women with <b>migraines</b> {{is associated with a}} 7 - to 8 -fold greater risk of ischemic stroke compared with women without <b>migraines</b> not using oral contraceptives (SOR: B, meta-analysis of observational studies) ...|$|R
50|$|These figures vary {{substantially}} with age: <b>migraines</b> {{most commonly}} start between 15 and 24 {{years of age}} and occur most frequently in those 35 to 45 years of age. In children, about 1.7% of 7 year olds and 3.9% of those between 7 and 15 years have <b>migraines,</b> with the condition being slightly more common in boys before puberty. During adolescence <b>migraines</b> become more common among women and this persists {{for the rest of the}} lifespan, being two times more common among elderly females than males. In women <b>migraines</b> without aura are more common than <b>migraines</b> with aura, however in men the two types occur with similar frequency.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur {{more often}} in people with epilepsy, depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and <b>migraine.</b> Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects {{three to five times}} more children with epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism.|$|E
5|$|The list {{of medical}} {{problems}} that can produce cerebellar damage is long, including stroke, hemorrhage, swelling of the brain (cerebral edema), tumors, alcoholism, physical trauma such as gunshot wounds or explosives, and chronic degenerative conditions such as olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Some forms of <b>migraine</b> headache may also produce temporary dysfunction of the cerebellum, of variable severity. Infection can result in cerebellar damage in such conditions as the prion diseases and Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of associated risk factors for vertebral artery dissection; many of these reports suffer from methodological weaknesses, such as selection bias. Elevated homocysteine levels, often due to mutations in the MTHFR gene, appear to {{increase the risk of}} vertebral artery dissection. People with an aneurysm of the aortic root and people with a history of <b>migraine</b> may be predisposed to vertebral artery dissection.|$|E
50|$|Retinal <b>migraines</b> are a {{subclass}} {{of optical}} <b>migraines.</b> Sufferers will experience a scotoma - {{a patch of}} vision loss in one eye surrounded by normal vision - for less than one hour before vision returns to normal.

50|$|S-Ethylisothiouronium diethylphosphate is {{also used}} for the {{treatment}} of headaches, in particular, <b>migraines,</b> {{as well as for the}} prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting, effective in preventing or alleviating emesis associated with <b>migraines</b> or other medical conditions such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as well as other symptoms of <b>migraines</b> including phonophobia and photophobia.|$|R
40|$|As the Canadian {{population}} ages, {{the burden}} on our community and health care systems of age-related conditions, such as dementia, is increasing and research in these areas is becoming more critical. Dementia is a major health concern for adults as they age. Although dementia {{is the most common}} neurological disease in older adults, headaches are the most common neurological disorder across all ages. <b>Migraines</b> are a common form of headache disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. Both neurological disorders—dementia and migraines—cause significant impairment for the individual and strain on their caregivers, as well as substantial economic impact on society. The relationship between <b>migraines</b> and late-life cognitive health outcomes has not yet been thoroughly explored. 	Using data from the Manitoba Study of Health and Aging (MSHA), the relationship between <b>migraines</b> and various late-life cognitive health outcomes, including overall dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and cognitive impairment-no dementia (CIND), was examined. As <b>migraines</b> and cognitive impairments are often associated with various comorbid disorders, analyses also investigated the impact of possible associated intervening variables: hypertension, diabetes, stroke, myocardial infarction and other heart conditions. A secondary focus of this project was to examine whether the association between <b>migraines</b> and late-life cognitive health outcomes varied by sex and family history of dementia. <b>Migraines</b> were a significant risk factor for both overall dementia and AD. However, the relationship between <b>migraines</b> and overall dementia appeared to be driven by the significant relationship between <b>migraines</b> and AD. Having a history of <b>migraines</b> was not significantly related to VaD. However, stroke was a statistically significant intervening variable in the relationship between <b>migraines</b> and VaD, indicating that the vascular event, stroke, plays an important part in the migraine-VaD relationship. A history of <b>migraines</b> was not a significant risk factor for CIND. Results could not be stratified by sex because of all participants with <b>migraines,</b> no men developed dementia and only one man developed CIND. Furthermore, despite a lack of significant results from models stratified by family history of dementia, the results are suggestive of possible genetic influences in the relationship between <b>migraines</b> and AD. Overall, this study supports the conclusion that <b>migraines</b> are a significant risk factor for late-life cognitive health, specifically AD. In addition, this study highlights the possibility that vascular events, such as stroke, may {{play an important role in}} the relationship between <b>migraines</b> and VaD. Increased understanding of mid-life risk factors for late-life cognitive health outcomes has important implications for researchers and clinicians in the form of interventions, preventative treatments and medications. In addition, this study suggests that there is a need for further research regarding possible genetic influences in the relationship between <b>migraines</b> and AD. As it was unable to be fully addressed in this study, future studies should investigate gender differences among individuals with <b>migraines</b> developing late-life cognitive health outcomes. This research aims to help develop new strategies that could aid in the prevention of cognitive decline, improve quality of life, and increase the likelihood of healthy aging...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and <b>migraine).</b>|$|E
5|$|Monti {{was born}} in Abington, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1975, to Paul, a school teacher, and Janet Monti. He grew up in Raynham, Massachusetts and, even as a child, he {{demonstrated}} the adventurous character that would later earn him the Medal of Honor. As a four-year-old, he disappeared from the backyard one day, and his mother found him later on hanging by the hood of his sweatshirt {{on the other side}} of the fence. On another occasion, a <b>migraine</b> headache kept him home from school, but he left the house and was later found climbing a tree. In 1994 he graduated from Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School at the age of 18. Monti had two siblings, a sister, Nicole and a brother, Timothy.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet may be {{a successful}} treatment for several rare metabolic diseases. Case reports of two children indicate that it {{may be a}} possible treatment for astrocytomas, a type of brain tumour. Autism, depression, <b>migraine</b> headaches, polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2 have also been shown to improve in small case studies. There is evidence from uncontrolled clinical trials and studies in animal models that the ketogenic diet can provide symptomatic and disease-modifying activity in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and may be protective in traumatic brain injury and stroke.|$|E

25|$|<b>Migraines.</b> In {{the late}} 70s it was {{reported}} that people with <b>migraines</b> had reactions to food allergens, like ARA, the most common reaction was to wheat (78%), orange, eggs, tea, coffee, chocolate, milk, beef, corn, cane sugar, and yeast. When 10 foods causing the most reactions were removed <b>migraines</b> fell precipitously, hypertension declined. Some specific instances are attributed to wheat.|$|R

5|$|After {{being shot}} in the head during the {{previous}} episode, Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) has had a miraculous recovery and will live, although doctors say he will be blind all his life. Crosetti (Jon Polito) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) question prime suspect Alfred Smith (Mojo Gentry), who was identified by eyewitness Charles Flavin (Larry Hull) as the shooter. Crosetti, a close personal friend of Thormann, is convinced Smith is the shooter, but Lewis insists on further investigation. Lewis later learns Flavin bragged about shooting a cop the day Thormann was shot. Crosetti confronts Flavin, who nonchalantly admits to shooting Thormann in frustration because Flavin was suffering a <b>migraine.</b> Although the police celebrate finding Thormann's shooter, Lewis comforts a guilt-stricken Crosetti, who feels he took the case too personally and almost let the true shooter go free.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for <b>migraine)</b> contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's <b>migraine.</b> She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

50|$|<b>Migraines</b> are {{believed}} to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors. About two-thirds of cases run in families. Changing hormone levels may also play a role, as <b>migraines</b> affect slightly more boys than girls before puberty and two to three times more women than men. The risk of <b>migraines</b> usually decreases during pregnancy. The underlying mechanisms are not fully known. It is, however, believed to involve the nerves and blood vessels of the brain.|$|R

5|$|Wilco began touring {{in support}} of Ghost even before the album had been released. Multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band after the {{recording}} sessions to join a theater production, so Wilco added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to replace him. Sansone had been playing with The Autumn Defense, a side project led by bassist John Stirratt. However, the tour to support the album had to be abridged. In May 2004, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago, Illinois due to chronic <b>migraine</b> headaches, anxiety attacks, and clinical depression. In the process of treating the ailments, Tweedy became addicted to prescription painkillers. His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album's release date. Intended for release on June 8, 2004, the album was officially released on June 22, 2004.|$|E
25|$|Neuroimaging is not {{indicated}} {{for patients}} with stable headaches which are diagnosed as <b>migraine.</b> Studies indicate that presence of <b>migraine</b> does not increase a patient's risk for intracranial disease. A diagnosis of <b>migraine</b> which notes the absence of other problems, such as papilledema, would not indicate a need for neuroimaging. In the course of conducting a careful diagnosis, the physician should consider whether the headache has a cause other than the <b>migraine</b> and might require neuroimaging.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia {{can occur}} during the aura {{phase of a}} <b>migraine</b> attack, a phase that often precedes the onset of a {{headache}} and is commonly characterized by visual disturbances. Micropsia, along with hemianopsia, quadrantopsia, scotoma, phosphene, teicopsia, metamorphopsia, macropsia, teleopsia, diplopia, dischromatopsia, and hallucination disturbances, {{is a type of}} aura that occurs immediately before or during the onset of a <b>migraine</b> headache. The symptom usually occurs less than thirty minutes before the <b>migraine</b> headache begins and lasts for five to twenty minutes. Only 10-20% of children with <b>migraine</b> headaches experience auras. Visual auras such as micropsia are most common in children with migraines.|$|E
