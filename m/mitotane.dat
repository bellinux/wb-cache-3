25|$|Cushing's syndrome, {{also known}} as hyperadrenocorticism, is {{characterized}} {{by an increase in}} glucocorticoids secreted by the adrenal glands. About 85 percent of cases are caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland, while 15 percent are caused by an adrenal tumor. The pituitary gland produces a hormone that signals the adrenal gland to produce cortisol; a tumor can cause it to produce the adrenal-stimulating hormone even when it is not needed. Signs include increased appetite, increased drinking and urination, a pot-bellied appearance, muscle weakness, and lethargy. Cushing's can be caused by overuse of steroid medications; in some cases, stopping the medication is enough to solve the problem. Diagnosis can be difficult as there are no tests with both high sensitivity and specificity.Treatments inclulde <b>mitotane,</b> trilostane, ketoconazole, or selegiline. Surgery is used in some cases of adrenal tumors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mitotane</b> is the INN, USAN, BAN, and JAN of <b>mitotane.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Mitotane</b> was {{introduced}} in 1960 {{for the treatment of}} adrenocortical carcinoma.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common regimens are cisplatin, doxorubicin, {{etoposide}} + <b>mitotane</b> and streptozotocin + <b>mitotane.</b> It is unknown which regimen is better. Researchers at Uppsala University Hospital initiated {{a collaboration between}} adrenocortical cancer specialists in Europe, USA and Australia, to conduct the first ever randomized controlled trial in adrenocortical cancer (FIRM-ACT study), comparing these two regimens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mitotane</b> is an {{inhibitor}} of the adrenal cortex. It {{acts as an}} inhibitor {{of cholesterol}} side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1), and also of 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), 18-hydroxylase (aldosterone synthase, CYP11B2), and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) to a lesser extent. In addition, <b>mitotane</b> has direct and selective cytotoxic effects on the adrenal cortex, via an unknown mechanism, and thereby induces permanent adrenal atrophy similarly to DDD.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mitotane</b> {{has been}} {{produced}} by Bristol Myers Squibb SpA {{but it is}} marketed as an orphan drug for adrenocortical carcinoma due to {{the small number of}} patients in need of it. Its main use is in those patients who have persistent disease despite surgical resection, those who are not surgical candidates, or those who have metastatic disease. A 2007 study of 177 patients shows {{a significant increase in the}} recurrence-free interval after radical surgery followed by <b>mitotane</b> when compared to surgery alone. The drug is also sometimes used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly enough, {{if one of}} the p-chlorines in DDD is {{switched}} to ortho-position, then we get a useful chemotherapeutic agent, <b>mitotane.</b> This {{is an example of a}} positional isomer.|$|E
5000|$|They {{are also}} taking {{medications}} that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, <b>mitotane,</b> rifampicin, enzalutamide, and St. John's Wort (Hypercium perforatum).|$|E
50|$|<b>Mitotane</b> is {{also used}} to treat Cushing's disease (pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome) in dogs. The {{medication}} is used in the controlled destruction of adrenal tissue, leading to a decrease in cortisol production.|$|E
50|$|Only {{one other}} drug, Anipryl (veterinary brand name) selegiline, is FDA-approved to treat Cushing's disease in dogs, {{but only to}} treat uncomplicated, pituitary-dependent Cushing's. The only {{previous}} treatment for the disease {{was the use of}} <b>Mitotane</b> (brand name Lysodren) off-label.|$|E
50|$|The only {{curative}} treatment is complete surgical excision of the tumor, {{which can be}} performed even {{in the case of}} invasion into large blood vessels, such as the renal vein or inferior vena cava. The 5-year survival rate after successful surgery is 50-60%, but unfortunately, a large percentage of patients are not surgical candidates. Radiation therapy and radiofrequency ablation may be used for palliation in patients who are not surgical candidates. Chemotherapy regimens typically include the drug <b>mitotane,</b> an inhibitor of steroid synthesis which is toxic to cells of the adrenal cortex, as well as standard cytotoxic drugs. A retrospective analysis showed a survival benefit for <b>mitotane</b> in addition to surgery when compared to surgery alone.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>mitotane</b> is {{unfortunately}} {{limited by}} side effects, which, {{as reported by}} Schteinberg et al., include anorexia and nausea (88%), diarrhea (38%), vomiting (23%), decreased memory and ability to concentrate (50%), rash (23%), gynecomastia (50%), arthralgia (19%), and leukopenia (7%).|$|E
5000|$|... 11β-Hydroxylase (CYP11B1) inhibitors such as amphenone B, etomidate, ketoconazole, metyrapone, <b>mitotane,</b> and osilodrostat {{inhibit the}} {{production}} of the potent corticosteroids cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone from the less potent corticosteroids 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol and are used in the diagnosis and treatment of Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) inhibitors such as metyrapone, <b>mitotane,</b> and osilodrostat {{prevent the}} {{production}} of the potent mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the less potent mineralocorticoid corticosterone.

5000|$|... 3β-Hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} (3β-HSD) inhibitors such as amphenone B, azastene, cyanoketone, epostane, <b>mitotane,</b> and trilostane {{inhibit the}} conversion of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroids into Δ4-3-ketosteroids and thereby inhibit the production {{of most of the}} steroid hormones. Due to inhibition of progesterone biosynthesis, they have been investigated as contraceptives and abortifacients (though ultimately have never been marketed for this indication), and trilostane was formerly used to inhibit corticosteroid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The ACTH {{stimulation}} test {{does not}} distinguish between primary and secondary hypoadrenocorticism, or adrenocortical destruction caused by <b>mitotane</b> overdose. Differentiation between primary and secondary hypoadrenocorticism {{can be made by}} periodically measuring serum electrolytes, baseline endogenous ACTH, or possibly serum or plasma aldosterone during the ACTH stimulation test. While most corticosteroid drugs will invalidate the results of an ACTH test, dexamethasone may be used {{in the event of an}} Addison's emergency without fear of compromising the results of the test.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, analogues of amphenone B {{with reduced}} {{toxicity}} and improved specificity were developed. One {{of the most}} potent of these was metyrapone (2-methyl-1,2-di(pyridin-3-yl)propan-1-one), a selective inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase, which was selected for clinical development and was eventually approved and marketed in 1958 as a diagnostic agent for Cushings syndrome. Another was <b>mitotane</b> (o,p-DDD, or 1,1-(dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane), an inhibitor of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme {{and to a lesser}} extent of other steroidogenic enzymes, which additionally has selective and direct cytotoxic effects on the adrenal glands similarly to p,p-DDD, and was introduced in 1960 for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. Aminoglutethimide (3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione), which was originally introduced as an anticonvulsant in 1960, is closely related structurally to amphenone B, and following its introduction, was found to cause adrenal insufficiency in patients due to inhibition of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and suppression of corticosteroid production. The drug was subsequently repurposed for use in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and Cushings syndrome.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Mitotane</b> {{represents}} the mainstay medical treatment for metastatic, inoperable or recurrent adrenocortical carcinoma. Besides the well-known adverse events, <b>mitotane</b> therapy is associated also with endocrinological effects, including sexual and reproductive dysfunction. The majority of male patients undergoing adjuvant <b>mitotane</b> therapy show {{a picture of}} hypogonadism, characterized by low free testosterone and high sex hormone binding globulin levels and unmodified LH concentrations. Since <b>mitotane</b> {{has been shown to}} have direct pituitary effects, we investigated whether <b>mitotane</b> may influence both cell viability and function of gonadotroph cells in the settings of two pituitary cell lines. We found that <b>mitotane</b> reduces cell viability, induces apoptosis, modifies cell cycle phase distribution and secretion of gonadotroph cells. The present data strengthen previous evidence showing a direct <b>mitotane</b> effect at pituitary level and represent a possible explanation of the lack of LH increase following decrease in free testosterone in patients undergoing adjuvant <b>mitotane</b> therapy...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{patients}} with adrenocortical cancer {{were treated with}} low doses of <b>mitotane</b> (2 - 3 g daily) while monitoring drug plasma levels. When the <b>mitotane</b> concentrations reached the therapeutic range (defined as <b>mitotane</b> plasma levels between 14 - 20 microg/mL), a dose reduction was performed to avoid toxicity. Thereafter, the <b>mitotane</b> dose was tailored according to plasma levels. A progressive increase in plasma <b>mitotane</b> concentrations was observed during treatment, and a highly significant linear correlation was found between plasma drug levels and the total <b>mitotane</b> dose. The therapeutic threshold was reached in all patients after 3 - 5 months and a total <b>mitotane</b> dose of 283 - 387 g/days (median, 363). The duration of treatment was 8 - 40 months (median, 9). Toxicity was manageable {{in all but one}} patient, who discontinued treatment. It is therefore possible to design a standard low dose schedule, e. g. 3 g/daily for about 3 - 4 months with following dose adjustments guided by the monitoring of plasma <b>mitotane</b> levels. This approach is able to provide therapeutic <b>mitotane</b> concentrations and limit the unwanted effects. The present data provide a rationale to change the approach to <b>mitotane</b> treatment in {{patients with}} adrenocortical carcinoma from high dose to low dose regimens...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mitotane</b> {{therapy is}} {{associated}} with many side effects, including thyroid function perturbations mimicking central hypothyroidism, possibly due to laboratory test interference or pituitary direct effects of <b>mitotane.</b> Therefore, we aimed at investigating whether increasing concentrations of <b>mitotane</b> in the therapeutic range might interfere with thyroid hormone assays and evaluate the effects of <b>mitotane</b> on a mouse TSH- producing pituitary cell line.

40|$|Introduction: Adrenocortical {{carcinoma}} (ACC) is {{an aggressive}} tumor {{with a short}} life expectancy and severe impact on quality of life. Due to the rarity of ACC progress {{in the development of}} treatment options beyond surgery has been limited. Areas covered: Postoperative treatment with <b>mitotane</b> for adjuvant purposes is currently recommended in many expert centers for patients at elevated risk of recurrence. Lacking data from prospective trials, evidence in favor of adjuvant <b>mitotane</b> comes from retrospective studies that have shown a benefit in recurrence-free survival in treated patients. The management of patients with recurrent and metastatic disease is challenging and the prognosis is often poor. <b>Mitotane</b> monotherapy may be used in patients with a low tumor burden and/or less aggressive disease, while cytotoxic chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for progressing tumors. No effective target therapy emerged from preclinical studies. Expert opinion: At our center, adjuvant <b>mitotane</b> treatment is recommended in all patients bearing ACC at high risk of recurrence. Patients with low-risk tumors are encouraged to enter the ADIUVO trial. A monitored <b>mitotane</b> approach is used trying to reach and maintain a <b>mitotane</b> level of 14 - 20 mg/l. For treatment of advanced ACC, patients are stratified according to their prognostic factors and consequently apply <b>mitotane</b> or <b>mitotane</b> plus etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin. In a number of patients, who are elderly or present with impaired clinical conditions, a simplified scheme with <b>mitotane</b> and cisplatin was chosen...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mitotane</b> is {{currently}} employed as adjuvant therapy {{as well as}} in the medical treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. It was previously demonstrated that <b>mitotane</b> potentiates chemotherapeutic drugs cytotoxicity in cancer cells displaying chemoresistance due to P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux pump involved in cancer multidrug resistance. The majority of ACC expresses high levels of P-gp and is highly chemoresistent. The aim of our study was to explore in vitro whether <b>mitotane,</b> at concentrations lower than those currently reached in vivo, may sensitize ACC cells to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin and whether this effect is due to a direct action on P-gp.

40|$|International audienceMitotane (o,p'DDD), {{the most}} {{effective}} drug in adrenocortical carcinoma, concentrates into the mitochondria and impacts mitochondrial functions. To address the molecular mechanisms of <b>mitotane</b> action and to identify its potential target, metabolomic and lipidomic approaches as well as imaging analyses were employed in human adrenocortical H 295 R cells allowing identification of Mitochondria-Associated Membranes dysfunction as a critical impact of <b>mitotane.</b> Study of intracellular energetic metabolites by NMR spectroscopy showed that <b>mitotane</b> significantly decreased aspartate while concomitantly increased glutamate content in a time-and concentration-dependent manner. Such alterations were very likely linked to the previously described, mitotane-induced respiratory chain defect. Lipidomic studies of intracellular and intramitochondrial phospholipids revealed that <b>mitotane</b> exposure markedly reduced the phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylethanolamine ratio, indicative of a dysfunction of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase located in Mitochondria-Associated Membranes. Expression levels of Mitochondria-Associated Membranes proteins phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, DRP 1, ATAD 3 A or TSPO were greatly reduced by <b>mitotane</b> as assessed by western blot analyses. <b>Mitotane</b> exposure markedly altered endogenous Mitochondria-Associated Membranes integrity and reduced the magnitude of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum interactions as demonstrated by high resolution deconvolution microscopy and quantification. Finally, we showed that PK 11195, a pharmacological inhibitor of the cholesterol translocator TSPO, embedded in Mitochondria-Associated Membranes, exerts a synergetic effect with <b>mitotane</b> in inducing Mitochondria-Associated Membranes disruption, apoptosis and in inhibiting steroid secretion. Altogether, our results demonstrate Mitochondria-Associated Membranes dysfunction in H 295 R cells treated with <b>mitotane</b> and that TSPO inhibition significantly potentiates <b>mitotane</b> antitumoral and antisecretory actions in vitro.
