He began as an assistant in a Civil Court and also began on his journalist career. In El Diario del Hogar newspaper he had a regular article called Desde mi mesa (From <b>my</b> <b>table),</b> which he signed as «La Corcadiere». Even though he was doing well for himself, he was not satisfied and joined public service.|$|E

The video prompts Aaron {{to return to}} Los Angeles in search of Christian. Upon arriving at Christian's apartment, Aaron is heartbroken when a stranger answers the door. Thinking that Christian has returned to his party boy ways and moved on, and having nowhere else to go, Aaron {{makes his way to}} Lila's restaurant, having befriended the owner while on missionary work after her life partner died. Christian, who happens to be working there, comes out and is overjoyed to see Aaron alive. They reconcile and later celebrate Thanksgiving with Christian's co-workers.

500|$|Although Paul Oscar's family {{encouraged}} {{his musical}} talent, his {{parents did not}} get along with each other, and he was bullied by his schoolmates. Paul Oscar recalled: [...] "My nickname was Little Palli, and Palli was chubby, nerdy, someone who never got jokes right, who was afraid of other men." [...] At age 13, {{he realized that he}} found men attractive, and came out to his [...] family at 16. [...] "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though my father did raise his voice. On the second day, and the third, and the fourth, there was this terrible silence. They treated me like an alien." [...] However, his mother was supportive. She said: [...] "If Páll has the talent to fall in love, he should nurture that talent. And he has as much a right to sit down at <b>my</b> <b>table</b> with his partner as anybody else does with their partner." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{comic book}} writer Stan Lee as himself. In John Ortved's book , Lee {{stated that he}} attended the episode's table read, and {{was impressed with the}} size and quality of the creative staff, who all sat around the conference table. Lee recalled in 2009, [...] "Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife." [...] Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like <b>my</b> <b>table</b> manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot. But hey one lives in hope." [...] The voice actor who plays Angry Dad in the episode was portrayed by Dan Castellaneta, who also does the voice for Homer among other characters in the series. The design of the character is also based on Castellaneta.|$|E
500|$|He then {{quotes a}} Mr. Townson's {{account of how}} crossbills feed on pine cones, {{inserting}} their beaks between the scales and then forcing them sideways, opening the cone. Yarrell then immediately returns to anatomy, describing in detail (nearly a page) how the tongue is used to extract the seed from between the cone scales. Only then does he return to Mr. Townson, quoting him as saying [...] "The degree of the lateral power is surprising, and they are fond of exercising it for amusement; they are, therefore, not a little mischievous. My pets would often come to <b>my</b> <b>table</b> whilst I was writing, and carry off my pencils... and tear them to pieces in a minute." [...] Yarrell then adds an observation of his own, and contradicts an opinion of a famous scientist: [...] "Notwithstanding Buffon's assertion to the contrary, they can pick up and eat the smallest seeds... so perfect and useful is this singular instrument." [...] He goes on to criticise Buffon's description of the crossbill's beak as [...] "an error and defect of Nature, and a useless deformity" [...] as [...] "an erroneous and hasty conclusion". Yarrell concludes by writing [...] "I have never met with a more interesting, or more beautiful example, of the adaptation of means to an end, than {{is to be found}} in the beak, the tongue, and their muscles, in the Crossbill".|$|E

500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around <b>my</b> <b>table,</b> Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E

The Australian novelist Patrick White described the first two volumes as [...] "amongst the wonders of the world". Director Jane Campion and screenwriter Laura Jones adapted the trilogy for television broadcast. It was eventually released as an award-winning feature film, An Angel at <b>My</b> <b>Table.</b> Actresses Kerry Fox, Alexia Keogh and Karen Fergusson portrayed the author at various ages. Frame's autobiographies sold better than any of her previous publications, and Campion's successful film adaptation of the texts introduced a new generation of readers to her work. These successes increasingly pushed Frame into the public eye.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Gifted, a {{novel by}} New Zealand {{academic}} and former Frame biographer Patrick Evans, was published and subsequently shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers' Prize. The story is a fictionalised account {{of the relationship between}} Janet Frame and Frank Sargeson during her time living as a guest on his Takapuna property in 1955–56 – an era recounted in a number of works by Frame and her contemporaries and dramatised in Campion's film, An Angel At <b>My</b> <b>Table</b> (1990). In 2013, Evans' novel was adapted for the stage, premiering at the Christchurch Arts Festival on 22 August 2013, followed by extended tour of New Zealand's north and south islands. While garnering positive critical reviews, the promotion and staging of the production drew fierce criticism from Frame's literary executor and niece, Pamela Gordon, who maintained it [...] "was designed to demean Frame." [...] Gordon, who has also criticised Campion's film for inaccuracies in its portrayal of Frame, asserted that Evans' theatrical adaptation presented an unfaithful view of her famous relative. Festival organiser Philip Tremewan, defended the play, while director Conrad Newport maintained that Gordon was [...] "overprotective of [...] legacy." [...] Evans generally avoided the controversy, stating, [...] "I have publicised her work and popularised it for two to three generations of students. In Gifted, the play and novel, you only {{have to look at the}} title to see what my attitude is. I really don't think I have anything to apologise for." ...|$|E
