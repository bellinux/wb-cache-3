40|$|An {{automated}} control system is disclosed {{that is particularly}} adapted for use in regulating urban traffic flow. The system includes a central control facility linked with a plurality of remote terminals over a unitary communication channel, which is preferably equivalent to a voice grade, non-compensated telephone line. The central control facility includes a computer coupled through interface equipment with a <b>master</b> <b>transceiver.</b> The <b>master</b> <b>transceiver</b> couples the computer and interface equipment with the communication channel. Each of the remote terminals, which are coupled to the communication channel in parallel, party line fashion, includes a remote transceiver coupled through interface equipment to a traffic control device, such as a signal light. An emergency vehicle locator may also be included in each remote terminal. Vehicle detectors may be coupled to the communication channel through the remote terminals or through separate remote transceivers to provide a measure of traffic flow parameters.

40|$|A {{prototype}} wireless data-acquisition {{system has}} been developed as a potential replacement for a wired data-acquisition system heretofore used in testing rocket engines. The traditional use of wires to connect sensors, signal-conditioning circuits, and data acquisition circuitry is time-consuming and prone to error, especially when, {{as is often the}} case, many sensors are used in a test. The system includes one master and multiple slave nodes. The master node communicates with a computer via an Ethernet connection. The slave nodes are powered by rechargeable batteries and are packaged in weatherproof enclosures. The master unit and each of the slave units are equipped with a time-modulated ultra-wide-band (TMUWB) radio transceiver, which spreads its RF energy over several gigahertz by transmitting extremely low-power and super-narrow pulses. In this prototype system, each slave node can be connected to as many as six sensors: two sensors can be connected directly to analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in the slave node and four sensors can be connected indirectly to the ADCs via signal conditioners. The maximum sampling rate for streaming data from any given sensor is about 5 kHz. The bandwidth of one channel of the TM-UWB radio communication system is sufficient to accommodate streaming of data from five slave nodes when they are fully loaded with data collected through all possible sensor connections. TM-UWB radios have a much higher spatial capacity than traditional sinusoidal wave-based radios. Hence, this TM-UWB wireless data-acquisition can be scaled to cover denser sensor setups for rocket engine test stands. Another advantage of TM-UWB radios is that it will not interfere with existing wireless transmission. The maximum radio-communication range between the master node and a slave node for this prototype system is about 50 ft (15 m) when the <b>master</b> and slave <b>transceivers</b> are equipped with small dipole antennas. The range can be increased by changing to larger antennas and/or greater transmission power. The battery life of a slave node ranges from about six hours during operation at full capacity to as long as three days when the system is in a "sleep" mode used to conserve battery charge during times between setup and rocket-engine testing. Batteries can be added to prolong operational lifetimes. The radio transceiver dominates the power consumption...|$|R
