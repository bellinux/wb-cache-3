30|$|Overall, {{this study}} {{examined}} the relationship between personality traits and entrepreneurial intent considering the influence of grit. Our study made a unique contribution in that we introduced grit as a potential mechanism through which personality traits relate to entrepreneurial intent. The results confirmed that there was a strong positive association between grit and entrepreneurial intentions. It was also found that grit shared a significant positive correlation with both agreeableness and conscientiousness. Conversely, there was a significant negative correlation between grit and neuroticism. When the sample was segmented into high and low grit participants, the high grit participants emerged as having significantly higher <b>means</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> entrepreneurial intent than their counterparts in the low grit group. We also found that in comparison with the low grit group, high grit participants had higher <b>means</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> agreeableness and conscientiousness, and lower <b>means</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> neuroticism. Lastly, the data indicated that grit fully mediated the predictive effect of conscientious and neuroticism on entrepreneurial intent.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{primary purpose}} of the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of peer presence upon the health-related physical fitness test scores of college students. A total of 312 undergraduate college students, 156 males and 156 females, 18 through 29 years of age, randomly selected from the physical education activity lists at Oregon State University were used in this study. The subjects were divided equally into three groups and randomly assigned to one of the following methods of testing: method A coacting; method B, audience; and method C, individual. In the coacting group, four subjects of the same sex were tested at the same time. In the audience group, subjects were tested individually in the presence of four peers, 2 males and 2 females. Subjects in the third group, method C, were tested alone without the presence of an audience or co-actors. The dependent variables were three test items from American Alliance for Health Physical Education Recreation and Dance, Health-Related Physical Fitness Test (1980). The test items included were: 1) the twelve-minute-run-and-walk test, as a measure of cardiovascular endurance, 2) sit-up test for 60 seconds, as a measure of muscular strength and muscular endurance, and 3) sit and reach test, as a measure of flexibility. A two by three analysis of variance fixed model was used as the statistical tool to test the null hypotheses. An alpha level of. 05 was established. The results of this study indicated that there was a significant difference between the male and female health-related physical fitness test scores for college students. Male mean scores were greater than the female <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> the twelve-minute-run-and-walk test and the sit-up test; however, female mean scores were greater than the male <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> the sit and reach test.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{number of}} steps taken per day (steps/day) {{provides}} a reliable and valid outcome of free-living walking behavior in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: This study examined the clinical meaningfulness of steps/day using the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) value across stages representing the developing impact of MS. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of de-identified data from 15 investigations totaling 786 persons with MS and 157 healthy controls. All participants provided demographic information and wore an accelerometer or pedometer during the waking hours of a 7 -day period. Those with MS further provided real-life, health, and clinical information and completed the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale- 12 (MSWS- 12) and Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale. MCID estimates were based on regression analyses and analysis of variance for between group differences. RESULTS: The mean MCID from self-report scales that capture subtle changes in ambulation (1 -point change in PDSS scores and 10 -point change in MSWS- 12 scores) was 779 steps/day (14 % of <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>for</b> MS sample); the mean MCID for clinical/health outcomes (MS type, duration, weight status) was 1, 455 steps/day (26 % of <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>for</b> MS sample); real-life anchors (unemployment, divorce, assistive device use) resulted in a mean MCID of 2, 580 steps/day (45 % of <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>for</b> MS sample); and the MCID for the cumulative impact of MS (MS vs. control) was 2, 747 steps/day (48 % of <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>for</b> MS sample). CONCLUSION: The change in motion sensor output of ~ 800 steps/day appears to represent a lower-bound estimate of clinically meaningful change in free-living walking behavior in interventions of MS...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Residency program {{directors}} are still exploring means {{to teach and}} evaluate ACGME core competencies. Finding simple means to reconcile ACGME core competencies with daily encounters offers a unique opportunity. Reflective writing through narratives may be the answer to simple and affordable means to achieve such goals. Methods To investigate the educational value of reflective writing, we conducted a prospective, randomized, cross-over pilot study among family practice residency program residents. The intervention group {{was introduced to the}} educational intervention. During the intervention, each narrative was analyzed by the authors, sentence by sentence, helping the learners spot ACGME core competencies. A week later, both groups were given five preselected narratives (test narratives) to analyze and identify what ACGME core competencies were reflected. A week later, the control group was subjected to the same intervention to comply with the cross-over design of the study. Data were then collected and a statistical analysis was completed. Results Nine learners were randomized into the control group and ten were randomized into the intervention group. Each learner analyzed ten sentences within the five test-narratives. The <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>for</b> each learner across the ten sentences was calculated. The grand <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>for</b> each group was calculated. The grand <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>for</b> the control group was 58. 75 (SD 13. 4). The grand <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>for</b> the intervention group was 69. 90 (SD 15. 8).
