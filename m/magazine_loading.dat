2500|$|Numbers of Lee–Enfield rifles were {{converted}} to [...]22 calibre training rifles, in order to teach cadets and new recruits the various aspects of shooting, firearms safety, and marksmanship at a markedly reduced cost per round. Initially, rifles {{were converted}} from obsolete Magazine Lee–Metford and Magazine Lee–Enfield rifles but from the First World War onwards SMLE rifles were used instead. These were known as [...]22 Pattern 1914 Short Rifles during The First World War and Rifle, No. 2 Mk. IV from 1921 onwards. They were generally single-shot affairs, originally using Morris tubes chambered for cheap [...]22L cartridge and some larger types, circa 1907. Some were later modified with special adaptors to enable <b>magazine</b> <b>loading.</b> In 1914, Enfield produced complete [...]22 barrels and bolts specifically for converting [...]303 units, and these soon became the most common conversion. A five-round [...]22 cal 'Parker-Hiscock' magazine was also developed and in service for {{a relatively short period}} during the later period of the First World War, but was subsequently withdrawn from issue due to reliability problems with its quite complicated loading and feeding mechanism. No. 2 Mk. IV rifles are externally identical to a [...]303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifle, the only difference being the [...]22 calibre barrel, empty magazine case, bolthead and extractor which have been modified to fire [...]22 calibre rimfire cartridges.|$|E

50|$|The RCA tape {{cartridge}} (also {{known as the}} <b>Magazine</b> <b>Loading</b> Cartridge) is a magnetic tape audio format {{that was designed to}} offer stereo quarter-inch reel-to-reel tape recording quality in a convenient format for the consumer market. It was introduced in 1958, following four years of development. This timing coincided with the launch of the stereophonic phonograph record. It was introduced to the market by RCA in 1958.|$|E
50|$|The Type 100 and Type 1 weapons {{offer the}} {{advantage}} of two guns being mounted in the space occupied by one gun of the same size, thus saving weight in the gun and mount, and space in the plane. A small ammunition supply making frequent <b>magazine</b> <b>loading</b> necessary is a disadvantage, partially because {{of the advantages of}} the double barrel principle. This doubling concept is also used for the Type 89 machine gun and MG 81Z machine gun.|$|E
50|$|The Škorpion {{uses the}} 7.65×17mmSR Browning Short (.32 ACP) pistol cartridge, {{which was the}} {{standard}} service cartridge of the Czechoslovak security forces. It uses two types of double-column curved box magazines: a short 10-round <b>magazine</b> (<b>loaded</b> weight—0.15 kg) or a 20-round capacity <b>magazine</b> (<b>loaded</b> weight—0.25 kg). The bolt remains locked open after the last cartridge from the magazine has been fired and can be snapped back forward by pulling the cocking handle knob slightly to the rear.|$|R

50|$|To {{eliminate}} the nuisance of tape-threading, various manufacturers introduced cartridges {{that held the}} tape inside a metal or plastic housing to eliminate handling. Most were intended only for low-fidelity voice recording in dictation machines. The first tape cartridge designed for general consumer use, including music reproduction, was the Sound Tape or <b>Magazine</b> <b>Loading</b> Cartridge (RCA tape cartridge), introduced in 1958 by RCA. Prerecorded stereophonic music cartridges were available, and blank cartridges {{could be used to}} make recordings at home, but the format failed to gain popularity.|$|E
50|$|It used a {{straight}} 50-round magazine containing 9×19mm Parabellum cartridges (special pouches were produced to hold three magazines each) which {{fit into a}} brass magazine housing from the left, with spent cartridges ejected on the right. It was interchangeable with the shorter 32-round Sten magazine. Stripping of cartridges into the magazine was aided by a catch {{on the top of}} the receiver. A <b>magazine</b> <b>loading</b> tool was needed to load both 32- and 50-round magazines more easily. One of the two magazine pouches had a special pocket on the front for this loader.|$|E
5000|$|The L39A1 was a target-shooting variant {{produced}} for military full-bore shooting teams. It {{was similar to}} the L42A1, except it was fitted with Parker-Hale target tunnel front and micrometer-adjustable rear sights in lieu of the telescopic sight, and the butt had a curved pistol grip similar to the butt used on the No.8 [...]22 rifle. Since <b>magazine</b> <b>loading</b> was not required, the L39A1 had a [...]303 British magazine, the follower of which served as a loading platform for single shot use. The barrel was the same hammer-forged, heavy 7.62×51mm NATO version fitted to the L42A1.|$|E

50|$|The M/50 {{is made of}} stamped sheet metal. It is an open bolt design {{which means}} it fires when the bolt is in the locked back open {{position}} with a fixed firing pin. The M/46-M/50 share a unique design: the firearm is stamped from 2 pieces of sheet metal which are shaped with an integral rear pistol grip and magazine housing. The two pieces fit together like a clam shell with the hinge {{at the rear of}} the pistol grip. The firearm is held together with a barrel locking nut which is threaded onto the fore section of the two receiver halves. The pistol grip is hollow, providing storage space for a <b>magazine</b> <b>loading</b> tool.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the rifle took another major step {{forward with the}} {{introduction}} of breech-loading rifles. These rifles also used brass cartridges. The brass cartridge had been introduced earlier; however, it was not widely adopted for various reasons. In the U.S. Army, generals thought their soldiers would waste ammunition, so they kept muzzle-loading black powder rifles until after the American Civil War. The introduction of breech loaders meant that the rifling of a weapon was no longer damaged when it was loaded, and reloading was a much faster process. Shortly afterwards, <b>magazine</b> <b>loading</b> rifles were introduced, which further increased the weapons' rate of fire. From this period (c. 1870) on, the musket was obsolete in modern warfare.|$|E
5000|$|Contrary to some {{speculation}} FN did not contract or {{produce the}} Argentine conversion of SAFN 1949 rifles from 7.65×53mm Argentine to 7.62mm NATO. While FN did receive {{and then later}} deliver an order for a conversion of a single rifle in March 1967 the remaining armory stock of the Argentine rifles were converted domestically by Metalúrgica Centro a company formerly known as Fábrica de armas Halcón. Metalúrgica Centro provided and installed in each rifle a new barrel in 7.62mm NATO, modified each ejector, and modified each trigger guard {{to take a new}} 20 round detachable box magazine. The converted rifles were provided with proprietary 20 round detachable box magazines manufactured by Metalúrgica Centro to fit the SAFN 1949 rifle conversions. The 20 round steel magazines are proprietary but were made to share the <b>magazine</b> <b>loading</b> charger with the FN FAL rifle used by the Argentine Army. [...] These chargers are the same as for the Mauser Kar-98k, and thus not interchangeable with standard NATO stripper clips.|$|E
50|$|Shotgun speedloaders are {{slightly}} more complex, since shotgun magazines load from the breech. Shotgun speedloaders generally require a special bracket be mounted near the <b>magazine</b> <b>loading</b> port of the gun; many models mount by replacing existing pins {{that hold the}} trigger group in the receiver, and so can be installed easily without permanent modification of the gun. This bracket serves to hold {{the end of the}} speedloader tube in the correct position to feed the rounds out of the speedloader and into the magazine. The speedloaders themselves consist of a plastic tube containing a slot cut in it, and a plunger that rides in the slot and that forces the rounds into the magazine. Capacity is usually four or five rounds of 2-inch (70 mm) length shells. Gravity is not suitable for operating these, as the rounds must be forced into the magazine against the pressure of the magazine spring. Shotgun speedloaders are most commonly encountered in action shooting sports like International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) shotgun competitions.|$|E
