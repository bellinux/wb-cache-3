[...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] ""diminished sequel, a brute-force enterprise" [...] {{and said it was}} an example of [...] "what happens when movies are confused with sandwich shops as franchise opportunities". The Minneapolis Star Tribune characterized Ratner's approach as [...] "Forget subtlety! Let's blow things up!"

[...] Foreshadowing , Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Last stand? <b>My</b> <b>ass.</b> Billed as the climax of a trilogy, the third and weakest chapter in the X-Men series is a blatant attempt to prove there is still life in the franchise.

I don't get knocked on <b>my</b> <b>ass</b> like I did the first time I heard TAYF, but the catchy repetitiveness is all there." [...] AllMusic reviewer Corey Apar called the album's name [...] "an apt title for a super-tight, aggressive album that falls somewhere between their last two, tapping the heartfelt vigor of Tell All Your Friends in order to give Where You Want to Be a swift, square kick in the pants." [...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press that the band [...] " [...] spot-on when they floor it or put it in park; it’s the sputtering along in-between that hurts the record." [...] Despite not mastering [...] "the art of the middle ground," [...] they take [...] "immense leaps forward musically on their third album."
