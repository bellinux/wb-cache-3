500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E

[...] He appears to have given lessons to amateurs also; a letter from a young lady being [...] "finished" [...] in London in 1595 says: [...] "For my drawing, I take an hour in the afternoon...
