2500|$|Mama Lucy {{had given}} Bobby Duran, {{representative}} from Taos, {{a job in}} her restaurant {{when he was at}} Highlands. He said, [...] "You gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> when I needed it the most. I never could have made it without you." [...] Lucy Lopez died on 31 May 1994 at the age of 80. The impact of the Mama Lucy Gang on state politics in the 1970s is still remembered.|$|E
2500|$|When he was 13 in 1968, Jobs {{was given}} a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an {{electronics}} project: [...] "He didn't know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters...well, assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It didn't matter; I was in heaven." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Farber's {{nomination}} proceedings, Senator Gerald Cardinale, a Republican from Bergen County, directed some of {{the most}} pointed queries at Farber. [...] "Can you tell me how many times you've gotten speeding tickets or is it an isolated incident?" [...] Cardinale asked. Farber apologized for her driving history but offered no specifics. She acknowledged some personal difficulties with driving and added,"...I thank the governor for giving <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> with a driver." [...] Cardinale asked Farber about the bench warrants; state records show warrants were issued against her in 1996 and 2003.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he sighed. [...] "They {{talk about}} giving <b>me</b> <b>a</b> home <b>job</b> and I don't think I could stick it. Are you {{walking in the}} Park this morning, Miss Conyers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm here, and you'll {{smash the}} boat {{if you try}} to send me back," [...] he said. [...] "You see, I {{suspected}} what you were getting after when you put <b>me</b> at <b>a</b> <b>job</b> it was awkward to leave." ...|$|R
2500|$|After Ellison {{retired from}} cricket, his {{teaching}} qualification came in handy, as he said: [...] "I {{never thought of}} teaching until I retired and had a phonecall {{out of the blue}} offering <b>me</b> <b>a</b> teaching <b>job.</b> And now I'm a housemaster." ...|$|R
2500|$|Prior to {{entering}} college, Robinson held {{a short-term}} job as shoeshine man before {{getting a job}} as warehouse personnel. [...] After finishing his college degree, Robinson {{was unable to find}} a suitable career in his hometown of Gulfport. Robinson attributed this to racial discrimination as many of the local garages were under white ownership; speaking to his father, he said, [...] " [...] give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> sweeping, filling gas tanks, changing tires, or washing, but I'm an engine man... When I talk to [...] about automotive science they smile, look at each other, and then look at me like I belong behind a mule and a plow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Javed Akhtar narrates: [...] "Kamal sahab gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> {{and helped}} me. My salary was Rs.50 {{and even in}} the 60s, you could not rent a house with that amount of money. I used to sleep {{in a corner of the}} studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn't have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in the drawers. There were many {{cupboards}} filled with costumes of Pakeezah; sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened a drawer and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in my hand was that of Meena Kumari! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money, no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and for this, I will be always thankful to Meena-ji." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Nat Poole talking. I am {{up here in}} Clayton--in the First National Bank. You know {{my father}} got <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> here last week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One man to want such {{a monstrous}} house as that! Well, 'tis a fine place. See, there's the carpenters' shops, the timber-yard, and everything, {{as if it}} were a little town. Perhaps Berta may hire <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>job</b> now and then.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Carrie laughed. [...] "I don't know if you're nice or not. Anyhow, I had the money; I'd been clerking {{for a time}} at the Woolsworth {{store and}} they had given <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good <b>job.</b> Why shouldn't I send Jake the money I didn't know how to spend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose I'm {{heavy enough}} {{and you have}} given <b>me</b> <b>an</b> easy <b>job.</b> It's curious, but not long since I told Harry I'd see him out if he wanted help and {{yesterday}} he hinted he'd like a partner for his voyage South. In a way, of course, I don't want to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most a week now, I guess. I didn't come till {{day before}} yesterday. I didn't have nothin' to do an' they give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> cookin' an' like that," [...] {{returned}} the man.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{left the}} store," [...] said Drummond. [...] "Thought I'd locate in Winnipeg. One has better chances {{in the big}} cities, and I {{reckoned}} you could find <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job.</b> Anyhow, I'll need some money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't say it's impossible," [...] Jake rejoined. [...] "But {{beginning}} {{work before}} breakfast is bad enough, without going on after dinner. Understand that I don't question your authority to find <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> at night; it's your object {{that makes me}} kick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, don't {{think about}} it," [...] echoed the doctor. [...] "My wife is quite right. Don't think about it. But, dear <b>me,</b> what <b>a</b> <b>job</b> I had to persuade your {{guardian}} {{to let you}} go. I should have given it up in despair--I really should--if I had not known that you had set your heart upon it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{imagine you}} are giving <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bigger <b>job</b> than you know. If Festing {{has taken the}} {{railroad}} contract, he'll probably stop until he had carried it out. Now I don't imagine I'd find it amusing to loaf about and watch him work; for one thing, it's pretty cold in the ranges after the snow comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh <b>me,</b> what <b>a</b> <b>job!</b> I {{shall have}} to work at it every day till next Saturday, for the paste alone will take all the wits I've got. I was rash, but I spoke without thinking, and wanted to do {{something}} really fine. We can't be shown about things, so I must blunder along as well as I can," [...] groaned Edith.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} up my mind to change them. But I'm going to do it in New York. Mr. Pett is going to give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in his office. I am going to start at the bottom and work my way still further down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I {{never tried}} it before," [...] Albert {{was saying to}} Maud, at their end of the table. [...] "Hartley offered <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> and as I needed money, I came. I don't know what he's {{going to do with}} me, now I'm here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose you}} can do anything," [...] Granet replied, [...] "but I am going to spend to-day and to-morrow, too, if necessary, in this place, bothering every one I ever heard of. You have some influence, I know. Get <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> out of this country." ...|$|E
50|$|One day a {{woman called}} Paddy Brosnan went to Smithfields {{to buy some}} meat. My dad asked Paddy if there was <b>a</b> <b>job</b> for <b>me.</b> She was the {{secretary}} to Tom Hopkinson, the editor of Picture Post. She said I could work for her as an office boy. On 1 April 1951, {{at the age of}} 15, I started work. Picture Post carried staff writers and about eight staff photographers. I walked around the office delivering post and doing odd errands for the staff. One day I was in the photographers rest room, where they had their lockers, when the picture editor Harry Deverson, came in. He said to one photographer, Come and talk to <b>me</b> about <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in Switzerland, and to another photographer, Talk to <b>me</b> about <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in Tokyo. I had rarely left Clerkenwell, certainly never been abroad. My ears started buzzing, and it was at that precise moment I decided that this photography game was for me. I soon started assisting the photographers.|$|R
60|$|LEMMY. Lawd! I {{could begin}} almost anywhere. Why, every month abaht, there's <b>a</b> cove turns <b>me</b> aht of <b>a</b> <b>job</b> 'cos I daon't do just wot 'e likes. They'd 'ave to go. I tell yer stryte--the Temple wants cleanin' up.|$|R
6000|$|... "With me! No,--not with <b>me.</b> I had <b>a</b> <b>job</b> of {{business}} {{of my own}} which took me over to Paris. And has Phinny fled too? Poor Ratler! I shouldn't wonder if it isn't an asylum he's in before the session is over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm goin' {{into the}} Department. Mr. Davis an' {{the rest of}} Ninety-four's men have got <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> up at {{headquarters}} where I'll {{have a chance to}} learn all the business, an' then when I'm big enough, if my record is all right, I'll slip in for a fireman as easy as winkin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] was {{the dull}} answer, {{and then he}} flared out. [...] "Faith, it's your own fault for giving <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> of this kind. You knew me. You know that I am just a blunt, simple soldier--that my place is {{at the head of}} a regiment, not {{at the head of a}}n administration. You should have known that by putting me out of my proper element I was bound to get into trouble sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was wearing}} a pair of old gum-boots with one toe torn off, and my jacket was split right up the back. When I went up-town the next day, people looked at me suspiciously. The trade of the Province is pretty bad when you see men in Vancouver dressed as I was. The fact that sticks in my mind most clearly, however, is that on the {{following}} morning, when I'd arranged to see a man who might give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> Miss Hartley offered to sew up the tear for me. I was uncommonly glad to let her." ...|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, while I was dressing, {{the steward}} of {{my side of}} the ship came to me as usual to see what I wanted. But the first thing he said to <b>me</b> was--'Rather <b>a</b> bad <b>job,</b> sir--a {{passenger}} missing.' ...|$|R
50|$|Azim was {{a student}} of Dyal Singh College. His mother {{is a writer and}} his father is a painter. During college days, he used to do small <b>jobs</b> such as <b>a</b> {{promoter}} or a coordinator. He left college in second year to pursue a computer course, as he wanted to earn money as early as possible. The computer course helped <b>me</b> get <b>a</b> <b>job</b> with <b>an</b> IT firm. Later he moved to Mumbai, to pursue his acting career.|$|R
6000|$|... "Plenty to do. But I'm {{not paid}} for it. I walk {{a great number}} of blocks and jump into {{a great number of}} cars and dive into {{elevators}} and dive out again and open doors and say 'Good morning' when people tell <b>me</b> they haven't <b>a</b> <b>job</b> for <b>me.</b> My days are quite full, but my pocket-book isn't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is by far}} {{the best}} thing for the little chap {{whichever}} he may be, and {{you will be able to}} do a deal more for him than I ever could. My wife did not quite see the matter at first, but she has come round to my way of thinking. No, sir, we do not want to be paid," [...] as Captain Clinton was about to speak; [...] "as long as I am fit for service we want nothing. Some day, perhaps, when I get past service I may ask you to give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> as a lodge-keeper or some such post, where I can earn my living." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{try to be}} consistent," [...] Edgar told him. [...] "You see, I couldn't {{very well}} indulge in an {{occasional}} drink when I've undertaken to make those Sage Butte fellows abstainers. Anyhow, though you're by no means liberal in your view, you're practical people. As soon as I landed at Montreal, a pleasant young man, wearing a silver monogram came up to me, and offered me introductions to people who might find <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job.</b> Though I didn't want one, I was grateful; and when I told him I wasn't one of his flock, he said it didn't matter. That kind of thing makes a good impression." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} must have been four--five--well, quite a number of years after the hose episode. Probably you didn't observe that I wasn't still around, but we crept silently out of the {{neighbourhood}} round about that time and went to live in London." [...] His tone lost its lightness momentarily. [...] "My father died, you know, and that sort of broke things up. He didn't leave any too much money, either. Apparently we had been living on rather too expensive a scale during the time I knew you. At any rate, I was more or less up against it until your father got <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in an office in New York." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Temnikova {{released}} two disco singles, [...] "Begi" [...] and [...] "Taina", she did {{not continue}} her solo career, and did not release a solo album. She instead joined Serebro, a girl group formed by Fadeev. In an interview for the magazine In Style, in February 2008, Temnikova said: [...] "After Star Factory, Maxim Fadeev offered <b>me</b> <b>a</b> new <b>job.</b> He offered me to be lead singer in girl band. I decided to do it, and we together found second and third member". Olga Seryabkina and Marina Lizorkina also joined the group.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis good. An' {{likely it}} saves <b>me</b> fingers <b>a</b> dirty <b>job.</b> Vincent, man, the girl child which is woman grown slapes in Dawson this night. God help us, you an' me, but we'll niver hit again the pillow as clane an' pure as she! Vincent, {{a word to}} the wise: ye'll niver lay holy hand or {{otherwise}} upon her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Julian," [...] he said, [...] "I {{know you}} area {{bit of a}} cynic about espionage {{and that sort of}} thing. Of course, there has been a terrible lot of exaggeration, and heaps of fellows go gassing about secret service jobs, {{all the way up the}} coast from here to Scotland, who haven't the least idea what the thing means. But there is a little bit of it done, and in my humble way they find <b>me</b> <b>an</b> {{occasional}} <b>job</b> or two down here. I won't say that anything ever comes of our efforts--we're rather like the special constables of the secret service--but just occasionally we come across something suspicious." ...|$|R
