40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A {{design of}} a current-controlled {{variable}} resistor was attempted. It is a four-terminal device with two junctions, one of which serves as carrier injector to increase the carrier concentration in the bulk of a gold-doped silicon substrate. Then resistance of the bulk can be varied with different levels of injection. With small output voltage applied, a change of resistance was observed as predicted. The resistance change is slightly more than {{an order of magnitude}} with 20 MA as an upper limit of input current. However, when the output voltage increases, saturation occurs. A model was proposed to explain the observed phenomena. In the extent of <b>useful</b> <b>voltage</b> range, the resultant devices are comparable to JFET and MOSFET, which serve as voltage-controlled variable resistors. The work is only a preliminary study and no optimization was made...|$|R

We estimate, for a 12 V- 10 V step-down converter, an efficiency of 88 % and a power density of about 1. 3 mW/cm 2. This converter is useful in low power portable applications, where several efficient DC-DC converters are necessary to convert the battery voltage into the voltages required by the loads.

Previous research work about MEMS converters is not sufficiently developed; two modes of variable capacitor operation have been explored: bistable static mode and resonant mode. Both methods have focused on obtaining high voltages for specific applications while efficiencies were very low. Our new conversion approach presents zero voltage switching; therefore the efficiency is high as the switching losses are close to naught...|$|R

The electrochemical behavior of NbSe 3 in the battery electrolyte, i. e., 1. 5 M LiAsF 6 / 2 Me-THF is reported here.

The kinetic parameters for the reduction of NbSe 3 were evaluated from the ac and dc measurements. Finally, the structural change in NbSe 3 on lithiation during initial discharge which results in higher cell voltages and different electro-chemical response as compared to virgin NbSe 3 was identified to be a loss of crystallographic order, i. e., "amorphous by x-ray diffraction.

In {{order to better}} understand how the energetic performance of this technology can be improved, the various losses in the system should be quantified and characterized. This {{can be done by}} looking at the entropy generation in ED systems. In this paper, we implement an ED model based on the Maxwell-Stefan transport model, which is the closest model to fundamental equations. We study the sources of entropy generation at different salinities, and locate areas where possible improvements need to be made under different operating conditions. In addition, we study the effect of the channel height, membrane thickness, and cell-pair voltage on the specific rate of entropy generation. We express the second-law efficiency of ED as the product of current and voltage utilization rates, and study its variation with current density. Further, we define the <b>useful</b> <b>voltage</b> that is used beneficially for separation.

Several means of transportation including transportation by vehicle, rail and canal are evaluated.
