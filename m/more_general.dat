5|$|Although a {{conforming}} standard library implementation {{is allowed}} {{to assume that the}} allocator's A::pointer and A::const_pointer are simply typedefs for T* and T const*, library implementors are encouraged to support <b>more</b> <b>general</b> allocators.|$|E
5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered <b>more</b> <b>general</b> because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} {{when it is not}} possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} phylogenetic {{hypothesis that}} has gained substantial traction places Brancasaurus in the clade Leptocleididae, {{along with other}} leptocleidids including Leptocleidus itself, Vectocleidus, Umoonasaurus, Nichollssaura, and also possibly Hastanectes. This result has been recovered by the phylogenies of Benson et al., who have also noted a number of morphological traits which ally Brancasaurus with the <b>more</b> <b>general</b> Leptocleidia.|$|E

5|$|Angered by the French surrender, {{and unhappy}} with British {{policies}} that affected them, an Ottawa chief named Pontiac organized 18 Native American tribes that attacked British {{military and civilian}} settlements beginning in April 1763. The tribes captured eight British forts and forced the evacuation of two <b>more.</b> <b>General</b> Amherst ordered the 17th to Albany in June 1763 to assist in combating the outbreak of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the First Amendment: The Politics of Free Speech and Pluralism is a {{book about}} {{freedom of speech and}} the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, written by author Samuel Peter Nelson. It was {{published}} by Johns Hopkins University Press in 2005. In it, Nelson discusses how the <b>more</b> <b>general</b> notion of free speech differs from that specifically applied to the First Amendment in American law.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{commented that}} the book seemed to be aimed at fans of The Simpsons rather than a <b>more</b> <b>general</b> audience. Other criticisms {{included}} {{the simplicity of the}} writing and a lack of interesting stories. In 2004, Cartwright adapted the book into a one-woman show, which she has performed in the UK and North America, including at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the origin and descent of species, and their change over time.

Orders can be issued simultaneously to each General who in turn would relay them to their troops. Conveniently once that the positions of the joined armies have been set, the computer will make the best effort to keep the defined distance between groups.|$|R
5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs {{can be viewed}} as a special case of the far <b>more</b> <b>general</b> notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the first}} ideas leading to vector spaces {{can be traced}} back as far as the 17th century's {{analytic}} geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses <b>more</b> <b>general</b> objects than Euclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the substantive issues in the case, there was also <b>more</b> <b>general</b> historical and theoretical issues involved. During Justice McHugh's final years on the court, he and Justice Kirby expressed differing views on constitutional interpretation, and particularly {{on the role of}} international law and principles of human rights in that process. In this case, the two judges continued that debate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} epoch (1907–19), Noether dealt {{primarily}} with differential and algebraic invariants, beginning with her dissertation under Paul Gordan. Her mathematical horizons broadened, {{and her work}} became <b>more</b> <b>general</b> and abstract, as she became acquainted {{with the work of}} David Hilbert, through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, Ernst Sigismund Fischer. After moving to Göttingen in 1915, she produced her seminal work for physics, the two Noether's theorems.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>more</b> <b>general</b> {{case where}} the firm cannot price {{discriminate}} between domestic and foreign consumers {{the effects of a}} subsidy are less clear since both an expansion of exports and deterioration of terms of trade are present. However, Brender and Spencer show that starting out from the position of no subsidy, introducing a small subsidy can improve a country's welfare.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to extend {{the definition of the}} flow to <b>more</b> <b>general</b> inputs than curves, for instance by using rectifiable varifolds or the level set method. However, these extended definitions may allow parts of curves to vanish instantaneously or fatten into sets of nonzero area.|$|E
