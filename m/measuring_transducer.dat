40|$|Purpose. Objective is {{to create}} a {{moisture}} meter for non-polar liquid dielectrics with low volumetric moisture content of more than 10 ‑ 3 %. Methodology. Moisture measuring is based on dielcometric method. It is implemented as a resonant method of determining a capacitance <b>measuring</b> <b>transducer.</b> <b>Measuring</b> <b>transducer</b> capacitive type has a working and parasitic capacitance. It was suggested the definition of moisture on four of resonance frequencies: when the <b>measuring</b> <b>transducer</b> is turned off, one by one filled with air, «dry» and investigated liquid, to determine the parasitic capacitance of the measuring generator, and the parasitic capacitance of the <b>measuring</b> <b>transducer</b> and humidity. Measurement frequency was increased up to microwave range to increase the sensitivity. <b>Measuring</b> <b>transducer</b> with distributed parameters representing a step heterogeneous coaxial resonator is used by. This <b>measuring</b> <b>transducer</b> has a zero stray capacitance, because the potential electrode has a galvanic connection with an external coaxial electrode. Inductive ties loop is used to neglect parasitic capacitance of the measuring generator, and to increase the quality factor of the system. Measuring moisture is reduced to measuring the two frequencies of resonance frequency and «dry» and investigated liquid. Resonant characteristics transducer in a step inhomogeneous coaxial resonator have been investigated to determine the quality factor of filled with air and transformer oil, and experiments to measure the moisture content in transformer oil have been conducted. Results. <b>Measuring</b> <b>transducer</b> of distributed type is developed and researched – it is step inhomogeneous coaxial resonator. It has a smaller geometric length and larger scatter of the first and second resonant frequencies. Expression is obtained for determination of moisture on the basis of two resonant frequencies. The formula of the two frequencies to determine the moisture is correct. Resonant characteristics are obtained for <b>measuring</b> <b>transducer.</b> Its quality factor has been determined – it does not depend on what it is filled with air or oil. The moisture content in transformer oil for the amount of water to 10 - 3 % with an error of no more than 6. 7 % has been determined. Originality. It has been proposed to use of an inhomogeneous step coaxial resonator as a <b>measuring</b> <b>transducer.</b> Original high sensitive moisture meter for the fluid at rest and flowing fluid with low values of parasitic capacitances has been developed and researched. An original method of determining the moisture by measuring the two frequencies of resonance has been proposed and implemented. Practical value. This meter may be used to determine moisture in any of the non-polar liquid with high speed and accuracy. Moisture meter can be used in electrical engineering, aeronautical engineering, in the chemical and food industries...|$|E
