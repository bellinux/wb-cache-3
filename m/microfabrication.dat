5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} excimer lasers, {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and <b>microfabrication,</b> which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.|$|E
