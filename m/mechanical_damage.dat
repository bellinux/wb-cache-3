5|$|The {{life span}} of T. fluviatilis is 2–3 years. The age of a few snails was {{estimated}} to be 3.5 years. The mortality rate is low in summer. However, it is higher in winter because ice and storms can dislocate the substrate, which can result in <b>mechanical</b> <b>damage</b> to the snails.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef.

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigate}} the sensitiveness of Bishop's goutweed (Aegopodium podagraria L.) to <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages</b> {{in an experiment}} with artificial clipping. Based on personalobservations of A. podagraria during several years I hypothesise that i) A. podagraria indifference with other species, for example different species of grass have difficult to recoverfrom <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages</b> ii) in a site with several other species present A. podagraria willhave harder to recover from <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages</b> than in a pure stand iii) as purer a stand withA. podagraria is, the harder other species will have to establish after the removal of aboveground parts of A. podagraria. The main conclusion of this work is that mechanical damagehas {{a significant effect on}} the vegetation cover of A. podagraria. The experiment also provethat a high grade of monoculture favours the ability of A. podagraria to recover frommechanical damage. It could however not be proven that high grade of monoculture of A. podagraria puts constraints on the ability of other species to establish on plots where A. podagraria is removed...|$|R

5|$|Another sortie {{into the}} North Sea {{followed}} on 19–20 October. On 21 December, Nassau ran aground {{in the mouth}} of the Elbe. She was able to free herself, and repairs were effected in Hamburg at the Reihersteig Dockyard until 1 February 1917. The ship was part of the force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered <b>mechanical</b> <b>damage</b> and had to be towed back to port. Nassau, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlußstein, a planned occupation of Saint Petersburg. On 8 August, Nassau took on 250 soldiers in Wilhelmshaven and then departed for the Baltic. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August, and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.|$|E
5|$|Following Königs {{return from}} the Baltic, the ship was tasked with guard duties in the North Sea and with {{providing}} support for minesweepers. König returned to the Baltic on 22 December for further training, which lasted until 8 January 1918. Another round of exercises was conducted from 23 February to 11 March. On 20 April König steamed out to assist a German patrol that was engaged with British forces. The ship {{was part of the}} force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered <b>mechanical</b> <b>damage.</b> König was briefly grounded in the northern harbor of the island of Helgoland on 30 May. Two months later, on 31 July, König and the rest of IIISquadron covered a minesweeping unit in the North Sea. The ship then went to the Baltic for training on 7–18 August, after which König returned to the North Sea. König conducted her last exercise in the Baltic starting on 28 September; the maneuvers lasted until 1 October.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg was {{the last}} battlecruiser {{completed}} for the Imperial German Navy, and as such had a very short career. She was commissioned 10 May 1917, and was fully operational by 20 October 1917, too late to see any major action in World War I. On 17 November Hindenburg and Moltke, along with the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group, were acting as distant support for German minesweepers off the German coast when they were attacked by British battlecruisers. The raid was brief; by the time Hindenburg and Moltke arrived on the scene, the British ships had broken off the attack and withdrawn. Six days later, Hindenburg replaced Seydlitz as flagship of the IScouting Group. On 23 April 1918, the ship took part in an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea that attempted to intercept an Allied convoy. Moltke sustained <b>mechanical</b> <b>damage</b> while en route, and as a result, Vice Admiral Hipper decided to cancel the operation. On 11 August, Hipper was promoted to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced Hipper as {{the commander of the}} IScouting Group; he raised his flag on Hindenburg the following day.|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{the product}} quality of airbag fabrics is an {{important}} part in the manufacture of an airbag. Thereby the aim is to detect faults in the fabric early and to identify possible sources of error. In this paper, a special inspection method is presented that allows detecting <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages</b> that cannot be detected by previous used inspection systems. For that purpose the fabric is observed under a flat camera angle. Destroyed fiber sections, which express themselves in line-like structures in the images, are recognized by a custom image analysis method. Thus, the human inspector can be supported by the detection of difficult recognizable <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages</b> and a further step towards a hundred percent control of airbag fabrics is ensured...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{properties}} and aroma have been indicated {{as sources of}} information {{for the analysis of}} quality of fruits. Optical properties can be measured with several experimental arrangements and equipments that are often complex with result difficult to interpret. In recent years, a number of suggestions arose in the sensor community proposing the use of conventional computer peripheral devices as analytical instruments. Among them the combination of a computer screen and a webcam was demonstrated to be suitable to measure optical properties of materials. In this paper this arrangement is utilized to characterize the reflectance of apricot fruits that underwent different post-harvest treatment and <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages.</b> Optical measurements were complemented by aroma analysis with an electronic nose. The response of fruits to treatments was also monitored measuring CO 2 (indicator of respiration) and ethylene (indicator of ripening); both these parameters are known to be influenced by post-harvest treatment and <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages.</b> Results show that a computer screen-webcam combination and an electronic nose are both sensitive to <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages</b> of fruits devising their use, after due optimization, for routine fruit sorting.

40|$|Seed {{processing}} machines remove {{viable seeds}} from non-viable seeds and inert materials based on physical characteristics. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the effect of each processing machine alone on the physical and physiological qualities of the soybean seeds. Seed samples of two soybean cultivars - BMX Potência RR and NK 7059 RR - were collected from five machines separately: air-screen machine, spiral separator, size grader and gravity separator. The experimental design was a completely randomized factorial, varying with the equipment, with 20 replications. Samples were assessed by germination test, accelerated aging, viability and vigor by tetrazolium test (TZ), weathering damages (TZ class 3), <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages</b> (TZ 1 - 8) and (TZ 6 - 8), stink bug damages (TZ 1 - 8) and weight of one thousand seeds. The air-screen machine and the spiral separator did not contribute to improve physiological quality of seeds; the size grader concentrated <b>mechanical</b> <b>damages</b> in larger sizes and stink bug damages in smaller sizes. Gravity separators showed higher quality seeds at the upper part of the machine compared to intermediate and lower parts. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>damages</b> and stink bug damages can be reduced by gravity separator and weathering damages are not eliminated by any of the machines...|$|R
