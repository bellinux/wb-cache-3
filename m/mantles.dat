40|$|This study {{investigated}} the capacity for <b>mantle</b> regeneration in the pearl oyster Pinctada maxima. Oysters were anaesthetised with 2. 5  mL L- 1 prophylene phenoxetol prior {{to a piece of}} tissue (approximately 10  ×  30  mm 2) being excised from the ventral region of the <b>mantle.</b> In the first experiment, 56 oysters with mean (±SD) dorso-ventral measurement (DVM) of 125. 5  ±  8. 9  mm had tissue excised from either the right <b>mantle</b> lobe, left <b>mantle</b> lobe or both <b>mantle</b> lobes. Following a further three month period in suspended culture, oyster survival was recorded and two oysters were selected arbitrarily from each group to be sacrificed for histological examination of healed <b>mantle.</b> In the second experiment 36 oysters with mean (±SD) DVM of 151. 6  ±  13. 4  mm were used for excision of the distal part of the ventral region of the left <b>mantle</b> lobe. Two oysters were sampled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 120  h (5 days) after <b>mantle</b> excision, and then at 12, 24, 45, 72 and 90  d after <b>mantle</b> excision for histological and histochemical analysis of <b>mantle</b> regeneration. There was almost 100 percent survival in both experiments. Healing and regeneration of <b>mantle</b> tissue in oysters subject to excision from the left, right or both <b>mantle</b> lobes was evident, with regenerated <b>mantle</b> appearing similar to non-regenerated <b>mantle.</b> All external and internal components of non-regenerated <b>mantle</b> were present in regenerated <b>mantle</b> tissue. Epithelization signifying wound healing occurred within 36 - 72  h and was characterised by a reduced wound area, haemocyte infiltration and accumulation, and cell dedifferentiation. Within 48  h of <b>mantle</b> excision, the latero-ventral edges of the wound flexed dorsally and attached to the dorsal edge of the wound reducing the wound area. Between five and twelve days after excision, the distal part of the <b>mantle</b> had divided into three small lobes which developed into the outer, middle and inner <b>mantle</b> folds two weeks later. Ninety days after excision the <b>mantle</b> had completely regenerated with histological observations indicating no difference in epithelial structure or in other internal <b>mantle</b> accessories when compared to non-regenerated <b>mantle.</b> Shell material began to be secreted onto the shell by regenerating <b>mantle</b> twelve days after excision. Initially this occurred in a position dorsal to the non-injured <b>mantle</b> edge. However, forty-five days after <b>mantle</b> excision, regenerated <b>mantle</b> had extended ventrally to a position similar to that of non-injured <b>mantle.</b> Nacre deposition by regenerated <b>mantle</b> had now reached the same position ventrally as that of non-injured <b>mantle</b> indicating full acquisition of nacre secreting abilities by regenerated <b>mantle.</b> © 2009 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mantle</b> length (ML) is the {{standard}} size measure for coleoid cephalopods (shell diameter being more common for nautiluses) and is almost universally reported in the scientific literature. The <b>mantle</b> is the cephalopod's [...] "body"; it lies posterior to the head and encloses the visceral mass and <b>mantle</b> cavity, the latter being used for locomotion by jet propulsion. Unless otherwise indicated, <b>mantle</b> length is measured dorsally over the midline of the <b>mantle.</b> In Decapodiformes (ten-limbed cephalopods), <b>mantle</b> length is measured from the anterior edge of the <b>mantle</b> (near the head), to the posterior end of the <b>mantle</b> or {{the apex of the}} united fins, whichever is longer. In Octopodiformes (eight-limbed cephalopods), the anterior edge of the <b>mantle</b> is not clearly delimited dorsally due to advanced head-mantle fusion, and <b>mantle</b> length is therefore taken from the midpoint between the eyes to the posterior end of the <b>mantle.</b> When ventral <b>mantle</b> length is meant instead of dorsal this is always specified as such and abbreviated VML (Roper & Voss, 1983:58).|$|R

5|$|Every planet {{began its}} {{existence}} {{in an entirely}} fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts, but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel, and <b>mantles</b> of silicates. Jupiter and Saturn {{are believed to have}} cores of rock and metal surrounded by <b>mantles</b> of metallic hydrogen. Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by <b>mantles</b> of water, ammonia, methane and other ices. The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, most {{applications}} {{that do not}} depend on thorium's radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found. Despite its radioactivity, the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States estimated that using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, {{but this was not}} the case for the dose received by people manufacturing the <b>mantles</b> (and thus contacting many) or for the soils around some factory sites. Some manufacturers have changed to other materials, such as yttrium, although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. Other manufacturers continued to make thorium <b>mantles,</b> but moved their factories to developing countries. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium <b>mantles</b> without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some claiming them to be non-radioactive while using quantities of thorium of up to 259milligrams per mantle.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGreenstone basalts and komatiites {{provide a}} means to track both <b>mantle</b> {{composition}} and magma generation temperature with time. Four types of <b>mantle</b> are characterized from incompatible element distributions in basalts and komatiites: depleted, hydrated, enriched and <b>mantle</b> from which komatiites are derived. Our most important observation is the recognition {{for the first time}} of what we refer to as a Great Thermal Divergence within the <b>mantle</b> beginning {{near the end of the}} Archean, which we ascribe to thermal and convective evolution. Prior to 2. 5  Ga, depleted and enriched <b>mantle</b> have indistinguishable thermal histories, whereas at 2. 5 – 2. 0  Ga a divergence in <b>mantle</b> magma generation temperature begins between these two types of <b>mantle.</b> Major and incompatible element distributions and calculated magma generation temperatures suggest that Archean enriched <b>mantle</b> did not come from <b>mantle</b> plumes, but was part of an undifferentiated or well-mixed <b>mantle</b> similar in composition to calculated primitive <b>mantle.</b> During this time, however, high-temperature <b>mantle</b> plumes from dominantly depleted sources gave rise to komatiites and associated basalts. Recycling of oceanic crust into the deep <b>mantle</b> after the Archean may have contributed to enrichment of Ti, Al, Ca and Na in basalts derived from enriched <b>mantle</b> sources. After 2. 5  Ga, increases in Mg# in basalts from depleted <b>mantle</b> and decreases in Fe and Mn reflect some combination of growing depletion and cooling of depleted <b>mantle</b> with time.

50|$|Earth's <b>mantle</b> {{extends to}} a depth of 2,890 km, making it the {{thickest}} layer of Earth. The <b>mantle</b> is divided into upper and lower <b>mantle.</b> The upper and lower <b>mantle</b> are separated by the transition zone. The lowest part of the <b>mantle</b> next to the core-mantle boundary is known as the D″ (pronounced dee-double-prime) layer. The pressure {{at the bottom of the}} <b>mantle</b> is ≈140 GPa (1.4 Matm). The <b>mantle</b> is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust. Although solid, the high temperatures within the <b>mantle</b> cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales. Convection of the <b>mantle</b> is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates. As there is intense and increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the <b>mantle,</b> the lower part of the <b>mantle</b> flows less easily than does the upper <b>mantle</b> (chemical changes within the <b>mantle</b> may also be important). The viscosity of the <b>mantle</b> ranges between 1021 and 1024 Pa·s, depending on depth. In comparison, the viscosity of water is approximately 10−3 Pa·s and that of pitch is 107 Pa·s. The source of heat that drives plate tectonics is the primordial heat left over from the planet’s formation as well as the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earth’s crust and <b>mantle.</b>|$|R

50|$|Convection within Earth's <b>mantle</b> is {{the driving}} force for plate tectonics. <b>Mantle</b> {{convection}} {{is the result of a}} thermal gradient: the lower <b>mantle</b> is hotter than the upper <b>mantle,</b> and is therefore less dense.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of arc subduction is well {{understood to be}} the location where new continental crust is formed and is presumably also the site of subcontinental <b>mantle</b> genesis.

Continued subduction of the slab leads to further hydration of the <b>mantle</b> which causes partial melting in the <b>mantle</b> wedge. It is expected then that the modern subcontinental <b>mantle</b> is a former, melt-depleted <b>mantle</b> wedge.
