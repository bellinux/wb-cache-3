50|$|Following the Libyan civil war, many ethnic Tuareg who {{had fought}} for the Gaddafi {{government}} and the rebels took their weapons and left for Azawad (A region in Northern Mali that the National <b>Movement</b> for the <b>Liberation</b> of Azawad (MNLA) {{wants to be an}} independent state). Following several previously failed Tuareg rebellions, the MNLA managed to take over the area and declare independence. However, the secular movement was soon overrun by Islamist-oriented groups such as MOJWA and Ansar Dine. The French launched a military operation that ousted the rebels, with additional military support from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). However, simmering tensions and irregular incidents continued to occur. The <b>Macina</b> <b>Liberation</b> Front is a new jihadist group operating in central and southern Mali led by the radical Muslim cleric Amadou Kouffa, a strong proponent of strict Islamic law in Mali. The group draws most of its support from the Fulani ethnic group, who are found across the Sahel region. Kouffa is a close ally of Ansar Dine leader Iyad ag Ghali. A Human Rights Watch report said the <b>Macina</b> <b>Liberation</b> Front militants had carried out serious abuses in parts of central Mali since January and killed at least five people they accused of being aligned to the government. The group has attacked police and military particularly in the Mopti region, most recently killing three soldiers in Tenenkou in August. The Malian military recently arrested Alaye Bocari, a man they say was a key MLF financier and Kouffa's right-hand man.|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} selected Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) activities {{designed to}} publicise political prisoners and detainees. The political prisoner campaign was {{one way in}} which the AAM highlighted the role of the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements</b> fighting apartheid. It illustrates how the AAM not only played a key part in exposing the immorality of apartheid, but also in popularising the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements,</b> and especially the African National Congress (ANC). All AAM activity broadly supported the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements,</b> informed British public opinion on conditions in South Africa, and aimed to change British government policy. However, certain actions focused more specifically on popularising the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements</b> and specific members in these movements. Political prisoner campaigns showed the difficulties faced by specific people caught up in the South African judicial system {{and the way in which}} the South African government used trials and jail sentences to weaken the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements.</b> On the one hand, the AAM attempted to highlight the activity of the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements</b> inside South Africa and the violence of the South African regime. On the other hand, it appealed to international concerns about human rights. The AAM aimed to invert the idea that the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements</b> were primarily responsible for violence through focusing on violence by the regime. Of all the campaigns for individual prisoners, that for Nelson Mandela achieved the highest profile. These campaigns were effective in increasing international criticism of apartheid and provided an opportunity for many concerned about human right to take a stand against apartheid...|$|R
