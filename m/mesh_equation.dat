40|$|A {{method of}} mesh {{adaptation}} is proposed for gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization. The method consists in coupling an equation for the mesh node coordinates with the discretized Euler equations of gas dynamics in steady state. The variational <b>mesh</b> <b>equation</b> {{is inspired by}} Winslow’s variable diffusion mapping. The system of mesh and flow equations is solved, instead of the flow equations alone, when performing shape optimization. The solution algorithm of the coupled equations is an approximate Newton method supplemented with an interpolation of the variable diffusivity by radial basis functions. Tests are carried out for supersonic flow over a wedge, a problem that is used here as a benchmark for the mesh adaptation and for a simple problem of inverse design. At a given design, the method of adaptation improves {{the accuracy of the}} calculated drag, a functional that is used {{in the construction of the}} inverse problem. The accuracy of the shape, obtained by inverse design, experiences similar improvements due to the mesh adaptation scheme.

40|$|A {{numerical}} method {{based on}} a fluid-structure interaction formulation is used to understand the role of viscoelasticity on flow in a two-dimensional collapsible channel. Three different viscoelastic fluid models have been considered - the Oldroyd-B, the FENE-P and Owens model for blood [R. G. Owens, A new microstructure-based constitutive model for human blood, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 140 (2006), 57 - 70]. Initially the collapsible wall is considered as a zero thickness membrane model. Subsequently the collapsible wall is modelled as an incompressible neo-Hookean solid. Experiments in micro collapsible channels have also been performed. At present, there are no models in the literature thatsimultaneously account for the elastic nature of the collapsible wall and the non-Newtonian rheology of the flowing fluid. In this study, for the first time, a viscoelastic fluid-structure interaction model has been developed that accounts for a viscoelastic fluid and a finite thickness elastic wall, and the resulting governing equations are solved with a sophisticated finite element method. The rheological behaviour of the viscoelastic fluids is {{described in terms of}} a conformation tensor model. The <b>mesh</b> <b>equation</b> and transport equations are discretized by using the DEVSS-TG/SUPG mixed finite element method. The computational method developed in this work is validated by comparing with the available analytical and numerical results. While considering viscoelastic flow in a two-dimensional collapsible channel with a zero-thickness membrane, a distinct difference has been observed in the collapse wall profile for the Oldroyd-B, FENE-P and Owens model as compared to a Newtonian fluid at low values of membrane tension. The shape change of the collapsible wall depends on the Weissenberg number (Wi) for the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P fluids. The shape change in Owens model is essentially due to its shear thinning property. There is a limiting Weissenberg number beyond which computations fail, which increases with mesh refinement and decreases with decrease in membrane tension. One of the major outcomes of the zero-thickness membrane model study is that the significant differences that arise amongst the different viscoelastic fluids in the predicted value of the tangential shear stress on the membrane surface, has no influence on the shape of the deformable membrane, because of the boundary condition adopted in the model. Essentially it is assumed that the shape of the membrane is governed only by the normal stresses acting on it. In order to use a more realistic model for the collapsible wall, the zero-thickness membrane model {{has been replaced by a}} deformable finite thickness elastic solid which accounts for the effect of shear stress on membrane shape. The limiting Weissenberg number beyond which computations fail to converge is found to be sensitive to the choice of viscoelastic model and depends on a dimensionless solid elasticity parameter. The shape of the fluid-solid interface and the stress and velocity fields in the channel, for the three viscoelastic fluids, are compared with predictions for a Newtonian fluid, and the observed differences are related to individual fluid rheological behaviour. Predictions with a finite thickness elastic solid model for the deformable wall differ considerably from those in which it is modelled as a zero-thickness membrane. Experiments have been carried out in a micro-collapsible channel made of polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) that mimics the numerically simulated geometry. The experiments show that the channel width perpendicular to the flow must be significant in order for wall effects to be negligible (an assumption that is made in the 2 D simulation). As a consequence, the commercial software ANSYS has been used to develop a full 3 D model of the channel which captures the deformation of the flexible membrane in the absence of flow. The elastic properties of PDMS have been extracted by comparing the load-displacement curves obtained from the FEM simulations with the experiments. Preliminary comparison has been made between simulations and experiments for the flow of a Newtonian fluid in the micro-collapsible channel...|$|E

30|$|In this work, a {{commercial}} process simulator {{was used as}} a tool for evaluating performance of the systems. The base case (direct sequence) was composed of two distillation columns. Generally, degree of freedom of a conventional two-product distillation column with a condenser and reboiler is 2. Therefore, for a two-product column, it is only possible to specify two specifications. In our simulations for two-product columns, recovery and purity of one of the products were the two used design parameters. These specifications, along with feed conditions and feed stage govern performance of the column. So, the other characteristics of the separation processes (including required reflux ratios, boil up ratios, condenser duties and reboiler duties) were obtained by running the simulation and solving Mass balance, Equilibrium, Summation of mole fractions =  1 and Heat balance (<b>MESH</b> <b>equations)</b> at all stages of the column. The energy requirements of the systems were evaluated by solving <b>MESH</b> <b>equations.</b> In designing the proposed bottom flashing configuration, operating parameters were adjusted to supply the same operating conditions for the columns.

In the current thesis, simulation studies of the divided wall distillation column using various mathematical models are presented. Steady state simulations are being performed using Thomas mathematical model supported by rigorous programming using combination of MATLAB which is the fundamental programming language In the steady state simulation we have tried to see the effect of changing the number of plates on the component mole fraction, vapor flow rate, liquid flow rate, Temperature etc., which gives an idea about the optimum number of plates in the divided wall distillation column. The basic input variables used are tear variables i. e. temperature and vapor flow rate. Firstly, <b>MESH</b> <b>equations</b> has been written for an equilibrium stage in a multi-component vapor liquid cascade.
