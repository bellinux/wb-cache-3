500|$|Because of its {{importance}} in human metabolism, salt {{has long been}} an important commodity, as shown by the English word salary, which derives from salarium, the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages. In medieval Europe, a compound of sodium with the Latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy. The name sodium is thought to originate from the Arabic suda, meaning headache, as the headache-alleviating properties of sodium carbonate or soda were well known in early times. [...] Although sodium, sometimes called soda, had long been recognized in compounds, the metal itself was not isolated until 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. [...] In 1809, the German physicist and chemist Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert proposed the names Natronium for Humphry Davy's [...] "sodium" [...] and Kalium for Davy's [...] "potassium". [...] The chemical abbreviation for sodium was first published in 1814 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in his system of atomic symbols, and is an abbreviation of the element's New Latin name natrium, which refers to the Egyptian natron, a natural <b>mineral</b> <b>salt</b> mainly consisting of hydrated sodium carbonate. Natron historically had several important industrial and household uses, later eclipsed by other sodium compounds.|$|E

40|$|These days Natural <b>mineral</b> <b>salts</b> (biologically active ingredients), {{which are}} the {{components}} of thermal springs, sea water, brine lakes, minerals (bischofite) are widely used {{in the composition of}} cosmetic products. The ability to influence the formulations stability and the sensory properties of cosmetics products is the specificity of this materials group, which creates certain difficulties {{in the development of a}} composition. The polymers’ use as gelling agents and thickeners is one of the means of formulations stability improving. The aim was scientific and technical literature review of the polymers assortment used in cosmetics with natural <b>mineral</b> <b>salts,</b> their application in the cosmetic compositions and the influence of <b>mineral</b> <b>salts</b> on the properties of polymers solutions. Materials and methods. Resources such as eLIBRARY, PubMed, Cyberleninca, as well as the websites of the manufacturers and suppliers of auxiliary materials, and finished cosmetic products were used to obtain the data. Results and discussion. Analysis of literature data and technical information suggests that cellulose derivatives, xanthan gum, and polyvinylpyrrolidone and carbomer are the most commonly used polymers in cosmetic compositions with natural <b>mineral</b> <b>salts.</b> These substances carry out functions of gelling agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, binders, sensorial modifier agents. There is insufficient information about the interaction of polymers with the natural <b>mineral</b> <b>salts</b> and their influence on polymers properties in scientific and technical literature.
