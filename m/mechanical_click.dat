The blades crossed {{again with the}} same sound like song, and the men went to work again with the same white and watchful faces. Evan, in his impatience, went back a little to his wildness. He made windmills, as the French duellists say, and though he was {{probably}} a shade the better fencer of the two, he found the other's point pass his face twice so close as almost to graze his cheek. The second time he realized the actual possibility of defeat and pulled himself together under a shock of the sanity of anger. He narrowed, and, so to speak, tightened his operations: he fenced (as the swordsman's boast goes), in a wedding ring; he turned Turnbull's thrusts with a maddening and almost <b>mechanical</b> <b>click,</b> {{like that of a}} machine. Whenever Turnbull's sword sought to go over that other mere white streak it seemed to be caught in a complex network of steel. He turned one thrust, turned another, turned another. Then suddenly he went forward at the lunge with his whole living weight. Turnbull leaped back, but Evan lunged and lunged and lunged again like a devilish piston rod or battering ram. And high above all the sound of the struggle there broke into the silent evening a bellowing human voice, nasal, raucous, at the highest pitch of pain. [...] "Help! Help! Police! Murder! Murder!" [...] The gag was broken; and the tongue of terror was loose.|$|E
50|$|Most players {{produced}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>click</b> when switching programs, although early Lear players switched silently. Because of {{the expense of}} producing tape heads capable of reading eight tracks, most eight-track players have heads that read just two tracks. Switching from program to program is accomplished by moving the head itself. Since the alignment of the head to the tape is crucial to any tape system, and because eight-track systems were generally designed to be cheap, this configuration further degraded {{the sound of the}} eight-track tape.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionNovel {{therapy for}} a stuck {{mechanical}} heart valve in pediatric patient with multiple prosthetic valves. Not much is known {{with the use}} of anticoagulation and fibrinolysis in multiple mechanical valves in pediatric patients. Case presentation 10 year, Saudi, male with poly-valvular disease with tricuspid, mitral, and aortic, and pulmonary valve regurgitation. Initially, he had repair of all his valves in June 2008. He required Mitral valve replacement # 21, and repeat poly-valvar repair in July 2008. Eventually, tricuspid valve was replaced by CM # 27, aortic valve was replaced by St. Jude # 19 mm, and pulmonary valve replaced by Jan 2012. He presented to cardiology clinic on March 2014 in which found to have stuck disc of the tricuspid valve prosthesis on echo with increasing gradients of six mmHg, despite therapeutic INR with warfarin. Immediate fluoroscopy confirmed diagnosis. Physical exam positively mild tachypnea and liver of three cm below costal margin, with <b>mechanical</b> cardiac <b>click</b> sounds. Immediate admission to the intensive care for observation and planning starting the tPA with heparin infusion. TPA stated as a dose of 0. 5 mg/kg/h over 6 h then repeated fluoroscopy done after 4 h of the completion of tPA showed mobile tricuspid disc. He was observed for a few days in ward with therapeutic INR and discharged home. ConclusionAs growing surgical skills we are facing many pediatric cases with prosthetic valves with stuck valves. Which tPA dose should be used? Is streptokinase better? How long do you wait before considering surgery...|$|R
40|$|The hip labrum {{has many}} functions, {{including}} shock absorption, joint lubrication, pressure distribution, and aiding in stability, with {{damage to the}} labrum associated with osteoarthritis.

40|$|The latest {{trend in}} {{athletic}} footwear is the five-toed running shoes. There are {{claims that the}} five-toed shoes will help develop strength and mechanical efficiency. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if an acute difference exists in postural sway between three different conditions; barefoot (BF), five-toed shoes (FT), and traditional running shoes (RS) without previous experience wearing five-toed shoes. METHODS: 49 healthy individuals (18 male, 31 female; avg. age = 23. 12 ± 2. 63) performed a bilateral, tandem, and single leg balance tests with each of the three conditions (BF, FT, RS). All balance assessments were 10 -second measures with eyes closed. A commercially available Smartphone with an application that accesses accelerometer outputs was used to determine postural sway. One trial was completed for each condition with a 4 -minute rest between trials. RESULTS: No differences were observed between barefoot and five-toed shoes (p= 0. 576), barefoot and athletic shoes (p= 0. 521), or five-toed shoes and athletic shoes (p= 0. 901). CONCLUSIONS: For individuals with no previous experience wearing five-toed shoes there is no change in postural sway when compared to being barefoot or wearing traditional athletic shoes. This study assessed balance in individuals wearing five-toed shoes for the first time; further research should be conducted on balance and other parameters after a period of training with this type of footwear to assess the claims of improved mechanical efficiency.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} — No {{consensus}} exists on when to perform arthroscopic partial meniscectomy {{in patients with}} a degenerative meniscal tear. Since MRI and clinical tests are not accurate in detecting a symptomatic meniscal lesion, the patient’s symptoms often play a large role when deciding when to perform surgery. We determined the prevalence and severity of self-reported knee symptoms in patients eligible for arthroscopic partial meniscectomy due to a degenerative meniscal tear. We investigated whether symptoms commonly considered {{to be related to}} meniscus injury were associated with early radiographic signs of knee osteoarthritis. Patients and methods — We included individual baseline items from the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score collected in 2 randomized controlled trials evaluating treatment for an MRI-verified degenerative medial meniscal tears in 199 patients aged 35 – 65 years. Each item was scored as no, mild, moderate, severe, extreme, and at least “mild” considering the symptoms present. Early radiographic signs of osteoarthritis, defined as a Kellgren and Lawrence grade of at least 1, were seen in 70 patients. Results — At least monthly knee pain, pain during stair walking and when twisting on the knee, and lack of confidence in knee was present in at least 80 % of the patients. Median severity was at least moderate for knee pain, pain when twisting on the knee, pain walking on stairs, lack of confidence in knee, and <b>clicking.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> symptoms such as catching were rare. Early radiographic signs of osteoarthritis were associated with an increased risk of self-reported swelling, catching, and stiffness later in the day; the odds ratio was 2. 4 (95 % CI 1. 2 – 4. 9), 2. 3 (1. 2 – 4. 3), and 2. 3 (1. 1 – 5. 0), respectively. Interpretation — Middle-aged patients with a degenerative medial meniscus tear reported symptoms commonly associated with knee osteoarthritis. Frequent knee pain, presence of lack of confidence in the knee, and clicking did not distinguish those with a meniscal tear alone from those with early radiographic knee OA. Our findings support the notion that symptoms reported by those with a degenerative meniscal tear represent early signs of knee osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|CLINICAL PRESENTATION 2 ̆ 6 EXAM: In TFCC cases, {{the patient}} usually reports {{injury to the}} {{triangular}} fibrocartilage and pain on the ulnar side of the wrist. This pain is associated to a specific occurrence of falling on an outstretched hand, from a forearm hyper rotation or an axial load and distraction injury to the ulnar boarder of the forearm. This type of falling and acute injury is common in many sports. Pain is especially pronounced when loading the wrist in extension or when supinating/pronating the wrist. In contrast, loading the wrist in a neutral position does not tend to cause pain. Deep aching pain with gripping, weakness and <b>mechanical</b> symptoms of <b>clicking</b> with pronation –supination can be experienced. The pain is typically described as being sharp and in one spot, frequently accompanied by clicking noises and visually unstable wrist. Though the wrist may show swelling early on, this can quickly subside. Repetitive pronation and supination lead to progressive degenerative changes of the proximal and distal aspects of the horizontal portion of the TFCC. ANATOMY 2 ̆ 6 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: TFCC is a constellation of many structures that support the triangular fibrocartilage proper, located between the distal ulna and ulnar carpus, arising from the distal aspect of the sigmoid notch of the radius, inserting {{in the base of}} the ulnar styloid process and ulnar carpus via the ulnolunate, ulnotriquetral, and ulnar collateral ligaments. The triangular fibrocartilage is the main ligament that stabilizes the distal radio-ulnar (RU) joint. The distal RU joint is the part of the wrist joint that lies between the two bones of the forearm and allows forearm rotation. The TFCC also functions as a shock-absorber for the wrist, like a meniscus in the knee. When the TFCC is torn, the distal RU joint becomes unstable, which causes the patient pain. TFCC is classified either as Class 1 - Traumatic or Class 2 – Degenerative. DIAGNOSTIC TESTING 2 ̆ 6 CONSIDEERATIONS: Imaging is not very successful at diagnosing TFCC cases. X ray’s are negative because there is often no bone damage present during TFCC injuries, and MRI’s frequently show a false negative. A thorough physical examination is needed to diagnose TFCC. Immediate examination of the wrist would not present any obvious abnormalities because swelling often recedes quickly. During palpation, the patient would frequently report tenderness along the ulnar side of the wrist, as well as lack range of motion in both supination and pronation, as well as ulnar and radial deviation, An axial load test would need to be performed, which would cause pain on the ulnar side of the wrist if a TFCC tear is present. The patient would also be subjected to a Sharpey’s test, which, if a TFCC tear is present, would result in a distinct clicking noise and the ulna translating inferiorly. TREATMENT 2 ̆ 6 RETURN TO ACTIVITY: Conservative treatment would consist of rest, immobilization in a wrist splint, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroid injections and change in work environment and sport activity. If this fails to resolve pain, physical therapy can then be prescribed. If these conservative treatment options continue to prove unsuccessful, then surgery can be considered. This would usually consist of arthroscopic debridement, total or partial excision, ulnar recession, partial or complete resection of the distal ulna and arthrodesis of the distal radio-ulnar joint followed by an open repair surgery for the TFCC in order to stabilize the distal radio-ulnar joint...|$|R
