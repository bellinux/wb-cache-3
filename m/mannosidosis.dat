50|$|Since this {{condition}} is generally agreed upon to be hereditary, {{nothing can be}} done to prevent HGF. However, in some cases where it can develop as a result of rare multi-system syndromes, such as: Zimmerman-Laband, Jones, Ramon Syndrome, Rutherford Syndrome, Juvenile Hyaline Fibromatosis, Systemic Infantile Hyalinosis, and <b>Mannosidosis,</b> it is best for one to simply monitors the possible progression for HGF with regular dental check-ups.|$|E
50|$|Livestock that graze {{for several}} weeks on locoweed (and little else) develop a {{lysosomal}} storage disease similar to genetic <b>mannosidosis.</b> Swainsonine inhibits a lysosomal enzyme, alpha-mannosidase. This results in abnormal accumulation of the molecules normally processed by the enzyme, and this accumulation leads to vacuolation of most tissues. Vacuolation is most obvious in neurons and epithelial cells. The vacuolation resolves shortly after poisoning is discontinued, but if the vacuolation is so severe that it destroys cells, it may result in some neurologic damage that is irreversible and permanent. The damage is highly varied.|$|E
50|$|Dilation is {{a typical}} {{characteristic}} of several diseases and disorders. These include diseases from metabolic and genetic disorders such as <b>mannosidosis,</b> myotonic dystrophy, Lowe syndrome, and Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Dilation is also a common characteristic of diseases or disorders of vascular pathologies, including CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), hereditary infantile hemiparesis, retinal arteriolar tortuosity and leukoencephalopathy, migraines, and vascular dementia. A third group disorders typically associated with VRS dilation are neuroectodermal syndromes. This includes polycystic brains associated with ectodermal dysplasia, frontonasal dysplasia, and Joubert syndrome. There is a fourth miscellaneous group of disorders typically associated with dilation which include autism in children, Megalencephalopathy, Secondary Parkinson’s Disease, recent-onset multiple sclerosis and chronic alcoholism. Because dilation {{can be associated with}} several diseases but also observed in healthy patients, it is always important in the evaluation of VRS to study the tissue around the dilation via MRI and to consider the entire clinical context.|$|E
5000|$|Congenital contractural {{arachnodactyly}} (CA) is a non-lethal {{autosomal recessive}} genetic disorder in cattle. [...] An autosomal recessive defect {{is a disease}} caused {{by the presence of}} two recessive mutant genes on an autosome. CA is classified as a heritable disorder of connective tissue, specifically a disorder of the endomysium and perimysium. The defect in the muscle connective tissue results in a reduced range of elastic extension. CA is also known as 'Fawn calf syndrome'. CA is predominately associated with Angus cattle, however it has also been detected in other Angus associated breeds such as Murray Greys. CA was first identified in Victoria, Australia in 1998. However, it has now been discovered in many other countries. CA calves are almost always born alive, most being able to walk and suckle on their mother's teat leading to their survival in the early stages, although around 20% of CA calves die soon after birth. Differences in phenotypes are not normally noticeable and the weight of new born CA calves are seen to be normal, this means that CA is not always recognised. [...] CA is caused by a specific error in the DNA. This means it can be passed on from parents to offspring. Any cattle known to carry any category one genetic condition such as CA cannot be registered with cattle societies. The carriers of category 1 defects are all identifiable in the Australian Angus database. CA calves that survive are exposed to joint dislocation and early onset of arthritis. This is a result of their flexible joint laxity. Although CA is not as severe as other genetic diseases in cattle such as <b>Mannosidosis</b> (MA), Arthrogryposis multiplex (AM), CA is nonetheless a cause of calf deaths in herds where prevalence of the CA mutation in the herd is high and carrier sires are still being used. Diagnosis of CA can be made with a physical examination of new born calves. This should be done in the first 24 hours after birth, preferably done by a veterinarian or experienced breeder. Despite the variations between severe and non-severe cases, CA is easily diagnosed in a live new born calf. Both males and females can be affected. The following symptoms are observed: congenital proximal limb contracture, congenital distal limb hyperextension, congenital kyphosis and significant postnatal improvement in these clinical signs as the calf grows and matures. CA is not a difficult diagnosis however it requires careful physical examination of the calf followed by constant observation for improvement. Additional signs are present in the calves CA causes but can be more difficult to identify especially in mild cases. These include abnormal long leg bones resulting in a tall stature, loose jointedness, poor muscling and knee knocking [...] To prevent cattle being affected by CA, sires should be pedigree analysed to minimise the chance of the mutation. If CA is identified in a herd, other bloodlines which have tested negative for CA should be purchased. Some predominant Angus sires identified with CA are Rambo 465T of JRS, Te Mania Kelp K207, Bon View Bando 598, SAF 598 Bando 5175 and Boyd On Target 1083.|$|E
40|$|Swainsonine induces the {{accumulation}} of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in human fibroblasts. The composition of the storage products shows that swainsonine completely inhibits lysosomal alpha-D-mannosidase and alters processing of glycoproteins by inhibiting Golgi alpha-D-mannosidase II. Comparison of the storage products in genetic and swainsonine-induced <b>mannosidosis</b> suggests that human fibroblasts contain a lysosomal alpha-D-mannosidase that is unaffected in genetic <b>mannosidosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Acidic alpha-mannosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 24), optimum pH 4. 25, {{is absent}} from the plasma of Angus calves with <b>mannosidosis,</b> and the {{residual}} alpha-mannosidase activity has an optimum pH of 5. 5, intermediate between that of the acidic and neutral alpha-mannosidases. This 'intermediate' alpha-mannosidase differs from the acidic form in its kinetic properties, its lack of marked inhibition by EDTA and its thermolability at 55 degrees C and physiological pH. Isoelectric focusing and ion-exchange chromatography show that it exists {{in at least two}} forms. The presence of a secondary peak at pH 5. 5 in the pH/activity profile of normal plasma and the effect of heating at 55 degrees C indicate that such a form is present in normal plasma. The residual activity in the plasma of a calf with <b>mannosidosis</b> is therefore probably not the product of the defective gene. A differential assay, based on their different stabilities at 55 degrees C, has been developed for measuring the acidic and intermediate alpha-mannosidases in plasma. There was no correlation between the concentrations of the two enzymes in the plasma of Angus cows heterozygous for <b>mannosidosis</b> or in the plasma of normal animals. This precludes the use of the intermediate form as a reference enzyme for the acidic activity in a test for heterozygosity for <b>mannosidosis</b> based on the gene-dosage phenomenon. The concentrations of the intermediate activity were comparable in normal animals and animals homozygous or heterozygous for <b>mannosidosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Normal calf α-mannosidase {{activity}} {{exists in}} at least three forms separable by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and by starch-gel electrophoresis. Two components, A and B, have optimum activity between pH 3. 75 and 4. 75, but component C has an optimum of pH 6. 6. Components A and B are virtually absent from the tissues of a calf with <b>mannosidosis</b> and the residual activity is due to component C. The acidic and neutral forms of α-mannosidase differ in their molecular weights and sensitivity to EDTA, Zn 2 +, Co 2 + and Mn 2 +. An acidic α-mannosidase component (pH optimum 4. 0) accounts for most of the activity in normal plasma but it is absent from the plasma of a calf with <b>mannosidosis.</b> Although the acidic α-mannosidase component is probably related to tissue components A and B, it can be distinguished from them by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The optimum pH of the low residual activity in the plasma from a calf with <b>mannosidosis</b> is pH 5. 5 – 5. 75. The results support the hypothesis that Angus-cattle <b>mannosidosis</b> is a storage disease caused by a deficiency of lysosomal acidic α-mannosidase activity...|$|E
40|$|Fibroblasts from {{patients}} with <b>mannosidosis,</b> cultured in medium supplemented with {{fetal calf serum}} from which acidic alpha-mannosidase (alpha-D-mannoside mannohydrolase, E. C. 3. 2. 1. 24) has been removed, secreted a normal amount of apparently unaffected acidic alpha-mannosidase into fetal calf serum-free medium. Both the intracellular and extracellular acidic alpha-mannosidase activities were completely precipitated by antiserum to placenta alpha-mannosidase B. In contrast to the heat-lability of the intracellular acidic alpha-mannosidase and its low affinity for artificial mannoside substrate, the extracellular enzyme exhibited both normal thermostability and normal kinetics. Mixing experiments with the intercellular enzymes suggested that the decreased activity in the patients' fibroblasts is not the effect of an inhibitor or absence of an activator. However, incubation of the <b>mannosidosis</b> extracellular enzyme with either normal or patient cell lysate resulted in a partial loss of activity, whereas an additive value was observed with the normal extracellular enzyme. In contrast to normal culture medium, the medium from <b>mannosidosis</b> cell culture was unable to enhance the rate of reduction of intracellular radioactivity in mucolipidosis type II fibroblasts precultured {{in the presence of}} radiolabeled mannose. These findings suggest that the defect in <b>mannosidosis</b> is expressed only after the enzyme has been delivered to lysosomes and presumably undergone some form of processing there...|$|E
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for the biochemical {{diagnosis of the}} first case of feline <b>mannosidosis.</b> A marked deficiency of acidic alpha-D-mannosidase in the brain, kidney and liver and excessive excretion of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in the urine were found in a kitten suffering from a nervous disorder. Residual acidic alpha-D-mannosidase, ranging from 2 to 5. 5 % of the normal activity, was observed in the tissues of the affected kitten. It has similar kinetic and physicochemical properties to the normal activity. The amount of mannose in the urine of the affected kitten was 19 -fold greater than in a comparable control, and the molar ratio of mannose to N-acetylglucosamine was approx. 6 : 1. High concentrations of neutral oligosaccharides were detected in the urine. The predominant oligosaccharide {{appeared to be a}} hexasaccharide. The biochemical features of bovine, feline and human <b>mannosidosis</b> are compared, and it is concluded that feline <b>mannosidosis</b> may be a useful animal model for studying the human disease...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} thin-layer chromatographic {{method is}} de-scribedfor the facile separation of neutraloiigosaccharides excreted {{in the urine}} of patients with <b>mannosidosis.</b> The urine sample is treated with mixed-bed ion-exchange resin to remove charged species. The eluate is then chroma-tographed on silica gel thin-layer plates with n-propanol water as the developer. Eleven unique orcinol-positive components can thus be resolved. The advantages of this method over previously described techniques arethe ease and rapidity of assay, better resolution of components, and clarity of resolution. It should be applicable to other disease states in which distinctive neutral carbohydrate products are produced. <b>Mannosidosis</b> is an inborn error of metabolism character-ized on the biochemical level by a deficiency of lysosomal acid a-D-mannosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 24) (1). Oligosaccharides with high concentrations of mannose and N-acetylglucosamine (2) have been isolated from tissues (3), cultured fibroblasts (4), and urine (2) of affected patients. Signs of this condition include mental retardation, a dysmorphic facial appearance, and poor motor coordination (5). Laboratory screening for inherited metabolic disorders such as <b>mannosidosis</b> in selected popu-lations has obvious diagnostic benefits. Recently, a thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) method was described by Humbel and Collart (6) for distinguishing patients with <b>mannosidosis</b> from others with clinically similar storage diseases. The pro-cedure, however, requires considerable time for sample ap-plication and chromatogram development. This communi-cation describes several modifications of the TLC method-ology that result in significant improvements in resolution and speed of chromatography...|$|E
40|$|Residual acidic α-mannosidase, varying in amount up to approx. 15 % {{of normal}} values, can be {{measured}} in various organs of a calf with <b>mannosidosis.</b> The highest specific activity and relative proportion of residual activity were found in the liver. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose showed that the residual activity was associated with two components, which were eluted at comparable positions with those found in normal tissues. The residual activity had a lower thermal stability and a higher Km value for a synthetic substrate than did the normal enzyme. No differences in molecular weight or electrophoretic mobility between normal acidic α-mannosidase and the residual activity were observed by gel filtration and electrophoresis on cellulose acetate respectively. The isoelectric focusing profiles for the α-mannosidase in the normal and pathological livers were very similar. It is suggested that a mutant enzyme, resulting from a mutation in a structural gene, accounts for the residual acidic α-mannosidase in <b>mannosidosis.</b> The mutant enzyme, which cross-reacts with antiserum raised against normal bovine acidic α-mannosidase, is present at a decreased concentration compared with the normal enzyme. There is a correlation between the concentrations of residual activity and cross-reacting material in <b>mannosidosis.</b> α-Mannosidase with a pH optimum of 5. 75 and which is activated by Zn 2 + was also detected in the liver of the calf with <b>mannosidosis.</b> However, it is probably not a product of the defective gene because addition of Zn 2 + indicated that it was also present in normal tissues...|$|E
40|$|Patients with <b>mannosidosis,</b> an {{inherited}} deficiency of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase, accumulate {{large amounts of}} mannose-rich oligosaccharides (the "core" of the carbohydrate units of many glocoproteins) in brain and liver and excrete these partial degradation products in their urine. A profound alpha-mannosidase deficiency was demonstrated in fibroblasts cultured from a skin biopsy obtained from a child with <b>mannosidosis.</b> Further, abnormal glycopeptides rich in mannose and similar to oligosaccharides found in the patient's urine were isolated from fibroblast extracts {{by a variety of}} chromatographic procedures and by virtue of their binding to a concanavalin A-Sepharose 4 B affinity column. This storage material contained mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and asparagine in the ratio 3 : 1 : 1 together with a few toher amino acids and had a molecular weight of approximately 1, 100. There was no evidence for excretion of storage material by <b>mannosidosis</b> fibroblasts or for any abnormality in cell surface glycoprotein composition. The glycopeptide nature of the storage material isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts may be attributed to the low level of N-aspartyl-beta-glucosamindase (EC 3. 5. 1. -) activity in these cells...|$|E
40|$|Human alpha-mannosidase {{activity}} (alpha-D-mannoside mannohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 24) from {{tissues and}} cultured skin fibroblasts was separated by gel electrophoresis into a neutral, cytoplasmic form (alpha-mannosidase A) and two closely related acidic, lysosomal components (alpha-mannosidase B). Human <b>mannosidosis,</b> an inherited glycoprotein storage disorder, {{has been associated}} with severe deficiency of both lysosomal alpha-mannosidase B molecular forms. Chromosome assignment of the gene coding for human alpha-mannosidase B (MANB) has been determined in human-mouse and human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids. The human alpha-mannosidase B phenotype showed concordant segregation with the human enzyme glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI) (D-glucose- 6 -phosphate ketolisomerase, EC 5. 3. 1. 9) but discordant segregation with 30 other enzyme markers representing 20 linkage groups. The glucose-phosphate isomerase gene has been assigned to chromosome 19 in man. This MANB-GPI linkage and confirming chromosome studies demonstrate assignment of the alpha-mannosidase B structural gene to chromosome 19 in man. Since <b>mannosidosis</b> is believed to result from a structural defect in alpha-mannosidase B, these findings suggest that the <b>mannosidosis</b> mutation is located on chromosome 19 in man...|$|E
40|$|Antiserum {{was raised}} in a rabbit against bovine kidney acidic alpha-mannosidase that had been {{purified}} 570 -fold by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A [...] Sepharose and Sepharose 4 B-xi-aminohexanoylmannosylamine. The antiserum precipitated the acidic but not the neutral alpha-mannosidase in normal calf tissues. Human acidic alpha-mannosidase cross-reacted partially with the antiserum, emphasizing the close structural resemblance between the enzyme in the two species. The residual acidic alpha-mannosidase in the tissues of a calf with <b>mannosidosis</b> was also precipitated by the antiserum, the same volume of antiserum being required to precipitate a unit of alpha-mannosidase activity from the normal and pathological tissues. The concentration of cross-reacting material detected by antibody-consumption experiments in the organs of the calf with <b>mannosidosis</b> appeared to be proportional to the concentration of the residual acidic alpha-mannosidase. It is suggested that the residual acidic alpha-mannosidase in <b>mannosidosis</b> accounts for the cross-reacting material detected and that it is unlikely that enzymically inactive but cross-reacting material is present. The residual acidic alpha-mannosidase could be a decreased concentration of the normal gene product or an altered enzyme with a decreased specific enzymic activity and a correspondingly decreased antigenicity...|$|E
40|$|Bovine <b>mannosidosis</b> is an inborn {{lysosomal}} disease of Angus cattle, {{associated with a}} deficiency of acidic α-mannosidase and a consequent disorder in the lysosomal catabolism of glycoproteins. Affected calves characteristically show signs of neurological derangement and usually die within {{their first year of}} life. The enzymic defect causes abnormal storage of water-soluble oligosaccharide units within membrane-bound vacuoles in various cell-types. Vacuolation is particularly severe in neurones of the central nervous system, reticuloendothelial cells of lymph nodes and liver, and exocrine epithelial cells of the pancreas, salivary glands and lacrimal glands. Certain cell-types of mesenchymal origin, including fibroblasts, mesangial cells, smooth muscle fibres, pericytes and capillary endothelial cells are also affected. There is evidence that the process of crinophagy may be important in contributing glycoprotein substrates to the lysosomal system, at least in the exocrine pancreas, while in some tissues vacuoles appear to develop as dilatations of Golgi apparatus or smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The more usual picture however was that of storage within vacuoles consistent with the structure of enlarged secondary lysosomes. <b>Mannosidosis</b> is inherited as a simple autosomal recessive disease and whereas acidic α-mannosidase activity is almost completely absent from the tissues and body fluids of affected homozygotes, heterozygous individuals possess a partial deficiency of the enzyme. This gene dosage relationship forms the basis of methods for differentiating heterozygotes from normal animals. A test based on plasma α-mannosidase activity has been evaluated on over 5, 000 Angus cattle, and the prevalence of heterozygotes was found to be approximately 10 %. Although plasma α-mannosidase activity has been shown to vary between cattle of different age and sex, and significant seasonal, between-herd and even between-mob differences were demonstrated, the teat is suitable for routine use in the control of <b>mannosidosis</b> on a herd basis. A more sophisticated test for <b>mannosidosis</b> heterozygotes, based on α-mannosidase activity in lymphocyte extracts has been developed and evaluated, and is a useful adjunct to the plasma test. Preliminary investigation of a further test, based on enzyme activity in granulocyte extracts, has produced encouraging results. Included in this thesis is an evaluation of an "experiment of nature" in enzyme replacement therapy, in which a chimeric <b>mannosidosis</b> calf had been endowed with a transplant of lymphocytes from a normal co-twin, due to fused placental blood circulations. This lymphocyte transplant reduced the severity of lesions in the liver, lymph nodes, pancreas and lacrimal glands of the chimeric calf but the vacuolation of neurones in its brain was of the same order of severity as that seen in positive control calves with <b>mannosidosis,</b> and the clinical course of the disease had not been significantly altered. It is concluded that enzyme replacement therapy by infusion of leucocyte suspensions is likely to be most effective in inborn {{lysosomal disease}}s with minimal neurological involvement...|$|E

40|$|Human liver acidic alpha-D-mannosidase was {{purified}} 1400 -fold by {{a relatively}} short procedure incorporating chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose and affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4 B-epsilon-aminohexanoylmannosylamine. In contrast with the acidic enzymic activity the neutral alpha-mannosidase did not bind to the concanavalin A-Sepharose so {{the two types of}} alpha-mannosidase could be separated at an early stage in the purification. The only significant glycosidase contaminant after affinity chromatography on the mannosylamine ligand was alpha-L-fucosidase, which was selectively removed by affinity chromatography on the corresponding fucosylamine ligand. The final preparation was free of other glycosidase activities. The pI of the purified enzyme was increased from 6. 0 to 6. 45 on treatment with neuraminidase. Although the pI and the mol. wt. (220 000) suggested that alpha-mannosidase A had been purified selectively, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose indicated that the preparation consisted predominantly of alpha-mannosidase B. This discrepancy is discussed in relation to the basis of the multiple forms of human alpha-mannosidase. The purified enzyme completely removed the alpha-linked non-reducing terminal mannose from a trisaccharide isolated from the urine of a patient with <b>mannosidosis.</b> A comparison of the activity of the pure enzyme towards the natural substrate and synthetic substrates suggests that the same enzymic activity is responsible for hydrolysing all the substrates.

40|$|Analysis of {{the neutral}} urinary {{oligosaccharides}} in bovine, feline and human <b>mannosidosis</b> by thin-layer and gel-permeation chromatography {{has shown that}} the patterns of stored oligosaccharides in the three species are different. In bovine and feline <b>mannosidosis</b> the most abundant urinary oligosaccharide is also the most abundant in the tissues of each species. The predominant oligosaccharides were purified by a combination of gel-filtration, ion-exchange and thin-layer chromatography and shown to contain only mannose and N-acetylglucosamine by g. l. c. and g. l. c. [...] mass spectrometry. The probable composition and size of each oligosaccharide were predicted from its chromatographic properties, sugar composition and the known structure of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. The bovine and feline oligosaccharides belonged to a homologous series of general composition Mann (GlcNAc) 2, whereas the human oligosaccharides belong to a different series, MannGlcNAc. These structures suggest that lysosomal endohexosaminidase is not present in bovine and feline tissues. The predominant feline storage product, Man 3 (GlcNAc) 2, was the expected storage product from the catabolism of complex asparagine-linked glycans. In contrast, the predominant bovine oligosaccharide, Man 2 (GlcNAc) 2, probably lacks one of the alpha-linked mannose residues in the core region. A similar situation occurs in human <b>mannosidosis.</b> It is predicted that in these species either that the residual mutant alpha-D-mannosidase retains activity towards one of the core alpha-linked mannose residues or that another form of lysosomal alpha-D-mannosidase that is unaffected in these disorders occurs.

Although the patterns of abnor-malities in the two cases closely match those of descriptions of “type 11 ” and “type I” <b>mannosidosis</b> respectively, the variation should be due to genetic modifiers or environ-mental effects since the brothers must have shared similar alpha-mannosidase mutations.

The catabolic pathway for a particular substrate appears to be determined by its structure, raising the possibility that degradation occurs by an uninterrupted sequence of steps within one active site. The structures of the digestion intermediates are compared with the published structures of the storage products in <b>mannosidosis</b> and of intact asparagine-linked glycans. Most but not all of the digestion intermediates derived from high-mannose glycans have structures found in intact asparagine-linked glycans of human glycoproteins or among the storage products in the urine of patients with <b>mannosidosis.</b> However, the relative abundances of these structures suggests that the catabolic pathway is not the same as the processing pathway. In contrast, the intermediates formed from the digestion of oligosaccharides derived from hybrid and complex N-glycans are completely different from any processing intermediates and also from the oligosaccharides of composition Man 2 - 4 GlcNAc that account for 80 - 90 % of the storage products in alpha-mannosidosis. It is postulated that the structures of these major storage products arise from the action of an exo/endo-alpha(1 - 6) -mannosidase on the partially catabolized oligomannosides that accumulate in the absence of the main lysosomal alpha-mannosidase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{morphology}} and ultrastructure of circulating {{white blood}} cells from six Persian and from five Russian Blue/Siamese cats deficient in lysosomal activity of a-mannosidase and arylsulfatase B, respectively, were studied and compared to cells from corresponding normal and carrier cats. In cats with <b>mannosidosis,</b> light microscopic examination revealed vacuoles in lymphocytes and monocytes, whereas electron microscopic studies demonstrated additional vacuoles in neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. In cats with mucopoly-saccharidosis VI (MPS VI), vacuoles containing metachromatic granules were observed in lymphocytes, neu-trophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. Ultrastructural studies of these cells identified the accumulation of fibrillar material, which often was associated with lamellated membrane structures. Lysosomal storage diseases are a group of over 30 different genetic disorders characterized by deficient lysosomal hydrolase activity and resulting in abnormal accumulation of undegraded substrates. These disor-ders affect various mammalian species, including cats and human beings. 6 Two lysosomal storage diseases, a-mannosidosis and mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MP...|$|E
