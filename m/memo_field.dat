To date clinical reasoning models have emerged from research developed in specific and well-developed health care and professional cultures, such as those in Australia and the United States, but there has been little discussion of their relevance and applicability to other cultural settings. The aim of this investigation was to explore clinical reasoning processes in a sample of experienced Portuguese musculoskeletal physiotherapists.

Findings highlighted that the clinicians were more likely to carry out their reasoning approach as a purely cognitive and clinician centred process.

40|$|Women {{empowerment}} {{in different}} spheres of life especially menopause {{is among the}} key elements of health promotion in all communities. However there is no realistic images of empowering women in menopausal symptoms management. The present survey aimed to explain the process of women's empowerment for menopausal symptoms management. This qualitative study {{is part of a}} larger project which was conducted using Grounded Theory between 2013 and 2015. The article's main focus was to explore the underlying conditions and factors affecting the process of women's empowerment. Using a purposive and theoretical sampling method, 25 participants were interviewed 28 times. Data was collected through some in-depth, semi-structural and open ended interviews with the participant and also <b>memoing</b> and <b>field</b> notes. The interviews were conducted in Neighborhoods House affiliated to Tehran municipality and two gynecological clinics affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Data analysis was applied through Strauss and Corbin approach (2008) using MAXQDA 10 software. Threat of the feminine identity has been noted as the women's most common concern to being empowered in menopause management. The key theme emerged in the present study (threat of the feminine identity) included four main categories (consciousness about the likelihood of femininity decline, negative attitude towards herself, inadequate supportive context, latent opportunity), two subcategories and 109 first-level codes. There is a logical, coherent and integrated relationship between all these concepts and the theme of feminine identity threat. This theme is considered as an underlying social problem and a major concern for postmenopausal women in the context of this group of women's empowerment. The factors (barriers and facilitators) affecting women's empowerment in menopause management are associated with social context, intensity and origin of each society. Evaluation of Iranian women's empowerment for management of menopause outcomes revealed that it is seriously influenced by gender and cultural and social beliefs. Further identification of these affecting factors as well as gaining insight and vision will help healthcare providers to make better design of applications to facilitate the process of postmenopausal women's empowermen...|$|R

However, I believe that college learning instruction has a more complex {{role to play in}} student support. This study explores the ways in which college learning instructors might, through a more nuanced approach, support students 2 ̆ 7 multidimensional academic development and identity construction, and in turn deepen their own practices. This inquiry is situated in the context of my practice as a learning instructor at the Weingarten Learning Resources Center and the University of Pennsylvania. I use both participatory and practitioner methodologies to offer an examination {{of the ways in which}} my practice impacted the development of five Black undergraduate students. The conceptual framework for this study was drawn from literature on student engagement, student development, self-authorship, literacy from a social practices perspective, literacy-identity, and intersectionality. Primary data sources included interviews, transcripts, learning sessions, database notes, personal email communication, narrative <b>memos,</b> and <b>field</b> notes. I employed a combination of analytic approaches, including ethnographic coding, practitioner research, critical discourse analysis, and case studies. There were four primary discoveries: 1) Learning instruction is a 2 ̆ 2 long game 2 ̆ 2 for both students and instructors, one that can benefit from a slow, patient, and deliberate approach; 2) By exercising restraint and allowing students an opportunity to work through issues independently, a learning instructor can help facilitate students 2 ̆ 7 improved self-authorship; 3) Effective learning instruction requires a human connection; practitioners should be unafraid to approach students holistically, and in turn share their own personal stories and experiences; and 4) Learning instructors must continually ask students to define, explain or clarify. Practitioners encourage students to bring more of their own knowledge to the table by acting as students 2 ̆ 7 thought partners and collaborators. This study contributes to scholarship in students 2 ̆ 7 academic and identity development by adding the voice of the students themselves to the field. The research also has clear implications for college learning instructors, providing a more complex, broader understanding of the kinds of knowledge are generated in the university learning center context. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: According to the literature, expert {{physiotherapists}} {{possess a}} superior organization of knowledge, organized around working hypothesis, that includes specific patterns, {{which can be}} explicitly and intuitively recognized and more general abstract sets of semantic relations, which reflect meaningful links between aspects of the problem (Mayer 1992; Jones and Higgs 1995; Higgs and Jones 1995). This organization of knowledge allows for the solution of a typical problem almost automatically through recognition of clinical patterns. In these conditions, knowledge base becomes highly structured in the forms of semantic networks (referred as “schemas”). The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the knowledge structure of expert physiotherapists when managing low back pain patients. Relevance: Elicitation and description of expert physiotherapists’ working hypothesis, both diagnostic and non- diagnostic will contribute to clarify the types of knowledge used in physiotherapy practice. Subjects: A sample of four expert physiotherapists was selected {{from a pool of}} registered physiotherapists of the Portuguese Manual Therapy Group, according to the following criteria: more than 10 years of experience in acute and recurrent low back pain, post- graduate education in areas related with management of low back pain problems and participation as lecturers or clinical supervisors in undergraduate and postgraduate courses related to neuromusculoskeletal dysfunctions. Methods and Material: This investigation uses a qualitative case study design. Data was collected through non- participant observation, semi- structured interview, <b>memos</b> and <b>field</b> notes, during the episode of care. The interviews were audio taped, transcribed and analysed. Data analysis process was organized according to Morse’s Model of qualitative data analysis (1994). After transcription of each interview, information received was coded. The coding process searches for working hypothesis according to Rivett and Higgs (1997) framework. Analysis: Coding categories were developed and revised while data analysis continues. Analysis of the data collected from video- observation and interview were reviewed by the sample that has been involved in the study. Both criterioa used in observation, and coding schema will be analysed by two external persons, who were not involved within the study. Results: The analysis of data showed evidence of working hypothesis generation in some specific themes. The majority of hypothesis formulated on the first session were related with areas or structures that could be responsible for patient’s symptoms and the mechanism by which a patient’s symptoms are being initiated and/ or maintained. In the following sessions the working hypothesis moved progressively to management and reassessment. Conclusions: This study provides some support for the view that understanding patient’s symptoms and its relationship with movement dysfunction seems to be the major concepts that organized expert’s reasoning in the management of low back pain patients...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{create new}} {{meaning of the}} {{experiences}} of intensive care survivors during early recovery {{and the meaning of}} “self” during this time. To add to the understanding of how support should be focussed for survivors during recovery. Background: Survival from a critical event/illness and intensive care unit experience is increasing, as is associated physical and psychological complications. Complications are due to the severity of illness, the intensive care experience itself {{and the nature of the}} treatments which promote survival. If complications remain untreated increased health care service uptake and reduced quality of life can ensue. Despite the potential impact upon individuals and beleaguered health care systems, inadequate support service provision in Australia and across the world persists. Design and participants: An interpretive biographical exploration of intensive care survivors experiences of recovery following hospital discharge. Nine participants were recruited from a single centre in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. All participants had been ventilated for a minimum period of twenty four hours following a critical event/illness. Methods: Data were collected from diaries, face to face interviews, <b>memos</b> and <b>field</b> notes. Participants diarised for three months commencing two months after hospital discharge. At five months following discharge participants were interviewed about the content of their diaries and the symbols and signifiers within them to create a shared meaning of their experiences. Analysis of diaries and interviews were undertaken using two frameworks. This process enabled the identification of themes throughout participants’ stories and offers a unique portrait of recovery through their individual lens. Findings: All of the participants considered their lives had irreparably changed as a result of their experience. The biographical methods provided a safe and creative way to reveal inner thoughts and feelings which may not have been revealed using other methods. This unique view through the lens of the survivor identified how unsupported by health care professionals they felt following discharge. Turmoil existed between survivors’ surface and inner worlds as they struggled to conform to the constraints of what recovery should be; imposed by the biomedical model. The process of constructing their stories enabled participants to reflect upon their experiences of recovery and bring a sense of coherence to their experiences. Conclusion: The use of the biographical method gave the participants a voice through which they could be heard and a way to bring clarity to their experiences. The process of constructing their stories was considered important to their recovery process, and in particular in enabling reflection on how far they had traversed. Often survivors are unable to articulate their inner most thoughts and experiences for fear of being misinterpreted. The methods reported here gave them an opportunity to do so through non-verbal techniques. Analysis of diary entries may also identify maladaptation in survivors and enable interventions to be individually targeted before chronicity is established. The findings from this study may lead to a greater awareness among health care providers of the problems survivors face, and improved support services more broadly, based on frameworks more appropriate for this population...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Implementation Research (IR) in {{and around}} health systems comes with unique {{challenges}} for researchers including implementation, multi-layer governance, and ethical issues. Partnerships between researchers, implementers, policy makers and community members are central to IR and come with additional challenges. In this paper, we elaborate on the challenges faced by frontline field researchers, drawing from experience with an IR study on Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs). METHODS: The IR on VHSNC took place in one state/province in India over an 18 -month research period. The IR study had twin components; intervention and in-depth research. The intervention sought to strengthen the VHSNC functioning, and concurrently the research arm sought to understand the contextual factors, pathways and mechanism affecting VHSNC functions. Frontline researchers were employed for data collection and a research assistant {{was living in the}} study sites. The frontline research assistant experienced a range of challenges, while collecting data from the study sites, which were documented as <b>field</b> <b>memos</b> and analysed using inductive content analysis approach. RESULTS: Due to the relational nature of IR, the challenges coalesced around two sets of relationships (a) between the community and frontline researchers and (b) between implementers and frontline researchers. In the community, the frontline researcher was viewed as the supervisor of the intervention and was perceived by the community to have power to bring about beneficial changes with public services and facilities. Implementers expected help from the frontline researcher in problem-solving in VHSNCs, and feedback on community mobilization to improve their approaches. A concerted effort was undertaken by the whole research team to clarify and dispel concerns among the community and implementers through careful and constant communication. The strategies employed were both managerial, relational and reflexive in nature. CONCLUSION: Frontline researchers through their experiences shape the research process and its outcome and they {{play a central role in}} the research. It demonstrates that frontline researcher resilience is very crucial when conducting health policy and systems research. Scopu...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{reasoning}} {{refers to}} the process in which practitioners, interacting with their patients, structure meaning, goals, and health management strategies based on clinical data, patient/client choices, and professional judgment and knowledge (Higgs;Jones, 2000, p. 11). Recent literature in physiotherapy and other allied health professions describes clinical reasoning as moving between cognitive and decision-making processes required to optimally diagnose and manage impairment and physical disabilities (hypothetic-deductive), and those required to understand and engage with patients' experience of disabilities and impairments (narrative reasoning). Clinical reasoning {{has been described as}} a universal process, common to all clinicians, in particular in the musculoskeletal area. However, clinical reasoning models emerged from research developed in specific and well-developed health care and professional cultures, such as Australia and United States, but there has been little discussion of their relevance and applicability to other cultural groups. Since research literature concerning physiotherapy in Portugal is almost non-existent, the aims of this study were twofold. The first aim was to explore clinical reasoning processes in a sample of Portuguese expert physiotherapists and secondly, to identify the current perspective of clinical reasoning held by educators and students, and how it is promoted in the undergraduate curriculum. The focus of the study was musculoskeletal physiotherapy. The research was influenced by the interpretative/constructivist paradigm of inquiry. The study consisted of three parts. In part one, the clinical reasoning approach of a sample of Portuguese expert therapists in musculoskeletal physiotherapy was investigated. The study focused on Portuguese clinicians' interaction with their patients in order to define and manage clinical problems. Data was collected through non-participant observation, semi-structured interviews, <b>memos</b> and <b>field</b> notes, and analysed thematically to identify and compare the practice and reasoning approach used. In part two, the generic aspects of undergraduate physiotherapy curricula in Portugal were analysed to provide a first insight of how educational programmes are organized and delivered in Portugal. Then, current musculoskeletal physiotherapy curricula in Portuguese entry-level physiotherapy programs were analysed by a questionnaire survey and documentary analysis. The specific aim was to capture the educational process and actions underlying current educational practice across undergraduate courses. In part three (Study 3 and 4), a sample of musculoskeletal lecturers and a sample of near graduate students were selected against criteria relating to the diversity of institutions that offer undergraduate physiotherapy courses (private versus public institutions) and length of time as a Physiotherapy education provider. Each course was examined from lecturer and student perspectives (through individual interviews and focus groups) to see what kind of clinical reasoning approach were most emphasised in relation to physiotherapy intervention in musculoskeletal conditions. Data were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Findings showed some similar characteristics in the reasoning process of this group of Portuguese expert physiotherapists in the study when compared with other studies in the musculoskeletal physiotherapy field. However, findings also highlighted that Portuguese physiotherapists were more likely to use and value an instrumental approach to clinical practice. There was little evidence of patients sharing their perspectives about their problems or participating in clinical decisions made. An instrumental approach to reasoning and practice was also dominant in current Portuguese musculoskeletal programs as well in educators' and students' perspectives. The focus was on diagnostic and procedural strategies of reasoning with little emphasis on promoting student competences to involve patients in the decision making process. In this sense, the practice and reasoning of this sample could be seen as more instrumental than communicative. Perspectives on clinical reasoning differ between cultures and contexts of practice and this has implications for the quality of health care education and service delivery. This research has identified the current model of clinical reasoning in Portuguese Physiotherapy practice. The findings have significant implications for clinical practice in musculoskeletal physiotherapy, curriculum development, and wider education and health service policy.

A EducomunicaÃÃo (Media Education) imerge como concepÃÃo pedagÃgica corroborada pelas vivÃncias dos conhecimentos atravÃs de aulas passeios, entrevistas, aulas expositivas e pesquisas. Nesta concepÃÃo pedagÃgica, educandos e educador constroem significados de seus conhecimentos na autonomia da ressignificaÃÃo do currÃculo, como agente ativo dentro dos processos disciplinares escolares. Portanto, como produzir conhecimento em ciÃncias biolÃgicas atravÃs de prÃticas educomunicativas em ecossistemas de redes interativas? Deve-se promover um aprendizado construÃdo da participaÃÃo e autoria dos alunos nas mÃdias sociais, focando no ensino de biologia e suas relaÃÃes com o cotidiano do aluno. TambÃm Ã necessÃrio construir um perfil no Facebook para a interatividade e compartilhamento de informaÃÃes produzidas pelos alunos e professores, bem como executar aulas expositivas e de campo para que o educando faÃa as relaÃÃes do conhecimento disciplinar com as observaÃÃes in loco dos conhecimentos no ambiente natural. Este trabalho, ocorrido na Escola de Ensino MÃdio Padre Rodolfo F. da Cunha, assumiu uma tendÃncia pedagÃgica progressista com princÃpios libertador e libertÃrio. Foi utilizada uma abordagem qualitativa, com procedimentos de uma pesquisa-aÃÃo, em que associado ao Grupo Focal, como tÃcnica de coleta de dados, realizou-se uma autoreflexÃo coletiva das prÃticas educacionais, como tambÃm o entendimento dessas prÃticas e das situaÃÃes onde essas prÃticas aconteceram, de forma colaborativa. As coletas de dados aconteceram nos ecossistemas presenciais e on-line, com entrevistas, memorandos e caderno de campo, que foram analisados, gerando leituras para as categorias de anÃlises, interpretaÃÃes e conclusÃes do trabalho. As atividades educomunicativas {{realizadas}} e publicadas no Facebook surgiram carregadas de sentimentos relativos a aprendizagem da biologia em redes colaborativas, e com os processos pedagÃgicos e ambientes onde essas prÃticas acontecem. Logo, tambÃm interferiram nos processos de aprendizagem. Portanto, foi possÃvel constatar que quando hÃ acoplamento dos conhecimentos curriculares disciplinares com os conhecimentos e afazeres locais, com as prÃticas pedagÃgicas educomunicativas, e quando ocorrem colaborativamente, estes conhecimentos adquirem valores que se agregam numa perspectiva de transformaÃÃo pessoal e social, de mobilizaÃÃes presenciais e on-line. This paper {{addresses the}} Biology of Cognition, recognizing {{that life is}} to know, and knowing is live, and supporting it {{with the construction of}} knowledge in ontoepistemogÃnese. The Educational Communication (Media Education) immerses as instructional design supported by the experiences of knowledge by riding lessons, interviews, lectures and research. In this pedagogical concept, students and educators construct meaning from their knowledge in the autonomy of the curriculum reframing, as an active agent within the school disciplinary proceedings. So, how to produce knowledge in biological sciences through educomunicativas practices in interactive networks ecosystems? One should promote learning built the participation and ownership of students in social media, focusing on teaching biology and its relations with the everyday student. It is also necessary to build a Facebook profile for interactivity and sharing of information produced by students and teachers as well as perform exhibition and field classes that the student make the relations of disciplinary knowledge with on-site observations of knowledge in the natural environment. This work, which took place at the School of High School Father Rodolfo F. da Cunha, took a progressive pedagogical trend with liberating and libertarian principles. A qualitative approach was used, with procedures of an action research in that associated with the Focus Group, as data collection technique was held a collective self-reflection of educational practices, as well as the understanding of these practices and situations where such practices happened, collaboratively. Data collection took place in the presence ecosystems and online, with interviews, <b>memos</b> and <b>field</b> notes, which were analyzed, generating readings for the categories of analysis, interpretations and conclusions. The educomunicativas activities and posted on Facebook emerged laden with feelings about the biology of learning in collaborative networks, and the pedagogical processes and environments where these practices occur. Then they also interfere with the learning process. Therefore, it was found that when there is coupling of disciplinary curricular knowledge with local knowledge and tasks, with the educomunicativas teaching practices, and when they occur collaboratively, this knowledge acquire values that are added in the interests of personal and social transformation, in-person demonstrations and online...|$|R

Das Gleiche gilt für Diskussionen über ethische und methodologische Probleme bezüglich der Wiederverwendung von Forschungsdaten. Dennoch haben die Autoren – wie viele andere Kollegen – die Sammlungen ihrer lebensgeschichtlichen Interviews immer wieder verwendet, um neue Themen zu untersuchen, die oft sehr weit von den ursprünglichen Forschungsfragen und -zielen entfernt liegen. In diesem Beitrag diskutieren wir methodologische Probleme, die bei einer solchen Praxis auftreten. Wir zeigen, dass die ethnomethodologische Perspektive auf der einen Seite eine besondere Qualität und Exaktheit der Interviews erfordert sowie eine Beschreibung der Interviewsituation (ggf. kann die Unzulänglichkeit eines Transkripts mit Hilfe der archivierten Tonbänder korrigiert werden). Auf der anderen Seite müssen die Wissenschaftler jedoch aufgrund der ethnomethodologischen Perspektive ihre Forschungsziele so formulieren, dass sie dem entsprechen, was die Daten selber bieten. Das methodologische Problem, das sich aus der Wiederverwendung von Daten ergibt, kann weder im voraus noch generell gelöst werden. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, {{the age of}} {{life history}} {{archives}} with a wider access for the social scientists is only coming. However, secondary analysis of qualitative data {{is not limited to}} documents that are stored in public archives. It happens quite often that researchers make use of an interview transcript, or a part of it, which has originally been gathered for a different occasion. Thus, they use these data for studying new topics that are sometimes far from the original research questions and objectives. In this paper we discuss some methodological problems arising from such practice. We show that, on one hand, the ethnomethodological perspective is especially demanding on the quality and the pinpoint accuracy of transcripts and the descriptions of the interviews by which the narratives were elicited (<b>field</b> <b>memos).</b> On the other hand, however, the ethnomethodological perspective orients scholars to formulate their research objectives according to what the data itself offers. The methodological problems related to the re-use of data can hardly be resolved in advance and on a general level. Los científicos sociales recién han comenzando a tener acceso a archivos de historias de vida en la República Checa y en la República de Eslovaquia. Sin embargo, el análisis secundario de los datos cualitativos no está limitado a documentos almacenado en los archivos públicos. Ocurre con frecuencia que los investigadores pueden hacer uso de la transcripción de una entrevista o parte de ella, aunque ésta originalmente fue recolectada con otros propósitos. De esta manera los investigadores emplean los datos en el estudio de nuevos temas, los cuales a veces distan mucho de las preguntas y objetivos investigativos originales. En este trabajo discutimos algunos problemas metodológicos que surgen de esta práctica. Demostramos que, por un lado, la perspectiva etnometodológica es especialmente exigente con relación a la calidad y absoluta fidelidad de las transcripciones y descripciones de las entrevistas en que las narrativas se encuentran (notas de campo). Por otro lado, sin embargo, la perspectiva etnometodológica orienta a los investigadores a la formulación de sus objetivos investigativos en función de lo que los datos le ofrecen. Los problemas metodológicos relacionados con la re-utilización de datos no pueden resolverse de antemano y en un sentido general...|$|R
40|$|The street {{children}} are a growing phenomenon of postmodern times, especially {{in developing countries}} like Bangladesh. The estimated total {{street children}} in Bangladesh are four million. These children are deprived of their basic needs and are facing numerous barriers to access their developmental opportunities, although they are considerably knowledgeable and resourceful in their living circumstances and in the life on the streets. A combination of factors leads the children to leave their own locality to resort to urban streets in Bangladesh. There are few organizations aiming to protect these children and to minimize their numbers. This study examines how the existing service system for street children is structured in two cities of Bangladesh and {{from the perspectives of}} street children themselves and from service providers perspective. Hence, the study analyses explanations for (1) how the children end up in the streets and their street-based livelihood system and surviving, and for (2) how it is written about the child perspective, child rights, service delivery for children and the elimination of street children from the streets by developing their livelihood conditions. Thus, these explanations were considered in this research combining and using ecology of human development, poverty, social exclusion and Giddens structuration theory. The structuration theory offers the dimensions of child policy and service delivery system. The study explores its arguments through the situation of street children (beneficiary and non-beneficiary) and support delivery system for them in two cities as Dhaka and Bogra in Bangladesh. The qualitative research methods used in this study were interviews with street children (30) and their service providers (12), informal discussions (16), focus group discussions (5), and seminar cum workshop from the year 2005. The field work was written to <b>memos</b> into the <b>field</b> diaries. The field diaries (3) included altogether 997 pages. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed by hand to the field diaries. The tapes were used again during the analysis. In this study the research strategies and methods allowed both street children and the service providers possibilities to be participants and producing the needed research data. The findings show that street children, whether beneficiaries or non-beneficiaries of services provided by organizations, are facing multifarious problems throughout their living on the streets. In this regard, the existing service delivery system does not offer in all respect and to all of them satisfactory services, which support their healthy development and growth. There are lacking with adequate shelter, healthy nutrition opportunities and with the daily hygiene and health. There are also signs that street children were exploited by adults or older street children in the community. The service delivery system {{does not take into account}} the cultural understanding of gender, age and also religion and how these should be taken into consideration in the services. Based on the results of the study a recommendation of service system was compiled for the restructuring comprehensive and holistic form services for street children in Bangladesh to fulfill their basic needs in the future and to take into consideration the cultural aspects of organizing services.
