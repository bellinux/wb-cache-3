5|$|Another way to <b>measure</b> <b>the</b> {{speed of}} light is to {{independently}} <b>measure</b> <b>the</b> frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to <b>measure</b> <b>the</b> resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If {{the dimensions of the}} resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the {{speed of light}}.|$|E
