40|$|Background Although {{lifestyle}} interventions {{have shown}} {{to be effective in}} reducing the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, maintenance of achieved results is difficult, as participants often experience relapse after the intervention has ended. This paper describes the systematic development of a <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> for the extensive SLIMMER intervention, an existing diabetes prevention intervention for high-risk individuals, implemented in a real-life setting in the Netherlands. Methods The <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> was developed using the Intervention Mapping protocol. Programme development was informed by a literature study supplemented by various focus group discussions and feedback from implementers of the extensive SLIMMER intervention. Results The <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> was designed to sustain a healthy diet and physical activity pattern by targeting knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control of the SLIMMER participants. Practical applications were clustered into nine programme components, including sports clinics at local sports clubs, a concluding meeting with the physiotherapist and dietician, and a return session with the physiotherapist, dietician and physical activity group. Manuals were developed for the implementers and included a detailed time table and step-by-step instructions on how to implement the <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme.</b> Conclusions The Intervention Mapping protocol provided a useful framework to systematically plan a <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> for the extensive SLIMMER intervention. The study showed that planning a <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> can build on existing implementation structures of the extensive programme. Future {{research is needed to determine}} to what extent the <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> contributes to sustained effects in participants of lifestyle interventions...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} was to assess aspects of the quality of life of drug users on a {{methadone}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> compared to drug users on a harm minimisation programme. 36 clients attending the harm minimisation programme in the National Drug Treatment Centre, Dublin, were matched for age and sex to 36 clients on the methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme.</b> All were interviewed with the SF- 36 Health Survey Questionnaire to measure health related quality of life and with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADs] to measure psychological morbidity. More clients from the harm minimisation programme had previous psychiatric problems than clients on the methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme,</b> with an odds ratio of 4. 3 CI (1. 2, 15. 2). On the HADs clients on the methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> had significantly lower depression scores than clients on the harm minimisation programme. In addition more clients on the harm minimisation programme were severely depressed than clients on the methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme.</b> On the UK SF- 36 Scale, clients on the harm minimisation programme perceived a significantly greater deterioration in "change in health" over the previous year than clients on the methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme.</b> Although clients on a methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> had an improved perception of their quality of life in relation to psychological and overall health function from the previous year, compared to clients on a harm minimisation programme, there still existed varying degrees of psychopathology in both groups which needs to be considered when providing future services for drug users...|$|R

50|$|Critics {{of heroin}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>programmes</b> {{object to the}} high costs of {{providing}} heroin to users. The British heroin study cost the British government £15,000 per participant per year, roughly equivalent to average heroin user's expense of £15,600 per year. Drug Free Australia contrast these ongoing maintenance costs with Sweden's investment in, and commitment to, a drug-free society where a policy of compulsory rehabilitation of drug addicts is integral, which has yielded the one of the lowest reported illicit drug use levels in the developed world, a model in which successfully rehabilitated users present no further maintenance costs to their community, as well as reduced ongoing health care costs.|$|E
50|$|As {{private funds}} lagged, {{and in part}} because those funds lagged, federal budget {{investments}} and expenditures began flowing into eastern Germany at a consistently high rate. Government funds were used essentially for two purposes: infrastructure investment projects (roads, bridges, railroads, and so on), and income maintenance (unemployment compensation, social security, and other social costs). The infrastructure projects sustained employment levels, and the income <b>maintenance</b> <b>programmes</b> sustained income. But neither had an early growth payoff. A review conducted in 2007 of twelve years of individual employment histories found that, generally speaking, the training of unemployed East Germans was beneficial, but involved initial negative (participants cease to actively seek employment for the first twelve to eighteen months of training) lock-in effects and that long-term retraining for construction was misguided.|$|E

Under FAA oversight, each operator prepares a Continuous Airworthiness Maintenance Program (CAMP) under its Operations Specifications or [...] "OpSpecs".The CAMP includes both routine and detailed inspections. Airlines and airworthiness authorities casually refer to the detailed inspections as [...] "checks", commonly one of the following: A check, B check, C check, or D check.
