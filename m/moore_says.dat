5000|$|The geology of Pluto {{consists}} {{of the characteristics of}} the surface, crust, and interior of Pluto. Because of Pluto's distance from Earth, in-depth study from Earth is difficult. Because of this, many details about Pluto remained unknown until 14 July 2015, when New Horizons flew through the Pluto system and began transmitting data back to Earth. When it did, Pluto was found to have remarkable geologic diversity, with New Horizons team member Jeff <b>Moore</b> <b>saying</b> that it [...] "is every bit as complex as that of Mars”. [...] The final New Horizons Pluto data transmission was received on October 25, 2016.|$|R
500|$|Extensive {{pre-production}} was necessary. The unique {{nature of}} the film shoot dictated steps not normally taken in filmmaking, such as charting {{the position of the}} sun weeks in advance since they could not use lighting equipment. Scenes were rehearsed and blocked in hotel rooms, rather than the actual locations. [...] "We must have walked through the entire movie at least eight or nine times during multiple scouting trips before we ever rolled camera," [...] <b>Moore</b> <b>says.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "There {{was nowhere}} else to do it," [...] <b>Moore</b> <b>says</b> of his {{decision}} to use Disney World as a setting and shoot at the parks. Disney, which {{has a reputation for}} aggressively protecting its intellectual property, has been tolerant of visitors uploading videos of their visits to YouTube and elsewhere since most of those user-created videos project a positive image of the parks. But Moore did not expect to get permission from Disney to shoot there given his negative, surrealistic portrayal of the park.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} [...] stories as to whom Ian Fleming {{personally}} wanted. Reportedly, Fleming favoured actor Richard Todd. In his autobiography When the Snow Melts, Cubby Broccoli said Roger Moore had been considered, {{but had been}} thought [...] "too young, perhaps a shade too pretty." [...] In his autobiography, My Word Is My Bond, <b>Moore</b> <b>says</b> he was never approached {{to play the role}} of Bond until 1973, for Live and Let Die. Moore appeared as Simon Templar on the television series The Saint, airing in the United Kingdom for the first time on 4 October 1962, only one day before the premiere of Dr. No.|$|E
5000|$|The Nuclear Information and Resource Service, an anti-nuclear group, criticized <b>Moore</b> <b>saying</b> {{that his}} comment in 1976 that [...] "it {{should be remembered}} that there are {{employed}} in the nuclear industry some very high-powered public relations organizations. One can no more trust them {{to tell the truth}} about nuclear power than about which brand of toothpaste will result in this apparently insoluble problem" [...] was seen as forecasting his own future.

Friedman and Bill <b>Moore</b> <b>say</b> {{they later}} {{received}} {{a series of}} anonymous messages that led them to find {{what has been called}} the [...] "Cutler/Twining memo" [...] in 1985 while searching declassified files in the National Archives. Purporting to be written by President Eisenhower's assistant Robert Cutler to General Nathan F. Twining and containing a reference to Majestic 12, the memo is widely held to be a forgery, likely planted as part of a hoax. Historian Robert Goldberg wrote that the ufologists came to believe the story despite the documents being [...] "obviously planted to bolster the legitimacy of the briefing papers".|$|R
500|$|Big Daddy {{covered the}} song on their 1992 Sgt.

Other acts who have covered the song for Sgt.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the album}} was largely positive; reviews specifically praised the band's musicianship {{and the range of}} material on the album. Adam Moore, writing for the Tufts Observer, posits that [...] "ll of the members bring their great musical abilities to Kid Kilowatt and make them more palatable to the listener who isn't into blast beats and Jake Bannon's [...] distinctive voice". The album's sound is described as [...] "more recent Cave In, but without the spacey effects and meandering songwriting". Moore likens the sound to that of Thursday, but concedes that [...] "Kilowatt isn’t even that metallic or scream-oriented". Attempting to categorise that band, a ScenePointBlank review writes that [...] "ne could narrowly define Kid Kilowatt as either indie-rock or post-hardcore, both are accurate descriptions". <b>Moore</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "verall, the album sounds rather pop-y", and that their use of [...] "pop hooks combined with post-pop chord progressions" [...] gives the album a [...] "very melodic feel". Chris Morgan, in a glowing review, writes that Guitar Method is [...] "a sleeper classic of the modern underground".|$|E
500|$|The final {{portion of}} the book {{analyzes}} consequentialism {{within the scope of}} normative ethics and deontological ethics. Florida State University Tobias Simon Eminent Scholar Fernando Tesón writes in his essay [...] "Targeted Killing in War and Peace: A Philosophical Analysis" [...] that targeted killing is particularly justified against terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians. University of Illinois law and philosophy professor Michael <b>Moore</b> <b>says</b> in [...] "Targeted Killings and the Morality of Hard Choices" [...] that targeted killing can be seen as justified through both deontological and consequentialist models. University of Pennsylvania School of Law professor Leo Katz writes in [...] "Targeted Killing and the Strategic Use of Self-Defense" [...] that there is a danger of a state government artificially generating instances in which it asserts it must use targeted killing in self-defense. He warns against situations in which governments find it easier to kill terrorists than to put them through due process of law. Katz concludes that current regulations support targeted killing because existing law does not consider his argument and justifies the tactical elimination of terrorists.|$|E

5000|$|A {{difference}} of opinion exists regarding {{the selection of the}} number 616. In 2005, Moore's son-in-law John Reppion stated on an Internet message board that the number 616 was arbitrarily chosen by <b>Moore,</b> <b>saying</b> it [...] "was just a random number of no significance chosen because people always seemed to be talking about 'earth 2' or 'earth 4' but never any higher numbers." [...] However, Davis has said that it comes from 616, a variation on the Number of the Beast, picked because Thorpe [...] "wasn't a fan of the modern superhero genre" [...] and expressed this in his stories, [...] "such as recording his opinion of the Marvel Universe with the designation 616." ...|$|R

500|$|According to showrunner Ronald D. Moore, {{the concept}} of Ellen and Saul Tigh's {{relationship}} being more than an average husband-and-wife relationship {{went back to the}} pilot mini-series for Battlestar Galactica but was not made part of the story arc for the two characters until the middle of Season 3. As writing progressed on the episode [...] "Torn," [...] the writing staff needed to explain why Baltar would not see all 12 Cylon models aboard the base star. Moore came up with {{the concept of}} five Cylon models that had yet to be revealed. Later, during writing sessions for the episode [...] "Rapture," [...] D'Anna Biers has a vision in which she confronts the Final Five Cylons in the opera house, and apologizes to one of them. Although Moore and the writing team had yet to formally settle on Ellen Tigh as one of the Final Five, <b>Moore</b> <b>says</b> it was his intention for the Cylon to be Ellen. When one of the final four Cylons was revealed to be Saul Tigh in the episode [...] "Crossroads," [...] Moore finally decided to make Ellen the fifth Cylon because [...] "Tigh being revealed as a Cylon was such a profound shift in that character, such a big leap for the show, that it felt really natural that she was also a Cylon." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning with Caged Bird, Angelou {{used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. She would get up at {{five in the morning}} and check into a hotel room, where the staff were {{instructed}} to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. [...] She averaged 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Lupton stated that this ritual indicated [...] "a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time". Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to [...] "enchant" [...] herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". [...] She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. Critic Opal <b>Moore</b> <b>says</b> about Caged Bird: [...] "...Though easily read, [...] is no 'easy read'". Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, [...] "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" [...] She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E

5000|$|Porter {{had been}} a {{transfer}} target for Oldham Athletic ahead of their clash with Brentford on 15 March, with Oldham boss Ronnie <b>Moore</b> <b>saying</b> that the club had made [...] "a reasonable offer". Bury manager Graham Barrow said there was [...] "no chance of him leaving", with the club stating that Oldham wanted to take Porter on loan {{with a view to}} a permanent deal in the summer. The loan move never materialised, as Porter matched last seasons tally with his final goal of the season on 9 April when Bury drew 2-2 with Kidderminster. He scored ten goals in 36 appearances. With his contract expiring, Porter was offered a new contract to remain with Bury in the summer of 2005.|$|R

Kenefick accused Moore of presenting his words out of context in order to defame him, and both Kenefick and his onetime co-blogger, Lee, criticized Moore for claiming to make this donation anonymously, only to highlight it in his film. They accuse him of being motivated by a desire for publicity and self-aggrandizement rather than altruism.|$|R

2500|$|Often the {{geography}} of the stage and more importantly the play matched {{the geography}} of the city so that the audience would be well oriented to the locale of the play. <b>Moore</b> <b>says</b> that, [...] "references to Roman locales must have been stunning for they are not merely references to things Roman, but the most blatant possible reminders that the production occurs {{in the city of}} Rome".

5000|$|Among {{writers and}} {{movements}} of the British Right, {{there are those who}} accept Wiener's thesis {{and those who do not}} agree with it. Those who share Wiener's slant most prominently include Andrew Neil (editor of The Sunday Times in the 1980s and early 1990s), the American-based but British-raised Andrew Sullivan, the Canadian-born but U.S.-based Mark Steyn, the Times columnist and Tory MP Michael Gove, and most writers associated with The Economist (especially its Washington correspondent Adrian Wooldridge, who in 2004 likened the sort of British conservatives Wiener attacked to the leftist film-maker and polemicist Michael <b>Moore,</b> <b>saying</b> that old-school Tories dislike George W. Bush because he [...] "represents an America where people believe in business, rather than dismissing it as a rather grubby pastime"). Among newspapers, The Sunday Times has been the most fervently Wienerite, very largely due to Andrew Neil's pervasive influence. Among Right-wing fringe groups, the Democracy Movement and other groups of Tory modernisers share most of Wiener's ideas on capitalist expansion and much of his contempt for the old guard in the party.|$|R
