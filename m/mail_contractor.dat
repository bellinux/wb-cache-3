5|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} career, he became known for wearing {{a bright red}} vest and tie. He adopted this dress during his term as vice-president when he and James Reeside, a <b>mail</b> <b>contractor</b> known for his drab dress, passed a tailor's shop that displayed a bright red cloth in the window. Johnson suggested that Reeside should wear a red vest because the mail coaches he owned and operated were red. Reeside agreed to do so if Johnson would also. Both men ordered red vests and neckties, and were known for donning this attire {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E
5|$|When the Black Hawk War {{began in}} the spring of 1832, the {{settlers}} at Buffalo Grove were notified of Black Hawk's victory at Stillman's Run and ordered to leave the grove. Most of the settlers went to Peoria where they remained {{for the duration of the}} war. On May 19, 1832 a small unit was detailed to carry dispatches from Colonel James M. Strode in Galena to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry (present-day Dixon, Illinois). The group of men, which included soldiers Fred Stahl, William Durley, Vincent Smith, Redding Bennett, James Smith, and <b>mail</b> <b>contractor</b> John D. Winters, left Dixon around 3 p.m. on May 19.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Inman resumed {{service to}} Philadelphia. However, New York was now the primary gateway to the west, and Inman decided to {{alternate}} between the two ports. The firm's name was changed to the Liverpool, Philadelphia and New York Steam Ship Company, but all ships were routed to New York after its SS Kangaroo was trapped by ice in the Delaware River. Until 1857, the firm ran a fortnightly service from Liverpool. That same year Collins Line collapsed, and Inman succeeded it as the <b>mail</b> <b>contractor</b> for the United States Post Office. In 1859, a call at Queenstown was added to pick up Irish emigrants. The next year Inman ran a weekly service, increasing in 1863 to three sailings every fortnight, and twice a week during summer in 1866.|$|E

The bill also declared that Federal district courts would have jurisdiction in cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend {{in whole or in part}} any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). Put another way, I.C.C. orders and enforcements were now subject to Federal district court review, and the special commerce Court of the I.C.C. was abolished.

50|$|The Fernvale {{post office}} had its {{beginnings}} in 1879 as a combined post and telegraph office in Cribb and Foote’s Store, where Abraham Phelps was manager.

When the railway line was built through the district, the post office was transferred across {{the road to the}} Phelps home, adjacent to the railway station. Mail was delivered onwards to outlying farms by <b>mail</b> <b>contractors,</b> at first on horseback or by horse and cart, and later by car.

50|$|The {{new office}} was a {{combined}} Post and Telegraph Office {{with responsibility for}} the issuing of mail orders and the management of land based <b>mail</b> <b>contractors</b> plying between Burketown and Normanton, south to Hughenden and Townsville and west via Gregory Downs to Camooweal. This network was a vital link for people located on stations across {{the northern part of}} Queensland. The stability of the Gulf region was also enhanced by the growth in mercantile trade as shipping companies, such as Australasian Steam Navigation Company, were awarded government-subsidised mail contracts. As a result, there was a monthly shipping service {{into and out of the}} region which was made more economically viable by the introduction of Parcel Post in 1892. The post office was proclaimed an official Post Office in 1893 with the post master assuming the role of land commissioner and land agent for the Department of Public Lands in 1897.|$|R
5000|$|Mining {{also proved}} a {{significant}} {{activity in the}} district, although a less stable one than pastoralism. Gold was first discovered {{in the area in}} 1867, and from the late 1860s through the last three decades of the 19th century, gold was found and mined throughout the district, although as a series of short lived fields. In 1867 Ernest Henry, often referred to as [...] "the father of Cloncurry", discovered copper in the area, not far from the present town of Cloncurry, although the boom era for copper mining was not reached until the early twentieth century. The township of Cloncurry was established in the early 1870s to serve a remote and isolated area in the far north west of Queensland. It was officially designated a Country Post Office in 1871 and in June that year the first postmaster was appointed, operating from temporary accommodation. In 1872 a general store and a hotel were opened, forming the nucleus for a service township. Early transportation was by horse, bullock and camel teams. <b>Mail</b> <b>contractors</b> using pack horses operated mail runs along routes radiating from Cloncurry as the demand for postal services increased in subsequent years. Cloncurry prospered in the 1880s, when prices for pastoral produce remained buoyant and mining activity increased. The first Cobb & Co coach arrived in Cloncurry in 1884, and for almost {{a quarter of a century}} provided the district with both a passenger and a mail service in the absence of a railway. The Great Northern railway reached Cloncurry in 1908.|$|R

West Coast Motors would remain a Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>contractor</b> until October 2011.|$|E

6000|$|For {{the benefit}} of the loafer {{it should be noted that}} Udaipur will never be {{pleasant}} or accessible until the present <b>Mail</b> <b>Contractors</b> have been hanged. They are extortionate and untruthful, and their one set of harness and one tonga are as rotten as pears. However, the weariness of the flesh must be great indeed, to make the wanderer blind to the beauties of a journey by clear starlight and in biting cold to Chitor. About six miles from Udaipur, the granite hills close in upon the road, and the air grows warmer until, with a rush and a rattle, the tonga swings through the great Dobarra, the gate in the double circle of hills round Udaipur on to the pastures of Mewar. More than once the Girwa has been a death-trap to those who rashly entered it; and an army has been cut up on the borders of the Pichola Lake. Even now the genius of the place is strong upon the hills, and as he felt the cold air from the open ground without the barrier, the Englishman found himself repeating the words of one of the Hat-marked tribe whose destiny kept him within the Dobarra. [...] "You must have a hobby of some kind in these parts or you'll die." [...] Very lovely is Udaipur, and thrice pleasant are a few days spent within her gates, but ... read what Tod said who stayed two years behind the Dobarra, and accepted the deserts of Marwar as a delightful change.|$|R

"Then the cry {{is raised}} of feudal privileges, {{because some of}} the Rensselaer tenants are obliged to find so many days' work with their teams, or substitutes, to the landlord, and even because they have to pay {{annually}} a pair of fat fowls! We have seen enough of America, Hugh, to know that most husbandmen would be delighted to have the privilege of paying their debt in chickens and work, instead of in money, which renders the cry only so much the more wicked. But what is there more feudal in a tenant's thus paying his landlord, than in a butcher's contracting to furnish so much meat for a series of years, or a <b>mail</b> <b>contractor's</b> agreeing to carry the mail in a four-horse coach for a term of years, eh? No one objects to the rent in wheat, and why should they object to the rent in chickens? Is it because our republican farmers have got to be so aristocratic themselves, that they do not like to be thought poulterers? This is being aristocratic on the other side. These dignitaries should remember that if it be plebeian to furnish fowls, it is plebeian to receive them; and if the tenant has to find an individual who has to submit to the degradation of tendering a pair of fat fowls, the landlord has to find an individual who has to submit to the degradation of taking them, and of putting them away in the larder. It seems to me that one is an offset to the other." ...|$|R

50|$|In 1858 the {{government}} was petitioned to commission a township survey so that land for settlement could be purchased {{at the site of}} the teamsters camp. A survey of the area in 1859 shows no buildings on the town area at that time. The first sale of land at Goondiwindi was held in August 1860 at which 50 residential blocks were sold. By this time Queensland had become a separate colony to New South Wales and the Macintyre River formed part of the border. In 1861 the postal service shifted to Goondiwindi and a courthouse and police station were built. Matthew Maher, a <b>mail</b> <b>contractor,</b> who also purchased several other lots, first purchased the land on which the Customs House Museum stands, in 1863. By 1868, Samuel Droughton was also working as a <b>mail</b> <b>contractor</b> based on Goondiwindi. In March 1872 he purchased the property from Maher. It remained in the ownership of Droughton, who also acted as a dairyman, and then that of his widow, until 1901 when it was sold to the editor of the local newspaper, Edward Drake.|$|E

On the left, Van Buren is seconded by Andrew Jackson and "bottle holder" Amos Kendall. On the right, Harrison's second is a "Western lad" (a frontiersman in buckskins) and his bottle holder "Old Seventy-six" (a lame Revolutionary war veteran).
