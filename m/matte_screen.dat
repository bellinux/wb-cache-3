5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent attempt {{in improving the}} perceived image quality is the introduction of grey screens, which are more capable of darker tones than their white counterparts. A <b>matte</b> grey <b>screen</b> would have no advantage over a <b>matte</b> white <b>screen</b> in terms of contrast; contemporary grey screens are rather designed to have a gain factor {{similar to those of}} <b>matte</b> white <b>screens,</b> but a darker appearance. A darker (grey) screen reflects less light, of course—both light from the projector and ambient light. This decreases the luminance (brightness) of both the projected image and ambient light, so while the light areas of the projected image are dimmer, the dark areas are darker; white is less bright, but intended black is closer to actual black. Many screen manufacturers thus appropriately call their grey screens [...] "high-contrast" [...] models.|$|R

As a result of communication between Notion Ink support and numerous community forum commenters, a fixed update was provided by Notion Ink to rectify the problem, {{in the form of an}} 80MB download. Many customers also questioned the gap between the quality of the screen and Notion Ink's advertised 'pure-matte glass', as the screen still had a glossy effect. Answering this criticism, Rohan Shravan described the screen as having 2 internal layers of matte surfaces; for the external glass, the gloss was to be corrected with a customer-applied <b>matte</b> <b>screen</b> protector.|$|E

25|$|Like SLRs DSLRs {{typically}} use {{interchangeable lenses}} (1) with a proprietary lens mount.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the quality of latent fingerprint on different types of screen protective films including screen protector, <b>matte</b> <b>screen</b> protector, anti-fingerprint clear screen protector and anti-fingerprint <b>matte</b> <b>screen</b> protector by using black powder method in developing latent fingerprints. The fingerprints were performed by 10 volunteers whose fingers (right index, right thumb, left index and left thumb) were stubbing at different types of screen protective films and subsequently latent fingerprints were developed by brushing with black powder. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) counted the numbers of minutiae points from 320 latent fingerprints. Anti-fingerprint <b>matte</b> <b>screen</b> protective film produced the best quality of latent fingerprint with an average minutiae point 72. 65, followed by <b>matte</b> <b>screen</b> protective film, clear screen protective film and anti-fingerprint clear screen protective film with an average minutiae point of 155. 2, 135. 0 and 72. 65 respectively. The quality of latent fingerprints developed between a clear and a matte surface of screen protective films showed a significant difference (sig> 0. 05), whereas the coat and the non-coat with anti-fingerprint chemical revealed a non-significant difference (sig< 0. 05) in their number of minutiae points...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe goal {{of display}} and screen {{manufacturers}} is to design devices or surfaces that maximize the perceived image quality, e. g., resolution, brightness, and color reproduction. Very often, a particular viewer location is not taken into account, {{and the quality}} is maximized across all viewing directions. This, however, has significant implications for energy efficiency. There is usually a very wide range of viewing directions (e. g., ceiling, floor, or walls) for which the displayed content {{does not need to}} be provided. Ignoring this fact results in energy waste due to a significant amount of light reflected towards these regions. In our work, we propose a new type of screen – directional screens, which can be customized depending on a specific audience layout. They can provide up to 5 times increased gain when compared to high-gain screens and up to 15 times brighter reflection than a <b>matte</b> <b>screen.</b> In addition, they provide uniform brightness across all viewing directions, which addresses the problem of " hot-spotting " in high-gain screens. The key idea of our approach is to build a front-projection screen from tiny, highly reflective surfaces. Each of these surfaces is carefully designed so that it reflects the light only towards the audience. In this paper, we propose a complete process for designing and manufacturing such screens. We also validate our concept in simulations and by fabricating several fragments of big screens...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the objective, the viewfinder consists of a 45-degree mirror (the reason for the word reflex in the name), a <b>matte</b> focusing <b>screen</b> {{at the top of}} the camera, and a pop-up hood surrounding it. The two objectives are connected, so that the focus shown on the focusing screen will be exactly the same as on the film. However, many inexpensive [...] "pseudo" [...] TLRs are fixed-focus models. Most TLRs use leaf shutters with shutter speeds up to 1/500th sec with a B setting.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} year or two of production, another version of the {{optional}} split-image focusing-screen became available, which featured the split image dot {{in the center and}} a [...] "donut" [...] of micro-diaprisms around that, both of which were {{in the center of the}} <b>matte</b> focus <b>screen.</b> Models fitted with the special screen feature had a small silver tag stuck on the back with [...] "S.I." [...] printed on it. The final version of focus screen became the standard on all subsequent Konica models (TC, T4, FP-1, FT-1, etc.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Frequently quoted gain {{levels of}} various {{materials}} range from 0.8 of light grey <b>matte</b> <b>screens</b> to 2.5 {{of the more}} highly reflective glass bead screens, some manufacturers claiming even higher numbers for their products. Very high gain levels could be attained simply by using a mirror surface, although the audience would then just see {{a reflection of the}} projector, defeating the purpose of using a screen. Many screens with higher gain are simply semi-glossy, and so exhibit more mirror-like properties, namely a bright [...] "hot spot" [...] in the screen—an enlarged (and greatly blurred) reflection of the projector’s lens. Opinions differ as to when this [...] "hot spotting" [...] begins to be distracting, but most viewers do not notice differences as large as 30% in the image luminosity, unless presented with a test image and asked to look for variations in brightness. This is possible because humans have greater sensitivity to contrast in smaller details, but less so in luminosity variations as great as half of the screen. Other screens with higher gain are semi-retroreflective. Unlike mirrors, retroreflective surfaces reflect light back toward the source. Hot spotting is less of a problem with retroreflective high gain screens. Unfortunately, at the perpendicular direction used for gain measurement, mirror reflection and retroreflection are indistinguishable, and this has sown confusion about the behavior of high gain screens.|$|R

50|$|A {{cross-section}} (or 'side-view') of {{the optical}} {{components of a}} typical SLR camera shows how the light passes through the lens assembly (1), is reflected by the mirror (2) placed at a 45-degree angle, and is projected on the <b>matte</b> focusing <b>screen</b> (5). Via a condensing lens (6) and internal reflections in the roof pentaprism (7) the image appears in the eyepiece (8). When an image is taken, the mirror moves upwards from its resting position {{in the direction of}} the arrow, the focal plane shutter (3) opens, and the image is projected onto the film or sensor (4) in exactly the same manner as on the focusing screen.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} an {{optional}} split image focus assist screen available on a few of this model. Up to now, the Konica K/AR cameras all had <b>matte</b> focus <b>screens</b> with a micro-diaprism dot in the center to help with focus.

5000|$|The popular 1995/96 1/4-inch DV/DVCAM/DVCPro format had a {{component}} digital YUV sampling of 4:1:1, meaning only 1 out of 4 pixels or 25% {{of the color}} is actually recorded, {{which is why the}} color looks [...] "muddy" [...] and not as vibrant when compared to any 4:2:2 recording.

40|$|Motion {{parallax}} {{is widely}} regarded as providing metric depth information that is equal or superior to that obtained from binocular stereopsis — in part because it is assumed to be fairly robust with viewing distance. But excellent depth-recovery from motion parallax may be limited to very near “personal” space, where most motion parallax experiments are done. For example, Ono et al. (1986) found that although motion parallax produced rigid depth percepts in very near space, simulated objects appeared to become non-rigid as viewing distance was increased past a meter or so. We sought to investigate the perception of empty intervals between objects. To ensure there were no artifacts of temporal lag, we created a “cloud chamber” in which fibrous clouds could be suspended on invisible wires in front of a back-lit <b>matte</b> blue <b>screen.</b> A volume of space 2 – 4 m from the observers was used — the near part of “action space” (Cutting 2 ̆ 6 Vishton, 1995). Naive subjects viewed pairs of clouds that were offset in depth (and offset slightly horizontally, to avoid occlusion), and estimated the depth separation between them. Static binocular viewing was compared with dynamic monocular viewing where the extent of lateral head motion (12. 5 cm) was twice the typical interocular distance. Despite the theoretical advantages accorded by doubled parallax, the gain of perceived depth separations from motion parallax was only about half that from binocular stereopsis. This inferiority of motion parallax corresponds to our own subjective experiences: At these distances, monocular motion parallax from lateral sway produces the impression of relative motion, not depth, between objects. Whether object-directed action would show greater evidence of depth sensitivity remains to be seen...|$|R
5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue <b>screen</b> <b>matte</b> techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|R
5000|$|Film {{authority}} Roy Kinnard says, “In {{examining the}} plethora of 1950s science fiction movies which deal with the theme of mans’ journeying to other worlds in order to advance his own knowledge, George Pal’s production of Conquest of Space stands {{head and shoulders above}} the others.... In a ... genre overburdened with cheap and shoddy productions that are all too deserving of scorn, Conquest of Space rises above the tide of mediocrity.... The special visual effects in Conquest ... are outstanding especially for their time, and they are the well-tailored work of one of Hollywood’s most gifted craftsmen, John P. Fulton. Besides the massive, graceful spacecraft shown in this film, it was Fulton who was responsible for parting the Red Sea in the 1956 version of The Ten Commandments. ... It is true that the blue <b>screen</b> <b>mattes</b> in Conquest are crude our perspective ... but this is hardly a technical flaw unique to this picture. Many productions of the 50s had difficulty with blue screen work, even multi-million dollar spectaculars like Ben-Hur.” ...|$|R
40|$|A {{classical}} {{problem of}} imaging—the matting problem—is separation of a non-rectangular foreground image from a (usually) rectangular background image—for example, {{in a film}} frame, extraction of an actor from a background scene to allow substitution of a different background. Of the several attacks on this difficult and persistent problem, we discuss here only the special case of separating a desired foreground image from a background of a constant, or almost constant, backing color. This backing color has often been blue, so the problem, and its solution, have been called blue screen matting. However, other backing colors, such as yellow or (increasingly) green, have also been used, so we often generalize to constant color matting. The mathematics of constant color matting is presented and proven to be unsolvable as generally practiced. This, of course, {{flies in the face}} of the fact that the technique is commonly used in film and video, so we demonstrate constraints on the general problem that lead to solutions, or at least significantly prune the search space of solutions. We shall also demonstrate that an algorithmic solution is possible by allowing the foreground object to be shot against two constant backing colors—in fact, against two completely arbitrary backings so long as they differ everywhere.
