25|$|Introduced into Africa by the Portuguese in the 16th century, maize {{has become}} Africa's most {{important}} staple food crop. <b>Maize</b> <b>meal</b> is {{made into a}} thick porridge in many cultures: from the polenta of Italy, the angu of Brazil, the mămăligă of Romania, to cornmeal mush in the US (and hominy grits in the South) or the food called mealie pap in South Africa and sadza, nshima and ugali {{in other parts of}} Africa. <b>Maize</b> <b>meal</b> is also used as a replacement for wheat flour, to make cornbread and other baked products.

25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of starch. Cornstarch (maize flour) {{is a major}} {{ingredient}} in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also {{a major source of}} cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. <b>Maize</b> <b>meal</b> is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.|$|E

It was observed that highest <b>maize</b> gluten <b>meal</b> MGM levels of 12 % (E) and 15 % (F) did not show positive effect {{on any of the}} quantitative and qualitative characters and group D (9 % MGM) was considered as an optimum MGM level for obtaining economical and profitable results. Group D (9 % MGM) consumed relatively less quantity of feed (4246. 51 g) per bird and produced significantly higher weight gain (2063. 50) g, feed conversion ratio (2. 05), dressing percentage (68. 95), liver weight (51. 39) g, gizzard weight (31. 27) g and heart weight (10. 81) g.

For it is a very sore point, this bread. Bread means a great deal to an Italian: it is verily his staff of life. He {{practically}} lives on bread. And instead of going by taste, he now, like all the world, goes by eye. He has got it into his head that bread should be white, so that every time he fancies a darker shade in the loaf a shadow falls on his soul. Nor is he altogether wrong. For although, personally, I don't like white bread any more, yet I do like my brown bread to be made of pure, unmixed flour. The peasants in Sicily, who have kept their own wheat and make their own natural brown bread, ah, it is amazing how fresh and sweet and clean their loaf seems, so perfumed as home-bread used all to be before the war. Whereas the bread of the commune, the regulation supply, is hard, and rather coarse and rough, so rough and harsh on the palate. One gets tired to death of it. I suspect myself the <b>maize</b> <b>meal</b> mixed in. But I don't know. And finally the bread varies immensely from town to town, from commune to commune. The so-called just and equal distribution is all my-eye. One place has abundance of good sweet bread, another scrapes along, always stinted, on an allowance of harsh coarse stuff. And the poor suffer bitterly, really, from the bread-stinting, because they depend so on this one food. They say the inequality and the injustice of distribution comes from the Camorra--la grande Camorra--which is no more nowadays than a profiteering combine, which the poor hate. But for myself, I don't know. I only know that one town--Venice, for example--seems to have an endless supply of pure bread, of sugar, of tobacco, of salt--while Florence is in one continual ferment of irritation over the stinting of these supplies--which are all government monopoly, doled out accordingly.|$|E

40|$|Kafirin and zein are alcohol-soluble prolamin-type {{proteins}} {{that can be}} used to make biodegradable, environmental-friendly bioplastic films and coatings. Despite this potential, there is no commercial process for kafirin extraction. Zein, though commercially produced, is expensive. Factors affecting kafirin and zein extraction and bioplastic quality were studied. Specifically, the effects of sorghum and maize grain particle size, inclusion of glacial acetic acid and sodium hydroxide in the aqueous ethanol extractant on extract filtration time, protein preparation purity and yield; as well as effect of heating kafirin and zein films on water uptake and film digestibility were investigated. Sorghum meal with particle size > 1 mm gave more rapid extract filtration time than sorghum flour with particle size < 250 ?m, due to larger inter-particle spaces. Sorghum flour yielded a kafirin preparation with lower purity (50 %) than sorghum meal (58 %). Kafirin extracted from distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) had a higher purity (78 %) than kafirin from sorghum meal (68 %) and zein (69 %). Washing decorticated sorghum and <b>maize</b> <b>meals</b> to remove starch prior to protein extraction substantially increased protein preparation purity. Inclusion of sodium hydroxide resulted in a slightly higher protein preparation purity and yield than inclusion of acetic acid. SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions revealed more dimers in kafirin than zein, while kafirin from DDGS contained polymers, indicating polymerisation due to cross-linking occurring during DDGS drying. All films absorbed water but remained whole on soaking. Heat treated films prepared from kafirin extracted from washed sorghum meal absorbed less water (approximately 42 %), compared to zein films (approximately 47 %) due to its greater hydrophobicity and heat induced intermolecular disulphide cross-linking. Heating had no effect on DDGS kafirin film water uptake because it was highly cross-linked. In vitro pepsin and total digestion were less for kafirin films than zein films, probably due to the greater hydrophobicity of kafirin. Heating the films resulted in reduced digestibility, probably due to heat induced disulphide bonding. Extraction of kafirin and zein from coarse meal enables more rapid filtration than from fine flour. Acetic acid-ethanol method appears to be a simpler extraction procedure than NaOHethanol method as it does not require protein neutralisation. Washing decorticated sorghum and <b>maize</b> <b>meals</b> prior to protein extraction improves protein preparation purity. Sorghum DDGS shows potential as a starting material for kafirin extraction for use in film making, based on high purity and low film water uptake. Heating the films decreases water uptake properties and reduces film digestibility. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Food ScienceMScUnrestricte...|$|R

40|$|Food-to-food {{fortification}} can be {{a promising}} approach to improve the low dietary iron intake and bioavailability from monotonous diets based on {{a small number of}} staple plant foods. In Burkina Faso, the common diet consists of a thick, cereal-based paste consumed with sauces composed of mainly green leaves, such as amaranth and jute leaves. Increasing the quantity of leaves in the sauces substantially increases their iron concentration. To evaluate whether increasing the quantity of leaves in sauces would provide additional bioavailable iron, an iron absorption study in 18 young women was conducted in Zurich, Switzerland. Burkinabe composite test meals consisting of the maize paste tô accompanied by an iron-improved amaranth sauce, an iron-improved jute sauce, or a traditional amaranth sauce were provided as multiple meals twice a day for 2 consecutive days. Iron absorption was measured as erythrocyte incorporation of stable iron isotopes. Mean fractional iron absorption from maize paste consumed with an iron-improved amaranth sauce (4. 9 %) did not differ from the same meal consumed with an iron-improved jute sauce (4. 9 %; P = 0. 9), resulting in a similar quantity of total iron absorbed (679 vs. 578 µg; P = 0. 3). Mean fractional iron absorption from maize paste accompanied by a traditional amaranth sauce (7. 4 %) was significantly higher than that from the other 2 meal types (P < 0. 05), but the quantity of total iron absorbed was similar (591 µg; P = 0. 4 and 0. 7, respectively). A food-to-food fortification approach based on an increase in leafy vegetables does not provide additional bioavailable iron, presumably due to the high phenolic compound concentration of the leaves tested.
