[...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in <b>my</b> <b>freshman</b> year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything", Swift said.|$|E

40|$|I can wholeheartedly {{say that}} {{committing}} to this research project {{is one of}} the best decisions I have made to date. The determination it takes to commit to research is beyond comparison. Even the slightest possibility that I could contribute to the scientific realm of discoveries has kept my curiosity stimulated throughout the interval of my project. Research, at times, can be frustrating and failures are inevitable but making expected or unexpected discoveries alleviates all frustrations. I have learned a vast amount of knowledge from my research, and it has positively contributed to my character in so many ways. There are many people that have directly and indirectly contributed to my research. First, and foremost, I would like to thank my professor and mentor Dr. Mary Clancy for her excellent guidance.

I remained there a year, doing janitor work {{as a means of}} livelihood, and leaving eventually because the strain was more than I could bear. At this time my socialistic utterances had attracted considerable attention, and I was known as the [...] "Boy Socialist," [...] a distinction that brought about my arrest for street-talking. After leaving the High School, in three months cramming by myself, I took the three years' work for that time and entered the University of California.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about how nature affects my {{relationship}} with myself and with others, particularly male members of my family. It is about journeys taken outwards. The poems are centered around the three places I lived as I grew up: Colorado, Nebraska and Maui. I lived in Nebraska in fourth through eighth grade, and returned for <b>my</b> <b>freshmen</b> and sophomore years of college. It was while I was at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln that I attended my first poetry reading. The poet was a rural Nebraskan, William Kloefkorn, and after the reading he signed my first book of poetry, Houses and Beyond, in his tight script. In Houses and Beyond. Kloefkorn's poetry focusses on family and place, and {{the interaction between the}} two. The character in this thesis is a journeyer and an observer. He watches the world around him and records it processes. He is always attentive, he takes possession of objects by holding them in his memory. The character enters each place through his five senses, and through the natural world he enters a transformative internal world. His breathing slows down, he feels as if time is slowing around him. "Seashores" is about this type of transformation. As the narrator moves from the highway, into the restroom, and then breaks away into the cornfield, he feels he {{is at the center of}} a flood of objects. He orders these primarily through sight to interact with them. The objects he selects from his world are transformed internally into sensual images around which he centers his memories. The mural of geese on a brick wall in "Seashores" is an emblem of how the character sees himself in nature. Just as the geese are trapped in their field of blue. the poet cannot fully escape the limits of his skin and attain "free-flight" completely into the natural. In "Immersion", the narrator acts almost entirely as an observer, watching the fish as he feels they are watching him. He places each one physically in its relation to himself and to the reef and feels as if he is one of the creatures of the ocean...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{three different}} issues that pertain to life history research&mdash;where the author, the "I, " {{fits into the}} text, where the Other fits into the project, and how we represent the Other and our selves in the text. The author suggests that autoethnography and life stories are powerful research tools that ultimately enable a writer to deal with difference and to ensure that, in doing so, people are not all assimilated into one mainstream sameness. The article highlights these issues by way of three research projects. One project pertains to understanding college preparation programs for low-income youth; a second project investigates the success of Native Americans in overcom-ing educational obstacles. The third project considers the anatomy of hate by studying gay bashers. Ultimately, the article focuses on notions of polyphony and multivocality in culture and how we use them {{in the development of}} life histories. Allen Ginsberg was a poet who helped reshape how we think, how we act, and how we present text. It may not be Ginsberg’s sexuality or his fight with censors about his poem Howl that stirred many of us in ways we had not before considered. Rather, Ginsberg populated his universe with the other America that had been lost and silent to everyone except those of us who composed the other America. In those Eisenhower years, Ginsberg (1996) began Howl by writing, &dquo;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix&dquo; (p. 49). And thus began, or I should say continued, our tradition of trying to understand the Other, for Ginsberg included everyone in his universe, not merely those able to go to prep school or those who were White or straight or men. Ginsberg’s guide was the American bard Walt Whitman, who did for 19 th-century U. S. poetry and life what Ginsberg has done for the 20 th century. I recall sitting in <b>my</b> <b>freshmen</b> English class in 1972 and listening to my teacher read Whitman’s poetry-Leaves of Grass, Song of Myself, Song of the Open Road.

40|$|Joan Digby {{has offered}} us a {{wonderful}} opportunity to think about our students and ourselves in constructing an education for them. Her essay took me back to <b>my</b> own <b>freshman</b> year when I read Nathaniel Hawthorne’s story “The Birthmark. ” I think {{it might have been}} the first formal paper that I wrote in college, and it left an indelible imprint on my mind: The only truth is paradox. It seems to fit this case. Our students are and are not different than those in the past, and we, their instructors, are neither more nor less than our predecessors. If the classics teach us anything, it is that humans have not changed much over the last few thousand years. Who are we to think that in our present age (a decade?), we have changed when all the others haven’t? That said, Dr. Digby has a point. Our current college students do seem enamored of imitation, and honors students are by no means immune. I would like to further explore why that might be so. Some of our students might be lazy. Others are probably busier than young people in the past. They begin lessons in everything from gymnastics to social graces from pre-kindergarten days through high school peppered with community service, a varsity letter in some sport, an instrument, a handful or two of AP classes, and a Kaplan course to prepare for the SAT examination. Every evening is “booked. ” This is not to excuse the pastiche of sentences and paragraphs that Digby describes, but our students may have lives too full to devote much time to the habits of mind or creative production. Another explanation alluded to by Digby is that imitation is easier now than before because of the Internet. Certainly, the popular and professional literature abounds with stories of plagiarism (the purest form of imitation?), and many of us, unfortunately, have had personal experiences confronting it. Some students who ‘imitate’ in this fashion plead ignorance. Perhaps so. Yet, it is possible that some of Dr. Digby’s students may be using imitation as a time-worn method of learning, practiced intensively today in music and art but also more broadly in every society known to human history...|$|R
