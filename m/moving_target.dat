5|$|The AN/APG-68, an {{evolution}} of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> indication, sea target, and track while scan (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide continuous-wave radar (CW) target illumination for semi-active radar-homing (SARH) missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and terrain-following radar (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Because {{of the low}} signal-to-clutter ratio, it is a {{difficult}} problem to detect and image <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> in foliage. In this paper, a multifrequency multiaperture polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (MFMA POLSAR) system is proposed for imaging of <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> in foliage. The MFMA POLSAR extends the multifrequency antenna array SAR (MF-SAR) system to multiple polarizations. Full polarization is used in MFMA POLSAR to achieve an optimal polarization adaptive to the environment such that the images obtained by different apertures are of the best coherence that is used to obtain the highest accuracy of the phase estimation. It is also shown that the MFMA POLSAR cannot only accurately locate both the slow and the fast <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> but also reveal <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> in foliage.

30|$|In this paper, {{aiming at}} the problem of UAV path {{planning}} for multiple <b>moving</b> <b>targets,</b> after the targets are determined, radar is used to observe the targets and obtain their observation positions. According to the observation positions of the targets, the Kalman filtering is used to obtain the state positions and the predicted positions of the targets, and the ant colony algorithm is used to perform path planning for multiple <b>moving</b> <b>targets.</b> The experimental results show that by predicting {{the position of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> for path planning, the UAV path can be corrected and updated in advance, which improves the tracking efficiency of the UAV, thus enhancing the intelligence of the UAV multiple <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> tracking.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{estimating}} the moving targets' Doppler parameters is often required, but the Wigner-Vill distribution-based algorithms will generate cross-terms [18], {{particularly in the}} presence of multiple <b>moving</b> <b>targets.</b> In this case, the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) is a powerful tool. But the conventional FrFT is redundant for <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> detection [19]. This article presents a simplified FrFT (SFrFT) and three-antenna SAR combined GMTI approach. After canceling the stationary clutter using three-antenna ATI SAR, two-channel signals through which <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> can be detected are formed. Next, one SFrFT-based algorithm is presented to estimate the Doppler parameters of the <b>moving</b> <b>targets.</b> Finally, the <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> are located through two-channel interferometric processing algorithm. The remaining sections are organized as follows. Section II introduces the SFrFT and its mathematical properties. Section III describes the system scheme of DPCA-based three-antenna ATI SAR for GMTI applications. Next, the SFrFT-based detection algorithm is detailed in Section IV, followed by decorrelation discussion in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the whole paper.|$|R

40|$|Based on the authors' 20 years' {{research}} work on Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging of <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> and non-cooperative target recognition, this book provides readers {{with knowledge of}} various algorithms of ISAR imaging of targets and implementation with MATLAB. It introduces basic principles of radar backscattering, radar imaging, and signal analysis. It describes the characteristics of radar returns from targets, how to produce well-focused ISAR images of <b>moving</b> <b>targets,</b> and what features that can extracted from ISAR images. Also introduced are several important algorithms for ISAR image formation, ISAR image auto-focusing, and applications of ISAR imaging to air targets, sea vessels and ground <b>moving</b> <b>targets.</b> Examples of ISAR imaging of ground <b>moving</b> <b>targets,</b> air targets, and sea vessels are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|In {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) imaging, the presence of <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> in the scene causes phase errors in the SAR data and subsequently defocusing in the formed image. The defocusing caused by the <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> exhibits space-variant characteristics, i. e., the defocusing arises only in {{the parts of the}} image containing the <b>moving</b> <b>targets,</b> whereas the stationary background is not defocused. Considering that the reflectivity field to be imaged usually admits sparse representation, we propose a sparsity-driven method for joint SAR imaging and removing the defocus caused by <b>moving</b> <b>targets.</b> The method is performed in a nonquadratic regular-ization based framework by solving an optimization problem, in which prior information about both the scene and phase errors are incorporated as constraints...|$|R
30|$|As ATI SAR {{output is}} signal power, slowly <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> will not {{attenuated}} {{along with the}} stationary clutter when we utilize magnitude and phase information for target extraction. In the case of low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR), the ATI SAR will lose its ability to detect slowly <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> and to correctly estimate their velocities because the system noise (additive thermal noise and multiplicative radar phase noise) scatters the stationary clutter signal around the real axis in the complex plane. If the clutter contribution is not negligible {{when compared to the}} signal power, the estimation of the target radial velocity from the contaminated interferometric phase may lead to erroneous results. When the SCR is small, this effect will become more serious for slowly <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> and the <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> will be indistinguishable from the clutter. Moreover, in this case, the targets' impulse responses are not normal delta functions, particularly for the <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> which are poorly focused because of the unmatched azimuth-compression filter. This leads to a point target's response overlaps with several neighboring resolution cells. This also means a varying SCR across the target's response, which in turn affects its interferometric phase. Therefore, the ATI SAR is a clutter limited <b>moving</b> <b>targets</b> detector and applying some efficient clutter suppression or cancelation techniques is necessary.|$|R

25|$|The most {{effective}} clutter reduction technique is pulse-Doppler radar. Doppler separates clutter from {{aircraft and spacecraft}} using a frequency spectrum, so individual signals can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences.

25|$|The Doppler {{effect is}} used in some types of radar, to measure the {{velocity}} of detected objects. A radar beam is fired at a <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> — e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists — as it approaches or recedes from the radar source. Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source. As each wave has to move farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength. In some situations, the radar beam is fired at the moving car as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength. In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car's velocity. Moreover, the proximity fuze, developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.|$|E
