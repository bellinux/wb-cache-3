On the northern slopes of the Djebel Tachrirt the walls were constructed above the ground level, allowing the snow to accumulate and to melt slowly in order to distribute the available water resulting from the snow <b>melting</b> <b>period.</b> Most of these traditional water management works are now in ruins.|$|E
50|$|Based on lab models {{carried out}} in a cold room, high water temperature, ice temperature, and {{discharge}} are shown {{to be the main}} contributors of thermal erosion, whereas high ice content in the soil is shown to slow down the thermal erosion process. Melting of the ice within a porous material reduces the strength of the material, rendering it easily breakable and removable. During the <b>melting</b> <b>period</b> of a periglacial river in the summer, due to a relatively high water discharge, the unfrozen sediments are weathered away. In conclusion, water discharge in permanent contact with permafrost banks creates a combination of thermal and mechanical erosion.|$|E

Interferometric coherence profiles from quad-pol SAR data show clear sensitivity to the different subsurfaces of two test sites with different <b>melting</b> <b>periods.</b> The differences in coherence are explained in this study through modelling of the different vertical subsurface structures which is supported by ground penetrating radar measurements.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to characterize and study the behaviour and transport of pollutants, i. e., suspended solids, particles and heavy metals, in road runoff from a small urban catchment during snowmelt and rainfall. The result will constitute a basis for essential considerations concerning the selection and design of environmental management practices and techniques in a cold climate. In regions with cold climate the urban drainage and highway runoff processes become much more complex, compared to temperate regions. The effects that runoff has on receiving waters seem to be particularly severe during snowmelt and rain-on-snow in cold climates. Therefore, climatic conditions {{should be taken into}} account in planning and design of BMPs and snow handling strategies. To increase the knowledge of seasonal variations of road runoff quantity and quality, measurements were carried out at a field site during <b>melt</b> and rain <b>periods,</b> year 2000 and 2001. The field site was a road with 7400 vehicles/day, in the central parts of Luleå in northern Sweden. Runoff samples were analysed for suspended solids (SS), particle-size distribution, total and dissolved heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cd, Ni and Zn), pH, and conductivity. The results showed higher concentrations of SS, particles, and heavy metals for the <b>melt</b> <b>period,</b> as compared to the rain period, and the highest concentrations were found during the rain-on-snow events. The results indicated a flow dependent increase in the concentration of suspended solids during the <b>melt</b> <b>period.</b> The mass load for suspended solids, particles, and heavy metals was higher for the <b>melt</b> <b>period</b> than for the rain period. On the contrary, dissolved heavy metal loads were higher during the rain period. Metal elements during the <b>melt</b> <b>period</b> were more particulate bound as compared to the rain period characterised by a higher percentage of the dissolved fraction. During the <b>melt</b> <b>period,</b> investigated particle sizes and TSS were highly correlated with total concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. During the rain period, the correlations between total metal concentrations and the different particle sizes were not as significant. It was shown that the modified degree-day method is inadequate to describe the snowmelt dynamics well. The build-up and transport of fine and coarse suspended solids should be improved during snowmelt conditions. Despite a simple model concept, it was possible to describe the dynamics of road runoff and suspended solids rather well, based on the continuous course of events for the whole modelling period. However, if the model were used for simulating a snowmelt period or single events during snowmelt, the model approach would be too simple. Godkänd; 2005; 20070102 (haneit...|$|R
40|$|A {{large part}} of the ice {{discharge}} from ice caps and ice sheets occurs through spatially limited flow units that may operate in a mode of steady flow or cyclic surge behaviour. Changes in the dynamics of distinct flow units {{play a key role in}} the mass balance of Austfonna, the largest ice cap on Svalbard. The recent net mass loss of Austfonna was dominated by calving from marine terminating outlet glaciers. Previous ice-surface velocity maps of the ice cap were derived by satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) and rely on data acquired in the mid- 1990 s with limited information concerning the temporal variability. Here, we present continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) observations along the central flowlines of two fast flowing outlet glaciers over 2008 – 2010. The data show prominent summer speed-ups with ice-surface velocities as high as 240 % of the pre-summer mean. Acceleration follows the onset of the summer <b>melt</b> <b>period,</b> indicating enhanced basal motion due to input of surface meltwater into the subglacial drainage system. In 2008, multiple velocity peaks coincide with successive <b>melt</b> <b>periods.</b> In 2009, the major melt was of higher amplitude than in 2008. Flow velocities appear unaffected by subsequent <b>melt</b> <b>periods,</b> suggesting a transition towards a hydraulically more efficient drainage system. The observed annual mean velocities of Duvebreen and Basin- 3 exceed those from the mid- 1990 s by factors two and four, respectively, implying increased ice discharge at the calving front. Measured summer velocities up to 2 m d− 1 for Basin- 3 are close to those of Kronebreen, often referred to as the fastest glacier on Svalbard...|$|R
50|$|In 1765, a {{road was}} built between Saint-Petersburg and Arkhangelsk, mainly for postal service. The road still exists and passes Kargopol and Plesetsk, {{and it has}} been paved in 2011. One of the {{principal}} highways in Russia, M8, connects Moscow and Arkhangelsk, and passes Velsk. This highway is paved and heavily used. In general, the road network is grossly underdeveloped. Only several all-season highways, in addition to M8, cross the oblast boundaries: the one (partially unpaved) connecting Kotlas with Syktyvkar; the one (paved) connecting Kotlas to Veliky Ustyug and eventually with Vologda and Nikolsk, the one (paved) from Konosha southwards, and two (unpaved) from Kargopol to Pudozh and to Solza and Belozersk. Most of the local roads are unpaved. Until 2008, there were no all-season roads connecting the main road network with the north-east of the oblast, including the town of Mezen and the selo of Leshukonskoye, and there are still no roads into the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, on the left bank of the Onega downstream from Severoonezhsk, and very few roads on the right bank of the Northern Dvina. Many rivers can only be crossed by ferry boats, which means they cannot be crossed during the ice <b>melting</b> <b>period.</b> There is regular bus service on the main roads.The principal railway line in the oblast is the railroad connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk. The piece between Vologda and Arkhangelsk was constructed in 1890s and passed through previously uninhabited areas between the valleys of the Northern Dvina and the Onega. The railroad construction gave the momentum to the population and exploitation of these areas. A branch from Konosha eastwards to Kotlas and further to Vorkuta was constructed in the 1940s to facilitate the transport of coal from the Komi Republic. From Kotlas, another branch continues south to Kirov. A branch from Obozersky to the west, to Onega and further to Belomorsk, was built during World War II to secure the transport of goods from the harbour of Murmansk to central Russia. A piece of railroad between Arkhangelsk and Karpogory was also built in the 1970s and is expected {{to become part of the}} Belkomur project — a railway line connecting Arkhangelsk via the Komi Republic with the Perm Krai and the Ural mountains. Almost the entire rail network belongs to the Northern Railway, which west of Onega connects to the Oktyabrskaya Railway. There is also a railway line from Severoonezhsk west to Yangory (an extension of the line from Puksa to Navolok), which belongs to the Department of Corrections. A big number of narrow gauge railways have been built in the 1950s and 1960s to facilitate the transport of timber, but since then most of these became unprofitable and have been destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Snow {{plays an}} {{important}} part in the hydrology of high latitude and mountainous areas. In Norway about 30 % of the annual precipitation falls as snow. Therefore it is important to properly quantify the seasonal snow cover in Norway. In this study a method to calculate regional snow-line elevations (RSLE) was evaluated in 70 catchments in Norway to see if the method is a viable option in the difficult conditions faced in Norway and if so can the results be used to study melt behavior in those same catchments. MODIS snow cover maps were used as input data when estimating the RSLE. An alternative approach used seNorge to calculate RSLE. The results from the seNorge RSLE calculations were used both to assess the reliability of the MODIS RSLE as well as for subsequent analysis regarding the climatology of the catchments. The two datasets were compared to see the effects of cloud cover has on them and if the RSLE would could provide a simple viable alternative to snow cover area (SCA) estimations as well as if the RSLE dataset could be used to identify <b>melt</b> <b>periods</b> and the factors driving variability in them. The method was implemented in all the catchments over the period from 2000 – 2016. Results show that when the SCA estimated using MODIS and seNorge data is compared, cloud cover within the catchments has significant effect on the fit between the two datasets while the clouds have hardly any effect on the RSLE estimated from the same datasets. Based on the seNorge RSLE melt slopes were estimated using the duration of <b>melt</b> <b>period</b> and elevation change in RSLE during <b>melt</b> <b>period.</b> Analysis of factors effecting variability in melt slopes suggest that, the elevation range, mean elevation and peak SWE are the factor that most affect melt slope variability. The effect of rain on snow events on melt slopes indicated that they had no significant effect on melt slopes as they are estimated in this study. The melt slopes estimated using RSLE data seem to give some indications of what drives melt rates but is not a very robust indicator. The RSLE method is promising and seems to work well in the conditions faced in Norway but needs further validation using observations...|$|R

40|$|A snow-melting {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} {{study the effects of}} road salt on the melting of urban snow from a snow wind-row (pile) along a road in central Luleå, Sweden. Two snow piles were formed in the laboratory, with and without road salt added, and melted under similar conditions. All meltwater was collected and analyzed. The purpose of the {{experiment was}} to study the influence of the use of de-icing salt on meltwater quality and the release of pollutants from urban snow. The study indicated that the use of road salt may increase the dissolved metal phase in the urban snow meltwater. Also, the salt seems to have the largest effect {{at the beginning of the}} <b>melting</b> <b>period</b> when chloride is leaving the snow pile. Of total chloride, 90 % was transported with the first 20 % of the meltwater. Concentrations of the particulate-bound metals showed a fairly constant rate of release at the start of melt, but increased rapidly towards the end of the <b>melting</b> <b>period,</b> and this was more pronounced in the case of snow containing high chloride concentrations. Overall, a larger transport of solids was found for the pile with salt due to faster melting. Significantly larger masses of suspended solids and two heavy metals (Cu and Zn) were released with the meltwater from the pile with salt in comparison with the no-salt pile. The rest of the suspended solids and heavy metals stayed in the solid residue remaining at the end of the experiment...|$|E
40|$|Models of snow accumulation, melt, {{vertical}} meltwater percolation, and evaporation, {{were used}} in coeunction with observations of basin snow cover and hillslope hydrology to explain {{certain aspects of the}} runoff regime, as well as the annual and daily water balance of an Arctic treeline site in northwestern Canada. These studies indicated that snowfall was the largest input to the basin, accounting for 58 % of the annual total. However, transport during blowing snow was also significant, accounting for 16 % of inputs, while sublimation removed 10 % of annual inputs. Although the ma: ority of annual precipitation was released over a brief period in the spring, the initiation of runoff was delayed by the processes of vertical percolation of meltwater into the snow and frozen soil infiltration. As a result of these processes, basin water storage increased dramatically during the early <b>melt</b> <b>period,</b> with over 150 mm of melt occurring before streamflow began. The occurrence of mineral hummocks greatly affected the transfer of meltwater from late lying snow patches, with organic water tracks responsible for rapidly transporting water to the stream channel.

40|$|We {{normally}} see hydrological drought as {{a period}} of low streamflow and/or groundwater levels caused by a long lack of rainfall in the summer period, combined with high temperatures and high evaporation. But there are more mechanisms underlying hydrological drought development, which encouraged Van Loon and Van Lanen (2012) to define six hydrological drought types. In some of these types low temperatures {{play an important role}} in the development of hydrological drought through the lack of recharge to the groundwater system due to the accumulation of snow. From studying time series of hydrometeorological variables of catchments in cold climates and monsoon climates, we now found evidence for hydrological drought types that were not studied before. Analysis of drought events in selected catchments in Ethiopia showed that variability in the start of the monsoon leads to hydrological droughts that can last throughout the wet season. Analysis of drought events in rivers in high Northern latitudes showed that a lack of snowfall in the winter season leads to a drought during the snow <b>melt</b> <b>period.</b> This is crucial for water resources management, because the snow <b>melt</b> <b>period</b> is needed to fill up reservoirs. From recent climate research there is some confidence that global warming will lead to a regime change in both hydroclimatic regions. Snowmelt peaks are expected to be earlier and lower and the variability of the start of the monsoon will increase in the future. The consequence is that the hydrological drought types mentioned above will occur more often.

Our observations revealed significant changes in sea ice and sackhole brine carbonate system parameters that were associated with increasing temperatures and the buildup of chlorophyll a in bottom ice. The warming sea-ice column could be separated into distinct geochemical zones where biotic and abiotic processes exerted different influences on inorganic carbon and pCO 2 distributions. In the bottom ice, biological carbon uptake maintained undersaturated pCO 2 conditions throughout the time series, while pCO 2 was supersaturated in the upper ice. Low CO 2 permeability of the sea ice matrix and snow cover effectively impeded CO 2 efflux to the atmosphere, despite a strong pCO 2 gradient. Throughout the middle of the ice column, brine pCO 2 decreased significantly with time and was tightly controlled by solubility, as sea ice temperature and in situ melt dilution increased. Once the influence of melt dilution was accounted for, both CaCO 3 dissolution and seawater mixing were found to contribute alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon to brines, with the CaCO 3 contribution driving brine pCO 2 to values lower than predicted from melt-water dilution alone. This field study reveals a dynamic carbon system within the rapidly warming sea ice, prior to snow melt. We suggest that the early spring period drives the ice column toward pCO 2 undersaturation, contributing to a weak atmospheric CO 2 sink as the <b>melt</b> <b>period</b> advances.

In this study, we developed a coupled sea ice–ocean ecosystem–sulfur cycle model to investigate {{the potential impact of}} bottom-ice DMS and its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) on the oceanic production and emissions of DMS in the Arctic. The results of the 1 -D model simulation were compared with field data collected during May and June of 2010 in Resolute Passage. Our results reproduced the accumulation of DMS and DMSP in the bottom ice during the development of an ice algal bloom. The release of these sulfur species took place predominantly during the earlier phase of the <b>melt</b> <b>period,</b> resulting in an increase of DMS and DMSP in the underlying water column prior to the onset of an under-ice phytoplankton bloom. Production and removal rates of processes considered in the model are analyzed to identify the processes dominating the budgets of DMS and DMSP both in the bottom ice and the underlying water column. When openings in the ice were taken into account, the simulated sea–air DMS flux during the <b>melt</b> <b>period</b> was dominated by episodic spikes of up to 8. 1  µmol m − 2  d − 1.

40|$|To {{minimize}} {{the environmental impact}} of a fuel spill a permeable bio-reactive barrier (PRB) was designed and installed at Australia's Casey Station. The PRB was designed to prevent further migration of a decade-old fuel spill during summer <b>melt</b> <b>periods</b> by intercepting catchment flow down-gradient of the spill. Catchment flow was intercepted using a PRB with a funnel and gate design. This is the first time a full-scale PRB has been designed and installed specifically for polar regions. This paper reports on the selection of a location for a PRB, and the subsequent design, installation and testing of the PRB throughout the first summer of operation at Casey Station, Antarctica. The PRB was designed to test five different treatments. Each treatment contained three zones: a zone of slow fertilizer release to enhance biodegradation; a zone for hydrocarbon and nutrient capture and degradation; and a zone for cation capture to contain excess nutrients released in the first zone. The materials used within these zones were required to have no adverse impact on the environment; be permeable enough to capture the entire catchment flow during the peak summer <b>melt</b> <b>period</b> without overtopping; have the ability to deliver nutrients in a controlled way; and have sufficient residence time to fully capture migrating hydrocarbons. The first zone tested different types of slow release fertilizer: MaxBacTM, ZeoProTM and zeolite preconditioned with ammonium. Sand was used for a control. For the capture of hydrocarbons the second zone contained granulated activated carbon and either: Raw St Cloud zeolite, sodium Australian zeolite, or ZeoPro. The capture of cations in the third zone was achieved with sodium Australian zeolite. The grain size of each material was relatively uniform and large enough (c. 0. 4 to 3. 5. mm) to keep the water holding capacity to a minimum {{at the end of the}} <b>melt</b> <b>period,</b> thereby maximizing permeability at the onset of the next season's melt. The PRB was keyed into the permafrost with insulation to limit the potential for flow bypassing the treatment zone, and sized to intercept the maximum flux of melt water through the upper catchment where the spill occurred. Testing of the nutrient delivery systems was performed by pumping contaminated water from a down-gradient melt lake through the PRB. Nutrient sampling indicated that all the nutrient sources chosen were able to supply ammonium to the hydrocarbon capture zone for 4 to 5 years at concentrations > 1 mgL- 1 (N as NH 4 +) and the ion exchange materials (zeolites) were found to maintain ammonium concentrations at a more consistent concentration than the coated nutrient material MaxBacTM.

The heat transfer rate could be improved, and the phase change time shortened, with an alternative design for finning of the heat pipe inside the PCM...|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 a {{displays}} {{the development of}} the IC (Eq.  13) over time for the catchment parameters (PCALT, TCALT) and the parameters of the snow routine (TT, CFMAX, SFCF, CFR). The IC of PCALT varies largely over the simulated time period; it is highest during the rainy season, when the soil moisture storage and the groundwater storages are filled and additional precipitation produces runoff, and it decreases continuously during recession periods. The IC for TCALT is significantly higher in periods with active vegetation, when the soil moisture is high. The parameters of the snow routine – with exception of CFR which has a low IC over the entire simulation time – are generally better identifiable during the snow <b>melt</b> <b>period,</b> especially during the first main melt events in spring.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how observational uncertainty in satellite-retrieved sea ice concentrations affects seasonal climate predictions. To do so, we initialize hindcast simulations with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model every 1 May and 1 November from 1981 to 2011 with two different sea ice concentration data sets, {{one based on}} the NASA Team {{and one on the}} Bootstrap algorithm. For hindcasts started in November, initial differences in Arctic sea ice area and surface temperature decrease rapidly throughout the freezing period. For hindcasts started in May, initial differences in sea ice area increase over time. By the end of the <b>melting</b> <b>period,</b> this causes significant differences in 2 meter air temperature of regionally more than 3 °C. Hindcast skill for surface temperatures over Europe and North America is higher with Bootstrap initialization during summer and with NASA Team initialization during winter. This implies that the observational uncertainty also affects forecasts of teleconnections that depend on northern hemispheric climate indices. © 2016. American Geophysical Union...|$|E
40|$|Snow depth {{variability}} at {{the plot}} scale: Assesment of topography and vegetation influence Abstract This master thesis {{deals with the}} evaluation of snow depth variability at the plot scale. It focuses on influence of topography and vegetation factors as slope, exposure, curvature, solar radiation and leaf area index. There is also assesment {{the impact of the}} size scale. Measurement was carried out in period of accumulation and snowmelt in winter 2014 / 2015 in the Krkonoše Mountains on Hanapetrova glade. To evaluate the effect of selected factors on variability of snow depth there was used multiple linear regresion and other descriptive statistical methods. The research shows that the variability of snow depth during the accumulation is greater in forest which is probably due to vegetation. The dependency was not confirmed by regression analysis. Higher variability of snow cover in the forest was also observed in the <b>melting</b> <b>period.</b> The variability of snow cover increased in the forest in general. The results show that the snow depth variability decreasses with increasing grid size. Keywords: snow accumulation, snowmelt, topography, vegetation, multivariate analysi...|$|E
40|$|Capabilities {{and methods}} for snow mapping in mountainous areas using the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) on board of ENVISAT were investigated. For {{algorithm}} development the backscattering signatures of snow covered and snow free surfaces in Alpine valleys and on mountain slopes were studied with ASAR data of different look angles and polarizations {{in comparison with}} field measurements of snow properties and meteorological data. The algorithm for automatic generation of snow maps during the <b>melting</b> <b>period</b> with ASAR applies multi-temporal change detection, the same principle as the method developed for ERS SAR. Impacts of various look angles (swathes), polarisations and image modes of ASAR for snow classification have been studied. The investigations demonstrate the suitability of ASAR Image Mode, Alternating Polarisation Mode and Wide Swath Mode for snow mapping in mountain areas, and the preference for steep incidence angle modes (IS 6 and IS 7) to minimize the loss of information due to layover and foreshortening. Time series of ASAR derived snow maps were produced for Alpine watersheds, confirming the high potential of this product for runoff modelling and forecasting. 1...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{data and}} aerial {{photographs}} were obtained over pack ice off the East Coast of Canada in March 1987 {{as part of}} the Labrador Ice Margin Experiment (LIMEX) pilot project. Examination of this data shows that although the pack ice off the Canadian East Coast appears essentially homogeneous to visible light imagery, two clearly defined zones of ice are apparent on C-band SAR imagery. To identify factors that create the zones seen on the radar image, aerial photographs were compared to the SAR imagery. Floe size data from the aerial photographs was compared to digital number values taken from SAR imagery of the same ice. The SAR data of the inner zone acquired three days apart over the <b>melt</b> <b>period</b> was also examined. The studies indicate that the radar response is governed by floe size and meltwater distribution...|$|R
40|$|Simulation of areal {{snowmelt}} and snowcover depletion {{over time}} {{can be carried out}} by applying point-scale melt rate computations to distributions of snow water equivalent (SWE). In alpine basins, this can be done by considering these processes separately on individual slope units. However, differences in melt timing and rates arise at smaller spatial scales due to the variability in SWE and snowpack cold content, which affects the timing of melt initiation, depletion of the snowcover and spatial extent of the snowmelt runoff contributing area (SRCA). This study examined the effects of variability in SWE, internal energy and applied melt energy on melt rates and timing, and snowcover depletion in a small cold regions alpine basin over various scales ranging from point to basin. Melt rate computations were performed using a physically based energy balance snowmelt routine (Snobal) in the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) and compared with measurements at 3 meteorological stations over a ridge within the basin. At the point scale, a negative association between daily melt rates and SWE was observed in the early <b>melt</b> <b>period,</b> with deeper snow requiring greater energy inputs to initiate melt. SWE distributions over the basin (stratified by slope) were measured using snow surveys and repeat LiDAR depth estimates, and used together with computed melt rates to simulate the areal snowcover depletion. Comparison with observations from georeferenced oblique photographs showed an improvement in simulated areal snowcover depletion curves when accounting for the variability in melt rate with depth of SWE in the early <b>melt</b> <b>period.</b> Finally, the SRCA was characterized as the product of the snowcovered area and the fraction of the SWE distribution undergoing active melt and producing an appreciable runoff quantity on each slope unit. Results for each slope were then aggregated to give the basin scale SRCA. The SRCA is controlled by the variability of melt amongst slope units and over individual SWE distributions, the variability of SWE, and the resulting snowcover depletion patterns over the basin...|$|R
40|$|The Antarctic sea ice is {{the site}} of {{production}} of great amounts of dissolved biogenic compounds of a very diverse nature, including potential chelators and reduced nitrogen which are introduced into adjacent surface waters in marginal ice zones during <b>melting</b> <b>periods.</b> The effect of melted brown ice on the development of surface phytoplankton in the Weddell Sea was tested experimentally using natural surface populations and cultured diatoms. The growth of natural and cultured diatoms was enhanced after various additions of melted brown ice. EDTA was also used as a standard chelator in order to compare the chelating capacities of surface water and melted ice. It was demonstrated that surface waters are not limited by lack of chelating compounds, which may originate from ice communities. The role of melted brown ice as a potential source of either ammonium or chelators affecting phytoplankton development in marginal ice zones is discussed...|$|R
