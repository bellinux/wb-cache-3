500|$|.....I {{thought about}} what I had been offered and I said to myself, [...] "What am I being so damn grand about? I have two {{children}} to support, the part they want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> {{has a lot of}} dignity, the show is already on the air, I wouldn't have to film a pilot, and they have a sponsor. This is really a great gift that has been offered me. I'd be stupid not to at least look into it." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{later said}} [...] "Jim Wong [...] {{was a big}} help, too. A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> against that and just let the situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared it and did it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E

500|$|Morgan {{attended}} Diamond Bar High School, {{where she}} was a three-time all-league pick and was named All-American by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA). At the school, she was known for her speed and sprinting ability. Morgan played for Olympic Development Program (ODP) regional and state teams as well. She later credited the program {{as an integral part}} of her development as a soccer player: [...] "... programs like ODP helped me especially because I did come into the club scene late and it was important for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> as much as possible, play with the best players and learn from the best coaches. That, for me, was crucial to my development." ...|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale {{became known}} as an action star after playing a vampire in 2003's Underworld. The film was {{markedly}} different from her previous work, and Beckinsale has said she {{was grateful for the}} change of pace after appearing in [...] "a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies," [...] adding that [...] "It was quite a challenge for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> an action heroine and pull off all that training when [...] I can’t catch a ball if it’s coming my way." [...] The film received negative to mixed reviews but was a surprise box-office hit and has gained a cult following. Also that year, she starred in the little seen Tiptoes with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{received}} an Academy Award nomination {{for the second}} year running for her work opposite Burt Lancaster in The Rainmaker (1956). Again she played a lonely woman empowered by a love affair, and it became apparent that Hepburn had found a niche in playing [...] "love-starved spinsters" [...] that critics and audiences enjoyed. Hepburn said of playing such roles, [...] "With Lizzie Curry [...] and Jane Hudson [...] and Rosie Sayer —I was playing me. It wasn't difficult for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> those women, because I'm the maiden aunt." [...] Less success that year came from The Iron Petticoat (1956), a reworking of the classic comedy Ninotchka, with Bob Hope. Hepburn played a cold-hearted Soviet pilot, a performance Bosley Crowther called [...] "horrible". It was a critical and commercial failure, and Hepburn considered it the worst film on her resume.|$|E

500|$|Producer Martin Hannett [...] "dedicated {{himself to}} {{capturing}} and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative {{because of its}} refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed {{to create a more}} expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, [...] " [...] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue". Hannett demanded clean and clear [...] "sound separation" [...] not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, [...] "Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was [...] "crucial". There are [...] "devices of distance" [...] in his production and [...] "the sound is an illusion of physicality".|$|E
500|$|In May 1970, Clancy {{was traded}} by the Dolphins to the Green Bay Packers for tight end Marv Fleming. [...] Clancy had begun a {{business}} selling {{real estate in}} Miami during the offseason, {{but he also had}} ties to Green Bay. [...] He had attended St. Matthew's Grade School there in the 1950s. [...] Clancy expressed mixed emotions about the trade: [...] "I don't like to leave Miami. [...] You hate to have to pick up and move and I definitely plan to come back (to Miami) in the offseason. [...] But most of my dad's family are still up in Green Bay. [...] He's always wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for the Packers." [...] Clancy was greeted as the first Green Bay native to play for the Packers since Wayland Becker in 1938. [...] Wisconsin columnist Lee Remmel said Clancy [...] "surveys the football scene with a pair of cool, calculating blue eyes and a computer-type mind." ...|$|E
500|$|On 6 January 1969, the band's {{third day}} at Twickenham Film Studios, in {{south-west}} London, an argument was captured on film where McCartney criticised Harrison's guitar {{playing on the}} song [...] "Two of Us". A resigned Harrison told him: [...] "I'll play what you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play." [...] With the sessions being recorded by film director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, tapes reveal Beatles associates Neil Aspinall and George Martin sympathising with Harrison's position, recognising that McCartney and Lennon [...] "don't offer him enough freedom within their compositions". Ringo Starr, who had quit the band briefly during the White Album sessions, {{partly as a result}} of McCartney's hectoring of his drumming, recalled of Harrison's refusal to be [...] "dominated" [...] by McCartney any longer: [...] "Paul [...] wanted to point out the solo to George, who would say, 'Look, I'm a guitarist. I'll play the solo.' And he always did, he always played fine solos." ...|$|E

500|$|A piano version also {{appeared}} on the DVD single, which was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly. During an interview he stated, [...] "When Björk asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> piano on Oceania, she sent me the music, {{and it was as}} complicated and layered as any piece of classical music I've played. I spent a few days figuring out how to make her vision of 'dueling lounge-lizard pianists' physically possible, and in the session, we ran through those quickly. Then, she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big, Brahmsy blocks - as well as the ending, for which we tried diaphanous, Debussy-like arpeggios". Björk decided to stick with the album's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices. Before some last-minute polishing by Mark Bell, this version of [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last track to be worked for Medúlla.|$|E
500|$|Chuck's {{father and}} co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated {{the fact that}} he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} his father {{died of a heart}} attack or stroke, Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders. The Packers {{traveled}} to Oakland where Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first half and 399 total yards in a 41–7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from [...] "Raider Nation"). He completed 73.3% of his passes and finished the game with a passer rating of 154.9 with having recorded a perfect 158.3 rating with four touchdowns and over 250 yards passing by halftime (a feat accomplished by only four other passers in NFL history). Afterwards, Favre said, [...] "I knew that my dad would have wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching tonight." [...] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.|$|E

500|$|R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck {{wrote the}} main riff and chorus {{to the song}} on a {{mandolin}} while watching television one day. Buck had just bought the instrument and was attempting to learn how <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it, recording the music as he practiced. Buck said that [...] "when I listened back to it the next day, there {{was a bunch of}} stuff that was really just <b>me</b> learning how <b>to</b> <b>play</b> mandolin, and then there's what became 'Losing My Religion', and then a whole bunch more of <b>me</b> learning <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the mandolin." ...|$|R

500|$|Åkerman {{is noted}} for {{frequently}} appearing in nude scenes in her films, such as The Heartbreak Kid and Watchmen. She {{has stated that}} she feels comfortable {{as long as the}} scenes are not gratuitous. In an interview for Daily Mail, she commented, [...] "I {{spent a lot of time}} as a child in Sweden; it’s natural there ... I don't know many women who go to bed with their husband at night and have sex with a bra on ... So let's make it real in the movies." [...] In 2008, she made her first appearance on AskMen.com's [...] "99 Most Desirable Women" [...] list at number 60. The same year, men's magazine Maxim placed her at number 59 in their annual [...] "Hot 100" [...] rankings. The following year, the magazine ranked her at number four. Although admitting that sex appeal is one of the [...] "best assets", Åkerman considers being beautiful both [...] "a blessing and a curse", stating, [...] "I tend to get a lot of scripts in which people want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the trophy wife, which is frustrating because I want the interesting, meaty roles." ...|$|E
500|$|Ron Swanson {{was created}} by Parks and Recreation creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, {{although}} Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation. Offerman said in July 2012 that [...] "NBC really resisted giving me this part. It took five months for me from the time Mike Schur and Greg Daniels said they wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> this part. NBC insisted on auditioning every other guy in the country, and then they finally acquiesced." [...] The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur encountered in Burbank while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, [...] "I don't really believe in the mission of my job [...] [...] [...] I'm aware of the irony." [...] Ron is also partially inspired by political appointees of President George W. Bush who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing. Ron's signature mustache {{was one of the}} first ideas conceived for the character. Offerman said the deadpan style of humor he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an altar boy: [...] "I would read things with the utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because he knew I was full of shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Klepacki {{has said}} that the most {{rewarding}} part of composing video game music is working with a team—which he compares to chemistry between band members—and knowing he is part of a greater cause. He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games. He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores, preferably next to video games in electronic departments. He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies. He also noted in 2008 that [...] "composition and engineering skills are now required," [...] advising upstart composers to ensure their work is film-quality. Klepacki is happy to see older games offered on the Wii, hoping that gamers are [...] "recognizing once again that simple, short fun experiences are just as good as...long, huge-production experiences." [...] Klepacki listed several influences for his style of composition: [...] "John Williams naturally for my love of Star Wars and his style in general, Michael Kamen for his composing diversity, Metallica for sparking my metal influence, Vince Dicola who in my opinion is way under-rated for his great work, Sly & The Family Stone for inspiring funk, syncopation, and positive energy, Larry Graham for inspiring <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> funk bass, Nine Inch Nails for their unique uses of mangled sound, and Rob Zombie for combining music with a theme and persona." ...|$|E

500|$|Bell {{was drafted}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants. [...] In late November, {{columnist}} David Bushnell wrote an article, [...] "Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?," [...] questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. [...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays." [...] The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: [...] "Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball[...] [...] [...] If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead." [...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It takes me about a quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. [...] I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't do much about it." [...] Bell also added, [...] "Sure it's been hard for me to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job. [...] I think it's better for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a lot, but then again I'm not the coach." ...|$|E
500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E
500|$|The school’s {{refusal to}} play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later {{became part of}} the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. Ward {{recalled}} that he met “my man Jerry” during freshman orientation in 1932, and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games. When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He urged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and we probably won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. You owe it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E
