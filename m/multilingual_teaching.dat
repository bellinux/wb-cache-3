50|$|The {{ideology}} behind translanguaging {{emerged from}} the evolution of <b>multilingual</b> <b>teaching</b> practices, particularly the practices promoted by Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), an international association designed to advance the quality of English language instruction. The beginnings of bilingual education in the United States asserted the primacy of speech and fostered a stark neglect of written language learning. The second language instruction of the 1960s and 70s heavily utilized oral-aural drills, and written portions of the courses were mimetic and repetition oriented, and structure, form, syntax, and grammar were given priority status for learners. In this system there was no focus on actual language use, {{which led to a}} lack of knowledge about how language and communication work in real practice.|$|E

5000|$|The New London Group is a {{group of}} ten {{academics}} who met at New London, New Hampshire, in the United States in September 1994, to develop a new literacy pedagogy that would serve concerns facing educators as the existing literacy pedagogy did not meet the learning needs of students. Their focus was on replacing the existing monolingual, monocultural, and standardized literacy pedagogy that prioritized reading and writing, with a pedagogy that used multiple modes of meaning making. They emphasised the use of multiple modes of communication, languages, and multiple Englishes to reflect the impact of new technologies and linguistic and cultural diversity, instead of developing competence in a single national language and standardized form of English. The ten academics brought to the discussion their expertise and personal experience from different national and professional contexts. Courtney Cazden from the United States has worked in the areas of classroom discourse and <b>multilingual</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning; Bill Cope from Australia, on literacy pedagogy and linguistic diversity, and new technologies of representation and communication; Mary Kalantzis from Australia, on experimental social education and citizenship education; Norman Fairclough from the United Kingdom, on critical discourse analysis, social practices and discourse, and the relationship between discursive change and social and cultural change; Gunther Kress from the United Kingdom, on social semiotics, visual literacy, discourse analysis, and multimodal literacy; James Gee from the United States, on psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language and literacy; Allan Luke from Australia on critical literacy and applied linguistics; Carmen Luke from Australia, on feminism and critical pedagogy; Sarah Michaels from the United States, on classroom discourse; and Martin Nataka on indigenous education and higher education curriculum.

40|$|Readers {{must seek}} for {{permission}} to reproduce this workThis paper reports on a research project which set out to explore what happens when students at an English medium university in South Africa are given opportunities to negotiate conceptual understanding in their primary languages. The project employed a range of methods, including concept translation, multilingual tutorial groups, interviews and a survey questionnaire to develop a richer understanding of the possibilities for <b>multilingual</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning in English medium tertiary education settings in South Africa. By allowing the student voices in the bilingual tutorial discussions to illustrate the complex difficulties that students face when they negotiate understanding of new concepts in their primary languages, this paper develops a textured understanding of multilingual concept formation.

L 2 learning tended to be enfolded in L 1 use at the start of sequences, and increasingly enveloped in L 2 use towards the end of sequences. Within learning cycles, teachers tended to use language shift of each type in preparing L 2 learning tasks, and in elaborating meanings, while students tended to respond in L 2, and teachers evaluated responses in L 2.|$|E

When the language undergoes attrition because of global culture, many aspects in culture will also be extinct.

40|$|Linguists {{have become}} {{increasingly}} more aware and active {{in the field of}} Language Revitalisation since Michael Krauss’ call to action in 1992. In his article ‘The World’s Languages in Crisis’ Krauss estimated a ninety percent extinction rate for the world’s languages by the year 2100. Changing global and regional economies, as well as increased language contact, have created both external and internal pressures for many minority and indigenous populations to shift to dominant languages (Bradley, 2010). Bradley (2010) argues that the modern situation of globalisation does not lend itself to supporting monolingual situations, but multilingualism doesn’t have to mean indigenous languages are lost. He believes instead that indigenous languages can still be maintained alongside of additional languages in a bilingual or multilingual model, where the indigenous language can still be used in the ways the people choose to use it. With Bradley’s thesis in mind, this paper will explore a ‘translanguaging’ case study trialled at the International School of the Hague from 2011.

Hymes often reminded applied and educational linguists that despite the potential equality of all languages, differences in language and language use too often become a basis for social discrimination and actual inequality.

This study mainly discusses their perception of English learning barriers and strategies in American universities, focusing on undergraduate Chinese {{international students}}. Research questions include: What themes emerge from interviews with undergraduate Chinese international students? How do they perceive their academic English learning? In what ways do undergraduate Chinese international students improve their academic English language skills? This is a qualitative study employing personal interviews with thirteen participants. Participants are undergraduate Chinese international students at a large public university in Washington State. Close text analysis was conducted to further study how these participants perceive their academic English learning. Based on this study, undergraduate Chinese international students feel struggled with their academic English, especially in reading and writing. Students have a similar awareness of disciplinary distinctions. Most of them believe that different disciplines have different demands for academic English. They try to improve their academic English by consciously using certain strategies, including self-study as well as social interactions. These students also feel that their learning experiences are significantly influenced by social interactions with native English speakers. Intercultural communications play a great role in their perceptions of academic English learning. The implications of my findings are: (a) undergraduate Chinese international students feel they need more support with their academic English reading and writing. Students from Humanities are in need of extra help with academic writing and students from Science need to improve reading; (b) an inclusive environment should be built to make international students feel belonged, thus they can further improve their self-efficacy. Intercultural communications should be encouraged in or after class so that students can mutually better understand each other.

40|$|The Indonesian {{community}} generally perceives that English {{language teaching}} should require phonology, vocabulary, grammar, discourse, and pragmatics. As a result, this often demands that pre-school teachers use English all the time. Code switching between English, Indonesian, and Minang – the local {{language of the}} region – is perceived negatively, and teachers are often criticized for using a multilingual approach that is “part snake and part eel” [sakarek ula sakarek baluik]. This refers to a negative perception of mixing languages in educational settings. In fact, code switching between Minang (first language), Indonesian (second language), and English (foreign language) is the norm of language use {{in this part of}} Indonesia. However, in this community, {{there is a lack of}} respect for pre-school teachers' professionalism as well as scepticism towards the effectiveness of a <b>multilingual</b> <b>teaching</b> approach, which is used widely at the pre-school level. Vygotsky [14], the Russian psychologist, presents a different perspective on this phenomenon, noting that children learn languages by playing. Their first language can be the main tool to help them understand new words and utterances in context. By using code switching, teachers help pre-school children to link their prior knowledge and experience to the new forms of expression that enable them to derive the meaning of new words from the social context of language use. For this reason, scaffolding techniques should be used by pre-school teachers, particularly in ways which support children's cognitive development in constructing new meanings based on their first language experience. This paper, based on a research study-in-progress at Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia, explores patterns of interaction between pre-school teachers and their students as teachers scaffold the development of EFL through dramatic play in West Sumatera, Indonesia. This interaction is systemic in nature and demonstrates consistent patterns of language use. The data described here is derived from a collaborative Action Research project with pre-school teachers in this community. The results are presented in the form of a narrative inquiry. These results challenge local perceptions of teachers' effectiveness in language education. Children, who have been taught English language through scaffolding, demonstrate physical, social, and cognitive development as a result of learning in and through playing in a multilingual context. This shows the positive role of code switching in EFL teaching at pre-school level in West Sumatera, and suggests a need to challenge existing community perceptions, thereby prompting a more serious consideration of this approach to EFL teaching in complex multilingual learning contexts...|$|E

Specifically, 29 % (31) of the participants argued that multilingual and multicultural aspects need to be integrated, either as an element during teacher education, or as a value that the trainee teachers should know how to promote and teach themselves. This is in line with a European vision of citizenship as promoted by the European Profile of Language Teacher Education (Kelly and Grenfell 2004, 42): “European citizenship corresponds to a set of shared values and beliefs in democracy, the rule of law, the free press and a shared cultural heritage”. Despite these statements and identified needs in this area of European language teaching, participants agree that little is available about the content of these European values.|$|R

With music you can practice accent, vocal clang, pitch, and rhythmics. Music has a social influence and creates safe atmosphere in the classroom. It even creates a place of meetings between different cultures and generations. This way of working requires a brave, flexible and a direct pedagogue. There are different ways of working with music as a method in second language teaching. The students can translate favorite songs from their homelands and then teach their classmates the same song in both languages. Together you can create your own songs connected to other theoretical subjects in school. The students can shape music and songs by drawing pictures and then let them write texts to their own pictures. What is obvious is that music promotes second language progress. ...|$|R
