This Consensus Document has been prepared by a panel of experts of the Spanish Society of Cardiovascular Infections, in cooperation with experts from the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine, Spanish Society of Chemotherapy, and the Spanish Society of Thoracic-Cardiovascular Surgery, and aims to define and establish guidelines for the management of short duration peripheral vascular catheters. The document addresses the indications for insertion, catheter <b>maintenance,</b> <b>registering,</b> diagnosis and treatment of infection, indications for removal, as well as placing an emphasis on continuous education as a drive toward quality. Implementation of these guidelines will allow uniformity in use, thus minimizing the risk of infections and their complications...|$|R

5000|$|Cullen {{was sent}} to Ireland to bring the Irish church into {{conformity}} with Roman canon law and usage. His first major act as Archbishop of Armagh was to convene the Synod of Thurles (1850), the first Roman Catholic national synod held in Ireland since the Reformation. It occurred {{during the period of}} the debilitating Irish Famine which reduced the population of the country by over 2 million people through starvation, disease and emigration. The purpose of the synod was to establish a new ecclesiastical discipline in Ireland. This included rules relating to the celebration of Mass, the administration of the sacraments and the <b>maintenance</b> of <b>registers</b> and archives. Twenty-five years later, Cullen, once more presided at the national synod held in Maynooth in 1875. He recruited new clergy and orders of religious brother and sisters. After a series of disastrous harvest in the 1860s, he founded, with the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Mansion House Relief Committee in 1862. Cullen also started the practice of Irish priests wearing Roman collars and being called [...] "Father" [...] (instead of [...] "Mister") by their parishioners.|$|R

The ideas of the registered capital of a joint stock company and its creation and protection as well as the ideas of functions which registered capital should undertake inside and outside the company and principles which should be followed for this purpose have stabilized within the European (continental) legal culture in an opinion scheme which can be generally called "a doctrine about a creation and <b>maintenance</b> of <b>registered</b> capital". The principles undertaken by this doctrine are anchored in the laws of the countries of the European (continental) legal culture mainly by cogent rules of law. The aforesaid doctrine has been a subject of polemic at the experts level and there has long time been an endeavour about a revision of this relatively stable system with reference to its imperfections.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if African-American nurses who are educated at a community college remain in their respective communities. Since one focus of healthcare reform is health maintenance and/or prevention of health problems, and some African-American clients do not seek preventive care and/or practice health <b>maintenance,</b> the <b>registered</b> nurse may be the best source for health care in the African-American community. The prospect that African-American nurses stay in the community after graduation may warrant consideration in the selective admission processes of nursing programs. ^ A case study of three urban Community Colleges was utilized. The researcher interviewed the department chairperson at each of the nursing programs for the purpose of identifying the geographic boundaries of the college 2 ̆ 7 s community, admission criteria, and the history of the nursing program. Students in three cohort groups (1985, 1990, and 1995) from each institution were surveyed for their work history and community participation. Data provided by survey respondents was analyzed utilizing conditional logit models. The results indicate that admission criteria could be expanded to include the likelihood of working in the college 2 ̆ 7 s service area. Said criteria could increase the number of African-American nursing graduates thereby improving health care services in minority communities. In short, it could capture an important variable of the social contributions of these community college students. ...|$|R

Although the content is focused on the study-based register of randomized/controlled clinical trials, this work applies to developers of databases of all sorts of studies related to the human, animals, cells, genes, and molecules. Methods: We describe necessity, rationale, and steps for the development, utilization and <b>maintenance</b> of study-based <b>registers</b> as well as the challenges and gains for the organizations supporting systematic reviews of the published and unpublished literature. Conclusion: The ultimate goal of having a study-based register is to facilitate efficient production of systematic reviews providing rapid, yet accurate, evidence for the decision-makers.

40|$|Abstract Background Perinatal {{mortality}} {{is an important}} indicator of obstetric and newborn care services. Although {{the vast majority of}} global perinatal {{mortality is}} estimated to occur in developing countries, there is a critical paucity of reliable data at the local level to inform health policy, plan health care services, and monitor their impact. This paper explores the utility of information from village health registers to measure perinatal mortality at the sub district level in a rural area of Indonesia. Methods A retrospective pregnancy cohort for 2007 was constructed by triangulating data from antenatal care, birth, and newborn care registers in a sample of villages in three rural sub districts in Central Java, Indonesia. For each pregnancy, birth outcome and first week survival were traced and recorded from the different registers, as available. Additional local death records were consulted to verify perinatal mortality, or identify deaths not recorded in the health registers. Analyses were performed to assess data quality from registers, and measure perinatal mortality rates. Qualitative research was conducted to explore knowledge and practices of village midwives in <b>register</b> <b>maintenance</b> and reporting of perinatal mortality. Results Field activities were conducted in 23 villages, covering a total of 1759 deliveries that occurred in 2007. Perinatal mortality outcomes were 23 stillbirths and 15 early neonatal deaths, resulting in a perinatal mortality rate of 21. 6 per 1000 live births in 2007. Stillbirth rates for the study population were about four times the rates reported in the routine Maternal and Child Health program information system. Inadequate awareness and supervision, and alternate workload were cited by local midwives as factors resulting in inconsistent data reporting. Conclusions Local maternal and child health registers are a useful source of information on perinatal mortality in rural Indonesia. Suitable training, supervision, and quality control, in conjunction with computerisation to strengthen <b>register</b> <b>maintenance</b> can provide routine local area measures of perinatal mortality for health policy, and monitoring of newborn care interventions. Similar efforts are required to strengthen routine health data in all developing countries, to guide planned progress towards reduction in the local, national and international burden from perinatal mortality. </p...|$|R

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldDrug doses, blood levels of drug metabolites and myelotoxicity during 6 -mercaptopurine/methotrexate (MTX) <b>maintenance</b> therapy were <b>registered</b> for 59 adolescents (>or= 10 years) and 176 non-adolescents (< 10 years) with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and a {{white blood cell count}} (WBC) < 50 x 10 (9) /l at diagnosis. Event-free survival was lower for adolescents than non-adolescents (pEFS(12 y) : 0. 71 vs 0. 83, P= 0. 04). For adolescents staying in remission, the mean WBC during maintenance therapy (mWBC) was related to age (r(S) = 0. 36, P= 0. 02), which became nonsignificant for those who relapsed (r(S) = 0. 05, P= 0. 9). The best-fit multivariate Cox regression model to predict risk of relapse included mWBC and thiopurine methyltransferase activity, which methylates mercaptopurine and reduces the intracellular availability of cytotoxic 6 -thioguanine nucleotides (coefficient: 0. 11, P= 0. 02). The correlation of mWBC to the risk of relapse was more pronounced for adolescents (coefficient= 0. 65, P= 0. 003) than for non-adolescents (coefficient= 0. 42, P= 0. 04). Adolescents had higher mean neutrophil counts (P= 0. 002) than non-adolescents, but received nonsignificantly lower mercaptopurine and MTX doses during maintenance therapy. Red blood cell MTX levels were significantly related to the dose of MTX among adolescents who stayed in remission (r(S) = 0. 38, P= 0. 02), which was not the case for those who developed a relapse (r(S) = 0. 15, P= 0. 60).

40|$|The basic {{function}} of the Medical Council is the <b>maintenance</b> of the <b>Register.</b> The purpose {{of this is to}} protect the public by enabling it to distinguish between qualified and unqualified practitioners, and the disciplinary, educational and ethical functions of the Council are geared towards ensuring that a doctor who is on the Register - be it one who is fully, provisionally or temporarily registered as a doctor to whom the public can turn with confidence. No problem arises with those doctors who graduate in Ireland, because the Medical Practitioners Act gives the Council the power to control the standards of the teaching and examinations of the Irish Medical Schools. Equally, under the Treaty of Rome any doctor who graduates in a School within the Community has the right, given clearance by his or her registering authority, to become fully registered in Ireland. An Irish medical graduate has a similar right to registration in any of the other Member States, again given clearance by the Council. What is not generally recognised, and this has given rise to widespread misunderstanding, is that this right depends basically on the place of qualification and not on nationality. Even a native-born Irish citizen who qualifies from a Medical School situated outside the Community, which is not recognised by the Council, has not the right to registration in this country. This is one of the obligations imposed on us by membership of the Community, and its application in all the Member States is very closely monitored by the Conference des Ordres the co-ordinating body for all the registering authorities. It might also be pointed out that there are few, if any, countries outside the European Communities in which Irish graduates may enter practice without very stringent entry requirements, usually including an examination, and in some {{they may not be able}} to practise at all...|$|R
50|$|At 1:30pm on 1 April 2011, a Zig Zag Railway {{maintenance}} vehicle (the Hi-Rail), {{collided with a}} two-car Rail Motor on the No 1 Viaduct, Top Road, between Clarence and Top Points stations. The Hi-Rail, with a Driver and Passenger on board, was freewheeling down the hill in reverse in the section from Clarence towards Top Points. The Rail Motor, operated by a Driver, was travelling empty {{in the opposite direction}} from Top Points. The Rail Motor Driver saw the approaching vehicle and applied the brakes. However, the two persons on board the Hi-Rail, facing the opposite direction, did not see the Rail Motor before the collision. The force of the collision compacted the body of the Hi-Rail such that neither cab door would open. The two occupants of the Hi-Rail were injured in the collision and were assisted out of the Hi-Rail and onto the Rail Motor by the Rail Motor Driver who was uninjured. The force of the collision caused a minor misalignment of the track. The investigation established that the collision resulted from the Driver of the Rail Motor and the Driver of the Hi-Rail not being aware that they were travelling towards each other on the same track in the Top Points-Clarence section. This lack of situational awareness resulted from procedural errors. The Rail Motor Driver departed Top Points without communicating his intention to his Guard or the Hi-Rail crew, and the Rail Motor Guard exceeded his authority by authorising the Hi-Rail to leave a worksite and proceed to Top Points. A number of other factors were found to have contributed to the collision, particularly a lack of radio communications and operational safeworking errors. Other safety issues identified during the investigation included delayed notification of the accident; poor <b>maintenance</b> of Train <b>Register</b> Books; passengers travelling in the Rail Motor driver's cab; Rail Motor Driver's fatigue; and excess speed of the Hi-Rail.|$|R
40|$|Continuity of {{follow-up}} {{is extremely important}} for the diabetic, to ensure that treatable complications such as retinopathy are detected at an early stage. Therefore, {{it is important to}} ensure that patients are not lost to follow-up and to know when they have been. Defining waht is meant by lost to follow-up, and identifying patients who have been lost, from traditionally organised outpatient clinics is not always easy. We have retrospectively studied 3537 patients who at some time attended a diabetes outpatient clinic over a seven year period, to assess how many were lost to follow-up. During this period, a computer system was established which included the booking of appointments and the <b>maintenance</b> of a <b>register</b> of patients. We have compared losses from the traditional clinic (19 per month) with the new computer-assisted clinic (seven per month). Estimates of the proportion of those who were lost to follow-up vary depending on the criteria adopted. Data from a patient survey suggest that in excess of 17 % were lost from the traditional clinic. An audit of case notes suggests that the proportion of those leaving the computer-assisted clinic who were lost was lower after the implementation of the computer system (29 % vs 7 %) (X 2 = 4. 1; 1 df; p< 0. 05). Of those last seen at a clinic more than three years ago, 30 % had not had an eye examination within three years. The process of identifying and following-up patients who had left the traditional clinic took nine person-months compared to a few days for patients leaving the computer-assisted clinic. Even in the absence of special efforts for the maintenance of the continuity of care, an appropriately designed clinical information system and improved clinic organisation will reduce losses to follow-up. However, our aim should be to eliminate losses to follow-up, and such systems should be used to promote a population approach to the maintenance of continuity of care through, for example, community-based registers and purpose designed shared-care schemes. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
