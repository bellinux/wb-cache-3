The drawbacks of conventional processes (hydrogen and carbothermic reduction schemes) are overcome by resorting to solution-based reduction schemes and are made economically feasible using iron oxides from steel industry’s <b>mill-scale</b> waste. A novel aqueous-based room temperature technique using sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) as the reducing agent has been developed that produces highly active nanoscale iron particles (40 nm). By using hydrazine as an inexpensive and, compared with NaBH 4, more stable reductant, body centered cubic iron particles with 5 nm edges were obtained via solvothermal process under mild conditions from acid digested <b>mill-scale</b> waste.

40|$|A <b>mill-scale</b> hydrometallurgical {{experiment}} (2700 m 3 of effluent treated/day) {{was conducted}} {{for three months}} at the Rabbit Lake uranium mine site located in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, to determine the controls on the solubility of dissolved arsenic over a pH range of 1 − 11 {{and to develop a}} thermodynamic database for the dominant mineralogical controls on arsenic in the mill and the resulting mill tailings. The arsenic concentrations in the mill ranged from 526 mg/L at pH 1. 0 (initial) to 1. 34 mg/L at pH 10. 8 (final discharge). Geochemical modeling of the chemistry data shows that arsenic solubility is controlled by the formation of scorodite (FeAsO 4 · 2 H 2 O) from pH 2. 4 to pH 3. 1, with 99. 8 % of dissolved arsenic precipitated as scorodite. Model results show that scorodite is unstable (releasing arsenic back in to solution) above pH 3. 1 and arsenic adsorption to the surface of 2 -line ferrihydrite is the dominant controlling factor in the solubility of arsenic from pH 3. 2 to pH 11. 0, with 99. 8 % of dissolved arsenic removed from solution via this mechanism. Finally, model results show ∼ 0. 2 % of the total dissolved arsenic adsorbs to the surface of amorphous aluminum hydroxide from pH 5. 0 to pH 8. 0.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of the potential degradation mechanisms of Types I and II High-Level Waste (HLW) Tanks determined that pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking were the two most significant degradation mechanisms. Specifically, nitrate induced stress corrosion cracking {{was determined to be}} the principal degradation mechanism for the primary tank steel of non-stress relieved tanks. Controls on the solution chemistry have been in place to preclude the initiation and propagation of degradation in the tanks. However, recent experience has shown that steel not in contact with the bulk waste solution or slurry, but exposed to the ''vapor space'' above the bulk waste, may be vulnerable to the initiation and propagation of degradation, including pitting and stress corrosion cracking. A program to resolve the issues associated with potential vapor space corrosion is in place. The objective of the program is to develop understanding of vapor space (VSC) and liquid/air interface (LAIC) corrosion to ensure a defensible technical basis to provide accurate corrosion evaluations with regard to vapor space and liquid/air interface corrosion (similar to current evaluations). There are several needs for a technically defensible basis with sufficient understanding to perform these evaluations. These include understanding of the (1) surface chemistry evolution, (2) corrosion response through coupon testing, and (3) mechanistic understanding through electrochemical studies. Experimentation performed in FY 02 determined the potential for vapor space and liquid/air interface corrosion of ASTM A 285 - 70 and ASTM A 537 -Cl. 1 steels. The material surface characteristics, i. e. <b>mill-scale,</b> polished, were found to {{play a key role in}} the pitting response. The experimentation indicated that the potential for limited vapor space and liquid/air interface pitting exists at 1. 5 M nitrate solution when using chemistry controls designed to prevent stress corrosion cracking. Experimentation performed in FY 03 quantified pitting rates as a function of material surface characteristics, including <b>mill-scale</b> and defects within the <b>mill-scale.</b> Testing was performed on ASTM A 537 -Cl. 1 (normalized) steel, the material of construction of the Type III HLW tanks. The pitting rates were approximately 3 mpy for exposure above inhibited solutions, as calculated from the limited exposure times. This translates to a penetration time of 166 years for a 0. 5 -in tank wall provided that the pitting rate remains constant and the bulk solution chemistry is maintained within the L 3 limit. The FY 04 testing consisted of electrochemical testing to potentially lend insight into the surface chemistry and further understand the corrosion mechanism in the vapor space. Electrochemical testing lends insight into the corrosion processes through the determination of current potential relationships. The results of the electrochemical testing performed during FY 04 are presented here...|$|E
40|$|Three {{simulated}} waste solutions representing wastes from tanks SY- 102 (high nitrate, {{modified to}} exceed guidance limits), AN- 107, and AY- 102 were supplied by PNNL. Out {{of the three}} solutions tested, both optical and electrochemical results show that carbon steel samples corroded much faster in SY- 102 (high nitrate) than {{in the other two}} solutions with lower ratios of nitrate to nitrite. The effect of the surface preparation was not as strong as the effect of solution chemistry. In areas with pristine <b>mill-scale</b> surface, no corrosion occurred even in the SY- 102 (high nitrate) solution, however, corrosion occurred in the areas where the <b>mill-scale</b> was damaged or flaked off due to machining. Localized corrosion in the form of pitting in the vapor space of tank walls is an ongoing challenge to overcome in maintaining the structural integrity of the liquid waste tanks at the Savannah River and Hanford Sites. It has been shown that the liquid waste condensate chemistry influences the amount of corrosion that occurs along the walls of the storage tanks. To minimize pitting corrosion, an effort is underway to gain an understanding of the pitting response in various simulated waste solutions. Electrochemical testing has been used as an accelerated tool in the investigation of pitting corrosion. While significant effort has been undertaken to evaluate the pitting susceptibility of carbon steel in various simulated waste solutions, additional effort is needed to evaluate the effect of liquid waste supernates from six Hanford Site tanks (AY- 101, AY- 102, AN- 102, AN- 107, SY- 102 (high Cl{sup -}), and SY- 102 (high nitrate)) on carbon steel. Solutions were formulated at PNNL to replicate tank conditions, {{and in the case of}} SY- 102, exceed Cl{sup -} and NO{sub 3 }{sup -} conditions, respectively, to provide a contrast between in and out of specification limits. The majority of previous testing has been performed on pristine polished samples. To evaluate the actual tank carbon steel surface, efforts are needed to compare the polished surfaces to corroded and <b>mill-scale</b> surfaces, which are more likely to occur in application. Additionally, due to the change in liquid waste levels within the tanks, salt deposits are highly likely to be present along the tank wall. When the level of the tank decreases, a salt deposit will form as the solution evaporates. The effects of this pre-existing salt, or supernate deposit, are unknown at this time on the corrosion effect and thus require investigation. Additionally, in the presence of radiation, moist air undergoes radiolysis, forming a corrosive nitric acid condensate. This condensate could accelerate the corrosion process in the vapor space. To investigate this process, an experimental apparatus simulating the effects of radiation was designed and constructed to provide gamma irradiation while coupons are exposed to a simulate tank solution. Additionally, ammonia vapors will also be introduced to further represent the tank environment...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on an {{experimental}} study of the pressure conditions in the refining zone of high-consistency refiners used in paper making. The work presents the findings from two different <b>mill-scale</b> experiments in addition to results obtained from a pilot refiner study. The experiments have been performed using two different types of pressure sensors: • Fibre-optic pressure sensors based on extrinsic Fabry Perot interferometer (EFPI). • Piezoresistive temperature and pressure transducers. This study has shown {{that it is possible to}} establish high-frequency pressure measurements in the refining zone of high-consistency refiners. Data have been collected at rates up to 20 million samples per second. The fibre-optic sensors seem to be preferable to the piezoresistive transducers as the fibre-optic sensors were working well after long exposure to the harsh environment inside the refining zone. Reliable measurements were still obtained after 1000 operating hours. On the other hand, the piezoresistive sensors suffered from problems caused by the wet environment inside the refiner as well as from the electrical dependent circuits and transmission cables. However, in the pilot refiner under less harsh environment, the piezoresistive transducer functioned well. The main focus in this thesis has been related to the second <b>mill-scale</b> experiment which used fibre-optic pressure sensors. The results obtained from this experiment are considered to be more valuable than those from the first <b>mill-scale</b> experiment which used combined piezoresistive pressure and temperature transducers. Furthermore, pulp samples were collected during the second <b>mill-scale</b> experiment allowing an even more comprehensive analysis. However, the results from the first <b>mill-scale</b> experiment are shown as a comparison and in order to demonstrate the challenge of selecting the appropriate technology. Results from a successfully test performed in the pilot refiner, which also used a combined piezoresistive pressure and temperature transducer, are shown as well. In addition, as a supplement to the results from the <b>mill-scale</b> experiment with fibre-optic sensors, an experiment which employed external accelerometers for measuring the high-frequency vibrations in the mill refiner is discussed. Another supplement was made through an experiment measuring the deviation of the rotational speed of the refiner shaft. The main objective of this study has been to find out how to make high-frequency pressure measurements in the refining zone of a <b>mill-scale</b> high-consistency TMP refiner. The study has particularly focused on the signal analyses and the reliability of the pressure measurements. Since the investigations have been focused on the experimental issues, assessments are primarily made regarding the recorded data and the related process observations. One of the challenges was to find suitable technology for use in a harsh environment. Obtaining and selecting an appropriate sensor was extremely important. A fast responding sensor was prerequisite. It was of particular interest to investigate the pressure pulses generated from the squeezing of wood particles between the sensor surface and the bars on the opposite disc. In addition, the dimension of the sensor surface had to be small so that the peak pressures could be determined. The size should preferably be smaller than a width of a bar. Especially the fibre-optic sensors met this criterion as they had a surface diameter of approximately 1 mm. The piezoresistive sensors had a surface diameter of 3. 8 mm. <b>Mill-scale</b> experiments were conducted to test the sensors in a realistic environment. The design of the experiments was important in the assessment of the performance of the sensors during different controlled conditions. Collecting of pulp samples to assess the pulp quality of the primary refining in comparison to the process behaviour and the pressure signals were matters of additional interest. The analyses of the experiment should give conclusions about the reliability of the sensors. A goal of the present work has also been to examine the behaviour and the properties of the pressure signals, and investigate the origin of the pressure pulses. Most of the results are from high-frequency measurements of pressure in the refining zone of a high-consistency TMP refiner. Combined temperature and pressure measurements are shown from the test in the pilot refiner. The fast development within sensor and computer technology has made it possible to achieve measurements that have not been performed earlier. The use of fibre-optic sensor technology in chip refiners has not been reported earlier. The high-frequency recordings using sample rates of up to 20 MSamples/s suffered from the lack of demodulation technology such that the accuracy of the absolute pressure readings is limited. However, this study indicates average pressures between 20 and 30 bar in the intermediate zone. Even more interesting is the fast pressure changes obtained using frequency analysis. Common frequencies indicating vibrations in the discs appearing from the pressure pulses when the pulp is squeezed between the bars of the stator and rotor disc have been observed. This observation was supported by vibration analysis using external accelerometers. It is claimed that there is a relationship between vibrations in the refiner discs and the pressure pulses that are generated from the squeezing of pulp between bars on the rotor and stator disc. However, nobody has investigated this particular relationship although this study strongly indicates that this relationship exists. Furthermore, it is shown that the pressure sensors were not affected by vibrations operating in resonance. This strongly supports the conclusion that the fibre-optic pressure sensors were solely measuring the activities in the refining zone. The frequency analysis of the different recordings gave firm evidence of the process related influences of the pressure readings. The reliability of the performance of the sensors was clearly visible through this analysis technique. Several analyses found that the shift in the bar crossing frequencies was directly proportional to and caused by fluctuations in the rotational speed of the refiner. However, local bar crossing frequencies were generally not as clear as expected. The measurements indicated that some specific radial positions determined by the tapered plate pattern, dominated the responses. Among the most dominating frequencies were periodicities associated with the rotational speed of the refiner, the number of bars in the breaker bar and coarse zones as well as the transition zone between the intermediate and fine bar zones. When the plates were new, a 25. 2 kHz periodicity that arose from a bar-to-bar passage in the fine bar zone dominated the pressure readings. These pulses probably propagated in the disc so that the whole disc vibrated. It is not assumed that these vibrations generated large plate gap variations. However, these fluctuations were predominant compared with the local generated pressure pulses. The pressure variations probably propagated through the steam and pulp pad as pressure waves. Thus the pulp and steam flow through the whole refining zone was affected. The local bar crossing frequencies were suppressed and only visible to a minor extent. It is conceivable that the steam and pulp interacts through a two-phase flow. Thus the steam may have a repressive effect on the interaction between the pulp pad and the bar patterns on the discs. Recordings during different controlled operating conditions were used to study the reliability of the sensors. The relationship between the pressure signals and the process variables has been investigated as well. The most reliable relationship was obtained when changing the chip flow to the refining zone after 1000 hours of operating time. The motor load and acceleration variables were strongly correlated with the pressure readings. No strong correlations were found between the data from the pressure sensors and the process variables shortly after start-up using new plates. The pulp samples that were collected and analysed did not give a good relationship between the pressure signals and the quality data. However, during this period other process disturbances affected the conditions in the refining zone more than the randomized manipulation of the control variables. This was observed as time dependent variations in the pressure recordings as well as several process variables. The most probable disturbance was the amount of chips fed to the refiner and subsequent changes of the plate gap. Further indications imply that the pressure sensors were sensitive to variations in the incoming stream of chips. Besides the successful test when changing the chip flow to the refining zone, frequency analyses have showed that the sensors also were affected by periodicities in the pulp flow that were related to the inner part of the refining zone and the breaker bar section. This was shown both as sideband effects as well as plain peak frequencies. Sideband effects are interpreted as periodic waves of pulp flow propagated through the refining zone. This study indicates that the average pressure in the intermediate zone of the refining zone of the <b>mill-scale</b> TMP refiner was as high as 20 - 30 bar. This was somewhat higher than expected from the theoretical considerations. However, the theoretical calculations have some limiting factors, which there are some disagreement in the literature. The area where the energy is applied in the refining zone as well as the tangential friction coefficient is not clearly determined. Both are included in one of the theoretical approaches. Thus there are some uncertainties associated with the models. However, some uncertainties are related to the determination of the pressure levels for the measurements using the fibre-optic sensors as well. This is mainly due to the lack of well-established demodulation techniques for the sinusoidal relation between the sensor signal and the pressure. This is the greatest weakness in this part of the investigation. The pressure levels obtained using the piezoresistive sensors were to some extent agreeable with the fibre-optic measurements. However, there was greater uncertainty in the piezoresistive measurements due to probable disturbances related to electromagnetic noise or moisture having a detrimental influence on electric circuits in the sensors. The most interesting results obtained using the piezoresistive sensors in the <b>mill-scale</b> experiment have been observations of process relevant periodic signal patterns. Stable average pressures between 2 and 4. 5 bar were found in the atmospheric pilot refiner during normal operating conditions. Since the local bar crossing frequency did not dominate the periodicities obtained from these recordings it is assumed that the steam affected the pressure conditions in the refining zone. This is assumed despite the fact that the refiner was atmospheric. Pressure peaks above 10 bar were observed frequently. When the plate gap decreased, the pressure pulses were considerably higher. Pressure peaks up to 60 bar were observed during operation with a small plate clearance. The local bar crossing frequency was clearly visible under such conditions, not otherwise. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The intensified process consists of wood softening by means of chip pretreatment with sodium sulphite, high intensity refining followed by low consistency refining.

Thorough evaluation of key paper-and print quality data showed {{that it is possible}} to produce pulp for newsprint at 1500 kWh/adt total specific energy (including auxiliary drives such as pumps, screw feeders, etc.).

Most of the Cs was transferred into the black liquor, while only a minor amount of the Cs was retained in the pulp. A minor amount of the Cs was also contained in the precipitation yielded by the acidification of the black liquor. From these results, it is suggested that the pulp from 137 Cs-contaminated woods be used if this minor amount of Cs retained in the pulp can be removed. The digested agents in black liquor can be recovered if the 137 Cs can be removed by a 137 Cs-special absorbent. In addition, the lignin could be used for further applications. The different behavior of Cs in the kraft cooking of bark and wood suggests that 137 Cs is bonded with unknown components in the bark that are difficult to dissolve in an alkaline solution. Further study at the pulp <b>mill-scale</b> would be interesting and is required for the forest industry in the Fukushima Prefecture to recover.|$|E
40|$|A high final {{brightness}} {{is desired}} in most {{paper and board}} products. This requires bleaching processes {{that are able to}} produce high-brightness pulps. Mechanical pulps are widely bleached for high brightness using alkaline hydrogen peroxide with traditional sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate as additives. With high doses however, peroxide bleaching causes high organic loads in the mill effluent and anionic trash carry-over to papermaking. To alleviate the problems that arise from the use of sodium-based additives in peroxide bleaching, interest in the use of alternative magnesium-based chemicals has increased.

To understand the mechanisms of mechanical pre-treatment, a short description of relevant refining theory and reported effects of pre-treatment on wood morphology is given. Mechanical pre-treatment offers a chance to utilize the energy needed to defibrate chips in a more efficient way, minimizing the cyclic elastic deformations which are the main defibration mechanism in refining. Studies of fibre morphology indicate that compressive pretreatment mechanically introduces favorable weak points in the S 1 and S 2 fibre walls where defibration proceeds easier upon subsequent refining. Published results which cover {{the effect of}} the pretreatment on energy consumption and pulp properties are reviewed. Energy reduction of between 10 % and 30 % is reported in the literature. High ratio of volumetric compression is necessary. Pressurized conditions are required to ensure that the fibres are not damaged during the pre-treatment. Other effects of compressive pretreatment include a more uniform chip size and moisture content, better penetration of chemicals and removal of extractives from the chips.

40|$|Most {{studies that}} have {{examined}} chloride-induced corrosion of steel in concrete have focused on sound concrete. However, reinforced concrete is seldom uncracked and very few studies have investigated the influence of cracked concrete on rebar corrosion. Furthermore, the {{studies that have}} {{examined the relationship between}} cracks and corrosion have focused on unloaded or statically loaded cracks. However, in practice, reinforced concrete structures (e. g. bridges) are often dynamically loaded. Hence, the cracks in such structures open and close which could influence the corrosion of the reinforcing steel. Consequently, the objectives of this project were (i) to examine the effect of different types of loading on the corrosion of reinforcing steel, (ii) the influence of concrete mixture design on the corrosion behaviour and (iii) to provide data {{that can be used in}} service-life modelling of cracked reinforced concretes. In this project, cracked reinforced concrete beams made with ordinary Portland cement concrete (OPCC) and high performance concrete (HPC) were subjected to no load, static loading and dynamic loading. They were immersed in salt solution to just above the crack level at their mid-point for two weeks out of every four (wet cycle) and, for the remaining two weeks, were left in ambient laboratory conditions to dry (dry cycle). The wet cycle led to three conditions of exposure for each beam: (i) the non-submerged region, (ii) the sound, submerged region and (ii) the cracked mid-section, which was also immersed in the solution. Linear polarization resistance and galvanostatic pulse techniques were used to monitor the corrosion in the three regions. Potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical current noise and concrete electrical resistance measurements were also performed. These measurements illustrated that (i) rebar corroded faster at cracks than in sound concrete, (ii) HPC was more protective towards the rebar than OPCC even at cracks and (iii) there was a minor effect of the type of loading on rebar corrosion within the period of the project. These measurements also highlighted the problems associated with corrosion measurements, for example, identifying the actual corroding area and the influence of the length of rebar. The numbers of cracks and crack-widths in each beam were measured after the beam’s initial exposure to salt solution and, again, after the final corrosion measurements. HPC beams had more cracks than the OPCC. Also, final measurements illustrated increased crack-widths in dynamically loaded beams, regardless of the concrete type. The cracks in both statically and dynamically loaded OPCC and HPC beams bifurcated at the rebar level and propagated parallel to the rebar. This project also examined the extent of corrosion on the rebars and the distribution of corrosion products in the concrete and on the concrete walls of the cracks. Corrosion occurred only at cracks in the concrete and was spread over a larger area on the rebars in HPC than those in OPCC. The damage due to corrosion was superficial in HPC and crater-like in OPCC. Regardless of the concrete type, there was a larger distribution of corrosion products on the crack walls of the dynamically loaded beams. Corrosion products diffused into the cement paste and the paste-aggregate interface in OPCC but remained in the crack in HPC. The most voluminous corrosion product identified was ferric hydroxide. Elemental analysis of <b>mill-scale</b> on rebar which was not embedded in concrete or exposed to chlorides was compared to that of the bars that had been embedded in uncontaminated concrete and in cracked concrete exposed to chlorides. In uncontaminated concrete, <b>mill-scale</b> absorbed calcium and silicon. At a crack, a layer, composed of a mixture of cement paste and corrosion products, developed between the <b>mill-scale</b> and the substrate steel. Based on the results, it was concluded that (i) corrosion occurred on the rebar only at cracks in the concrete, (ii) corrosion was initiated at the cracks immediately upon exposure to salt solution, (ii) the type of loading had a minor influence on the corrosion rates of reinforcing steel and (iv) the use of polarized area led to a significant underestimation of the current density at the crack. It is recommended that the effect of cover-depth on (i) the time to initiation of corrosion and (ii) the corrosion current density in cracked concrete be investigated...|$|E

Treatment of these pulps with xylanase enzyme could result in improved properties, showing 2. 0 % ISO gain in pulp brightness and/or reducing the demand of chlorine-based bleach chemicals by up to 15 % with simultaneous reduction of 20 to 25 % in AOX generation in bleach effluents. Further, <b>mill-scale</b> trial results revealed that enzymatic prebleaching can be successfully employed with xylanases to reach the same bleach boosting efficacy.

Further studies carried out with HOBT as mediator in comparison to the commonly used and expensive ABTS laccase mediator system (LMS) resulted in improvement of the bleaching efficiency with reduction in demand of chlorine dioxide by more than 35 %.

40|$|This work {{focused on}} {{modeling}} of the chip bed packing phenomena {{in a continuous}} kraft cooking digester. A better understanding of chip bed packing would {{make it possible to}} optimize chip flow conditions in the digester, thereby ensuring uniform fiber quality and production efficiency. Chips are fed continuously into the digester, with the chip flow forming a solid bed. As the solid chip bed moves slowly downwards, cooking reactions proceed, which leads to softening of the chips. The softening of chips and the process conditions, flows and gravitational, are major variables affecting the chip bed packing. A new computer model, TKK Packing Simulator, was created to study the chip bed packing in a continuous digester. The simulator was verified against <b>mill-scale</b> conditions by conducting measurements in a continuous cooking plant. The packing simulator was found to give an accurate picture of the process flows inside the continuous digester. As digesters have grown bigger, controlling the liquor flows in the chip bed has become increasingly important. A tracer test was used to verify the liquor flow, which can be far from ideal in a modern digester. It is important to have optimal packing and flow conditions inside the digester, because too high packing and channeling of the liquor flow leads to non-uniform cooking, production disturbances and impaired fiber quality. The simulator developed in the present research can be used to determine optimal packing and flow conditions...|$|E

Mill evaluation of Eucalyptus grandis wood chips biotreated by Ceriporiopsis subvermispora on a 50 -tonne pilot-plant demonstrated that equivalent energy savings {{can be obtained}} in lab- and <b>mill-scale</b> biopulping. Some drawbacks concerning limited improvements in pulp strength and contamination of the chip pile with opportunist fungi have been observed.

Alkaline wash restored part of the brightness in biopulps and marketable brightness values were obtained by one-stage bleaching with 5 % H 2 O 2 when bio-TMP pulps were under evaluation. Considering the current scenario, the understanding of biopulping mechanisms has gained renewed attention because more resistant and competitive fungal species could be selected with basis on a function-directed screening project. A series of studies aimed to elucidate structural changes in lignin during wood biodegradation by C. subvermispora had indicated that lignin depolymerization occurs during initial stages of wood biotreatment. Aromatic hydroxyls did not increase with the split of aryl-ether linkages, suggesting that the ether-cleavage-products remain as quitione-type structures. On the other hand, cellulose is more resistant to the attack by C subvermispora. MnP-initiated lipid peroxidation reactions have been proposed to explain degradation of non-phenolic lignin substructures by C subvermispora, while the lack of cellobiohydrolases and the occurrence of systems able to suppress Fenton`s reaction in the cultures have explained non-efficient cellulose degradation by this biopulping fungus.

40|$|A {{program to}} resolve the issues {{associated}} with potential vapor space corrosion and liquid/air interface corrosion in the Type III high level waste tanks is in place. The objective {{of the program is}} to develop understanding of vapor space (VSC) and liquid/air interface (LAIC) corrosion to ensure a defensible technical basis to provide accurate corrosion evaluations with regard to vapor space and liquid/air interface corrosion. The results of the FY 05 experiments are presented here. The experiments are an extension of the previous research on the corrosion of tank steel exposed to simple solutions to corrosion of the steel when exposed to complex high level waste simulants. The testing suggested that decanting and the consequent residual species on the tank wall is the predominant source of surface chemistry on the tank wall. The laboratory testing has shown that at the boundary conditions of the chemistry control program for solutions greater than 1 M NaNO{sub 3 }{sup -}. Minor and isolated pitting is possible within crevices in the vapor space of the tanks that contain stagnant dilute solution {{for an extended period of}} time, specifically when residues are left on the tank wall during decanting. Liquid/air interfacial corrosion is possible in dilute stagnant solutions, particularly with high concentrations of chloride. The experimental results indicate that Tank 50 would be most susceptible to the potential for liquid/air interfacial corrosion or vapor space corrosion, with Tank 49 and 41 following, since these tanks are nearest to the chemistry control boundary conditions. The testing continues to show that the combination of well-inhibited solutions and <b>mill-scale</b> sufficiently protect against pitting in the Type III tanks...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the axial fatigue behavior of plain plates and full penetration butt-welded joints in HY- 130 (T) steel is presented. The weldments were fabricated using GMA and SMA welding processes. Fatigue tests were conducted with sound weldments and weldments containing internal defects including slag, porosity, and lack of fusion. Radiographic and ultrasonic inspection techniques were used to- study the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks originating at internal weld flaws. Acoustic emission measurements were taken for smooth and notched HY- 130 (T) specimens tested in static tension and in fatigue. The results of preliminary tests of plain plates and butt weldments of HY- 100 (T) [HY-IIO] steel are presented. Comparison of the fatigue results for the HY- 130 (T) specimens with equivalent data for HY- 80 and HY-IOO steel has indicated that, {{within the range of}} lives from approximately 104 to 106 cycles, the fatigue behavior of as-rolled (<b>mill-scale</b> intact) plain plates of the three materials may be described by a single S-N regression line. Surface treatments, including gritblasting and polishing, were found to significantly increase the fatigue lives of the HY- 130 (T) plate specimens. Wide variations in fatigue life were exhibited by the HY- 130 (T) and HY- 100 (T) butt-welded specimens in which cracking initiated at internal weld discontinuities. The scatter in lives could not be explained {{on the basis of the}} type of weld defect initiating failure, nor could it be attributed to differences in the weld metal composition or the welding process. However, through application of the concepts of fracture mechanics, it was found that the fraction of the total fatigue life spent in macroscopic crack propagation could be estimated with reasonable reliability if the through-thickness dimension of the crack-initiating defect, its position relative to the specimen surface, and the nominal cyclic stress are known. Results obtained from the monitoring of the acoustic emission from specimens subjected to both static and cyclic loading have indicated that this technique is potentially an effective tool for in-service nondestructive testing of structural components.

40|$|The {{chloride}} {{threshold value}} (Cth), or critical chloride content, {{is defined as}} the chloride concentration at the depth of the reinforcement, which initiates the depassivation of steel in concrete. However, very limited information is available regarding the chloride distributions at the interface with the steel. The main objective of this work is to improve the knowledge and understanding about the mechanisms leading to depassivation of steel in concrete, by studying the influence of the steel surface condition and the concrete-steel interface on the corrosion initiation and the chloride distributions along the concrete-steel interface at the time of depassivation. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used for spatial resolved chloride profiling in cementitious materials. A range of materials with increasing degree of heterogeneity (i. e. cement paste, mortar and concrete) and exposed to chlorides under different conditions (i. e. mixed-in, diffused and migrated) was studied. The system was optimized for maximum chloride sensitivity, while allowing for the detection of other elements such as calcium and iron. At a scan speed of 100 µm/s, a spatial resolution of 300 - 400 µm and limits of detection of 0. 05 wt% of cement were determined. The chloride distributions along the concrete-steel interface and possible differences between passive and active regions were studied, for different steel surface conditions under free corrosion conditions as well as under potentiostatic control. The results have shown that along the interface, a range of chloride concentrations can be expected, with higher values around the corroding active sites. It was suggested that chlorides preferentially accumulate at the anodic regions even prior to depassivation, leading to pitting corrosion. A local migration mechanism was proposed to account for the chloride build-up around the anode regions, due to the formation of local potential gradients on the passive layer of the steel as a result of differences in the moisture content and oxygen availability, concentration of aggressive species and metallurgical properties, such as inclusions or <b>mill-scale</b> along the steel. In particular the steel surface condition and the presence of air voids at the concrete-steel interface were recognized as major factors influencing the development of potential gradients along the steel surface...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} defoamer dosage {{procedure and}} a more efficient dosing point to the approach system were studied in this thesis. Their influence on paper machine wet end operations was investigated. The improved defoamer dosing procedure was examined at UMP-Kymmene Tervasaari PM 8. Air content and its controlling methods at the paper machine were studied in the literature survey. Also the influence of dissolved gases and entrained air in the papermaking furnish were introduced. Feeding methods – a TrumpJet chemical mixer and traditional feeding devices – were reviewed. The defoamer’s functioning methods were studied. The influence {{of the use of}} defoamers was estimated based on the main selected wet end operations. In the experimental part, defoamer mixing with a traditional feeding method and two improved mixing stages were compared based on the air content profiles in PM 8 ’s approach system. The reference dosage procedure was PM 8 ’s old dosing system. The first dosage procedure in the comparison involved two TrumpJet chemical mixers installed on the bottom wire trays. The second element of comparison involved the improvement brought by a third TrumpJet chemical mixer installed on the top wire tray. This second comparison of the efficient defoamer feeding concept was made at a higher production speed of PM 8. The air content control situation was also studied at the higher production speed. In addition the connection between the defoamer and air content was observed and a <b>mill-scale</b> system was studied. The economical benefits of the new dosing procedure were also reviewed. Air content profiles of short circulation were measured in the reference situation and the two comparison points of the study. These air content measurements proved the main gas load is introduced to PM 8 's paper furnish from the white water tray. Thick stock air content was not essential when the air volume flow was considered. The improved defoamer dosing procedure made lower dosage amounts possible. Compared with the traditional feeding system, the new defoamer feeding concept made only few direct improvements to the wet end operations and the produced paper itself. The lower defoamer need was noticed to have a positive influence on hydrophobic sizing and paper defects. The surfaces of the white water tanks and the operation of pumps were assessed based on the density variations of the suspension.

40|$|Abstract A pulp {{suspension}} {{consists of}} water, fibres, fines, fillers and chemicals, but air or other gases are {{also present in}} practically all pulping processes either in dissolved form or as bubbles. Dissolved gases seldom disturb the processes, but they are readily converted to gaseous form when conditions change. The gas bubbles affect {{the properties of the}} pulp suspension, reduce the accuracy of certain measurements, interfere with the runability of the papermachine and detract from the quality of the end-product. Gases are removed from the process by either mechanical or chemical means, resulting in increased investments and operational costs. The aim of this work was to study the behaviour of gas in pulp and papermaking processes with laboratory, pilot-scale and <b>mill-scale</b> experiments. Five main areas of the research can be identified: 1. Occurrence of gases in pulp and paper mill processes, 2. Dissolution, precipitation and hold-up of gases in the pulp suspension and mill water, 3. Effects of gases on certain consistency measurements, centrifugal pumping and operation of the hydrocyclone. 4. Measurement of the gas content of the pulp suspension by compression, radiometric, microwave and sonar methods and 5. Removal of gases with a centrifugal pump equipped with vacuum pump or hydrocyclone equipped light reject removal. The results show that the dissolution and precipitation of gas is strongly dependent on the pulp and water properties. Dissolved and colloidal material reduces the solubility potential of gas, but also accelerates the precipitation of dissolved gases in gaseous form. The hold-up of precipitated gas bubbles was found to be much more pronounced in hydrophobic mechanical pulps than in lignin-free chemical pulps. The accuracy of consistency measurements was affected by free gas in the pulp suspension, requiring special attention when assessing the results. The operation of pressure screens and hydrocyclones was affected only at high volumes of free gas in the feed suspension. According to the experiments, a reliable gas content measurement can be achieved by in-line radiometric, microwave or sonar methods, and also by the off-line compression method if a representative sample is obtained. A centrifugal pump equipped with a gas removing unit is designed mainly to ensure undisturbed pumping, whereas its gas removal efficiency remains quite low, especially with small bubbles and at a low gas content. The gas removal efficiency of a hydrocyclone equipped with light reject removal is good, but decreases with small precipitated bubbles. These results offer new information of the behaviour of the gas in pulp suspensions and white water and underline the importance of the bubble generation mechanism in this context...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{of carbon}} (black) steel {{reinforcing}} bars (rebar) {{is the major}} cause of damage and deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in maritime regions and in climates where de-icing salts are used. The cause of the corrosion is diffusion of chloride ions to the steel surface through the concrete {{in which it is}} placed. The bars are naturally passivated by the high pH of concrete interstitial pore fluid, and will not corrode in chloride-free concrete. Chloride ions break down the passive film, allowing dissolution of the steel. Corrosion of reinforcing steel drastically reduces the service lives of concrete structures. Where chlorides can not be avoided, stainless steel is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative reinforcing material. Stainless steel is able to withstand greater concentrations of chlorides, extending the service lives of structure in which they are placed. Due to high initial cost, stainless steel is often avoided in the design of new structures. In order to reduce the cost of stainless rebar, it has been proposed that the standard process of abrasive blasting and pickling of the steels not be performed, as these steps are mainly used to restore a bright and shiny surface, a quality not required for steels embedded in concrete. AISI 304 LN, AISI 316 LN and 2205 duplex stainless steels were tested with pickled surfaces as well as with <b>mill-scale</b> intact (as-rolled) {{in order to determine the}} affect of pickling vs. not pickling on the corrosion behaviour of the steels. Steels were tested in solutions simulating concrete interstitial pore fluid containing from 0 to 16 % Cl- by mass of solution, simulating cement paste with 0 to 7. 5 % Cl- by mass of cement, which is near the solubility limit of Cl- in pore fluid. Steels were also tested in thin mortar shells, with Cl- ions being rapidly diffused to the surface due to an applied potential gradient. The microcell corrosion performance of the as-rolled steels was slightly worse than that of pickled steels; however, the corrosion rates of the as-rolled steels at 16 % Cl- in pore fluid are near 3 µm/year, while black steel is normally observed to be actively corroding at 10 µm/year in cement containing as low as 0. 1 % Cl- by mass of cement, or 0. 2 % Cl- by mass of solution. No significant difference was observed between different grades of stainless steel in either the as-rolled or pickled conditions. As-rolled stainless steels exhibited poor pitting resistance when an anodic potential is applied, but the corrosion occurs at potentials much higher than experienced in service and at Cl- concentrations far greater than that needed to initiate corrosion on black steel; the time required to reach these higher Cl- levels would allow for maintenance free service long enough to justify the cost of as-rolled stainless steel over black steel. The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, CSA S 6 - 06, specifies that reinforced concrete bridges should meet a service life of 75 years. It is concluded that, given the time required for concentrated chlorides to accumulate at the steel, the stainless steel rebar in the as-rolled condition would allow reinforced concrete structures to reach the specified service life, as long as care is taken to avoid contamination of the steel/surface by black steel from handling, or by secondary phases within the steel, Cr 23 C 6 and MnS in particular...|$|E
