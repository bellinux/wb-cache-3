40|$|Besides {{automotive}} applications, {{the railway}} sector becomes a {{more and more}} important field of application for energy storages. The fact that the service conditions of a railway vehicle deviate from a car, e. g. railway vehicles have a higher energy consumption of auxiliary aggregates, suggests that different rules of dimensioning {{have to be considered}} for energy storages. This underlines the importance to have a well-directed focus on this means of transport. As there are many different railway vehicles who offer a potential to include (or already use) energy storages, it is important to determine the specific edge conditions of every vehicle segment. Each of the railway vehicle segments offers different individual constraints. That includes station spacing, <b>mileage,</b> <b>performance,</b> weight and cross section amongst others. These boundary conditions have a strong influence on the selection of an appropriate energy storage system –e. g. : while a (comparatively) low weight is an important factor for standard gauge railways, a heavy weight might have a positive impact for shunting locos that need a certain axial force, to transmit the required traction force. The fact that only 50...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Congress has {{expressed concern about the}} extent to which the Department of Defense has moved funds that directly affect military readiness, such as those that finance training, to pay for other subactivities within its operation and maintenance (O&M) account, such as real property maintenance and base operations. This report reviews the (1) Army's obligation of O&M division training funds and (2) readiness of the Army's divisions. GAO found that the Army continued to use division training funds for purposes other than training during fiscal year 2000. However, the reduced funding did not interfere with the Army's planned training events or exercises. The Army's tank units also reported that, despite the reduced funding and their failure to meet their tank <b>mileage</b> <b>performance</b> goal, their readiness remained high. Specifically, many tank units reported that they could be fully trained for their wartime mission within a short time period. Units that reported that they would need more time to become fully trained generally cited personnel issues rather than the lack of training funds as the reason. Even so, starting in fiscal year 2001, the Army has taken action to restrict moving training funds by exempting unit training funds from any Army headquarters' adjustments and requiring prior approval before Army commands move any training funds. ...|$|E

50|$|Yamaha {{introduced}} their bike SZ RR in 2013 {{after that}} they improved it technically and relaunched it as SZ RR version 2.0. Yamaha used its new Blue Core technology in the new SZ RR version 2.0 and it resulted in improved <b>mileage</b> and <b>performance.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} an Oldsmobile-sourced 350 CID L V8, fitted with Bendix/Bosch {{electronically}} controlled fuel injection. This system gave the Seville smooth drivability and performance that was usually lacking in other domestic cars of this early emissions control era. Power output was , gas mileage was 17 MPG {{in the city}} and 23 MPG on the highway [...] (the larger Deville and Fleetwood were still getting single digit gas <b>mileage)</b> and <b>performance</b> was good for the era zero to 60 mi/h km/h taking 11.5 seconds. A diesel 350 CID L LF9 V8 was added in 1978, the first diesel engine offered in passenger vehicles in America.|$|R
50|$|The Infiniti QX56 had around 9,000 lb (4082 kg) of towing capacity. <b>Mileage</b> at peak <b>performance</b> drain is 12 mpg. It {{comes in}} one trim level, with only key options such as: DVD {{entertainment}} system, 4WD/2WD, and a bench instead of captain chairs {{as the second}} row. Other features which came standard were a ten-speaker Bose system, DVD-based navigation system, leather trim for all seats, dual-climate control, 18-inch chrome alloy wheels, and an adaptive cruise control system. A Precrash system was a unique feature in the market as well.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Fiat Powertrain {{introduced}} {{the third generation}} of this technology, called Multijet II. With its new and innovative injectors with hydraulically balanced solenoid valve and even higher injection pressure of 2,000 bar (29,000 psi) {{it is capable of}} even more precise controlling of the injected diesel fuel, injecting it in a quicker and more flexible manner. It enables up to eight consecutive injections per combustion cycle and implemented Injection Rate Shaping technology, which provides two very close pilot injection making the fuel delivery more continuous and modulated. This results in an engine that is quiet and has a smoother operation, lower emissions, better fuel <b>mileage</b> and higher <b>performance</b> compared to the previous generation.|$|R
25|$|All {{organizations}} can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments. For instance, former Mayor Martin O’Malley pushed the City of Baltimore to use CitiStat, a performance-measurement data and management {{system that allows}} city officials to maintain statistics on crime trends to condition of potholes. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency {{in terms of time}} and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million. Even mass transit systems have innovated with hybrid bus fleets to real-time tracking at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of mobile data terminals in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine <b>performance,</b> <b>mileage</b> and other information. This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems.|$|R
5000|$|Fiberfab Avenger GT: The Avenger GT was a kit-car {{designed}} and {{manufactured in the}} USA, starting in 1966. The car had a stronger GT40 look. It was manufactured by Fiberfab, a company founded by Warren “Bud” Goodwin and was the successor to the Aztec. The car was styled to resemble the Ford GT of racing fame; however, it wasn't a Ford GT40 replica, instead was heavily influenced by the MkI and MkIII styling. They utilized quad headlamps and a longer tail similar to the MkIII to cover the rear engine. The Avenger GT came in two models, the Avenger GT-12, and the Avenger GT-15. The GT-12 (so named {{with respect to the}} first 12 GT40 prototypes) was designed to be assembled by the owner, using parts salvaged from other cars, usually a VW Beetle, Karmman Ghia or early Porsche. The GT-15 was similar, but utilized a tube frame chassis, designed to accept suspension and drivetrain components for a Chevrolet Corvair. The GT-12 is the most common. Originally, one could take a VW Beetle, and a $700 GT-12 body kit, and with quite a bit of work and some money spent on hardware, custom exhaust, gauges etc., and end up with a great looking sports car. The GT-12 weighed about 500 pounds less than the Beetle. The lowered weight and improved aerodynamics boosted the fuel <b>mileage</b> and <b>performance.</b> The weight reduction was equivalent to adding approximately 30% more power. The lower weight and center of gravity meant it would out-corner and out-stop the Beetle as well. As a result, thousands of Fiberfab Avengers were sold in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|R
