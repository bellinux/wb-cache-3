30|$|In sum, {{this paper}} has {{provided}} {{evidence to suggest that}} current screening protocols for super recognition need to be expanded. Both face memory and face <b>matching</b> <b>skills</b> should be assessed using both target-present and target-absent trials, but inclusion criteria should not require exceptional performance on both processes. Further, some very specified real-world face recognition tasks may require targeted screening using measures that specifically replicate the required scenario. Finally, our data indicate that the new screening measures developed in this test may be of benefit to the wider field, and the new MMT may be a particularly sensitive test for the detection of SRs. We are happy to share these resources with other researchers on request (please contact the corresponding author).|$|E
30|$|A second {{implication}} of the current work concerns {{the possibility that some}} individuals only excel at either face memory or face matching. This hypothesis has been raised in previous work using small case series or individual case studies (e.g. Bennetts, Mole, & Bate, 2017; Bobak, Bennetts, et al., 2016; Bobak, Hancock, & Bate, 2016). While it was clear that performance on the face matching task (the PMT) was at least mildly related to the two face memory measures, the current study nevertheless identified 18 individuals who only performed in the superior range on the PMT (although the consistency of this performance was not checked in a second related task) and 13 individuals who only performed in the superior range on the face memory tasks. In many of these individuals, performance on all three tasks was nevertheless in the range that encompasses the upper end of “normal” (i.e. that above 1 SD, or even 1.5 SDs, of the control mean on all three tasks), supporting the argument that the three tasks are inter-related at least to some degree. However, for three “super matchers”, the difference between scores on the CFMT+ and the PMT were significantly larger than the mean difference between scores observed in controls. This finding provides more convincing support for a dissociation between super face matchers and super face memorisers; although it is of note that this pattern only emerged in a very small proportion of our sample, and that no evidence was observed for the reverse dissociation. That is, while superior face <b>matching</b> <b>skills</b> may be observed in the absence of superior face memory skills, people with excellent face memory skills also seem to have very good face <b>matching</b> <b>skills.</b> This finding supports hierarchical models of face-processing (e.g. Breen, Caine, & Coltheart, 2000; Bruce & Young, 1986; Ellis & Lewis, 2001), acknowledging the contribution of earlier perceptual processes in identity recognition. Such models make the assumption that perceptual analysis of a face occurs prior to identity recognition, and needs to be successfully completed in order for recognition to occur. This is backed up by the performance of those with prosopagnosia—while case studies have been reported where individuals have impairments to face memory alone, or to both facial identity perception and face memory (for a review see Bate & Bennetts, 2015), there are no reports of impaired facial identity perception in the context of intact face memory. The evidence reported here fits nicely with patterns of impairment in prosopagnosia, providing novel evidence from top performers that further bolsters the claims of theoretical models of face-processing. Importantly, then, SR screening procedures should include face matching measures from the outset, given that reliance on the CFMT+ (or any face memory measure) alone would overlook some individuals with superior face <b>matching</b> <b>skills.</b>|$|E
