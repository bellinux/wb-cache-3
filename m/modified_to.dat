5|$|As Darby {{approached}} Hawaii on July21, {{a tropical}} storm watch was issued for Hawaii County and Maui County.

A tropical storm watch was issued for Oahu late on July22 as Darby continued to move closer to Hawaii, and was <b>modified</b> <b>to</b> {{a tropical storm}} warning the next morning. Eventually, after Darby made landfall in Kaʻū District in the afternoon of July23, the tropical storm warning was extended to all islands {{in the state of}} Hawaii. The watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Darby weakened and moved away from the islands, with none remaining by July25.|$|E

On the other hand if the subject’s speed is more at time T_a than T_b then to find q in the radius R will <b>modify</b> <b>to</b> (1 + 1 -β [...])R.

5|$|As Hurricane Ida {{moved over}} the Yucatán Channel on November8, the NHC issued a {{hurricane}} watch for areas between Grand Isle, Louisiana and Mexico Beach, Florida. As the storm {{moved closer to}} the states, a tropical storm warning was declared for areas between Grand Isle and Pascagoula, Mississippi, as well as areas between Indian Pass, Florida, and the mouth of the Aucilla River. The hurricane watch was also <b>modified</b> <b>to</b> encompass a smaller area, between Grand Isle and Pascagoula. A hurricane warning was also issued from Pascagoula to Indian Pass. During the afternoon of November9, all hurricane watches and warnings were discontinued and the tropical storm warning was <b>modified</b> <b>to</b> include areas between Grand Isle and the mouth of the Aucilla River. As Ida became extratropical, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings on the storm on November10.|$|E

40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{radiosensitivity}} of single human cells have been examined in vitro. So far, all factors which tend <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> sensitivity <b>to</b> x-radiation appear not <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> (or <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> less effectively) the effects upon single cells of high-dE/dx radiation. Whenever the hazards of heavily ionizing radiations are being evaluated, chronic exposure must be considered equivalent to acute exposure, and any attempts <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> the effects of densely ionizing radiations at the cellular level are probably useless. In the case of cultured human cells, the RBE is dependent upon the endpoint because of the differently-shaped survival curves. Thus, for example, the RBE of fast carbon ions for 50 % survival is about 6, whereas, it is only about 2 for 1 % survival...|$|R
