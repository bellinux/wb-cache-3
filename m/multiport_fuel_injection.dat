5000|$|When it {{debuted in}} the US, it was {{introduced}} with a slightly larger displacing SOHC 2.2-liter [...] engine that was also used for the European, British and Australian versions over the Japanese market version of DOHC 2.0 liters. The 2.0-liter and 2.2-liter engines fuel delivery were managed with sequential <b>multiport</b> common rail <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> called MPFI, and the 1.8-liter engine used a throttle body <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system with single injector called SPFI. The Japanese use the smaller engine because of Japanese vehicle size legislation, which determines the {{tax to be paid}} based on the cars dimensions and engine displacement. However, the Japanese domestic market (JDM) engine was more powerful, even without the turbo. The JDM DOHC 2.0-liter [...] non turbocharged engine had a dual stage intake manifold where at approximately 3200-3500 engine RPMs four individual valves would allow additional air flow into the engine from a secondary manifold attached and located underneath the primary intake manifold.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, an attempt {{has been made}} to predict the {{influence}} of split multiple stage <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> on a DI diesel engine performance and emission characteristics. The predictions have been made for both conventional continuous <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> as well as split multiple stage <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> The analysis mainly emphasize on the prediction of SFC and NOx levels in a diesel engine for the above mentioned two <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> modes.
