40|$|Throughout the United States it {{is common}} {{practice}} for automobile insurance premiums for a particular policy to vary depending upon the driver class and geographic location of the policyholder {{as well as the}} type and number of vehicles covered by the policy. In addition, most states also permit so-called "merit rating" plans whereby each policyholder's annual premium is adjusted up or down depending upon the insured's claims experience and traffice violation record during previous years. Although these <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> plans may be viewed as a special type of risk classification, the rationale underlying their use {{is quite different from the}} justification for driver class and territory differentials. This paper develops a methodology for evaluating <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> plans that are used in conjunction with other risk classification criteria. A theoretically equitable <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> plan is designed and compared with plans commonly used throughout the country. The differences are striking, especially among high risk classes. For example, most typical <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> plans overcharge good drivers in high risk classes [...] often by more than 25 %. 1. 0 The Purpose of Merit-Rating The popular rational behind merit-rating is straightforward: Merit-Rating keeps "good" drivers from subsidizing "bad" drivers and, because having any accident or traffic violation means higher rates, it promotes safe driving an...|$|R

The major points for and against merit ratings are summarized, followed by a description of the requirements for a successful plan, inclading the prerequisite conditions of acceptance, mutual confidence, participation, and research; a validated and continuous evaluation system; and a basic scale of salaries which adequately reflects the importance of teaching. The wider acceptance of <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> plans in the United States than in Canada is considered, as well as the probable cost of such a program, which has been estimated at an additional 18 percent of payroll. The philosophical prot'em raised by <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> is due to the conflicting views of the school system as a bureaucracy or as a profession. If the teacher is to be rated by someone else, he cannot retain his professional autonomy.

Great Britain and Germany both experimented with the idea before this country even had an unemployment insurance law. The plan was soon found to be unsuccessful by both countries, and it was dropped from the law {{in order to protect}} the benefit fund and to prevent some industries from paying outrageously high tax rates. The United States incorporated experience rating in its unemployment insurance law and by 1948 every state had some type of <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> provision. There are five distinct experience ratings in use in this country - the payroll decline, compensable-separations, reserve-ration, benefit-ration, and benefit-wage ration plans. All the plans have certain things in common in spite of essential differences. They are all devised to establish the relative experience of individual employers with unemployment or benefit costs. [TRUNCATED] Employers must remember that the structure of industry in Massachusetts does not permit the fund to be adequately financed by experience rating. Unemployment will be higher here than in other sections of the country. An attempt to cut into workers' benefits is no solution, for it does not attack the cause of the dilemma. Unless the economy of this state can be re-vitalized, experience rating must be abolished so that the fund will be adequate to meet the claims of the unemployed...|$|R
40|$|This document, {{the result}} of {{research}} conducted to resolve some of the confusion surrounding the question of merit pay, synthesizes information and professional opinion about teacher compensation. The material {{is presented in two}} major sections, one devoted to the concept of merit pay and the other to a discussion of alternative methods of rewarding outstanding teachers. Within the concept of merit pay are discussed (1) three major additional compensation provisions, (2) merit provisions in historical perspective, CO principles of merit pay plans, (4) procedures for <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> and/or evaluation, (5) pro and con arguments regarding merit pay programs, and (6) some successes and failures of merit pay plans. The differentiated teaching staff approach, the teacher incentive plan, and the approved staff plan are examined in depth in a section on alternative reward methods. Study findings reveal that (I) careful teacher preparation and training (indying improvements in the college programs for training new teachers) is necessary before a schoca can handle the technical and human relationship problems inherent in a thoroughgoing merit program; (2) a merit salary program is feasible only in school systems that have developed approariate objective evaluation procedures; (3) teacher morale, a complex of many factors, is not primarily determined by the salary system, be it merit or nonmerit.

40|$|The new Italian {{regulation}} for {{the distribution}} of the Ordinary Financing public Fund (FFO) is included in the framework of the reformation of the University System financing politics. A part of the FFO is bound by a specific <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> performed by the C. N. V. S. U. (forthcoming A. N. V. U. R.) for the competent Ministry. Such an evaluation results in a periodical monitoring of achieved results for each University, compared with the triennial operating programme in which the main targets, in terms of improvement and efficiency of the public service quality, are presented. From the quantitative viewpoint, this ambitious goal is reached by means of a Quality Aggregate Index (QAI), obtained by the weighted synthesis of twenty-one parameters, measured on scale of ratios and assembled for homogeneity in five macro-areas. The present proposal for the QAI quantification {{does not seem to be}} statistically clear and is tends to create discordant results compared with the inspiring regulation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} subject of Performance Management. The nature and value of performance management is assessed {{in terms of its}} contribution to organisational effectiveness. Organisations today are more aware of the important role employees can play as a source of competitive advantage. Organisations are implementing human resource management (HRM) policies and practices which promote productivity and efficiency, one particular HRM practice is the use of performance appraisal systems, a tool used to motiviate employees to improve performance and productivity. Performance management is a long established process and has developed over time from the old <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> systems to the strategically integrated systems being utilised in organisations today. Research indicates that organisations today are paying far more attention to the process of performance management and that there are a wide and varied range o f methods and designs of performance schemes that organisations can adopt. Linking performance to reward is a problematic area and critics in the field suggest that employers abandon any link between performance management and reward and focus on employee development instead if they are to realise the potential developments. These issues are researched and investigated both through the current literature and a survey of an Irish Pharmaceutical company. The survey is supported through the use of interviews. The findings from the research study show that there is a commitment to the performance management system being used by the company in question and results in general were very positive particularly in relation to goals and objectives and the link between the performance management system and the culture o f the company. The already identified problematic area of performance and pay was also evident from the results...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay {{is to make the}} {{characteristics}} of the wage administration in postwar Japan clear, comparing to the characteristics in the prewar. Its contents are as follows: (1) the concepts and structure of the wage administration, (2) the characteristics of the wage in Japanese business, (3) the characteristics of personnel administration in postwar Japan, (4) conclusion - the characteristics of the wage administration in postwar Japan. The writer think that the wage administration's characteristics are determined mainly by the wage determination's system and the degrees of the personnel administration's development. And therefore this essay describes the characteristics of the wage and personnel administration in Japanese business in the previous parts. In Japan there has not ever been general wage-rate, but the wages are determined in extent of each enterprise's ability to pay. In this result, a. sum of wage for each employee is determined in accordance with the individual living conditions of him. And also, the, development of work-standardization is so imperfect that the scientific incentive wage does not develop sufficiently. Concerning to the personnel administration in the postwar, it has been ever tinged with the paternalistic features as same as in the prewar, but however some of the personnel management plans, for example <b>merit</b> <b>rating,</b> training for supervisors and job evaluation's methods, become to take modern methods. Such features has influence upon the wage administration. In this way, the wage administration in the postwar proceeds to have the prewar characteristics, while it begins to have some modern features; in other words, it may say what the wage administration has two characters is the principal characteristic in the postwar...|$|R

The first response to starvation was a 10 % decrease in 02 {{consumption and}} a 25 % decrease in ammonia excretion.

From the O: N ratio it appeared that carbohydrate reserves were quickly exhausted (3 - 4 days) and that lipids and proteins were the main substrates oxidized to meet the energetic requirements of C. crangon. After 2 weeks of starvation the O:N ratio remained constant near a value of 8, indicating that only proteins were being utilised; a 50 % loss of body protein after 30 days suggested that structural proteins were heavily catabolized. The metabolic response of Crangon to starvation (although seasonal variations must be considered) appears to depend mainly on high nitrogen requirements...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to examine}} some aspects of special education in Swedish upper secondary schools. The availability of special education resources, the occurrence of ability grouping and the organisational modalities of special education support are investigated. The further aim of the thesis is to discuss how these phenomena can be understood {{on the basis of}} democratic educational theories and theories of social educational justice. The study describes how special education support was organised in 764 upper secondary schools in Sweden in the academic school year 2010 / 2011, with a response rate of 80. 4 % (n= 764). The design of the study is a cross-sectional total population survey, where data have been collected by way of questionnaires and supplemented with public statistics. The results of the study show that about 37. 5 % of upper secondary schools lack special education resources in terms of special educators or special education teachers. Special education support is not provided in 68 % of the independent schools compared with 10 % of the public schools. This uneven balance between public and independent schools can be interpreted to be a threat to an equivalent and democratic school, since students in need of special support {{do not have the same}} opportunities to receive such support in all schools. Furthermore, schools with a higher average parental educational background have shown higher availability of special education resources. It seems that students with parents who have higher educational backgrounds have to a greater extent access to special education resources. Ability grouping is used in about 43 % of the schools. It is most commonly used within foundation subjects, particularly in Mathematics. The schools that use ability grouping to a very large extent have lower and more varied <b>merit</b> <b>rating</b> values and greater availability of special education resources. Special education support is primarily provided outside the students’ regular teaching groups. This is also the case with support provided by other school staff: indeed, 87 % of the schools report that the majority of special education support is provided outside the students’ regular teaching groups. This can be understood as a way to organise special support in which heterogeneity and pluralism are not considered important. Based on democratic theories, the support provided outside the regular teaching group might be a risk to the creation of a democratic school where all students are given opportunities to meet and interact.    Overall, the results from this thesis show that special education resources are unevenly distributed among independent and public schools; that 43 % of the schools use ability grouping; and that special support is primarily provided outside the students’ regular teaching groups.
