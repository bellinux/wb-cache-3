5|$|A {{side effect}} of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied {{assertion}} of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, especially when he {{made a point of}} celebrating <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear before him and take the cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.|$|E
5|$|Ferrite (α-iron) is {{a fairly}} soft metal that can {{dissolve}} only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> 910°C). Austenite (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> 1146°C). This form of iron {{is used in the}} type of stainless steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.|$|E

5|$|Even {{when this}} inner planet, with a <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> least 78% {{times that of}} Jupiter was {{accounted}} for, the star still showed a drift in its radial velocity. This {{eventually led to the}} discovery of the outer planet 55 Cancri d in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{amplitude}} of the radial velocity oscillations {{means that the}} planet has a <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> least 5.7 times that of Jupiter in the Solar System. However, the radial velocity method only yields a minimum value on the planet's mass, depending on the orbital inclination to our line-of-sight. Therefore, the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this lower limit.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large <b>mass.</b> <b>At</b> its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic that it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is losing}} <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> {{a rate of}} 200kg/second. If mass loss at this rate {{continued}} for 4.5 Gyr, the satellite would have lost approximately 30% of its initial mass. A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal. It suggests that tectonics in the south polar region is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated subduction caused {{by the process of}} mass loss.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public demonstrations of piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, aged 62, he {{was again}} uprooted by the German {{invasion}} of France, and spent {{weeks in a}} refugee camp in Mende. During this time he began attending <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> the cathedral in Mende, a turn towards Christianity that would culminate in his religious conversion the following year. On 3 September 1940 Alfred, Erna, and Stefan boarded the Nea Hellas in Lisbon, reaching New York six days later; in October they moved to Los Angeles. Döblin worked briefly for Metro Goldwyn Mayer writing screenplays for 100 dollars a week, but his contract expired in October 1941 and was not renewed, despite the interventions of Thomas Mann and others. Alfred, Erna, and Stefan were baptized as Roman Catholics in Hollywood's Blessed Sacrament Church on 30 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} {{its body}} <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> {{a rate of}} about 1% a day, much slower than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. This is thought to be because the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E

5|$|The table below {{lists the}} known reasons for core {{collapse}} in massive stars, {{the types of}} star that they occur in, their associated supernova type, and the remnant produced. The metallicity is the proportion of elements other than hydrogen or helium, {{as compared to the}} Sun. The initial mass is the mass of the star prior to the supernova event, given in multiples of the Sun's mass, although the <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> the time of the supernova may be much lower.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player accumulates mass by colliding their asteroid against other asteroids until enough mass has been gathered to become a small planet. From there, the player has to absorb other asteroids to make their planet grow enough to become a life planet; crashing against other objects will decrease the player's <b>mass.</b> <b>At</b> this point, life forms will evolve in the planet, creating spaceships, planetary shields and cannons. If the player wishes, they can accumulate more mass until their planet becomes a star. Life forms will disappear, but the player will be able to attract planets to form a solar system, further grow the star by absorbing other planets, or a combination of both. The player can also create multi-star systems by selecting planets from their system and make them absorb asteroids until they become another star.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the {{hydrogen}} {{burning in the}} shell around the solar core will increase {{the mass of the}} core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar <b>mass.</b> <b>At</b> this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an asymptotic giant. Here the luminosity of the Sun will increase again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500K. This phase lasts about 30million years, after which, {{over the course of a}} further 100,000years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a planetary nebula. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.|$|E

5|$|In February 1959 Agagianian visited Taiwan {{to oversee}} missionary {{work in the}} island. He later {{entrusted}} Paul Yü Pin, Archbishop of Nanking, to reestablish the Fu Jen Catholic University. He arrived in Japan for a two week long visit in May 1959, which included a meeting with Emperor Hirohito. On December 10, 1959 he presided over the First Far East Conference of Bishops at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines with attendance of 100 prelates, 10 papal representatives, 16 archbishops, 79 bishops from almost {{every country in the}} Far East. His visit to the Republic of Ireland in June 1961 was the highlight of the Patrician Year. Agagianian received a great popular welcome there. Conservative President of Ireland Éamon de Valera was famously pictured kissing Agagianian's ring. In September 1963 he visited South Vietnam and met with Madame Nhu, the Catholic first lady. On October 18, 1964 when the Uganda Martyrs where canonized by Pope Paul VI, Agagianian presided over the Holy <b>Mass</b> <b>at</b> Namugongo. In November 1964 he traveled to Bombay, India to open the 38th Eucharistic Congress.|$|E
5|$|In March 1701, James II {{suffered}} a stroke while hearing <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, leaving him partially paralysed. Fagon, Louis XIV's personal physician, recommend the waters of Bourbon-l'Archambault, to cure the King's paralysis. The waters, however, had little effect, and James II died of a seizure on 16 September 1701. Louis XIV, in contravention of the Peace of Ryswick, declared James Francis Edward King of England, Ireland and Scotland as James III and VIII. This act irritated King William III and II, who had ruled alone {{since the death of}} his wife, Mary II. Because James Francis Edward was a minor, Queen Mary acted as nominal regent for her son. Mary presided over his regency council, too, although she was uninterested in politics. Before his death, James II expressed his wish that Mary's regency would last no longer than their son's 18th birthday.|$|E
5|$|Simulations suggest that, {{while the}} disk had a {{relatively}} high <b>mass</b> <b>at</b> any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tenths of a percent) {{of the mass of}} Jupiter captured from the Solar nebula was processed through it. However, the disk mass of only 2% that of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites. Thus there may have been several generations of Galilean-mass satellites in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons would have spiraled into Jupiter, due to drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the Solar nebula. By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned out {{to the point that it}} no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits. The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io.|$|E
