2500|$|Although LORAN {{deliberately}} {{used the}} same display as Gee, the signals were so much longer and more complex than Gee that direct measurement of the two signals was simply not possible. Even the initial signal from the master station was spread out {{in time with the}} initial groundwave signal being sharp (if received), while the skywave receptions could appear anywhere on the display. Accordingly, the LORAN operator instead set the delays so the <b>master</b> <b>signal</b> appeared on one trace and the slave on the second, allowing the complex patterns to be compared. This meant that only one master/slave measurement could be made at once; to produce a [...] "fix", the entire measurement procedure had to be repeated a second time using a different set of stations. Measurement times on the order of three to five minutes were typical, requiring the navigator {{to take into account the}} motion of the vehicle during this time.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with some embodiments, {{a method for}} high frequency clock distribution in a VLSI system includes splitting an original <b>master</b> clock <b>signal</b> into one or more pairs of lower-frequency sub-clocks for a destination in the VLSI system, distributing each lower-frequency sub-clock of {{the one or more}} pairs of lower-frequency sub-clocks to a corresponding channel coupled to the destination, and reconstructing a reference <b>master</b> clock <b>signal</b> at the destination from the one or more pairs of lower-frequency sub-clocks, wherein the reconstructed reference <b>master</b> clock <b>signal</b> replicates the original <b>master</b> clock <b>signal...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{output of}} the {{envelope}} sampler was also sent to a phase-shifter that adjusted the output of a local clock that locked to the master carrier using a phase-locked loop. This retained the phase of the <b>master</b> <b>signal</b> {{long enough for the}} slave signal to arrive. Gating on the slave signal was then compared to this <b>master</b> <b>signal</b> in a phase detector, and a varying voltage was produced depending on the difference in phase. This voltage represented the fine-positioning measurement.|$|E

5000|$|Slave clocks come in many {{shapes and}} sizes. They can {{connect to the}} master clock through either a cable or a {{short-range}} wireless signal. In the 19th century Paris used a series of pneumatic tubes to transmit the signal.

5000|$|Ground based radio {{navigation}} {{has long been}} practiced. The DECCA, LORAN, GEE and Omega systems used terrestrial longwave radio transmitters which broadcast a radio pulse from a known [...] "master" [...] location, followed by a pulse repeated {{from a number of}} [...] "slave" [...] stations. The delay between the reception of the <b>master</b> <b>signal</b> and the slave signals allowed the receiver to deduce the distance to each of the slaves, providing a fix.|$|E

50|$|With {{very slight}} modification, the same display {{could be used}} to time the {{difference}} between two arbitrary signals. For navigational use, any number of identifying characteristics {{could be used to}} differentiate the master from the secondary signals. In this case, the portable receiver triggered its trace when it received the <b>master</b> <b>signal.</b> As the signals from secondary arrived they would cause a blip on the display in the same fashion as a target on the radar, and the exact delay between the master and secondary easily determined.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the output}} frame {{rate of the}} PC {{graphics}} card is relatively constant and cannot be fine tuned on the fly, we use the PC video output rate as the <b>master</b> <b>signal</b> for system synchronization. The projector's FPGA also creates signals encoding the current frame rate. These control signals interface directly to an Animatics SM3420D ”Smart Motor” which contains firmware and motion control parameters resulting in a stable, velocity-based control loop that ensures the motor velocity stays {{in sync with the}} signals from the projector.|$|E
50|$|In practice, radio {{navigation}} systems normally use {{a chain of}} three or four stations, all synchronized to a <b>master</b> <b>signal</b> that is broadcast from one of the stations. The others, the secondaries, are positioned so their LOPs cross at acute angles, which increases the accuracy of the fix. So for instance, a given chain might have four stations with the master in the center, allowing a receiver to pick the signals from two secondaries that are currently as close to right angles as possible given their current location. Modern systems, which know the locations of all the broadcasters, can automate which stations to pick.|$|E

40|$|Transferring a <b>master</b> {{reference}} <b>signal</b> {{across a}} research campus or even across a region {{is a key}} activity for a timing facility. In the past, the U. S.

Several months of data have now been collected with the new transceivers driving these inter-building fiber links. The modules were also tested in an environmental chamber to evaluate their temperature sensitivities. The laser modules alone show more than a factor of 10 improvement over previous transceivers used at USNO. We are also investigating actively stabilized laser links to further improve our ability to transfer <b>Master</b> Clock <b>signals...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Signals from {{different}} chains were closely spaced in frequency, {{close enough that}} the wide-band R1355 receiver would often tune {{in more than one}} chain at a time. For station identification, the A' signals were only sent periodically. After the display was stabilized so the pulse trains were appearing in a single location on the screen, the A' pulses could be seen blinking on and off with a set pattern (thus [...] "ghosting" [...] on the display). This allowed the operator to determine the identity of the <b>master</b> <b>signal,</b> and thus select the chain they wanted to use by positioning its associated [...] "ABD" [...] signal on the left.|$|E
50|$|On {{its second}} digital subchannel, the station {{affiliated}} with the Retro Television Network from December 1, 2008 to January 15, 2012.

The station master's apartment in the upper story consisted of four rooms and a kitchen. However, it had limited space due to roof angles and steep stairs. There was also a cargo building on the platform and the station featured six tracks at the time. In 1926 the station was manned by a station master, a clerk, a switcher, five telegraphists, six station workers and a journeyman.|$|R

5000|$|Because a {{secondary}} could not instantaneously transmit its signal pulse on receipt of the <b>master</b> <b>signal,</b> a fixed delay was {{built into the}} signal. No matter what delay is selected, {{there will be some}} locations where the signal from two secondary would be received at the same time, and thus make them difficult to see on the display. Some method of identifying one secondary from another was needed. Common methods included transmitting from the secondary only at certain times, using different frequencies, adjusting the envelope of the burst of signal, or broadcasting several bursts in a particular pattern. A set of stations, master and secondaries, was known as a [...] "chain". Similar methods are used to identify chains in the case where more than one chain may be received in a given location.|$|E

5000|$|A VOR {{ground station}} sends out an {{omnidirectional}} <b>master</b> <b>signal,</b> {{and a highly}} directional second signal is propagated by a phased antenna array and rotates clockwise in space 30 times a second. This signal is timed so that its phase (compared to the master) varies as the secondary signal rotates, and this phase difference {{is the same as}} the angular direction of the 'spinning' signal, (so that when the signal is being sent 90 degrees clockwise from north, the signal is 90 degrees out of phase with the master). By comparing the phase of the secondary signal with the master, the angle (bearing) to the aircraft from the station can be determined. This line of position is called the [...] "radial" [...] from the VOR. The intersection of radials from two different VOR stations can be used to fix the position of the aircraft, as in earlier radio direction finding (RDF) systems.|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method for {{controlling}} power transferred to an aircraft. The system includes a master antenna and {{a plurality of}} slave antennas on the ground. Each slave antenna transmits an uplink signal of a unique phase modulated frequency. The master antenna transmits a <b>master</b> uplink <b>signal.</b> The aircraft receives all the uplink signals and modulates a composite of those signals to produce a downlink beacon that has multiple phase components, each of which corresponds {{to one of the}} slave antennas and has a unique frequency. Each of the slave antennas receives the downlink beacon and uses the corresponding phase component to adjust the phase of the slave uplink signal relative to the <b>master</b> uplink <b>signal...</b>|$|R
50|$|The sound {{generator}} was fairly complex, containing 1,400 integrated circuits. The first bank of 32 oscillators {{were used as}} <b>master</b> <b>signals,</b> and generally meant the system had up to 32-note polyphony (see below). A second set of 32 oscillators was slaved {{to one of the}} masters, generating the first N harmonics, where N was from 1 (first harmonic) to 127. Additionally there were a bank of 32 programmable filters, 32 amplitude multipliers, and 256 envelope generators. All of these signals could be mixed in an arbitrary fashion into a bank of 192 accumulators. These were then sent to one of four 16-bit output channels, and from there to a digital-to-analog converter for output.|$|R
