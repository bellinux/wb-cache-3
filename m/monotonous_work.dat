The Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order was issued to reassert that the able-bodied should not receive outdoor relief and the Outdoor Labour Test Order meant that paupers in the North of England had to do hard <b>monotonous</b> <b>work</b> {{in order to receive}} outdoor relief. In 1863 when American crop failures led to an increase in pauperism the government passed short term measures which legitimized outdoor relief. The Local Government Board similarly encouraged those unions to limit outdoor relief.|$|E
25|$|On the Canadian home front, {{there were}} {{many ways in which}} women could {{participate}} in the war effort. Not only did women help raise money; they rolled bandages, knitted socks, mitts, sweaters, and scarves for the men serving overseas. Women raised money to send cigarettes and candy overseas and comfort the fighting men. Canadian women were encouraged to marshal support for the war by persuading wives and mothers to allow their men and sons to enlist. During the war, an immense amount of pressure was laid on women to do their part. One of women’s largest contributions to the war was in the form of voluntary organisations. Through different organisations women volunteered millions of hours of unpaid labour. One of the biggest organisations that middle class women participated in was the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire. The IODE strongly advocated imperialist sentiment. By World War I the IODE was of the largest Canadians women’s voluntary associations. The IODE organised writing competitions to raise awareness of the war and bring patriotic feeling to Canadian children. Lois Allan joined the Farm Services Corps in 1918, to replace the men who were sent to the front. Allan was placed at E.B. Smith and Sons where she hulled strawberries for jam. Jobs were opened up at factories as well, as industrial production increased. Work days for these women consisted of ten to twelve hours, six days a week. Because the days consisted of long <b>monotonous</b> <b>work,</b> many women made of parodies of popular songs to get through the day and boost morale. Depending on the area of Canada, some women were given a choice to sleep in either barracks or tents at the factory or farm that they were employed at.|$|E

40|$|Thesis Title: The Quantification of Biomechanical Consequences of <b>Monotonous</b> Sedentary <b>Work</b> to the Axial System Thesis Goals: The {{goal of the}} Diploma Thesis is {{to assess}} the impact of {{sedentary}} work position on the axial system and to find out what changes in biomechanical properties occur specifically in the spine after the specific monotonous eight hours lasting load. Method: Five probands were exposed to diagnostic vibrations of the TVS method (transfer vibration through the spine) before performing eight hours <b>monotonous</b> sedentary <b>work</b> and after it. The examined feature was the ability of the axial system to dampen vibrations spread throughout the spine. Dampening reactions of individual segments were compared to each other before and after the performance of work. Results: The TVS method applied at work has proven its adequacy in the provision of information on resonance frequencies and on the overall attenuation of the spine with sufficient accuracy so that the impact to the axial system after completing the work performance was clearly identifiable. When comparing the frequency dependence and overall attenuation of individual probands we have found that the overall attenuation of the spine increased in all examined individuals.

The widely spread cultivation of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) has changed the use of harvesting tools (from a rice knife to a sickle) and the form of rice grains handled by farmers in the field (from panicles to paddy). A remarkable increase in wet-season harvests has created a {{problem of how to}} handle the huge amount of wet paddy at harvest time in the late rainy season. Intervention by the Indonesian government has played an essential role in stabilizing the retail prices of rice as well as in improving the quality of white rice in distribution.

Consisting of three rifle companies and a support company, 2 RAR was once again joined by two companies from the RNZIR and on 15 May the ANZAC title was adopted again. The second tour was focused mainly upon 'pacification', which sought to provide security of the struggling South Vietnamese state by seeking out and destroying the VC in their bases areas and isolating them from the ordinary civilian population. This was essentially very <b>monotonous</b> <b>work</b> for the infantrymen. The Vietcong had been greatly weakened {{by the failure of}} the Tet Offensive, and as a result over the twelve months that 2 RAR was deployed contact was significantly less than had been experienced during the first tour, sustaining half the number of casualties. Nevertheless, the presence of two strong provincial VC regiments in the area meant that security in Phuoc Tuy remained problematic until the end and in May 1971, 4 RAR/NZ took over from 2 RAR and the battalion returned to Australia.|$|E

This study purposed to find out the difference of creative thinking between monotonous-working and non-monotonous-working employess.

The hypothesis stated that there were difference monotonous-working and non-monotonous-working employess. Those who <b>work</b> <b>monotonous</b> have low level of creative thinking, and those who work non-monotonous have high level of creative thinking. This research used non-experimental design. The dependent variable was to think creative and the independent variable was kind/characteristic of working (monotonous and non-monotonous-working). This study was conducted in PT.

Snowshoe work, under such conditions, called for the use of muscles other than those used in ordinary walking. From step to step the rising foot could not come up and forward on a slant. It had to be raised perpendicularly. When the snowshoe was pressed into the snow, its nose was confronted by a vertical wall of snow twelve inches high. If the foot, in rising, slanted forward the slightest bit, the nose of the shoe penetrated the obstructing wall and tipped downward till the heel of the shoe struck the man's leg behind. Thus up, straight up, twelve inches, each foot must be raised every time and all the time, ere the forward swing from the knee could begin.|$|E

Various legislations have been enacted along with technical standards for ergonomic risk evaluation {{to ensure the safety}} of the operators. There are numerous methods to assess the ergonomic risk at work. However, most methods are not meant to be used for assessing cyclic work. This paper proposes a method, Postural Ergonomic Risk Assessment (PERA), which is suitable to evaluate the postural ergonomic risk of short cyclic assembly work. Its key features are simplicity and compliance with standards. The added value of the method is that it provides an analysis of every work task in the work cycle, which facilitates the identification of sources of high risk to the operator. The method has been verified on nine work cycles, constituted by 88 work tasks, and it demonstrates accordance with the European Assembly Worksheet (EAWS), which has been developed to comply with the relevant standards and is one of the most comprehensive tools for ergonomic risk assessment. Industrial relevance: The simplicity and the compliance with standards of the proposed method would allow for a quick check of every work task of the work cycle and identification of problem areas. With further work, it would be possible to integrate the method along with work design tools used in the industry...|$|R
