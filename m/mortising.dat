Mann's Emigrant's Guide of 1849 suggests that those heading for Australia's unsettled areas take {{with them a}} plentiful supply {{of a wide variety}} of tools and fasteners, but he lists as the very minimum, 'A hand saw; Axe; Adze; <b>Mortising</b> chisel; Two augers, 1 and 11/4 inch; Two maul rings; Set of wedges; 1 Spade; Pick-axe; Two-foot rule; Chalk line; Square; A Plumb Bob.' A majority of early settlers had formerly been manual labourers, or servicemen, and brought with them a sound practical ability and aptitude for 'making do'; others observed or helped and copied their techniques.|$|E
