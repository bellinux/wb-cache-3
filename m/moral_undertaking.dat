40|$|Extract] Getting action {{research}} right {{requires more than}} a <b>moral</b> <b>undertaking</b> {{to do justice to}} the research recipient. It entails more than finding a set of willing participants, working with them, evaluating one's activities and noting change within the research setting/participants or even within oneself. Action research needs also to entail a level of intellectual honesty that seizes opportunities to make visible the most marginalised. Silent hegemonies can express themselves in attitudes, ideologies, idiosyncrasies, customs and cultural practices, maintaining oppression at unconscious and subjective levels and awareness of their impact can remain hidden from view...|$|E
40|$|Is {{clinical}} {{legal education}} an inherently <b>moral</b> <b>undertaking?</b> In {{this issue of}} the IJCLE, we have three papers linked by their focus on the underpinning values of CLE: whether we can transmit our values through the clinic experience; whether we can most effectively teach ethics through clinic and whether our commitment to and belief in clinic should be expressed by bringing it from the margins to the centre of legal education. There is a common perception amongst educators that we transmit our values tacitly through the curriculum and that, by providing students with a particular kind of learning experience, we create in them specific dispositions. The logical formula appears to run: 1. We embed the values {{in the structure of the}} curriculum (e. g. by running a pro bono clinic) 2. We engage students in the activity 3. They absorb the values and become active agents pursuing those values in future activities...|$|E

It is based on ethnographic fieldwork on the control of welfare recipients by public welfare agencies in France. I consider investigations conducted {{in the homes of}} welfare recipients as a form of bureaucratic interrogation, with particular emphasis on its defining features, modalities and uses, and how it contributes to our understanding of contemporary practices in the institutional treatment of welfare recipients. The impact of the institutional power of constraint is combined with that of the uncertainty of the recipients ‟ situations, of the modalities of their control, and of the rules enforced on such occasions. The paradox of these checks, which are made in the name of legal rigor but characterized by uncertainty and the discretionary power of grassroots agents, reveals the broader functioning of a government of the poor, based on the combination of a multitude of individual relationships, which though unevenly coordinated derive from a structural rationale – that of the economic imperative of putting people back to work combined with a <b>moral</b> <b>undertaking</b> of reforming habituses that fail to conform to the job market‟s and/or the welfare institutions ‟ demands. Rather than disaggregation of the state, individualization and uncertainty {{can be viewed as a}} consistent mode of governance in which discretion and leeway of street-level bureaucrats are necessary for the state to exert power on citizens ‟ behaviors...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWorking-class {{adolescents}} of French urban peripheries are {{key figures}} {{in a new}} social debate that reactivates the nineteenth century spectre of " dangerous " classes to be controlled. Since the 1990 s, French social counselling has privileged two modalities of response: taking account of suffering and government by listening and speech. We hypothesize that the contemporary moral economy allows for social interactions that go beyond social control and institutional domination. This is partly because professionals engaged in this <b>moral</b> <b>undertaking</b> may keep a critical distance, and partly because the concerned populations aren " t necessarily devoid of resources to advance their interests or incapable of resistance. The concept of moral economy, coupled with the ethnographic method, is heuristic for fully comprehending the complexity of these issues and their stakes. Our fieldwork was centred on a French Adolescent Centre in an impoverished commune in Paris " s periphery, from January 2010 through March 2011. These institutions were established in the early 2000 s to respond to adolescent " suffering " by crossing social work and psychiatry. Adolescents, parents, and other institutions (especially schools) solicit the professionally diverse staff for assistance, which in turn may take on cases and/or make referrals to other support institutions. By paying attention to all the scenes upon which {{the story of a}} counselled adolescent evolves, and bearing more general social evolutions in mind by applying the concept of moral economy, we can consider the multiplicity of seemingly contradictory processes as a whole. We see the destabilization of parents and their loss of symbolic capital, partly due to the norms of contemporary parenthood and partly due to the stigmatization of working-class adolescence. But we also discern possibilities for expressing sentiments of injustice and humiliation, for increasing symbolic capital, and in some cases a reappropriation of the system, particularly in trajectories marked by a will for social ascension...|$|E

We engaged Foucault's ‘technologies of the self’ and his notion of ethics (the relationship with self) to examine that moral work (individual actions rather than adherence to universal moral codes) in relation to women's subjectivity constructed in interviews with 49 women from the UK. Four categories of moral work were identified: biographical preservation, biographical repair, altruism and political action.

They also emphasised the fit between their work requirements and their abilities. Those with a career orientation assigned status significance to their work: they derived meaning from {{their position in the}} organizational, and valued the job security of their career-for-life. The ambassadors who displayed a way of life orientation assigned dominance significance to their work: they referred to all consuming nature of work, and the blurred boundaries between work, family and social life.

40|$|The authors {{propose that}} the {{empirical}} study of human <b>moral</b> behavior as <b>undertaken</b> by positive psychologists, psychologists interested {{in the study of}} values, and experimental ethicists can be normative at its core, yet also remain truly scientific. To do this, those interested in the empirical study of human moral behavior should consider the concept of affordances, which is central to the Gibsonian ecological psychology tradition, as an approach to studying virtues and strengths. From this perspective, virtues can be better defined as part of moral analogues of affordances (MAAs). Just as the affordance “being-climbable ” is a relation between climbing ability and height, so one can similarly define a MAA as an opportunity for moral behavior. Virtues, on this account, would be defined as abilities to behave appropriately in morally relevant situations. If one studies virtues as components of MAAs, virtues are only comprehensible in terms of morally relevant situations. Similarly, morally relevant situations are comprehensible only in terms of abilities to behave appropriately in them, that is, in terms of virtues. We believe that such an approach holds many advantages...|$|R

50|$|Others {{argue that}} {{dominant}} countries, especially the United States and its coalition partners, are using humanitarian pretexts to pursue otherwise unacceptable geopolitical goals and {{to evade the}} non-intervention norm and legal prohibitions {{on the use of}} international force. Noam Chomsky and Tariq Ali are at the forefront of this camp, viewing professions of humanitarian motivation with deep skepticism. They argue that the United States has continued to act with its own interests in mind, with the only change being that humanitarianism has become a legitimizing ideology for projection of U.S. hegemony in a post-Cold War world. Ali in particular argues that NATO intervention in Kosovo was conducted largely to boost NATO's credibility. Chomsky’s expression of “our excess of righteousness and disinterested benevolence” is often used to describe Kennedy’s invasion of South Vietnam, which spread to all of Indochina. Furthermore, he asserts that the prospective leader of “humanitarian intervention” must uphold several qualifications. A first qualification is that the leader has to work as a moral agent that does not magnify the danger of elite culture, the efficacy of the intervention should be on the targeted population, and the people must be the <b>moral</b> agents that <b>undertake</b> humanitarian efforts.|$|R
40|$|Geography’s {{debates about}} how to {{maintain}} a sense of morally responsible action often emphasise the problematic nature of caring at a distance, and take for granted particular kinds of moral selfhood in which responsibility is bound into notions of human agency that emphasise knowledge and recognition. Taking commodity consumption as a field in which the ethics, morality, and politics of responsibility has been problematised, we argue that existing research on consumption fails to register the full complexity of the practices, motivations and mechanisms through which the working-up of <b>moral</b> selves is <b>undertaken</b> in relation to consumption practices. Rather than assuming that ethical decision-making works through the rational calculation of obligations, we conceptualise the emergence of ethical consumption as ways in which everyday practical moral dispositions are re-articulated by policies, campaigns and practices that enlist ordinary people into broader projects of social change. Ethical consumption, then, involves both a governing of consumption and a governing of the consuming self. Using the example of Traidcraft, we present a detailed examination of one particular context in which self-consciously ethical consumption is mediated, suggesting that ethical consumption {{can be understood as}} opening up ethical and political considerations in new combinations. We therefore argue for the importance of the growth of ethical consumption as a new terrain of political action, while also emphasising the grounds upon which ethical consumption can be opened up to normative critique...|$|R
40|$|This thesis examines, on a {{case study}} basis, how written texts and traditions {{function}} {{in the construction of}} a Roman philosophical identity in Seneca's Epistulae Morales, and how these moral letters operate within the shared cultural framework of Seneca and his audience. In sum, Seneca's Epistulae Morales aim to construct and legitimise a Roman philosophical identity, and to make the journey of <b>moral</b> progress <b>undertaken</b> by Seneca and the addressee Lucilius the paradigm for its wider Roman audience. The first part of the book, consisting of two chapters, discusses the central theoretical concepts and how these can be applied effectively to the study of Seneca's letters. It studies the cultural context of Seneca and his audience as well as the textual traditions to which the Epistulae Morales belong. In the second part of my thesis four letters (Ep. 11, 15, 78, 106) serve as case studies, each letter constituting one of the four chapters. The central theme in the selection of letters is the topic of the body. The theme of the body helps to bear out Seneca's construction of a cultural identity and his reinterpretation of authoritative texts and traditions as it serves as an ideological battleground characterised by disagreement and professional competition for authority on the subject. Against the background of various competing views, Seneca assesses the importance of physical exercise, chooses mental health over bodily health, and discusses the inability to change inborn characteristics scuh as blushing. This study brings out the process of cultural identity construction in the letters, drawing attention to the nature of cultural memory as inscribed in literature, as well as the interpretation of 'our own' views and values, and those of 'others'. Seneca's aim to adapt Greek (Stoic) philosophy to a Roman audience calls for the integration of different cultural backgrounds. The ambitious claims of philosophy, combined with the partly critical Roman attitude towards Greek philosophy, provide a challenging background for his project of presenting philosophy as not merely a viable, but even the most suitable, option for a member of the Roman elite. At the same time, in order to appeal to his Roman audience, Seneca takes account of the Roman cultural perspective and customises the philosophical tradition by addressing Roman concerns and by writing in Latin. In addition, Seneca capitalises on the epistolary form to give personal advice, to underline the friendly bonds between him and Lucilius, and to present a model for others that actualises a philosophical life in accordance with Roman culture. By singling out five central identities in the letters—the human, Roman, upper-class, philosophical and Stoic identity—we further define key elements of Seneca's self-presentation. In placing emphasis on the arrangement of the different themes within each letter, on how epistolary features are employed, and on how text and audience presuppose one another, the book seeks to further our understanding of these individual letters, of the Epistulae Morales as a literary and philosophical work, and {{of the ways in which}} Seneca conveys his philosophical message to his audienc...|$|R
60|$|He had {{undertaken}} to demonstrate by arguments which he thought {{could not be}} refuted, and by documents which he was sure could not be denied, that no comparison was to be made between the British government and the French usurpation.

He meant to demonstrate that the French scheme was not a comparative good, but a positive evil. That the question did not at all turn, as had been stated, on a parallel between a monarchy and a republic. He denied that the present scheme of things in France did at all deserve the respectable name of a republic: he had therefore no comparison between monarchies and republics to make.

40|$|Today {{more than}} ever, the ethical and moral {{questions}} of communications are pertinent {{in our day}} lifes and in various contexts of social life, affecting in an immediate manner different levels of experience. Thus, these questions constitute a primordial challenge to sociological thought. It {{is in response to}} this challenge that this study endeavors to analyze the public space and public opinion, institutions, of reference in modern societies that bring into focus the eminent ethical and moral dilemmas of communication today. The proposed analysis begins with the notion of social action and follows two fundamental vectors: social action as a for of rationality and as a process of meaning. The current situation of practical reason - of rationality at the levles of the regulation of social relationships and of forms of sociability - is marked by a deep discontinuity between the symbolic mediatizations of modern technological mecahnisms and the utopian universe of communication. This fracture in public discourse situates the ethical-moral discussion with modern media and leads to their questioning as language mechanisms: with an eminently performative and pragmatic dimension (extended in immediate terms as forms of action) that assume a profound compromise with life and with mankind. Recognizing that the media are bearers of an ethical and moral problem in our societies means that they cannot be vewed in a simple manner, nor as demoniac forces, nor as celestial beings. The ethical interpellation that the media provide demands more than the mere questioning of their internal functioning, a tragic perspective that is often transmitted and that reduces the ethical and the moral dimensions to some (more or less fundamental) deontology. It is the inscription of media in collective experience that is in question, reason for which it becomes indispensable to reflect upon media in the framework of different forms of life and generally, in symblic processes. The investigation of this question is developed in four phases. The first phase defines the theoretical and methodological framework from a reaproximation with critical theory of society based on the paradigm of communication. The second phase proceeds with a discussion of the structure of communication in modern societies, based on a genealogical procedure of reconstitution of the institutions of the public space and public opinion that reveals their profoundly ambivalent relationship and tensions in our days [...] In the third phase, the relationship of communication with ethics and <b>morals</b> is <b>undertaken</b> within the framework of democratic thought and a democratic form of life. An attempt is made to respond to a dual challenge: the cahllenge of social justice (in terms of an acceptable organization of collective life) and the autonomy of the individual (translated in the utopian energies that endow the world with meanings). In the final phase, the investigation concludes with a more detailed discussion of the problem of power. To the exaltations of subjectivity and the proclamations of the 'end of the subject', this study presents the alternative of a form of power constituted on an ethical and moral basis, a form of power that finds its normative reference in communication and its inherent intercomprehensive demandsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Commenting on Professor Cass Sunstein 2 ̆ 7 s {{work is a}} {{daunting}} task. There is simply so much of it. Professor Sunstein produces scholarship {{at a rate that}} is faster than I can consume it. Scarcely an area of law has failed to feel his impact. One cannot today write an article on administrative law, free speech, punitive damages, Internet law, law and economics, separation of powers, or animal rights law without addressing one or more of Sunstein 2 ̆ 7 s papers. And his work is typically not a mere footnote. Sunstein has changed how scholars think about each of these areas of law. More broadly, his work has made his mark on psychology, economics, and political science. But, surprisingly, one of his most subversive, and important, articles, Moral Heuristics, is directed primarily at philosophers. Sunstein 2 ̆ 7 s Moral Heuristics approaches the gates of philosophical discourse like a Trojan Horse. The article 2 ̆ 7 s title uses the well-known jargon of psychology. This is no surprise, as the piece is published in a psychological journal (albeit one known for sometimes engaging in philosophical inquiry). It thus seems that the piece will be another of his many valuable conversions of psychological research into legal concepts. Sunstein is well known for mining out nuggets of social and cognitive psychology that have been previously ignored by legal scholars and demonstrating that an understanding of these principles is actually critical for understanding some area of law. But Moral Heuristics is not such a piece. It brings some psychological research to bear on legal issues, but the piece is more ambitious than that. It provides a new way for both psychologists and legal scholars to think about the concept of heuristics. It then uses this new approach to challenge the basic epistemological assumptions of contemporary moral philosophy. The basic thesis of Moral Heuristics is that people rely on simple habits of the mind when thinking about moral issues. As in many areas of life, they do not adhere to principles of deductive logic. They resist relying on broad-based optimization strategies (such as cost-benefit analysis) as a means of addressing hard moral questions in favor of simple rules of thumb. For example, Sunstein argues that people avoid making decisions that they know will result in the death of another person. This is a good principle to follow, of course, but blind application of it can lead to paradox because some fatalities are more invisible than others. The principle can produce condemnation of those who account for less visible, indirect fatalities, as happens in cost-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis makes indirect fatalities transparent, thereby making those who rely on it seem callous, even if they are trying to minimize the total fatality rate. But Sunstein 2 ̆ 7 s admonition against using overly simple habits of mind to assess complex choices in modern society is not what is novel about this paper. Many of his papers engage in that kind of exposition. What sets this paper apart is how he uses the concept of heuristics. In this paper, Sunstein uses the idea of mental shortcuts in a highly contextual way. He seems, at times, to be inventing new heuristics. New to this paper are terms such as the 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 cold-heart heuristic 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 do not play God 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 heuristic. And obviously the 2 ̆ 7 Justice Antonin Scalia heuristic 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 is not one psychologists would have heard before. Implicit in this move is that Sunstein must be arguing that the mental shortcuts that people are taking are highly specific. They are not global habits of mind that people use in all places to suit all purposes. Rather, people seize upon these heuristics to solve certain problems. That is a novel move and one that nicely embraces some of the criticisms levied against the concept of heuristics, both in psychology and in law, and shows them to be modifications, rather than criticisms. The second novel claim of the paper is its main target. In asserting that the psychological concept of heuristics speaks directly to the epistemology of moral philosophy, Sunstein attacks the foundations of contemporary moral philosophy. Sunstein argues that people reject deductive logic in their approach to statistical and probabilistic reasoning, preferring instead to rely on heuristics that are often inconsistent with logic. Consequently, creating a workable, internally coherent mathematics based on people 2 ̆ 7 s intuitions about numbers would be a foolish undertaking. Sunstein argues that {{the same is true for}} moral philosophy. Intuitions about moral issues, he contends, are no more apt to be coherent than intuitions about probability theory. Therefore, founding a normative theory of moral philosophy upon intuition is just as misguided as founding mathematics on intuition. And yet, that is exactly what contemporary <b>moral</b> philosophers <b>undertake.</b> I flesh out these issues in this paper. First, I discuss how Sunstein 2 ̆ 7 s approach to heuristics differs from what many psychologists adopt and how this new approach addresses some of the criticism levied at the heuristics and biases literature. Second, I review how this new approach undergirds Sunstein 2 ̆ 7 s critique of moral philosophy...|$|R
