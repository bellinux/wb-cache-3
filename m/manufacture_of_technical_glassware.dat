40|$|When Haldor Topsøe founded {{his company}} in 1940, the {{application}} of solid catalysts in industrial chemical processes was still in its early phase. At that time, catalyst development and optimization strongly relied on phenomenological approaches and experimental know-how, whereas little knowledge existed {{on the nature of}} the catalytically active species and how to tune their structure and concentration. For more than 70 years, Topsøe has advocated the need of “bringing more scientific understanding to the field of catalysis,” becoming a prominent figure in the transition of catalyst preparation – a word with an alchemical connotation – to catalyst synthesis, based on scientific principles. Numerous fundamental studies of his team and collaborators on simplified model catalysts have added substantially to the current understanding of a significant number of industrially relevant systems in particular, and the principles of action of solid catalysts in general. This article reviews some key advancements that the Topsøe team has contributed to the field of catalyst development, rooted in fundamental studies with either 2 D or 3 D model materials. Examples are provided of how the acquired scientific knowledge was successfully translated into innovations in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>technical</b> catalysts.

Owing to their persistence and semi-volatility, PBBs could transport long distance and thus pose potential risk to global environment and human health. Commercial hexabrominated biphenyls (technical Hexa-BBs) have been listed in the Annex A covered under Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2009 for banning the <b>manufacture</b> and use <b>of</b> <b>technical</b> Hexa-BBs.
