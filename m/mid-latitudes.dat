40|$|The <b>mid-latitude</b> {{ionosphere}} is {{more complicated}} than previously thought, as it includes many different scales of wave-like structures. Recent studies reveal that the <b>mid-latitude</b> ionospheric irregularities are less understood due to lack of models and observations that can explain the characteristics of the observed wave structures. Since temperature and density gradients are a persistent feature in the <b>mid-latitude</b> ionosphere near the plasmapause, the drift mode growth rate at short wavelengths may explain the <b>mid-latitude</b> decameter-scale ionospheric irregularities observed by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN).

First, the physical mechanism of the Temperature Gradient Instability (TGI), which is a strong candidate for producing <b>mid-latitude</b> irregularities, is proposed.

5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind.

Westerly winds in the <b>mid-latitudes</b> of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans.

30|$|The flows {{that show}} no {{correlation}} between SYM-H and MLAT {{are considered to be}} <b>mid-latitude</b> F-region echoes (Fukao et al. 1988). In order to be sure that these echoes are the <b>mid-latitude</b> F-region echoes, it is necessary to confirm that they have similar characteristics. Fukao et al. (1988) revealed that <b>mid-latitude</b> F-region echoes have spectral width of 20 – 30  Hz using the MU VHF radar observation. Since the spectral width is considered to correspond to the decorrelation time of echoes, we need to confirm that our echoes with no SYM-H-latitude relationship have similar parameters. Thus, we checked the spectral width of these echoes converted into the values in the unit of Hertz instead of meters per second. We found {{that the majority of the}} echoes have spectral widths less than 40  Hz, which is comparable to the <b>mid-latitude</b> F-region echoes. On the contrary, most of the echoes identified as SAPS (with close SYM-H-latitude relationships) have spectral width wider than 40  Hz, indicating that their characteristics are different from <b>mid-latitude</b> F-region echoes.|$|R

5|$|The Voyagers found aurora-like {{ultraviolet}} {{emissions of}} hydrogen at <b>mid-latitudes</b> in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity {{may lead to}} the formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the rotation of Saturn (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the <b>mid-latitudes</b> {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the south polar region {{is marked by a}} pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern <b>mid-latitudes</b> to its south pole. Consequently, the moon's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped discontinuities and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped discontinuities, and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.|$|E

5|$|Note {{that these}} numbers are for the {{terrestrial}} surface and not really a global average. Whether dimming (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has {{been a bit of}} an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation. A 2009 review by Wild et al. found that widespread variation in regional and time effects. There was solar brightening beyond 2000 at numerous stations in Europe, the United States, and Korea. The brightening seen at sites in Antarctica during the 1990s, influenced by recovering from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, fades after 2000. The brightening tendency also seems to level off at sites in Japan. In China there is some indication for a renewed dimming, after the stabilization in the 1990s. A continuation of the long-lasting dimming is also noted at the sites in India. Overall, the available data suggest continuation of the brightening beyond the year 2000 at numerous locations, yet less pronounced and coherent than during the 1990s, with more regions with no clear changes or declines. Therefore, globally, greenhouse warming after 2000 may be less modulated by surface solar variations than in prior decades. The largest reductions are found in the northern hemisphere <b>mid-latitudes.</b> Visible light and infrared radiation seem to be most affected rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the <b>mid-latitudes</b> while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E

There are no significant trends in the tropics, largely because halogen-containing compounds have not had time to break down and release chlorine and bromine atoms at tropical latitudes.|$|E

Information on H+ {{as well as on the}} plasma temperature might be useful to understand these findings.
