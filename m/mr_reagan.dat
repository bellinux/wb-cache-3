2500|$|It is {{speculated that}} Mondale lost support with voters nearly {{immediately}} during the campaign, namely during {{his acceptance speech}} at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated {{that he intended to}} increase taxes. To quote Mondale, [...] "By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Reagan</b> will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did." [...] Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{recorded}} problem of Mrs. Reagan's {{was that of}} her children and stepchildren, Maureen, Michael, Patti, and Ron. The most-publicized controversy erupted between Nancy and her daughter Patti. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Reagan</b> wrote of it, [...] "there is still {{time for us to}} improve our relationship, and now that our public years are over, I'm hoping Patti and I will be able to reach some kind of understanding." [...] This was written in 1989 and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Reagan</b> and her daughter have since reconciled.

5000|$|Reed, a California {{business}} {{executive and}} former Air Force Secretary under Ford and Carter, served under President Reagan {{as a vice}} chairman of the newly created National Commission on Strategic Forces.

[...] While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.|$|E

5000|$|According to Fred Barnes, {{a former}} news {{columnist}} and current television pundit on Fox News, Reagan's {{book was a}} confirmation of many speculated reports about the <b>Reagan</b> White House. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Reagan</b> argues against the media about her image, saying she was not [...] "as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted." [...] She comments on President Reagan's White House staff frequently: of James Baker, former White House Chief of Staff, she says that [...] "his main interest was Jim Baker"; Michael Deaver, a Reagan adviser for two decades, [...] "caught {{a bad case of}} Potomac fever"; William Clark, a Reagan staffer, was a [...] "bad choice" [...] for top positions within the administration and a [...] "user" [...] who unjustly spoke for President Reagan. Donald Regan, former Treasury Secretary and White House Chief of Staff whom often had a contested relationship with Nancy Reagan, was talked about in detail. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Reagan</b> denied forming a plan to oust him from the staff, saying that there was not [...] "a plot to get rid of Don Regan.

5000|$|In 1988, Jacobsen told a House Judiciary Committee that Seal {{had flown}} to an {{airstrip}} in Nicaragua {{in an airplane}} that had cameras installed by the Central Intelligence Agency. Seal took pictures during the Nicaragua sting operation that purported to show Pablo Escobar, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vásquez, {{and other members of}} the Medellín Cartel loading kilos of cocaine onto a C-123 transport plane. Also Frederico Vaughan, whom Seal claimed was an associate of Tomas Borges' of the Interior Ministry of Nicaragua, was photographed with Sandinista soldiers helping load the plane. However, Wall Street Journal reporter Jonathan Kwitney threw strong doubt on Seal's claims of a Sandinista connection: [...] "The Nicaraguan [...] "military airfield" [...] that government officials said Mr. Seal flew from is, in fact, a civilian field used chiefly for crop-dusting flights, the State Department now concedes. That concession undermines the basis for linking Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, President Ortega's brother, to the operation. In fact, the man who supervised Mr. Seal's work for the government — Richard Gregorie, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Miami — says he could find no information beyond Mr. Seal's word tying any Nicaraguan official to the drug shipment. As for Federico Vaughan, the man <b>Mr.</b> <b>Reagan</b> called an aide to a Sandinista commandant, federal prosecutors and drug officials now say they aren't sure who he is." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the 1968 presidential campaign, Brown {{endorsed}} Democratic {{presidential candidate}} Hubert Humphrey and appeared with Humphrey at political rallies. Brown began supporting Republican president Richard Nixon after {{being invited to}} perform at Nixon's inaugural ball in January 1969. Brown's endorsement of Nixon during the 1972 presidential election negatively impacted his career during that period with several national Black organizations boycotting his records and protesting at his concert shows. Brown stated he was neither Democratic nor Republican despite his support of Republican presidents such as Nixon and Ronald Reagan. In 1999, when being interviewed by Rolling Stone, the magazine asked him to name a hero in the 20th century; Brown mentioned John F. Kennedy and 96-year-old, former Dixiecrat Senator Strom Thurmond, stating [...] "when the young whippersnappers get out of line, whether Democratic or Republican, an old man can walk up and say 'Wait a minute, son, it goes this way.' And that's great for our country. He's like a grandfather to me." [...] In 2003, Brown was the featured attraction of a Washington D.C. fundraiser for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Following the deaths of Ronald Reagan and his friend Ray Charles, Brown said to CNN, [...] "I'm kind of in an uproar. I love the country and I got - you know I've {{been around a long}} time, through many presidents and everything. So after losing <b>Mr.</b> <b>Reagan,</b> who I knew very well, then Mr. Ray Charles, who I worked with and lived with like, all our life, we had a show together in Oakland many, many years ago and it's like you found the placard." ...|$|E

5000|$|As Secretary of Defense, Weinberger oversaw {{a massive}} {{rebuilding}} of US military strength. Major defense programs he championed included the B-1B bomber and the [...] "600-ship Navy". His efforts created economic and military-industrial pressures that {{were associated with}} the beginning of Perestroika {{and the beginning of the}} end of both the Cold War and the Soviet Union.However, this thesis was contested by a study on the causes of the collapse of the Soviet Union by two prominent economists from the World Bank - William Easterly, and Stanley Fischer from MIT: [...] "… the study concludes that the increased Soviet defense spending provoked by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Reagans</b> policies was not the straw that broke the back of the Evil Empire. The Soviet war in Afghanistan and the Soviet response to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Reagans</b> Star Wars program caused only a relatively small rise in USSR defense costs. The massive US defense effort throughout the period from 1960 to 1987 contributed only marginally to Soviet economic decline." ...|$|R
