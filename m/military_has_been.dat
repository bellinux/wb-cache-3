5|$|The Australian <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an all-volunteer force {{since the}} {{abolition}} of conscription in 1972. Both men and women can enlist in the ADF, with women being able to apply for all roles. Only Australian citizens and permanent residents who are eligible for Australian citizenship can enlist. Recruits must be aged between 17 and 55, and meet health and educational standards. The ADF {{is one of the}} few areas of the Australian Government to continue to have compulsory retirement ages: permanent personnel must retire at 60 years of age and reservists at 65. Discipline of defence personnel is guided by the Defence Force Discipline Act (1982), ultimately overseen by the Judge Advocate General of the ADF.|$|E
5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5000|$|The {{weakness}} of the Canadian <b>military</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a factor in its very limited role in the 1991 Gulf War. While the <b>military</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> asked about the feasibility of sending 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (4 CMBG) from Germany to the Gulf to participate in direct combat operations, the Canadian Forces were forced to report that Operation [...] "Broadsword", a theoretical deployment, would likely be a failure.|$|R
25|$|Finally, Argentine <b>military</b> {{aviation}} <b>had</b> never <b>been</b> {{involved in}} an international conflict, indeed {{the last time the}} Argentine <b>military</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{involved in an}} international conflict was the War of the Triple Alliance more than a century before.|$|R

5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was {{a mutual}} naval arms {{limitation}} and disarmament treaty between the five major naval {{powers of the}} time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy {{for the purposes of the}} treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E

25|$|While the {{question}} of homosexuality in the <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> highly politicized in the United States, {{it is not necessarily}} so in many countries. Generally speaking, sexuality in these cultures is considered a more personal aspect of one's identity {{than it is in the}} United States.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} {{mission of the}} armed forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad. Poland's national security goal is to further integrate with NATO and European defence, economic, and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military. The armed forces are being re-organised according to NATO standards, and since 2010, the transition to an entirely contract-based <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> completed. Compulsory military service for men was discontinued in 2008. From 2007, until conscription ended in 2008, the mandatory service was nine months.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> closely {{monitoring}} Islamic State {{movements in}} Libya, and small teams of U.S. military personnel has {{moved in and}} out of the country over a period of months. British, French, Italian and Jordanian special forces as well as the British RAF also have been in Libya helping with aerial surveillance, mapping and intelligence gathering in several cities, including Benghazi in the east and Zintan in the west, according to two Libyan military officials who were coordinating with them. British and American special forces have also been carrying out intelligence-gathering operations around Sirte.|$|E

50|$|Bainimarama and Leweni {{expressed}} {{mixed feelings}} after the government's decision {{to increase its}} budget allocation to the Military to F$76.4 million was announced on 4 November. The figure represented a considerable increase on the F$67 million allocated in 2004, but fell short of the F$84 million the <b>Military</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> seeking. Because the <b>Military</b> <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> allocated all that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> seeking, they would continue with their cost-cutting measures, Leweni said.|$|R
25|$|One unique view, {{which does}} not neatly fall into either of the cultural- or connectivity-gap categories, centers on the {{organizational}} differences {{between the military and}} civilian societies. This view claims to explain much as to why the <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> or may be used to press ahead of society's norms. This view goes beyond the simpler cultural-gap approach and emphasizes the ability of the military society to control the behavior and attitudes of its members in ways not possible in the more open civilian society, as evidenced by such phenomena as desegregation of the military and inclusion of women in the military.|$|E
25|$|Kelly’s {{background}} in the <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested {{as a source of}} the seriousness of his works. While serving time in the army, Kelly was exposed to and influenced by the camouflage with which his specific battalion worked. This taught him about the use of form and shadow, as well as the construction and deconstruction of the visible. It was fundamental to his early education as an artist. Ralph Coburn, a friend of Kelly's from Boston, introduced him to the technique of automatic drawing while visiting in Paris. Kelly embraced this technique of making an image without looking at the sheet of paper. These techniques helped Kelly in loosening his drawing style and broadened his acceptance of what he believed to be art. During his last year in Paris, Kelly was ill and also suffered depression; Sims thought that influenced his predominant use of black and white during that period.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to traditional defense roles, the <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{called on to}} provide support to civil authorities for disaster relief and internal security. The military of Bangladesh fought tribal insurgents in Chittagong Hill Tracts since mid-1970s. In November 2008, Bangladesh Navy effectively staved off economic aggression by Myanmar in the seas of Bangladesh. Occasionally the military forces have been called to participate in social activities like rehabilitation of people following a flood or cyclone. Since late 1980s, it has earned international reputation by working as part of United Nations peacekeeping Missions in different countries of the world. The Bangladesh military is recognized as a disciplined and well-trained national institution that can tackle critical national phases. A 2,300-member Bangladesh Army contingent served with coalition forces during the 1991 Gulf war. Bangladesh is currently the second highest contributor (with 7941 troops, as of October 2013) to United Nations peacekeeping operations, with an infantry battalion in UNIKOM (Kuwait), an engineer battalion in UNTAET, (East Timor) and another infantry battalion service in Sierra Leone in May 2000.|$|E

2500|$|The need {{to monitor}} {{activities}} and warn of potential {{threats to the}} United States is not new. From conventional assaults to potential nuclear attacks, the <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{at the forefront of}} monitoring and warning of potential dangers since the founding of the country. [...] Protecting the security and well being of the United States, including the critical Defense Infrastructure, has now entered a new era. It has been deemed essential to have a coordinated ability to identify and warn of potential or actual incidents among critical infrastructure domains. The ability to detect and warn of infrastructure events is the third phase of the critical infrastructure protection life cycle, the Indications and Warnings phase.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{and more}} {{importantly}} the removal of the former heavily guarded [...] "Iron Curtain" [...] separating Austria and its Eastern Bloc neighbours (Hungary and former Czechoslovakia), the Austrian <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by illegal immigrants. This assistance came to an end when Hungary and Slovakia joined the EU Schengen Area in 2008, {{for all intents and purposes}} abolishing [...] "internal" [...] border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of natural disasters. They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1947 and 1971, Pakistan {{has fought}} three direct {{conventional}} wars against India, with the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 witnessing the secession of East Pakistan as independent Bangladesh. In the latter war, the Pakistan Armed Forces {{were the main}} perpetrators of the Bangladesh genocide, in which, most independent researchers estimate, around 300,000 to 500,000 {{people were killed and}} 200,000 to 400,000 were raped, while the Bangladesh government claims the number of deaths was as high as 3,000,000. Rising tensions with Afghanistan in the 1960s and an indirect proxy war fought against the Soviet Union in the 1970s led to a sharp rise {{in the development of the}} Pakistan Armed Forces. In 1999, an extended period of intense border-skirmishing with India, the so-called Kargil War, resulted in a redeployment of forces. [...] the <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> conducting counterinsurgency operations along the border areas of Afghanistan, while continuing to participate in several United Nations peacekeeping operations.|$|E
