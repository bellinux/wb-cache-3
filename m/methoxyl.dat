In contrast to conventional unlabelled TMAH thermochemolysis, 13 C-labelling allows thermochemolysis products from lignin, demethylated lignin and other polyphenolic litter compounds (e. g. tannins) to be distinguished. Proxies for lignin degradation (phenol yield; acid/aldehyde ratio of products) changed considerably upon correction for the contribution of non-lignin sources to the thermochemolysis products. Using the corrected values, we found increasing acid/aldehyde values as well as decreasing or constant yield of lignin derived phenols normalised to litter carbon, suggesting pronounced lignin degradation by wood-rotting fungi. No indication for build up of demethylated lignin through the action of brown rot fungi on ring <b>methoxyls</b> was found. The results were compared with those of other analytical techniques applied in previous studies. Like 13 C-TMAH thermochemolysis, CuO oxidation showed increasing lignin oxidation (acid/aldehyde ratio) and no/little enrichment of lignin derived phenols in the litter. Molecular lignin degradation patterns did not match those from analysis of total acid unhydrolysable residues (AURs).

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of pectin gelation {{depends on the}} degree of methoxylation. High <b>methoxyl</b> pectin gels due to hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between pectin molecules. Low <b>methoxyl</b> pectin forms gels in the presence of di- and polyvalent cations which cross link and neutralise the negative charges of the pectin molecule. Monovalent cations normally do not lead to gel formation with high <b>methoxyl</b> pectin solutions free of divalent cations, especially Ca.

30|$|The {{degree of}} {{esterification}} (DE) of the dried pectin was 60.4 %. The {{degree of esterification}} is an important molecular index for pectin classification that describes {{the extent to which}} carboxyl groups in pectin molecules exist as the methyl ester. The pectin obtained can be categorized as high <b>methoxyl</b> pectin (HMP) because it has a high percentage of degree of esterification greater than 50 %. A high degree of esterification allows pectin to form gel quickly at high temperatures, having a more effective action on the lipid profile (Brouns et al. 2012; Dominiak et al. 2014). However, the degree of esterification represents only the ratio between methanol-esterified carboxyl groups and free carboxyl groups, whereas the <b>methoxyl</b> rate refers to the amount of <b>methoxyl</b> groups in a sample (Gnanasambandam and Proctor 1999).

Since delta D in precipitation is mainly influenced by climatic conditions, including temperature, evaporation and precipitation amount, <b>methoxyl</b> groups of organic matter have been proposed as a potential palaeoclimate proxy. Here, we measured the delta D values of the <b>methoxyl</b> groups of sedimentary organic matter derived from sediment core segments of Lake Holzmaar (Eifel, Germany). The sediment core covers the entire Holocene and part of the Late Glacial (until 13, 650 years BP). Since the sedimentary organic matter was indicated by organic source proxies of predominantly phytoplanktonic origin, we considered the delta D values of the <b>methoxyl</b> groups as a proxy for the delta D value of the lake water. Presently and probably during most of the Holocene, the delta D value of precipitation was primarily controlled by temperature (2 - 4. 5 parts per thousand/degrees C) as well as in isotopic equilibrium with the delta D value of the lake water. We used these modern temperature sensitivities of the Eifel region together with the measured delta D values of the <b>methoxyl</b> groups of the sedimentary organic matter to evaluate temperature changes recorded for the Holocene. The resulting mean temperature variance was found to be consistently less than 1. 8 - 4 degrees C and is broadly in line with that reported from the NGRIP ice core for the same period. The transition from the Holocene to the Late Glacial period was accompanied with more negative delta D values of the <b>methoxyl</b> groups (similar to 13 parts per thousand/for the Younger Dryas). Besides the association with temperature we assumed a higher susceptibility of the delta D value of Lake Holzmaar to evaporative enrichment during the Younger Dryas which could serve as an explanation for discrepancies reported for existing palaeoclimate/-hydrology records of the Eifel region. Our findings indicate that the delta D values of <b>methoxyl</b> groups have great potential for assisting with palaeoclimate and palaeohydrology, particularly when the organic matter is well characterized and of uniform origin.

A factorial experimental design was {{used and the}} effects of temperature, time and pH of extraction on pectin yield and 'jelly units', ie pectin yield x viscosity of pectin solution were determined. Optimum conditions for pectin extraction are also discussed. According to ash and <b>methoxyl</b> content determinations the product can be classified as low ash and high <b>methoxyl</b> pectin. Its purity expressed as anhydrogalacturonic acid content varied from 68 - 5 to 75. 0 %...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} the most {{abundant}} C 1 units of terrestrial plants, the <b>methoxyl</b> groups of pectin and lignin, have a unique carbon isotope signature exceptionally depleted in 13 C. Plant-derived C 1 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are also anomalously depleted in 13 C compared with C n + 1 VOCs. The results confirm that the plant <b>methoxyl</b> pool is the predominant source of biospheric C 1 compounds of plant origin such as methanol, chloromethane and bromomethane. Furthermore this pool, comprising ca 2. 5 % of carbon in plant biomass, could be an important substrate for methanogenesis and thus be envisaged as a possible source of isotopically light methane entering the atmosphere. Our findings have significant implications {{for the use of}} carbon isotope ratios in elucidation of global carbon cycling. Moreover <b>methoxyl</b> groups could act as markers for biological activity in organic matter of terrestrial and extraterrestrial origin...|$|E
