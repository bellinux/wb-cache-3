5000|$|The ureters are muscular ducts that propel urine {{from the}} kidneys to the urinary bladder. In the human adult, the ureters are usually 25-30 cm (10-12 in) long. In humans, the ureters {{arise from the}} renal pelvis on the medial aspect of each kidney before {{descending}} towards the bladder {{on the front of}} the psoas major muscle. The ureters cross the pelvic brim near the bifurcation of the iliac arteries (which they run over). This [...] "pelviureteric junction" [...] is a common site for the impaction of kidney stones (the other being the uteterovesical valve). The ureters run posteriorly on the lateral walls of the pelvis. They then curve anteriormedially to enter the bladder through the back, at the vesicoureteric junction, running within the wall of the bladder for a few centimeters. The backflow of urine is prevented by valves known as ureterovesical valves. In the female, the ureters pass through the <b>mesometrium</b> on the way to the bladder.|$|E
40|$|Weight and {{collagen}} {{content of}} the <b>mesometrium,</b> {{that part of the}} reproductive tract which lies between the uterus and the body wall, were measured in the rat, throughout pregnancy and post-partum. Both the weight and the collagen content increased significantly during pregnancy and decreased rapidly after parturition, the collagen content halving in around four days. The changes were almost entirely in the part of the <b>mesometrium</b> between the main longitudinal blood vessels and the uterus. At any given stage of pregnancy, the larger the uterus, the larger were both the weight and collagen {{content of the}} <b>mesometrium.</b> In rats pregnant in only one uterine horn the <b>mesometrium</b> associated with the barren horn showed no changes in weight or collagen content during pregnancy. Removal of fetuses from one uterine horn reversed the growth of the <b>mesometrium</b> associated with that horn, but not the growth of the <b>mesometrium</b> associated with the other (pregnant) horn. Cutting the attachment to the body wall prevented mesometrial growth during pregnancy although the tissue remained attached to the uterus, with its blood supply and the metrial gland intact.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{estrogen}} administration on uterine contractility varies with aninsal species. In nonpregnant ovariectomized sheep, estrogen {{administration has been}} reported either to inhibit, inhibit then stimulate, or only stimulate uterine contractility. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the effects of prolonged estrogen administration in the electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded from the myometrium and <b>mesometrium</b> in nonpregnant ovariectomized sheep after estrous synchronization by inserting vaginal progesterone sponges 14 days before surgery. Surgery was performed on four ewes under halothane anes-thesia. Bilateral oophorectomy was performed, and stainless steel EMG electrodes were sewn to the <b>mesometrium</b> and myo-metrium in both left and right horns of the uterus. Blood samples were taken at 1000 h from the uterine vein for 13, 1 4 -dihydro- 1 5 -keto-prostaglandin F,, determination, and from the femoral artery for estradiol determination. Starting on Day 7 after surgery, estradiol 17 (50 g/ 24 h) was infused continuously into the jugular vein. Estrogen administration had a different effect on the EMG activity recorded from myometrium and <b>mesometrium.</b> The myometrial response to estrogen was an increase in the fre-quency of short EMG events from 19. 0 ± 8. 7 to 57. 0 ± 5. 0 (p 60 sec but less than 60 but less than < 180 sec.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} provides a baseline data on gross anatomy of female reproductive system of Mizo local pig (Zovawk). The organs {{can be divided}} functionally and morphologically into the ovaries, and the tubular organs, which lead from the ovaries through the pelvis to the outside. The tubular organs consist of the uterine tubes, the uterus, and the copulatory organ. The copulatory organ is subdivided into vagina, vestibule and the vulva. The uterus is apparently U-shaped and the diverging horns were long, flexuous and almost reach the caudal extremities of the ovaries. The mesovarium was long. The mesosalpinx was highly vascular, arises from the lateral surface of the mesovarium and the adjacent part of the <b>mesometrium.</b> It contained the uterine tube and formed a large cone-shaped ovarian bursa which concealed the ovary. The <b>mesometrium</b> was attached dorso-laterally to the uterine horns and corpus uteri, originating from the dorso-lateral walls of the abdominal and pelvic peritoneal cavity.

40|$|Uteri from {{non-pregnant}} {{and pregnant}} (Days 1 - 10) mice were examined {{for the presence}} of NADPH diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity by histochemical techniques. Macrophages positive for NADPH-d were observed in all uterine sections but appeared to migrate out of the implantation site and cluster in the <b>mesometrium</b> and interimplantation zones beginning on Day 4. NADPH-d activity was seen in the luminal and glandular epithelium and in several isolated fibers coursing through the myometrium. Many branches of the uterine artery also expressed activity, with the most intense staining in the vessels of the <b>mesometrium.</b> However, the most remarkable staining began on Day 6 within the primary decidual zone. When the stromal cells underwent decidualization, they began to show NADPH-d activity, with the pattern of activity matching the expanding area of decidualization. By Day 9 most of the decidual cell reaction had occurred and the mesometrial decidual staining began to decrease. However, the blood vessels and the cells surrounding the developing blood spaces continued to express activity, and heavy staining was evident within the antimesometrial decidua. No NADPH-d activity was seen in any of the trophoblast cells at any time, or in embryonic tissue, except on Day 8. NADPH-d has been used to identify nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Therefore, it may represent an NO-mediated paracrine control over decidual blood flow, myometrial quiescence, or immune response during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The angioarchitecture of the {{internal}} genitalia of twenty-six female swine was studied. The arteries of the genitalia of female swine anastomose freely allowing fluid injected into one artery to flow into all other arteries of the genitalia. A similar degree of anastomosis exists in the veins. There is no branch to the uterine horn from the so-called utero-ovarian artery and a more descriptive name for the artery would be ovarian. Also, it is more appropriate {{to refer to the}} artery originating from the umbilical artery as the uterine instead of middle uterine artery since it supplies the entire uterine horn and there is no cranial uterine artery in the pig. The uterine branch of the urogenital artery supplies the cervix and uterine body. Two large veins are located bilaterally in the <b>mesometrium</b> of the uterus. The larger is nearer the uterine horn, runs {{the entire length of the}} horn and is a utero-ovarian vein. It follows the ovarian artery after receiving one or two venous branches from the ovary. An additional large vein which parallels the utero-ovarian vein in the <b>mesometrium</b> is designated as the uterine vein since it follows the uterine artery. The uterine vein anastomoses with the utero-ovarian vein through one large branch and many smaller branches and enters a ureteric vein as the uterine artery crosses the ureter. The uterine body and cervix are drained by the uterine branch of the urogenital vein...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An adult, captive-born female {{capybara}} died {{of systemic}} thrombosis and hemoperitoneum as-sociated with placental subinvolution. Grossly, the uterus was enlarged, segmentally thickened, and {{associated with a}} large blood clot in the abdominal cavity. There was hemometra and a large ovoid mass in each uterine horn weakly adhered to the endometrium, and the right uterine horn wall had a small perforation over the mass. The mesometrial veins were markedly dilated due to thrombosis and occasionally perforated. Histologically, the uterine masses consisted of partly necrotic placental and subplacental tissue. The uterine wall surrounding the masses had full-thickness coagulative necrosis of the myometrium and diffuse endometrial ulceration with abundant syncytiotrophoblast-like cells within capillaries. Vascular lesions in the uterus and <b>mesometrium</b> con-sisted of mural invasion by cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast-like cells, thrombosis, fibrinoid necrosis, and/or heterophilic vasculitis.

40|$|Background: Uterine natural killer (uNK) {{cells are}} the most {{abundant}} leukocytes in pre-implantation endometrium and early pregnancy deciduas in humans and rodents. They are associated with structural changes in maternal spiral arteries but regulation of their re-cruitment and activation is incompletely understood. The major subpopulation of uNK cells in humans expresses CD 56, the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) - 1 while their counterpart in mouse expresses asialoGM 1, a brain ganglioside. Sympathetic nerves ex-press NCAM- 1 which mediates homotypic binding. Sympathetic fibers innervate the me-sometrial vasculature but {{their relationship to the}} myometrial and decidual uNK cell re-cruitment is unknown. Objective: The present study aims to explore positional relation-ship between natural killer cells and distribution of nerves in decidualized mouse uterus. Methods: Immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression for the enzyme tyrosine hy-droxylase were used to map sympathetic nerve fibre distribution within C 57 BL/ 6 implan-tation sites and to address a relationship with uNK cells.

40|$|Abstract. In {{pregnant}} Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus uurutus) used as {{an animal}} model for studying the migration of fetal trophoblasts and the associated changes in maternal blood vessels, intravascular trophoblasts migrated well beyond the blood vessels of the uterus and into the vessels of the <b>mesometrium.</b> They migrated beyond the decidua of the uterus, into the lumina of maternal uterine and mesometrial arteries, but not into veins. The arterial changes, which were often segmental, resembled those seen in the decidua and consisted of a replace-ment of normal smooth muscle cells by poorly differentiated stromal cells. Ultrastructurally, the trophoblasts were either above or below maternal endothelial cells. They occurred also as single or multiple layers within the lumina of arteries that lacked an endothelial lining. Apparent penetration of the elastic membrane by the fetal trophoblasts brought them into close apposition to maternal cells in the arterial wall. Histochemical studies showed heightened metabolic activity of the intravascular trophoblasts as suggested by strong histochemical reactions to nonspecific esterase, succinic dehydrogenase and the glycerophosphate dehydro-genase reactions. Thus, these metabolically active fetal trophoblasts actively migrate into the maternal arterial system, resulting in loss of endothelial cells {{and changes in the}} wall of th...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the uteroplacental vasculature in the golden hamster was studied by vascular casting and India ink injection methods. The hamster placenta usually has three sets of uteroplacental arteries and its maternal segment {{is derived from the}} medial arterial division of the non-pregnant uterus. The maternal segment consists of the spiral artery in the endometrium and the vascular knot in the <b>mesometrium.</b> The spiral arteries start developing on Day 5, simultaneously with the endometrial decidual reaction of the mesometrial side. The chorioallantoic placenta of the golden hamster is the so-called labyrinthine haemochorial type. The formation of the haemochorial placenta begins as early as Day 7, when maternal blood drains into the uterine lumen to form the maternal blood space. In this space, the maternal blood starts flowing on Day 8 and a direct contact with the chorion containing fetal capillaries is achieved on Day 9. The labyrinthine feature, in which the direction of flow of the maternal and fetal blood is in opposite directions, is achieved on Day 10. This countercurrent system functions through the central arterial space, the fetal segment of the uteroplacental artery which leads the maternal blood to the antimesometrial surface of the labyrinth...|$|E
40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed The peri-implantation period is a critical time during murine development. Although the importance of nitric oxide has been demonstrated during gestation, its role in implantation has not been fully defined. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify (by Western blotting) two prominent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS) and localize all three forms [iNOS, eNOS, and neuronal (nNOS) ] by immunohistochemistry in uterine tissue from days 4 through 8 of pregnancy. By day 6, iNOS values were significantly elevated in implantation sites compared with interimplantation regions and continued to rise through day 8. Analysis of eNOS was similar, but implantation site values peaked by days 6 and 7. Labelled iNOS cells were within the decidua, around myometrial vessels, and within the ectoplacental cone. At implantation, eNOS was conspicuous, displaying label adjacent to the embryo in vessels of the primary decidual zone. nNOS was localized mainly in the <b>mesometrium</b> and myometrium and did not appear to change throughout the peri-implantation period. The increased iNOS and eNOS values following implantation in the embryonic site may imply roles in tissue remodelling, immunosuppression and vasoregulation. Nitric oxide may play an important role in the mechanisms of implantation where these factors are keys to successful pregnancy.

40|$|Whole boar semen or seminal plasma {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to advance the time of ovulation in gilts. As a means of clarifying this influence, the contribution of uterine lymphatics and their white cell populations has been examined. After duct visualisation with Evan's blue, lymph was sampled from a mesometrial vessel in eight pre-ovulatory gilts whose uterine lumen was infused simultaneously with whole semen in one ligated horn and saline in the contralateral ligated horn. Lymph was collected from cannulated vessels for periods of up to four hours under general anaesthesia. Thereafter, mesometrial lymph nodes, utero-tubal junction and uterine wall tissues were sampled. The proportion of nucleated cells in the sampled lymph increased {{towards the end of}} the collection period, but erythrocytes were found in all instances preventing a meaningful differentiation and identification of leukocytes. Prominent uterine lymph nodes were present in the <b>mesometrium</b> on both sides of the reproductive tract in 7 of 10 gilts. Differences in cellular contents were demonstrated between the side of the tract infused with semen and that infused with saline control. Two of 4 gilts had lower values for CD 4 (Cluster Differentiation) and 3 of 6 gilts higher values for MHC II (Major Histocompatibility Complex) markers on the side challenged with semen. In contrast, values remained constant for CD 8 but ranged widely for CD 18. Immunohistochemical analysis of uterine tissue samples for MHC II+ cells revealed significant differences (P < 0. 05) between the control and semen-treated ligated portions of the horns, as well as between the tissue sample of uterine wall and that from the utero-tubal junction, but there were no significant differences for CD 4 + cells. It therefore remains plausible that semen-induced cytokines in the uterine lymph undergo counter-current transfer to the ipsilateral ovary and accelerate the final maturation of pre-ovulatory Graafian follicles...|$|E
40|$|Intact {{pregnant}} rats {{in which}} gonadotrophin secretion was suppressed by {{administration of the}} tranquillizer trifluoperazine (Stelazine) were very sensitive to testosterone propionate (TP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) and androstenedione as inducers of nidation but insensitive to 5 =aandrostan=req- 3 =aol- 17 -one. The minimum effective dose of the former steroids was 0 =. 25 mg. intramuscularly or 0 =. 05 mg. injected under the ovarian capsule. This effect of androgens seems to be indirect, inasmuch as 0 =. 05 mg. TP was ineffective when applied locally to the uterine <b>mesometrium.</b> Moreover, 2 mg. TP failed to induce nidation after ovariectomy (followed by daily administration of progesterone), although adrenalectomy did not prevent the action of this dose of TP. MER- 25, 20 mg., given simultaneously with 2 mg. TP invariably prevented nidation. Nidation was also induced in lactating pregnant rats by intramuscular injection of 1 =n- mg. TP. In {{the absence of the}} ovaries such animals failed to respond to 1 =. mg. TP. Lactating pregnant rats also failed to respond to 0 =. 5 mg. TP applied to the ovaries but nidation was induced when this dose was injected into the spleen. It is concluded that the ovaries of pregnant rats under the influence of Stelazine more readily convert androgens into oestrogens than the ovaries of lactating pregnant animals. It is suggested that the suppression of gonadotrophin secretion caused by trifluoperazine or lactation induces a deficiency in the secretion of androgenic steroids by both the ovaries and adrenals. However, the ovaries do not lose the enzyme system capable of converting androgens into the oestrogens required for nidation. Finally, it is suggested that the oestrogen surge from the ovaries during the critical period before nidation is not necessarily due to an acute release of pituitary luteinizing hormone, as is ovulation, since androgens from the adrenals can be converted by ovarian tissue(s) to the oestrogen required for nidation...|$|E
40|$|The histophysiology {{varies in}} the three {{different}} types of placenta, namely the epitheliochorial, the endotheliochorial, and the haemochorial. The histophysiology of epitheliochorial placentas is almost unknown. In {{the case of the}} other two types, researches have been made which, although fragmentary, allow of the following conclusions being deduced. In endotheliochorial placentas the hypertrophied uterine glands contribute considerably to the nutrition of the embryo. The remainder of the substances, at the expense of which embryonic development is carried out, come from the maternal blood and are absorbed in the region of the placenta by the trophoblastic ectoderm. This absorption is selective: when certain soluble substances are injected into the maternal circulation, some are seen to pass into the embryo, others are stopped by the trophoblast, in which they accumulate. In the case of haemochorial placentas the uterine glands supply little material for embryonic development. The embryotrophic substances are derived from two sources. One of these is the maternal cells, which become filled with reserve inclusions (decidual cells) and are absorbed by the trophoblast. A veritable maternal placenta is thus formed, which, in certain species, can change its situation in the course of gestation, being at first localised in the basilar deciduum, then rapidly absorbed, and finally reformed in the region of the <b>mesometrium.</b> The second source is the maternal blood which directly bathes the foetal trophoblast. The latter partially fixes colouring matters injected into the mother, while allowing a certain amount to diffuse into the embryonic mesenchymatous tissue of the placenta. Here the maternal blood, comes into contact with the embryonic vessels, the endothelium of which acts as an impassable barrier for the dyes, since these are not found in the embryo itself, although they pass into the external coelom. In rodents the umbilical vesicle, by means of its vitelline endoderm, acts as an energetic resorber and contributes to the nutrition of the embryo. In the rodents showing inversion of layers the endoderm of the umbilical vesicle is differentiated differently on the placental face and on the inner layer of the umbilical vesicle. Physiological differences correspond to these morphological differences. Copyright © 1930, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reservedSCOPUS: ar. jFLWNAinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Measurements ofhistamine {{in control}} and IUCD-containing uterine horns of the rat in di-oestrus and L 4 of {{pregnancy}} showed that device-containing horns had a higher concentration and content per horn than did control horns at both times. In control horns, the histamine content on L 4 was about one-half of the value observed in di-oestrus, while in IUCD-containing horns the histamine content on L 4 {{was the same as}} the di-oestrous value. These data are interpreted in terms of a chronic inflammatory response in the IUCD-containing horn. The contraceptive action of a foreign body in the uterus is still only partially understood, but a number of changes are known to be brought about by an IUCD. The decidual cell reaction is inhibited in the rat uterine horn con¬ taining an IUCD (Doyle & Margolis, 1964) and it has been suggested (Shel¬ esnyak, 1966; Marcus, 1964) that this inhibition may be due to a depletion of the histamine available for stimulation of the decidual response. This paper presents measurements of histamine {{in control and}} IUCD-containing uterine horns of the rat. Female rats of the Holtzmann strain were used. L 0 designates the day spermatozoa were found in the vaginal smear. IUCDs, when present, con¬ sisted of about 1 cm of 3 - 0 surgical silk suture inserted with an atraumatic needle into one horn. Uterine histamine was extracted by the method of Code & Mclntyre (1956) and assayed on the guinea-pig ileum. For each measurement on whole uterine horns, five to eight horns were transected at the utero-tubal and utero-cervicaljunctions and pooled. In addition, some measurements were made on pools of anti-mesometrial tissue, obtained by cutting eight to twelve whole horns longitudinally with scissors into approximately two halves and using only the half opposite the <b>mesometrium.</b> In every case, the measurements on IUCD-containing horns were compared with the measurements on the control horns from the same animals. The anti-histamine, diphenhydramine (Benadryl), at a concentration of 10 " 6 g/ml, completely abolished the contractile response to large doses of the uterine extract. The log dose-response curve was linear, and parallel lines wer...|$|E
40|$|Background: Doppler {{ultrasonography}} is a non-invasive {{real time}} pulse-wave technique recently {{used for the}} transrectal study of the reproductive system hemodynamics in large animals. This technic is based in the Doppler Effect Principle that proposes the change in frequency of a wave for an observer (red blood cells) moving relative {{to the source of}} the respective wave (ultrasonic transducer). This method had showed to be effective and useful for the evaluation of the in vivo equine reproductive tract increasing the diagnostic, monitoring, and predictive capabilities of theriogenology in mares. However, an accurate and truthful ultrasonic exam requires the previous knowledge of the Doppler ultrasonography principles. Review: In recent years, the capabilities of ultrasound flow imaging have increased enormously. The current Doppler ultrasound machines offer three methods of evaluation that may be used simultaneously (triplex mode). In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of transducers simultaneously scans a plane through the tissue that {{can be viewed as a}} two-dimensional gray-scale image on screen. This mode is primarily used to identify anatomically a structure for its posterior evaluation using colored ultrasound modes (Color or Spectral modes). Colored ultrasound images of flow, whether Color or Spectral modes, are essentially obtained from measurements of moving red cells. In Color mode, velocity information is presented as a color coded overlay on top of a B-mode image, while Pulsed Wave Doppler provides a measure of the changing velocity throughout the cardiac cycle and the distribution of velocities in the sample volume represented by a spectral graphic. Color images conception varies according to the Doppler Frequency that is the difference between the frequency of received echoes by moving blood red cells and wave frequency transmitted by the transducer. To produce an adequate spectral graphic it is important determine the position and size of the simple gate. Furthermore, blood flow velocity measurement is influence by the intersection angle between ultrasonic pulses and the direction of moving blood-red cells (Doppler angle). Objectively colored ultrasound exam may be done on large arteries of the reproductive tract, as uterine and ovary arteries, or directly on the target tissue (follicle, for example). Mesovarium and <b>mesometrium</b> attachment arteries also can be used for spectral evaluation of the equine reproductive system. Subjectively analysis of the ovarian and uterine vascular perfusion must be done directly on the corpus luteum, follicular wall and uterus (endometrium and myometrium associated), respectively. Power-flow imaging has greater sensitivity to weak blood flow and independent of the Doppler angle, improving the evaluation of vessels with small diameters and slow blood flow. Conclusion: Doppler ultrasonography principles, methods of evaluation and reproductive system anatomy have been described. This knowledge is essential for the competent equipment acquisition and precise collection and analysis of colored ultrasound images. Otherwise, the reporting of inconsistent and not reproducible findings may result in the discredit of Doppler technology ahead of the scientific veterinary community...|$|E
40|$|Background: Studies with Doppler ultrassonography {{started at}} the end of the 90 s for the {{determination}} of physiological and pathological alterations in the reproductive tract of the mare. Uterine alterations caused by inflammation, response from seminal plasma infusion, hormonal variations during estrous and diestrus, pregnancy and action of various vasoactive factors influence on the vascular perfusion detected by Doppler ultrasound. The development of efficient methods for uterine quality evaluation is of big importance for field equine reproduction veterinarians, once uterine environment is responsible for pregnancy maintenance. Review: Nowadays, the most used methods of uterine evaluation are the mode B ultrassonography, cytology, culture and biopsy. Hemodynamic evaluation of the uterus can be done by spectral data collected from large vessels, as A. uterine and its ramifications, or from subjective or objective evaluations from endometrium, miometrium and <b>mesometrium</b> attachment, which provide data referent to local and specific alterations of the evaluated area. Alterations in uterine vascular perfusion has been detected during estrous cycle, during pregnancy and in cases of infusion of inflammatory substances. These alterations happen because of vasoactive substances that act in the uterus during these events, however, most of these vasoactive substances are probably not even known. Also, important hemodynamic alterations in old mares, as an increase in vascular resistance, have been described. This increase might result from fibrosis of the uterus and in women it is considered to be a cause of infertility. In mares, periglandular fibrosis of the endometrium is considered to be the major diagnosable cause of embryonic and fetal loss in older mares. For the CL, ovarian artery of the mare supplies the ovary as well as the oviduct and therefore can be used for evaluation of these areas. The CL evaluation can also be done by the percentage of luteum area with colored signals as an indicator of the extent of blood flow. The percentage of the CL area with colored signals is determined subjectively by images observations in real time and/or by a freezing Power Doppler cross-section image with the maximum number of color pixels taped and the total number of color pixels is assessed by a computer analysis system. Therefore, a high correlation between plasmatic progesterone and CL vascularization also allows the CL evalution by this technique. In a first report, CL circulation reached its maximum on D 5, the progesterone concentration in peripheral blood increased until D 7 and in a posterior report, maximum perfusion was achieved two days after the maximum progesterone concentration (D 8). Blood flow reduced between D 10 -D 14 some days before the plasma progesterone decrease and, during the luteolytic period (D 15 -D 17), the decline in CL blood-flow area was greater than blood flow decrease. Conclusion: Doppler ultrassonography add knowledge about uterine viability and CL functionality can be easily used by veterinarians in the field. It is a noninvasive method that provides real time results. However, because of the short time studies in this area have been done, many other answers still need to be found until normal and pathological patterns will be established...|$|E
