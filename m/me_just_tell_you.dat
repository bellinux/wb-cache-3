6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] reiterated Stoutenburg peremptorily, [...] "and you too, my good Nicolaes," [...] {{he added}} as {{he offered a}} chair to his friend. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the news which Jan has brought, and which should make you forget even your present just wrath, so glorious, so {{important}} is it." ...|$|E
60|$|You may {{easily see}} that {{although}} we obtained from water {{twice as much}} in volume of the hydrogen as of oxygen, {{it does not follow}} that we have twice as much in weight--because one is heavy, and the other a very light gas. We have means of weighing gases or air; but without stopping to explain, that, let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what their respective weights are. The weight of a pint of hydrogen is three-quarters of a grain; the weight of the same quantity of oxygen is nearly twelve grains. This is a very great difference. The weight of a cubit foot of hydrogen is one-twelfth of an ounce; and the weight of a cubit foot of oxygen is one ounce and a third. And so on we might come to masses of matter which may be weighed in the balance, and which we can take account of as to hundredweights and as to tons, as you will see almost immediately.|$|E

6000|$|... "For Aggie's hand? My dear," [...] {{said the}} Duchess, [...] "I'm glad {{you do me}} the justice of feeling that I'm a person to take time by the forelock. It was not, as you seem to remember, with the sight of Mr. Mitchett that the {{question}} of Aggie's hand began to occupy me. I should be ashamed of myself if it weren't constantly before me and if I hadn't my feelers out in more quarters than one. But I've not so much as thought of Mr. Mitchett--who, rich as he may be, is the son of a shoemaker and superlatively hideous--for a reason I don't at all mind <b>telling</b> <b>you.</b> Don't be outraged if I say that I've for a long time hoped you yourself would find the right use for him." [...] She paused--at present with a momentary failure of assurance, from which she rallied, however, to proceed with a burst of earnestness that was fairly noble. [...] "Forgive <b>me</b> if I <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> once for all how it strikes me, I'm stupefied at your not seeming to recognise either your interest or your duty. Oh I know you want to, but you appear to me--in your perfect good faith of course--utterly at sea. They're one and the same thing, don't you make out? your interest and your duty. Why isn't it convincingly plain to you that the thing to do with Nanda is just to marry her--and to marry her soon? That's the great thing--do it while you CAN. If you don't want her downstairs--at which, let me say, I don't in the least wonder--your remedy is to take the right alternative. Don't send her to Tishy--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Reginald hasn't a shilling," [...] the Duchess {{declared}} earnestly. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{how they}} live. Letitia has two thousand a year, {{and so has}} Margaret, from their mother. Margaret's husband, who is a decent fellow, won't touch her money and makes her an allowance, so that nearly all her two thousand, and all of Letitia's, except the few ha'pence she spends on clothes, go to keeping an establishment together. Reginald has sold every scrap of land he could, years ago. Mandeleys is the only estate he has left, and there isn't a square yard of that that isn't mortgaged to the very fullest extent. It's always a scramble between his poor devils of lawyers and himself, whether there's a little margin to be {{got out of the}} rents after paying the interest. If there is, it goes, I believe, towards satisfying the claims of a lady down at Battersea." ...|$|E

The voices of the actors are so horrendous that you feel like crying. The actors look so jaded that they aren’t acting at all. The plot moves so slowly that you can {{actually}} predict the very next scene and solve the murder mystery too." [...] Bollywood Hungama wrote [...] "Frankly, watching YEH LAMHE JUDAAI KE is akin to watching two films within one film. If the film begins with the SRK - Raveena track, the other track crops up from nowhere and that involves a bunch of newcomers, all non-actors." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{of course}} I didn't do that, and I took my hoss {{back to the}} stable, and my family didn't starve nuther; but I <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> this {{to show you what}} sort of a woman Miss Panney is." ...|$|R
