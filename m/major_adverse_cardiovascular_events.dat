Some types of normal gut bacteria (e.g. species of Acinetobacter) in the human microbiome convert dietary carnitine to TMAO. TMAO alters cholesterol metabolism in the intestines, in the liver, and in artery wall. In the presence of TMAO, there is increased deposition of cholesterol in, and decreased removal of cholesterol from, peripheral cells such as those in the artery wall.|$|E

The optimal treatment for patients with multivessel {{coronary artery}} disease is uncertain given the lack of prospective, randomized data reflecting current practice. This study represents a "real-world" evaluation of current technology in the treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1680 patients undergoing revascularization for multivessel coronary artery disease were identified. Of these, 1080 patients were treated for 2 -vessel disease (196 CABG and 884 PCI) and 600 for 3 -vessel disease (505 CABG and 95 PCI). One-year mortality, cerebrovascular events, Q-wave myocardial infarction, target vessel failure, and composite <b>major</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> and cerebrovascular <b>events</b> were compared between the CABG and PCI cohorts. Outcomes were adjusted for baseline covariates and reported as hazard ratios. The unadjusted <b>major</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> and cerebrovascular <b>event</b> rate was reduced with CABG for patients with 2 -vessel disease (9. 7 % CABG versus 21. 2 % PCI; P< 0. 001) and 3 -vessel disease (10. 8 % CABG versus 28. 4 % PCI; P< 0. 001). Adjusted outcomes showed increased <b>major</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> and cerebrovascular <b>event</b> with PCI for patients with 2 -vessel (hazard ratio 2. 29; 95 % CI 1. 39 to 3. 76; P= 0. 01) and 3 -vessel disease (hazard ratio 2. 90; 95 % CI 1. 76 to 4. 78; P< 0. 001).

However, the incidence of myocardial infarction was reduced with remote ischemic conditioning (0. 50 [0. 31, 0. 82]), as was peak troponin release (standardized mean difference - 0. 28 [- 0. 47, - 0. 09]). CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that remote ischemic conditioning reduces mortality associated with ischemic events; nor does it reduce <b>major</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>events.</b> However, remote ischemic conditioning did reduce the incidence of peri-procedural myocardial infarctions, as well as the release of troponin...|$|E
40|$|Background. A {{large number}} of {{clinical}} and laboratory markers have been appraised to predict prognosis in patients with stable angina, but uncertainty remains regarding which variables are the best predictors of prognosis. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of studies in patients with stable angina to assess which variables predict prognosis. Methods. MEDLINE and PubMed were searched for eligible studies published up to 2015, reporting multivariate predictors of <b>major</b> <b>adverse</b> cardiac events (MACE, a composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) in patients with stable angina. Study features, patient characteristics, and prevalence and predictors of such events were abstracted and pooled with random-effect methods (95 % CIs). <b>Major</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>event</b> (MACE) was the primary endpoint. Results. 42 studies (104, 559 patients) were included. After a median follow-up of 57 months, <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>events</b> occurred in 7. 8 % of patients with MI in 6. 2 % of patients and need for repeat revascularization (both surgical and percutaneous) in 19. 5 % of patients. Male sex, reduced EF, diabetes, prior MI, and high C-reactive protein were the most powerful predictors of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>events.</b> Conclusions. We show that simple and low-cost clinical features may help clinicians in identifying the most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approaches within {{the broad range of}} outpatients presenting with stable coronary artery disease...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{cardiovascular}} {{burden and}} consequences of peripheral atherosclerosis appear to differ between men and women. Data regarding long-term outcomes, including the impact of medical prophylactic treatment, are insufficient. This study examined long-term outcomes according to sex following primary vascular surgery, adjusted for multiple variables as well as recommended medical prophylaxis. MethodsAll Danish patients who underwent peripheral vascular surgery from January 2000 to December 2007 were stratified into five procedural groups: (a) aorto-iliac bypass or thromboendarterectomy, (b) femoro–femoral crossover, (c) thromboendarterectomy of the femoral arteries, (d) infrainguinal bypass, or (e) axillo- uni-, and bifemoral bypass. Data were analyzed according to sex for differences in myocardial infarction, stroke, and death, individually and combined, after surgery. ResultsA total of 11, 234 patients were included: 6, 289 males and 4, 945 females. The overall adjusted hazard ratio for male patients compared with female patients for death was 1. 11 (95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 17), for MI was 1. 16 (95 % CI 1. 04 – 1. 29), for stroke was 0. 99 (95 % CI 0. 89 – 1. 11), and for any <b>major</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>event</b> was 1. 10 (95 % CI 1. 05 – 1. 16). ConclusionsThese findings show that, despite indication, severity, and concomitant medical treatment of peripheral artery disease, men have {{a higher risk of}} mortality and <b>adverse</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>events</b> following surgery for peripheral arterial disease...|$|R
40|$|Background The optimal {{period to}} achieve target percent {{reduction}} of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level for secondary prevention of {{acute myocardial infarction}} (AMI) is not well established. Methods The Assessment of Lipophilic vs. Hydrophilic Statin Therapy in AMI (ALPS-AMI) study enrolled 508 patients (mean age, 66. 0 ± 11. 6 years; 80. 6 % male) who were hospitalized for AMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Of these patients, 81 {{were excluded because of}} the absence of LDL-C measurements at 4 weeks after randomization. In the remaining 427 patients, the target LDL-C level reduction of 30 % was achieved and not reached within 4 weeks after randomization in 204 cases (early reduction group) and 223 cases (late reduction group). The groups were formed prospectively and analyzed with regard to the composite end point (<b>major</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>event</b> [MACE]: all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) and clinical outcomes. Results MACE were significantly more frequent in the late reduction group compared to the early reduction group (9. 4 % vs. 3. 4 %, P = 0. 013). The incidence of cardiac deaths was also sig-nificantly higher in the late reduction group (3. 1 % vs. 0. 5 %, P = 0. 044). On age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis in statin-naïve patients, percent reduction of LDL-C leve...|$|R
