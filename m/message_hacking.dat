50|$|The {{idea of a}} deal {{involving}} Steve Coogan and BSkyB surprised many, due to {{his very}} public antipathy toward media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his company 21st Century Fox, who own a controlling 33% of BSkyB.

5000|$|The PCC's {{inquiry in}} 2009 [...] "was {{concerned}} with whether the PCC was misled by the News of the World during its 2007 investigation, {{and whether there}} was any evidence that phone <b>message</b> <b>hacking</b> has taken place since 2007." [...] Its report concluded the PCC was not misled {{and that there was}} no evidence of ongoing phone hacking. This report and its conclusions were withdrawn on 6 July 2011, two days after The Guardian reported on the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone. [...] The organisation's future was placed in doubt as a result of its failure to address the phone hacking scandal as it unfolded.|$|E
30|$|When the MAG i {{receives}} the handover {{report from the}} HMN, the MAG i extracts the IDs of the candidate MAGs, which is given by the report and subsequently stored as a list on its policy database. Then, the MAG i utilizes the Handover initiates (HI) and the Handover Acknowledgment (<b>HAck)</b> <b>messages,</b> which are introduced by [11] and extended by [13] to determine the load of the candidate MAGs. This is done by sending an HI message by the MAG i to all candidates MAGs including the MN-ID. Once the HI message received by the candidate MAGs, the candidate MAGs reply by sending <b>HAck</b> <b>messages</b> emulated to the MAG i including the current loads information.

5000|$|On July 22, 2016, Wikileaks {{released}} online tens {{of thousands}} of <b>messages</b> <b>hacked</b> from the e-mail accounts of seven key DNC staff. The e-mails demonstrate how, even during the late stage of the campaign, when Hillary Clinton's lead had been crystallized, the DNC still appeared committed to undermine the Sanders campaign. The e-mails show DNC staff discussing the possibility of coordinating negative stories about the Sanders campaign with the press. DNC CFO Brad Marshall suggested using the media to attack Sanders from a religious angle, portraying him as an atheist, ahead of the Kentucky and West Virginia primaries. DNC CEO Amy K. Dacey responded approvingly with, [...] "Amen." [...] Then DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz appears attacking Sanders staffers as liars. The e-mails also show that the DNC exchanged messages with the Clinton campaign on strategies to attack the Sanders campaign. The e-mails provoked Wasserman Schultz's resignation ahead of the convention, and that of Marshals, Dacey, and Communications Director Luis Miranda afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|The awards were {{larger than}} had been made {{previously}} in phone hacking cases. Mr Justice Mann explained this, saying: [...] "The length, degree and frequency of all this conduct explains why the sums I have awarded are so much greater than historical awards. People whose private voicemail <b>messages</b> were <b>hacked</b> so often and for so long, and had very significant parts of their private lives exposed, and then reported on, are entitled to significant compensation”.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Privacy {{is needed}} in adhoc networks. Designing a {{security}} protocol for ad hoc wireless is a very challenging task. There are various kinds of attacks possible on adhoc network. In this paper, secured on demand position based private routing algorithm is proposed for communication anonymity, which provides a security in mobile adhoc networks. Here, we use cryptography algorithm for providing security to prevent <b>message</b> <b>hacking</b> information from internal and external attackers. The position information of nodes is drawn by GPS (Global Positioning System). Here, we provide a terminal node, which behaves like server to collect position information of nodes in the network. Simulation {{has been carried out}} for evaluating the security of ad-hoc networks. It provides a secure data transmission between the nodes. In our design, the server with the process of GPS system records all the information about the terminal nodes involved in the ad-hoc networks. In this paper, we proposed a new protocol using cryptographic techniques to analyze and find the optimal route...|$|E

30|$|Data packets {{are sent}} from the LLMA through the LLMA-LMAG 1 tunnel and {{forwarded}} using the LMAG 1 -LMAG 2 tunnel. The packets will be buffered in LMAG 2 until the mobile node is attached. This buffering technique prevents the packet loss. A Handover ACK (<b>HAck)</b> <b>message</b> {{is sent to}} the LMAG 1 to notify that the network is prepared to support the handover.|$|R

30|$|A load {{balancing}} scheme is introduced in [24] {{to improve the}} overall system performance in terms of handoff delay and throughput. The IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover Services (MIH) functionalities are utilized with the proper selection of the MN new network to provide a seamless handover in the heterogeneous networks. In this scheme, when the signal of the MN becomes very weak, a report from MN {{is sent to the}} MN serving MAG. Then, the PMAG upon receiving the report sends handover initiate (HI) message to the LMA including all candidates MAG/APs information. Accordingly, the LMA forwards the HI message to the candidates and these candidates response to the LMA with sending a Handover Acknowledgment (<b>HAck)</b> <b>messages</b> to inform the LMA about their status and their acceptance to serve the MN. The LMA forwards the received <b>HAck</b> <b>messages</b> to the serving MAG in order to select the proper network for the MN. Despite the enhancements that are made in this scheme regarding the handover time and throughput, additional signaling messages are required between the PMAG, LMA, and the candidates MAGs/APs, which negatively impact the system. The reactive {{load balancing}} is not considered in this scheme, which leads to increasing the blocking probability in the overloaded MAGs and service disruption due to increasing the queuing delay in the overloaded MAGs, in addition to ignoring the divided domain as the previous works do.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{national}} and local press reaction to the revelations was more muted than the investigative team had expected. Chiquita categorically denied the allegations but did not offer {{an explanation for the}} voicemails and internal documents. On May 14, Larry Birns of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs replayed some of the voicemail messages at a news conference. In response, Kirkland & Ellis sued Gallagher and threatened to sue the Enquirer as well. The Enquirer concluded that Gallagher had obtained the voicemail <b>messages</b> through voicemail <b>hacking,</b> rather than from an authorized Chiquita executive, as he had originally claimed. By mid-June, it began negotiating an out-of-court settlement with Chiquita.|$|R
2500|$|LulzSec did {{not appear}} to hack for {{financial}} profit, claiming their main motivation was to have fun by causing mayhem. They did things [...] "for the lulz" [...] and focused on the possible comedic and entertainment value of attacking targets. The group occasionally claimed a political <b>message.</b> When they <b>hacked</b> PBS, they stated they did so in retaliation for what they perceived as unfair treatment of Wikileaks in a Frontline documentary entitled WikiSecrets. A page they inserted on the PBS website included the title [...] "FREE BRADLEY MANNING. FUCK FRONTLINE!" [...] The 20 June announcement of [...] "Operation Anti-Security" [...] contained justification for attacks on government targets, citing supposed government efforts to [...] "dominate and control our Internet ocean" [...] and accusing them of corruption and breaching privacy.

40|$|Mobile IPv 6 {{enables a}} mobile node (MN) to {{maintain}} its connectivity to the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover. During handover, there is a period during which the mobile node is unable to send or receive packets because of link-switching delay and IP protocol operations. This "handover latency " resulting from standard Mobile IPv 6 procedures (namely, movement detection, new Care-of Address configuration, and Binding Update) is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP). Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well. This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv 6 procedures. This document does not address improving the link-switching latency. This document updates the packet formats for the Handover Initiate (HI) and Handover Acknowledge (<b>HAck)</b> <b>messages</b> to the Mobility Header Type...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, {{dramatic}} {{developments in}} the scandal led to {{the closure of the}} News of the World newspaper, Yates faced allegations of wrongdoing, including from MP Chris Bryant, who called for his resignation saying [...] "a very dirty smell" [...] surrounded the police's conduct in the matter. The main accusations relate to having misled Parliament, having repeatedly reported that there was evidence of only around 10-12 cases, but it later emerged that police had evidence of [...] "a vast number" [...] of victims. Yates later said that he believed that he should refer only to cases where voicemail messages had been shown to have been intercepted prior to them being heard by the intended recipient. He also claimed to have ensured that four major mobile phone companies had informed around 120 people that their <b>messages</b> had been <b>hacked,</b> a claim disputed by the companies involved, two of which wrote to Scotland Yard stating that it was incorrect. On 9 July 2009, Yates issued a statement.|$|R

In its reconsideration petition, Peabody brought these questionable practices and activities to the attention of EPA. Peabody argued that the CRU material significantly weakened EPA’s reliance on the work of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) as support for EPA’s Endangerment Finding. The very scientists implicated in the Climategate scandal were heavily involved in all stages of the production of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (“AR 4 ”) and otherwise highly influential in the workings of the IPCC and 1 See “Scientist steps down during e-mail probe; <b>Hacked</b> <b>messages</b> about global warming cause...|$|R
5000|$|The first solicitors to win {{financial}} settlements {{for their}} clients for phone hacking {{had to deal with}} the Met as an obstacle rather than a resource. In some cases, the Met's failure to notify potential victims in a timely manner resulted in their having to pay their own solicitors to simply find out whether they had been victims of phone hacking crimes. [...] George Galloway, a member of Parliament, was alerted by a detective that his <b>messages</b> had been <b>hacked</b> in August 2006. Galloway said the detective urged him to change his PIN code. But when Galloway asked who had accessed his phone, the man from Scotland Yard “refused to tell me anything." [...] In most cases, the failure to notify delayed or even precluded legal action by victims against perpetrators. Some possible hacking victims said that [...] "by sitting on the evidence for so long, the police have made it impossible to get information from phone companies, which do not permanently keep records." [...] Not only were potential victims denied the opportunity to check the call data, which the phone companies only keep for 12 months, they also did not become aware of the desirability of changing their access codes or of considering what damage might have been done to them as a result of interception.|$|R
