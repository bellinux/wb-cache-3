5|$|After {{returning}} from World War II, Hassett operated a sports store in Melbourne; {{one of his}} staff members was Victorian Test teammate Neil Harvey. After retiring from cricket, Hassett joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio commentator in 1956, remaining in that position until 1981. During {{his time in the}} commentary booth, he was known for his self-deprecating humour and frequently <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> of his conservative approach to batting during the latter half of his career. Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket, particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style of his era.|$|E
5|$|Made in Berlin in the 1930s, the Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders {{was located}} in Hitler's office {{throughout}} most of its existence. It became widely known in the United States after comedian Charlie Chaplin parodied it in his 1940 film The Great Dictator. Comedy group The Three Stooges also <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> of it in two of their short subject comedies. One of the two limited editions was looted by John Barsamia, a private in the U.S. Army, at Hitler's summer retreat shortly {{after the war and}} sold 60 years later at an auction in San Francisco for $100,000. The globe in Hitler's office replaced Ethiopia with Italian East Africa and was known for its size as well as manufacturing cost.|$|E

5|$|The FBI arrives to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, but Marvin tricks {{them into}} taking Cartman instead. Cartman, who had {{previously}} cared little for the impoverished in Africa, is unable to bear the lack of food and poor living conditions there; furthermore, he attempts to convince the Red Cross there that he's {{not one of the}} Africans, but it fails. While praying to God in Addis Ababa, Cartman says he is sorry he <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> of poor people. He eventually finds a Red Cross shack, where Sally Struthers is hoarding all the food meant for charity. After a brief argument, Cartman exposes all of Miss Struthers's hoarding of the food supply to the Ethiopians, who then take control of the food supply.|$|E
5|$|Rickey was a {{conservative}} teetotaler, while O'Malley freely enjoyed vices such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O'Malley became {{more involved in}} affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O'Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O'Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O'Malley felt was a drain on attendance. In board of directors meetings, O'Malley also opposed Rickey's extravagances. When he was with his political friends, he <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> of Rickey at every chance. Daily News columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O'Malley, the team lawyer, if he should sue, O'Malley said no. Powers' campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O'Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press. It {{got to the point}} where everything Rickey did was something O'Malley derided: O'Malley thought Rickey's construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey's investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team's beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered. As team lawyer, O'Malley had a role in breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey's top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he had a role in assessing the ongoing legal risks to the franchise.Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson's signing.|$|E

60|$|Of course, {{the other}} lads <b>made</b> great <b>fun</b> {{of the whole}} thing, and plagued Dr. Alec's {{students}} half out of their lives. But they kept on persistently, and one day something happened which made the other fellows behave themselves for ever after.|$|R

25|$|A {{parody of}} a police manual that <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> of the {{conventions}} of 1970s British police procedurals like The Sweeney. It also contained a glossary of British 1970s slang terms. The actual author of the text is Guy Adams.|$|E
5000|$|The third stanza uses gambling/loss imagery {{that occurs}} in many Grateful Dead songs. The line [...] "As I picked up my matches and was closing the door" [...] uses the {{symbolism}} of playing poker with matchsticks to indicate a very low stakes gamble that was <b>made</b> for <b>fun.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sky Movies wrote [...] " [...] it's a bouncy, {{confidently}} <b>made</b> comedy that's <b>fun</b> throughout {{and pretty}} hilarious in its boxing-ring conclusion." ...|$|R
500|$|On its {{publication}} in 1954, {{the book was}} received with immediate acclaim, and has remained in print ever since.

5000|$|Although it {{aired on}} state-run television, the play {{came in for}} some {{criticism}} in the Parliament of India because it allegedly <b>made</b> disrespectful <b>fun</b> of Emperor Akbar, [...] "a great and respected leader of this nation of ancient times." [...] The play has received popular and critical acclaim since it first began to be staged.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} {{historical}} period portrayed in Gun was fraught with racism, Activision's decision {{to publish a}} racially stereotyped video game represents a serious misstep in social responsibility. Like Custer's Revenge, Gun provokes wonder. In this case, the industry has unfortunately bought into the popular misconception that games are frivolous because they are <b>made</b> for <b>fun.</b>|$|R

At university he worked more intensively as a journalist, among other things working for the social democratic party organ Vorwärts ("onwards"). He involved himself in the SPD's election campaign in 1911.|$|E
25|$|During the Renaissance {{translations}} of Plato, the Hermetica and other works fostered new European interest in reincarnation.

But the Greek philosophical works remained available and, particularly in north Europe, were discussed by groups such as the Cambridge Platonists.|$|E
50|$|The {{program was}} known for its wit and satire, but also, as both {{performers}} constantly admitted, a large degree of toilet humour.

5000|$|Richard Roeper {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} four stars, saying: [...] "This is one good-looking, {{occasionally}} titillating, mostly soapy and dull snooze-fest." [...] Vince Mancini of Uproxx acknowledged the film's flaws, but said watching the film was enjoyable, noting, [...] "Narrative sloppiness aside, as an outsider, sitting through Fifty Shades Darker was a reasonably diverting experience, odd, dumb <b>fun</b> <b>made</b> even more <b>fun</b> by an audience that whooped and shouted at the screen during sex scenes. I didn't really get it, but I enjoyed the feeling of them having fun, though at two hours plus, it's {{a bit of a}} slog." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} war years, Balašević had serious {{problems}} {{with the government of}} Slobodan Milošević because he openly stated his opposition to it. At his concerts he often criticised and <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> of Milošević and other Serbian politicians. In 1996, he became the UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador for his antiwar statements during the Yugoslav wars and held the first postwar concert in Sarajevo as the first Serbian artist visiting war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|After John Frederick death's, Prince-Bishop of Paderborn Ferdinand of Fürstenberg {{appointed}} him as Auxiliary Bishop of Münster (Church Saint Liudger) on 7 October 1680.

5000|$|Bollywood Hungama was {{critical}} of the bonus beat matching game, calling it a [...] "show stopper" [...] as the controls were not very responsive. They were more receptive towards the Gilli Danda game, saying that the unpredictability <b>made</b> it <b>fun.</b> Ultimately however, they did not feel the game was worth the price. ET Now noted that the game was very simple in terms of gameplay and graphics, and was not really appealing to gamers {{over the age of}} ten.|$|R
