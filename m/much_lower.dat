40|$|Abstract. A good {{correlation}} {{is found}} between ortho-positronium (o-Ps) pick-off annihilation lifetimes and surface tensions of molecular liquids and polymers. Systematic shortening of the o-Ps lifetime with increasing surface tension {{suggests that the}} hole for Ps localization in polymers may be that subjected to considerable expansion as in liquids. The driving force of this hole expansion is the large quantum mechanical zero-point energy of a light particle confined in an angstrom size space.
