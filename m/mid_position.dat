25|$|The SZD-6x Nietoperz (Bat) was {{designed}} and built to research tail-less aircraft, and the control of them. Main designers were Władysław Nowakowski and Justyn Sandauer. Built in a conventional fashion using wood throughout, fabric covering and steel for highly stressed parts and fittings the SZD-6x was a cantilever monoplane with the cranked wing attached to a short fuselage pod at the <b>mid</b> <b>position.</b> The inner portion of each wing was markedly swept forward out to approx. quarter-span, where the swept-back outer wing panels were attached. This is arrangement allowed for maximum distance between the centre of gravity and the vertical stabilizer, and placed the pilot at the centre of gravity, so that differing pilot weights had little impact on stability.|$|E
25|$|The Model T's {{transmission}} {{was controlled}} with three foot pedals and a lever mounted {{to the road}} side of the driver's seat. The throttle was controlled with a lever on the steering wheel. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the <b>mid</b> <b>position</b> or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward – in any other position, the pedal would only move up {{as far as the}} central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.|$|E

50|$|The {{airframe}} had a semi-monocoque fuselage with bicycle-type landing gear, short cropped delta {{wings of}} 37° leading edge sweep, with 5° anhedral, {{attached to the}} fuselage in a <b>mid</b> <b>position.</b> The fuselage was substantial forward of the wing trailing edges, due to accommodating the engines, cockpit, fuel tanks and equipment bays {{as close to the}} centre of gravity as possible, tapering sharply to the swept tail surfaces with a high-set tailplane. Control of the aircraft was by conventional rudder, ailerons and elevators in normal flight and by compressed engine bleed air blown from control nozzles at the wingtips, rear fuselage tip {{and at the end of}} a long boom extending forwards from the top lip of the air intakes.|$|E

50|$|There {{was just}} one Schweizer 1-23C built and it was owned and {{modified}} by Gehrlein. The aircraft was crashed and rebuilt with new 1-23D wings. The 1-23C's damaged wings were rebuilt and {{formed the basis for}} the Precursor. The fuselage for the Precursor started life as a 1963 model Schweizer 1-26A. The two components were reworked by Gehrlein and his two sons, Rod and Jay, in 1965. They took the 1-26A fuselage and mounted the wings from the Schweizer 1-23C, modifying the fuselage, which had mounted the original 1-26 wings in the <b>mid</b> <b>position</b> to accept the 1-23C wings in the high position. The resulting aircraft is registered with the Federal Aviation Administration in the Experimental - Racing - Amateur Built - Exhibition category.|$|E
40|$|Background: Prolongation {{of action}} {{potential}} duration (APD), increased spatial APD dispersion, and triangulation are major factors promoting drug-induced ventricular arrhythmia. Preclinical identification of HERG/IKr-blocking drugs and their pro-arrhythmic potential, however, remains a challenge. We hypothesize that transgenic long-QT type 1 (LQT 1) rabbits lacking repolarizing IKs current {{may help to}} sensitively detect HERG/IKr-blocking properties of drugs. Methods: Hearts of adult female transgenic LQT 1 and wild type littermate control (LMC) rabbits were Langendorff-perfused with increasing concentrations of HERG/IKr-blockers E- 4031 (0. 001 – 0. 1 mM, n = 9 / 7) or erythromycin (1 – 300 mM, n = 9 / 7) and APD, APD dispersion, and triangulation were analyzed. Results: At baseline, APD was longer in LQT 1 than in LMC rabbits in LV apex and RV mid. Erythromycin and E- 4031 prolonged APD in LQT 1 and LMC rabbits in all positions. However, erythromycin-induced percentaged APD prolongation related to baseline (%APD) was more pronounced in LQT 1 at LV base-lateral and RV <b>mid</b> <b>positions</b> (100 mM, LQT 1, + 40. 669. 7 % vs. LMC, + 24. 1610. 0 %, p, 0. 05) and E- 4031 -induced %APD prolongation was more pronounced in LQT 1 at LV base-lateral (0. 01 mM, LQT 1, + 29. 6610. 6 % vs. LMC, + 19. 163. 8 %, p, 0. 05) and LV base-septal positions. Moreover, erythromycin significantly increased spatial APD dispersion only in LQT 1 and increased triangulation only in LQT 1 in LV base-septal and RV <b>mid</b> <b>positions.</b> Similarly, E- 4031 increased triangulation only in LQT 1 in LV apex and base-septa...|$|R

5000|$|The P-530's wing {{planform}} {{and nose}} section {{was similar to}} the F-5, with a trapezoidal shape formed by a sweep of 20° at the quarter-chord line, and an unswept trailing edge, but was over double the area, with 400 sq ft as opposed to 186 sq ft of the F-5E. Initially shoulder mounted, the wings were gradually shifted down to the <b>mid</b> <b>position.</b> Its most distinctive new feature were the LERXs that tapered into the fuselage under the cockpit. They enabled maneuvering at angles of attack exceeding 50°, by providing about 50% additional lift. The extensions also trapped airflow under them at high angles of attack, ensuring airflow into the engines. The resemblance to the head of a cobra lead to the adoption of the nickname [...] "Cobra", often unofficially used for the YF-17.|$|E

Kuzan was moved up the main roster to share the starting <b>mid</b> <b>position</b> with GBM before the next season of Champions. Jin Air then attended SBENU Champions Summer 2015 but placed 6th overall, gaining 10 circuit points and qualifying for the next season of LCK but barely missing playoffs.

40|$|Electrode-place {{discrimination}} {{was measured}} {{in a group of}} children implanted with the Cochlear Limited multiple-electrode prosthesis. An adaptive technique was used to obtain difference Iimens (DLs) for electrodes at the apical, <b>mid,</b> and basal <b>positions</b> on the array. The influence of loudness cues were minimised by randomly varying the electric stimulation levels. Most DLs for the three positions were less than 3 electrodes, although for some subjects limens were as large as 7 electrodes. The relationships between electrode DLs and subject characteristics, and between electrode DLs and speech perception performance were also examined. A significant correlation between age at implantation and electrode DLs for the basal position was found, indicating that subjects implanted at a later age had larger DLs for basal electrodes. No correlations were found for electrode DLs at the apical and <b>mid</b> <b>positions.</b> Also, electrode DLs for the three positions did not correlate with any other subject variables, such as duration of implant use. A significant negative correlation between electrode DLs for the apical position and speech scores for closed-set monosyllabic words was recorded, indicating that subjects with larger DLs had lower speech scores. No correlations were found for electrode DLs at the <b>mid</b> and basal <b>positions,</b> and electrode DLs did not correlate with scores for open-set speech tests. 14 - 17 JuneOpen Acces...|$|R

The body outline is shaped like the Jazz Bass, though substantially lighter (the Aerodyne Jazz Bass weighs about 7 pounds, compared to the 10 pounds of the standard Jazz Bass). It's also slightly thinner than a traditional Jazz Bass body, due to its unusual 39 inch top radius unique to the Aerodyne series. The radius of the top means that the bridge is actually inset slightly {{into the top of}} the body. The Aerodyne Jazz Bass has a standard 1.5 inch nut width, a very slim [...] "C" [...] shaped neck and 20 medium jumbo frets.|$|E

50|$|The {{full scale}} SB-13 finally flew in 1988. Its 15 m wing was {{straight}} edged, with three slightly tapered sections of increasing sweep. The two inner panels occupied less than 1.9 m of the span {{and the outer}} section leading edge was swept at about 17°. All had a dihedral of 4°. At its tips, where the chord was 600 mm, the wing turned upwards into 1250 mm tall, slightly swept winglets, which carried rudders. Elevons occupied much of the outer panel trailing edge and, further inboard, mid-chord mounted airbrakes were fitted. The fuselage, onto which the wings were mounted between low and <b>mid</b> <b>position</b> was a short pod with its nose {{a little ahead of}} the centre section leading edge, extending aft about as far as the trailing horizontal edge of the wing at its tip. The pilot reclined under a long, bulged, single piece canopy, which was side hinged to starboard. The cockpit reached beyond the wing both forward and aft, with the main spar passing through it under the pilot's knees.|$|E
50|$|It uses water {{pressure}} from the water supply system rather than gravity from a raised tank like in previous models. A diaphragm separates a pressure chamber from the main water supply. A narrow passageway leads from the main water supply into the pressure chamber. It is the narrowness of this passage that meters the flow by slowing repressurizing of the pressure chamber after the action of a flush. The diaphragm technology allows the flush valve to open and let water into the bowl. A main cylinder valve operates up and down. A groove in this cylinder allows water from the main supply to flow through when {{it is in a}} <b>mid</b> <b>position.</b> The valve is shut off at both its top and bottom positions. A second valve, placed within the main cylinder valve, releases the water in the topmost pressure chamber when the flush lever is activated, sending the main cylinder valve shooting upwards. The topmost pressure chamber slowly refills through its narrow passageway, pushing the valve cylinder back down gradually. A flush occurs while it is in its open mid positions. Because the water is gradually shut off, slower water {{at the end of the}} cycle that will not activate the siphon serves to refill the bowl. The valve cannot be kept open by holding the flush lever in the activated position, wasting water, because this only sends the main cylinder valve all the way up to its topmost shutoff position. A flush can only occur when the valve is in one of its mid positions.|$|E
