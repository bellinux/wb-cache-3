5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{primarily}} flatpicks {{while playing}} acoustic guitar, though he also uses elements of fingerpicking. Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include [...] "Yesterday", [...] "I'm Looking Through You", [...] "Michelle", [...] "Blackbird", [...] "I Will", [...] "Mother Nature's Son" [...] and [...] "Rocky Raccoon". McCartney singled out [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{as a personal}} favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: [...] "I got <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> sort of cheating way of ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time... I was trying to emulate those folk players." [...] He employed a similar technique for [...] "Jenny Wren". He played an Epiphone Texan on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a Martin D-28.|$|E
500|$|While {{songs such as}} [...] "Overcome" [...] and [...] "Suffocated Love" [...] {{dealt with}} themes of [...] "sexual {{paranoia}} and male dread of intimacy", the rest of Maxinquaye explored the psychological tolls of the British recreational drug culture, which Reynolds said served as a [...] "temporary utopia" [...] for a generation of users who otherwise lacked a [...] "constructive outlet for its idealism". He felt the album's cover art, featuring rusting metal surfaces, represented the cultural decline explored in the music's themes. Tricky drew on Rastafarian ideas about end time for the record, although unlike adherents to that movement he did not disassociate himself from [...] "Babylon", or the degenerate qualities of Western society, writing lyrics such as [...] "my brain thinks bomb-like/beware of our appetite" [...] on [...] "Hell Is Round the Corner". He later told Reynolds, [...] "I'm part of this fuckin' psychic pollution... It's like, I can be as greedy as you. The conditioned part of me says 'yeah, I'm gonna {{go out and make}} money, I'm going to rule <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> kingdom.'" [...] Christgau deemed the album's songs [...] "audioramas of someone who's signed on to work for the wages of sin and lived to cash the check", while O'Hagan said Tricky's [...] "impressionistic prose poems" [...] were written from the deviant perspective of the urban hedonist: [...] "Maxinquaye is the sound of blunted Britain, paranoid and obsessive... This was the inner-city blues, Bristol style".|$|E
6000|$|... "'Deed, yes!" [...] {{said the}} woman. [...] "She was <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> Kitty." [...] But {{there was no}} tear in her eye or gurgling sob audible from her throat.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must take}} the place of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> dear <b>little</b> granddaughter," [...] said Aunt Esther. [...] "She died six years ago, and I have been so lonely since." ...|$|R

500|$|Writer Cody was {{impressed}} with the production design team's creation of the set from only a few sentences in her script, calling Juno's bedroom [...] "a very emotional set for [...] because it reminded me so much of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> habitat when I was a teenager." [...] The walls of Juno's room are covered with posters of bands, while Leah's room includes a mural of older men whom she finds attractive, and Paulie's room is designed to be overly childlike to indicate his innocence. Production designer Steve Saklad designed Mark and Vanessa's house with the assumption that [...] "Vanessa has probably read every home magazine and tried to copy what's in them as best she could." [...] Costume designer Monique Prudhomme was nominated for a Costume Designers Guild Award in the [...] "Excellence in Contemporary Costume Design for Film" [...] category. She dressed Vanessa in clothes that were [...] "simple and very tasteful" [...] but with an [...] "anal-retentive quality," [...] while dressing Mark in conservative clothing that complements Vanessa's taste. It was Page's suggestion that Juno wear flannel shirts and sweater-vests. Page also had to wear two sizes of prosthetic belly fitted like a corset in the back, as well as a third [...] "real" [...] belly that is seen when Juno has an ultrasound and a variety of sizes of fake breasts. The footage displayed on Juno's ultrasound monitor is of supervising sound designer Scott Sanders's son Matthew and was embedded into the scene in post-production.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was principally at shot at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire and {{directed}} by Nez. It premiered on Channel 4 on 4 December 2008. It starts off with Allen singing from a caravan window, while a clothes line on the right has underwear and a teddybear hanging from it. As she exits, her clothes are revealed to be a smock dress with a big bow and high heels; upon returning through the caravan door, the interior changes {{to that of a}} luxurious mansion, in reality an English country estate. The chorus starts and she walks down the hall, surrounded by butlers, all making synchronised moves and starting a choreography with Allen. Afterwards, she climbs the stairs and the camera cuts to the next scene, where she is sitting {{down in front of the}} mirror in an extravagant bedroom, with dresses, lamps, toys and cupcakes. The scene changes once again, with Allen walking into a room with giant, brightly coloured presents. They suddenly stand up, having two human legs, and begin to spin around, with the singer joining them. After descending the stairs and walking through the same hall she entered, she exits the estate, and the video takes down a darker, more serious tone, while the verse [...] "Forget about guns and forget ammunition/'Cause I'm killing them all on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> mission/Now I'm not a saint but I'm not a sinner/Now everything is cool as long as I'm getting thinner" [...] is sung. The euphoric visual effects appear once again soon after, as the chorus takes place. Allen walks down the estate stairs, being surrounded by dancing balloons, hopping butlers and coloured fog. The camera zooms out showing the estate tied in a giant ribbon, but also grey, melancholic clouds, which contrast the cheerful party from before. Allen stated that she hoped the music video would convey parts of the song's sarcasm.|$|E
2500|$|Jean-Marc Lofficier {{was born}} in Toulon, France in 1954. The son of a serviceman, he moved several times during his {{formative}} years, spending [...] "a goodly part of my childhood in Bordeaux, and my teenage years in Fontainebleau." [...] A budding writer from an early age, Lofficier also [...] "drew <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> comic strips when I was 13, 14, and began being published in French 'zines at 16." [...] Recalling in 2005 that [...] "writing wasn't deemed a respectable, economically sound way of making a living," [...] he [...] "got a MBA and a Law degree, then {{went to work in}} international banking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes--if you'll only {{let those}} {{stockings}} alone--there'll be ponies, and carriages, and horses, and everything a gentleman can have, and all for <b>my</b> <b>own</b> dear <b>little</b> Master Owen!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, thank you, <b>my</b> <b>own</b> sweet <b>little</b> friend. We {{will not}} be parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or because he is {{attached}} to her, and can write a tolerable letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{idea of an}} apology," [...] I answered, [...] "appears to me ridiculous. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> poor <b>little</b> {{possessions}} were wholly at his disposal. I caught him, however, {{in the act of}} meddling {{with papers}} which are mine only on trust." ...|$|R
2500|$|Deep Wound {{broke up}} in mid-1984. Cosloy {{had dropped out}} of the University of Massachusetts Amherst to focus on running his {{independent}} record label, Homestead Records, and promised Mascis that if he were to make a record Homestead would release it. Mascis wrote a number of songs by himself and showed them to Barlow, to whom he offered the bassist position. Barlow said the songs [...] "were fucking brilliant...They were so far beyond. I was still into two-chord songs and basic stuff like 'I'm so sad.' While I was really into <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> tragedy, J was operating in this whole other panorama." [...] Mascis enlisted vocalist Charlie Nakajima, also formerly of Deep Wound, and drummer Emmett Patrick Murphy, otherwise known as Murph, to complete the band. Mascis explained the concept behind the group as [...] "ear-bleeding country".|$|E
2500|$|Several notable {{artists and}} musicians cite Milo Goes to College as a {{favorite}} and influence, including Mike Watt of the Minutemen, David Nolte of The Last, and Zach Blair of Hagfish, Only Crime, and Rise Against. Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters opined that [...] "If the Descendents had made Milo Goes to College in 1999, they’d {{be living in}} fucking mansions. That’s a fucking amazing record." [...] Joey Cape of Lagwagon remarked that the album [...] "was just huge in punk and to me. I don’t think {{there would have been}} a [...] song like 'Angry Days' without that album." [...] Fat Mike of NOFX has cited Milo Goes to College as his favorite record of all time, and said that hearing the song [...] "Kabuki Girl" [...] on Rodney Bingenheimer's Rodney on the ROQ program on KROQ-FM was a significant moment in his youth. Chris Shary, who has done artwork for the Descendents and their successor band, All, since 1998, remarked that [...] "From the minute that I heard the beginning it was like 'this is the music that I have been waiting for. Photographer Glen E. Friedman, who photographed the band during the early 1980s, recalled that [...] "the album had just come out, and coincidentally I had <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> heartbreak as a teenager, and I heard that song 'Hope' and I gotta say that I had never in my life related to a song about love ever before until I heard that song [...] I was just 'Wow, this is fucking heavy. This guy's hurting even more than I am, and this is desperation.' A whole new world opened up of a depth of emotion in music for me." ...|$|E

60|$|I'm {{trying to}} put <b>my</b> <b>own</b> poor <b>little</b> fragmentary Ism into a rather more {{connected}} form of imagery. I've never quite set myself up enough to impress some people; and I've written so much that I can't quite make out what I am myself, nor what it all comes to.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, <b>my</b> <b>own</b> dear <b>little</b> Sadie," [...] she whispered. [...] "You'll be strong! You {{would just}} hate {{yourself}} for ever after. Keep your grip of me, dear, and pray {{if you find}} your strength is leaving you. Don't forget that your old aunt Eliza has {{you all the time}} by the hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} {{allow you to}} persuade me I know <b>my</b> <b>own</b> country so <b>little.</b> Conduct like this will stamp a man with disgrace in America as well as elsewhere." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Good-bye, good-bye, <b>my</b> <b>own</b> dearest <b>little</b> one! Bless you, bless you! and may you be {{as happy}} as a Mayflower! Guy, goodbye.

6000|$|The {{old lady}} {{threw her arms}} round her. [...] "No, no, <b>my</b> <b>own</b> dear <b>little</b> Sadie," [...] she whispered. [...] "You'll be strong!

6000|$|... 'Well, I hope he {{is a good}} fellow,' Captain Hampton said shortly. 'You see I {{never had}} a sister of <b>my</b> <b>own.</b> That <b>little</b> one and I were quite chums, and I used to look upon her almost in the light of a small sister, and I should not like to think of her marrying anyone who would not make her happy.' ...|$|R

60|$|We dined {{together}} by the fireside. Peggotty was in attendance to wait upon us, but my mother wouldn't let her do it, and made her dine with us. I had <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old plate, with a brown view of a man-of-war in full sail upon it, which Peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time I had been away, {{and would not have}} had broken, she said, for a hundred pounds. I had <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old mug with David on it, and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> old <b>little</b> knife and fork that wouldn't cut.|$|R
5000|$|... (more on {{the name}} change) “I just changed Davis to Williams. I wasn’t really a (Davis). It was my older brother’s Dad’s last name and {{whatever}} happened I ended up with Davis.

60|$|One late afternoon, in the village, a great uproar arose. The horde was {{animated}} with {{a single}} emotion, that of fear. The bluff-side swarmed with the Folk, all gazing and pointing into the northeast. I {{did not know what}} it was, but I scrambled {{all the way up to}} the safety of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> high <b>little</b> cave before ever I turned around to see.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do {{n't want}} you to help," [...] said Mary, [...] "for this is to be <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> flower-garden, and I want to do all the work myself." ...|$|E
60|$|He led {{me up to}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> chamber, took fresh raiment for me from a press, called Lorenza and bade her bring {{bread and}} wine, vinegar and warm water.|$|E

6000|$|It was for {{a moment}} as if I could {{scarcely}} credit my senses. The idea that any one, even those belonging to the plantation, should bestride <b>my</b> <b>own</b> colt, <b>my</b> <b>little</b> Silver Heels, as I had named her! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Compeyson took it easy as a {{good riddance}} for both sides. Him and me was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> book,--this here <b>little</b> black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sewell, with {{a curious}} little smile, [...] "perhaps I do. In fact, I'm not sure I'm not {{diagnosing}} <b>my</b> <b>own</b> case. A <b>little</b> while ago I had a purpose and believed in it, though the belief naturally cost {{me a good}} deal." ...|$|R
