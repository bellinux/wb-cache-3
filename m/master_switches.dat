40|$|The {{discovery}} that AC elements coordinated {{the regulation of}} genes belonging to the entire lignin biosynthetic pathway was the first breakthrough in understanding how lignin biosynthesis is regulated.

We investigated the genetic basis of this trait complex, and specifically assessed whether it is under the control of just one or a few genes that can act as <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> by simultaneously affecting a range of traits in the complex. To address this problem, we crossed two Hordeum spontaneum lines originating from two habitats that differ in productivity. The F 3 offspring, in which parental alleles are present in different combinations due to recombination and segregation, was analysed for RGR and its underlying components (leaf area ratio, unit leaf rate, photosynthesis, respiration), {{as well as a number}} of other physiological and morphological parameters. For this intra-specific comparison, we found a complex of positively and negatively correlated traits, which was quite similar to what is generally observed across species. A quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis showed three major and one minor QTL for RGR. Most other variables of the growth-trait complex showed fewer QTLs that were typically scattered over various locations on the genome. Thus, at least in H. spontaneum, we found no evidence for regulation of the trait complex by one or two <b>master</b> <b>switches.</b> [KEYWORDS: Specific leaf area; Unit leaf rate; Quantitative trait loci; Trait complex; Photosynthesis...|$|E

30|$|In Arabidopsis, a {{detailed}} transcriptional regulation mechanism of SCWs biosynthesis has been reported. A transcriptional network comprising two large family transcription factors (TFs), NAC and MYB, {{are involved in}} SCWs biosynthesis (Zhong and Ye, 2015). In this transcriptional network, a group of NAC family TFs, including NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR 1 (NST 1), NST 2, NST 3 (also called as SND 1, SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN 1), VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 6 (VND 6), and VND 7, function as the top-level <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> of SCWs biosynthesis in fibers and/or vessels (Zhong and Ye, 2015). These factors directly regulate {{the expression of a}} battery of downstream TFs, including SND 2, SND 3, MYB 20, MYB 42, MYB 46, MYB 52, MYB 54, MYB 58, MYB 63, MYB 83, MYB 85 and MYB 103. Of these, MYB 46 and its close homolog MYB 83 act as the secondary-layer <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> to regulate SCWs biosynthesis (Hussey et al., 2013). MYB 46 and MYB 83 also regulate the expression of the direct targets of SND 1 and its homologs, NST 1, NST 2, VND 6 and VND 7 (McCarthy et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2007). All of these NAC and MYB TFs collectively regulate the biosynthetic genes for cellulose, xylan and lignin. The SCWs NAC family TFs activate the downstream targets through binding to a 19 base pair (bp) sequence, known as SCWs NAC-binding element (SNBE) (McCarthy et al., 2014; Zhong et al., 2010). MYB 46 and MYB 83 bind to a 7  bp consensus sequence, termed as SCWs MYB-responsive element (SMRE) to regulate the expression of target genes (Zhong and Ye, 2012).|$|E
40|$|Wood biomass {{is mainly}} made of {{secondary}} cell walls; hence, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis during wood formation will be instrumental to design strategies for genetic improvement of wood biomass. Here, we provide direct {{evidence demonstrating that}} the poplar (Populus trichocarpa) wood-associated NAC domain transcription factors (PtrWNDs) are <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> activating a suite of downstream transcription factors, and together, {{they are involved in}} the coordinated regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis during wood formation. We show that transgenic poplar plants with dominant repression of PtrWNDs functions exhibit a drastic reduction in secondary wall thickening in woody cells, and those with PtrWND overexpression result in ectopic deposition of secondary walls. Analysis of PtrWND 2 B overexpressors revealed up-regulation of the expression of a number of wood-associated transcription factors, the promoters of which were also activated by PtrWND 6 B and the Eucalyptus EgWND 1. Transactivation analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that PtrWNDs and EgWND 1 activated gene expression through direct binding to the secondary wall NAC-binding elements, which are present in the promoters of several wood-associated transcription factors and a number of genes involved in secondary wall biosynthesis and modification. The WND-regulated transcription factors PtrNAC 150, PtrNAC 156, PtrNAC 157, PtrMYB 18, PtrMYB 74, PtrMYB 75, PtrMYB 121, PtrMYB 128, PtrZF 1, and PtrGATA 8 were able to activate the promoter activities of the biosynthetic genes for all three major wood components.

40|$|Abstract Background Caffeoyl shikimate {{esterase}} (CSE) {{was recently}} characterized as an enzyme {{central to the}} lignin biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. The cse- 2 loss-of-function mutant shows a typical phenotype of lignin-deficient mutants, including collapsed vessels, reduced lignin content, and lignin compositional shift, {{in addition to a}} fourfold increase in cellulose-to-glucose conversion when compared to the wild type. However, this mutant exhibits a substantial developmental arrest, which might outweigh the gains in fermentable sugar yield. To restore its normal growth and further improve its saccharification yield, we investigated a possible cause for the yield penalty of the cse- 2 mutant. Furthermore, we evaluated whether CSE expression is under the same multi-leveled transcriptional regulatory network as other lignin biosynthetic genes and analyzed the transcriptional responses of the phenylpropanoid pathway upon disruption of CSE. Results Transactivation analysis demonstrated that only second-level MYB <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> (MYB 46 and MYB 83) and lignin-specific activators (MYB 63 and MYB 85), but not top-level NAC <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> or other downstream transcription factors, effectively activate the CSE promoter in our protoplast-based system. The cse- 2 mutant exhibited transcriptional repression of genes upstream of CSE, while downstream genes were mainly unaffected, indicating transcriptional feedback of CSE loss-of-function on monolignol biosynthetic genes. In addition, we found that the expression of CSE {{under the control of the}} vessel-specific VND 7 promoter in the cse- 2 background restored the vasculature integrity resulting in improved growth parameters, while the overall lignin content remained relatively low. Thus, by restoring the vascular integrity and biomass parameters of cse- 2, we further improved glucose release per plant without pretreatment, with an increase of up to 36  % compared to the cse- 2 mutant and up to 154  % compared to the wild type. Conclusions Our results contribute to a better understanding of how the expression of CSE is regulated by secondary wall-associated transcription factors and how the expression of lignin genes is affected upon CSE loss-of-function in Arabidopsis. Moreover, we found evidence that vasculature collapse is underlying the yield penalty found in the cse- 2 mutant. Through a vessel-specific complementation approach, vasculature morphology and final stem weight were restored, leading to an even higher total glucose release per plant...|$|E

Recently, we reported the requirement of a WOX 1 /MAW-like gene, STENOFOLIA (STF), for blade outgrowth and leaf vascular patterning in Medicago truncatula and Nicotiana sylvestris. The stf mutant in Medicago produces narrow leaves where mediolateral outgrowth of the blade is severely curtailed while proximodistal growth and trifoliate identity remain unaffected. The lam 1 mutant in N. sylvestris produces leaves devoid of blade tissue with just 1 - 2 layers of rudimentary strips and lacks stem elongation. stf and lam 1 mutants have narrow petals and are female sterile due to defective ovule development.
