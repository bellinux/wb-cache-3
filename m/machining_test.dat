40|$|Gouge {{checking}} and gouge measuring are essential parts of 5 -axis tool-positioning strategies. To evaluate {{the quality of}} a tool path (i. e. the remaining material, commonly referred to as cusps), machining tests must usually be performed. If the tests prove to be unsatisfactory, new tool paths must be generated and run. In this paper, a new approach for modeling cusps is presented which makes use of recent advances in vector algebraic computation of swept volumes. The method uses the computer’s graphics card to compute the cusp geometry from the swept volumes. The algorithm was verified with a <b>machining</b> <b>test</b> by measuring the cusp height between two adjacent passes with a Coordinate Measuring Machine and comparing it to the modeled cusp height. machining, modeling the surface that will be generated by a tool path is more difficult than for 3 -axis. The simplicity of 3 -axis machining allows for the development of simplified algorithms to compute and visualize the surface resulting from a tool path. Unfortunately, these simplifications cannot easily be generalized to 5 -axis tool motion. Gouge {{checking and}} measuring for 5 -axis tool paths has been a widely researched area [13]. However, gouge checking only measures the error of a tool path and does not measure its quality. To determine the quality, researchers usually perform a <b>machining</b> <b>test</b> to measure cusp heights (the material remaining on the workpiece between adjacent passes of the tool). If the test proves to be unsatisfactory, the researcher must compute new tool paths adding more tool passes and perform a new <b>machining</b> <b>test.</b> byCategories and Subject Descriptor...|$|E

In this study, laser surface texturing is implemented for enhancing, at the surface level, the intrinsic bulk-like tribological performance of these materials.
