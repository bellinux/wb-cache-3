40|$|Objectives: Several {{studies have}} shown that <b>mirrored</b> <b>arm</b> or leg {{movements}} are related to altered body sensations. This includes the alleviation of chronic pain using congruent mirror feedback and the induction of abnormal sensation in healthy participants using incongruent mirror feedback. Prior research has identified neuronal and conceptual mechanisms of these phenomena. With the rising application of behavior-based methods for pain relief, a structured investigation of these reported effects seems necessary. Methods: We investigated a mirror setup that included congruent and incongruent hand and arm movements in 113 healthy participants and assessed the occurrence and intensity of unusual physical experiences such as pain, the sensation of missing or additional limbs, or changes in weight or temperature. A wooden surface instead of a mirror condition served as control. Results: As reported earlier, mirrored movements led to a variety of subjective reactions in both the congruent an incongruent movement condition, with the sensation of possessing a third limb being significantly more intense and frequent in the incongruent mirror condition. Reports of illusory pain were not more frequent during mirrored than during non-mirrored movements. Conclusions: These results suggest that hand movements with and without a mirror induce abnormal body perceptions but that the experience of an extra limb is most pronounced in the incongruent mirror movement condition. The frequent sensation of having a third arm may be related to brain processes designed to integrate input from several senses in a meaningful manner...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Er:YAG lasers for soft and hard tissue ablation has proven promising results {{over the last}} decades due to strong absorption at 2. 94 μm wavelength by water molecules. An extension to endoluminal applications demands laser delivery without <b>mirror</b> <b>arms</b> due to dimensional constraints. Therefore, fiber-based solutions are advanced to provide exible access while keeping space requirements to a minimum. Conventional fiber-based treatments aim at laser-tissue interactions in contact mode. However, this procedure is associated with disadvantages such as advancing decrease in power delivery due to particle coverage of the fiber tip, tissue carbonization, and obstructed observation of the ablation progress. The objective of this work is to overcome aforementioned limitations with a customized fiber-based module for non-contact robot-assisted endoluminal surgery and its associated experimental evaluation. Up to the authors knowledge, this approach has not been presented {{in the context of}} laser surgery at 2. 94 μm wavelength. The preliminary system design is composed of a 3 D Er:YAG laser processing unit enabling automatic laser to fiber coupling, a GeO 2 solid core fiber, and a customized module combining collimation and focusing unit (focal length of 20 mm, outer diameter of 8 mm). The performance is evaluated with studies on tissue substitutes (agar-agar) as well as porcine samples that are analysed by optical coherence tomography measurements. Cuts (depths up to 3 mm) with minimal carbonization have been achieved under adequate moistening and sample movement (1. 5 mms- 1). Furthermore, an early cadaver study is presented. Future work aims at module miniaturization and integration into an endoluminal robot for scanning and focus adaptation. © 2016 SPIE...|$|R

Ronalds’ idea was to configure the index arm to rotate through twice {{the angle of the}} mirror, so that the arm could then be used to draw a line at the correct angle directly onto the drawing. He used a sector as the basis of his instrument and placed the horizon glass at one tip and the index mirror near the hinge connecting the two rulers. The two revolving elements were linked mechanically and the barrel supporting the mirror was twice the diameter of the hinge to give the required angular ratio.|$|R
