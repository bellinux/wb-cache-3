The utility's documentation, along with the forum post, contained little information as to how necessary keys could be obtained.

5|$|The ENIAC (1946) was {{the first}} machine that was both {{electronic}} and general purpose. It was Turing complete, with conditional branching, and programmable to solve {{a wide range of}} problems, but its program was held in the state of switches in patchcords, not in memory, and it could take several days to reprogram. Researchers such as Turing and Zuse investigated the idea of using the computer's <b>memory</b> <b>to</b> hold the program as well as the data it was working on, and it was mathematician John von Neumann who wrote a widely distributed paper describing that computer architecture, still used in almost all computers.|$|E
40|$|Autobiographical {{memory was}} {{examined}} in participants with {{seasonal affective disorder}} (SAD). In Experiment 1, participants with SAD performed an autobiographical memory task (AMT) in the winter, when depressed. The AMT required participants <b>to</b> generate autobiographical <b>memories</b> <b>to</b> positive and negative cue words. Symptom levels were reassessed in the summer, when participants were remitted. The number of overly general <b>memories</b> <b>to</b> positive cues generated when the SAD participants were depressed predicted symptom levels when remitted, over and above initial symptom levels, with greater winter overgenerality being associated {{with high levels of}} summer symptoms. However, this was dependent on the exact measure of depressive symptoms used. The degree of overgenerality of memories in SAD participants was further investigated in Experiment 2. Results revealed that SAD participants did not show elevated recall of overgeneral <b>memories</b> relative <b>to</b> controls. The results as a whole indicate that, even when levels of general memories are no greater in a given target group than in controls, the absolute level of general <b>memories</b> <b>to</b> positive cue words is still independently related to symptom outcome...|$|R

However, Karna needed real food to eat and asked Indra, the lord of heaven, the reason for serving gold as food. Indra told Karna that he had donated gold all his life, but had never donated food to his {{ancestors}} in Shraddha. Karna said that since {{he was unaware of}} his ancestors, he never donated anything in their <b>memory.</b> <b>To</b> make amends, Karna was permitted to return to earth for a 15–day period, so that he could perform Shraddha and donate food and water in their memory.

5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the <b>memory</b> <b>to</b> make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E

Fragmentation of memory can occur for relatively recent events as well.|$|R
5|$|The poem was {{the first}} of Eliot's that relied on speech, with a narrator who speaks to the {{audience}} directly. Described as a poem of early summer, air, and grace, it begins with a narrator recalling a moment in a garden. The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, really matters to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The poem then transitions from <b>memory</b> <b>to</b> how life works and the point of existence. In particular, the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates. Those who cling to technology and reason are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ("the Word", or Christ). The underworld is replaced by a churchyard and a discussion of death. This, in turn, becomes a discussion of timelessness and eternity, which ends the poem.|$|E

5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his <b>memory</b> <b>to</b> come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says that it looks like he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E
30|$|In other contexts, however, people {{selectively}} retrieve mood-incongruent <b>memories</b> <b>to</b> regulate mood (Parrott and Sabini 1990; Erber and Erber 1994; Rusting and DeHart 2000). People retrieve happier memories when {{in negative}} than positive moods (Parrott and Sabini 1990). Students {{are more likely}} <b>to</b> recall mood-incongruent <b>memories</b> before class <b>to</b> regulate emotions for more level-headedness around their peers (Erber and Erber 1994). And adaptive mood-incongruent strategies can be induced by providing people with specific instructions to engage in positive reappraisal—reinterpreting negative <b>memories</b> <b>to</b> extract positive outcomes (Rusting and DeHart 2000). Thus, while mood-congruent memory is well-documented, and may function to guide behavior, mood-incongruent strategies potentially aid emotion-regulation and well-being.|$|R
