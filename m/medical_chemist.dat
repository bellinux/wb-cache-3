40|$|AbstractDiscovering {{drugs to}} a disease {{is still a}} {{challenging}} task for medical researchers due to the complex structures of biomolecules which are responsible for disease such as AIDS, Cancer, Autism, Alzimear etc. Design and development of new efficient anti-drugs for the disease without any side effects are becoming mandatory in {{the recent history of}} human life cycle due to changes in various factors which includes food habit, environmental and migration in human life style. Cheminformaticds deals with discovering drugs based in modern drug discovery techniques which in turn rectifies complex issues in traditional drug discovery system. Cheminformatics tools, helps <b>medical</b> <b>chemist</b> for better understanding of complex structures of chemical compounds. Cheminformatics is a new emerging interdisciplinary field which primarily aims to discover Novel Chemical Entities [NCE] which ultimately results in design of new molecule [chemical data]. It also plays an important role for collecting, storing and analysing the chemical data. This paper focuses on cheminformatics and its applications on drug discovery and modern drug discovery techniques which helps chemist and medical researchers for finding solution to the complex disease...|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{chemistry}} {{emerged from}} the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy, medicine, manufacturing and mining. [...] A decisive moment came when 'chemistry' was distinguished from alchemy by Robert Boyle in his work The Sceptical Chymist, in 1661; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work. [...] Other important steps included the gravimetric experimental practices of <b>medical</b> <b>chemists</b> like William Cullen, Joseph Black, Torbern Bergman and Pierre Macquer and through the work of Antoine Lavoisier (Father of Modern Chemistry) on oxygen and the law of conservation of mass, which refuted phlogiston theory. The theory that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by John Dalton in 1803, although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven.

50|$|During the 18th century, {{the moral}} economy of France {{was based on}} wheaten bread. By {{supplying}} a sufficient amount of bread to the people, the government was able to demonstrate its strong political fitness. Wheaten bread was also thought to be indispensable to one's well-being after French <b>medical</b> <b>chemists</b> had associated gluten with several nourishing elements in plants. As bread had a high gluten content compared to other cereals, it was given a reputation of being the alimentary ideal. Consequently, consumers became extremely concerned {{with the quality of}} their wheaten bread, resulting in a meticulous surveillance of wheaten bread production; they did not want their bread to contain filler additives such as bran, rye, barley, and legume flour. At the time, bread was the most sought out food as it was considered to be essential, universal, and highly nutritive. It was typical for the average French citizen to believe {{that it was impossible to}} overindulge in bread. For many, bread became the centerpiece of every meal. All other foods such as fruits, vegetables, and meats were thought as subsidiary, or ancillary to nourishment.|$|R

50|$|The {{discovery}} of the imidazolinone herbicides began with the synthesis of the initial lead molecule by an American Cyanamid <b>Medical</b> Division <b>chemist</b> during the 1950s. This initial lead molecule was that of phthalimide. Years later during a random screening, the molecule exhibited herbicidal activity. Although it was not known to researchers at the time, the original phthalimide was actually inhibiting the enzyme AHAS. A derivative of phthalimide showed promise when it exhibited some plant growth-regulant activity. Optimization ensued and the attempt to enable the production of field trial samples {{led to the formation}} of a tricyclic compound. The same reaction was performed on the original phthalimide, resulting in a compound that exhibited broad-spectrum herbicidal activity. Further exploration resulted in the formation of the first imidazolinone herbicide.|$|R

The courses were lectured by highly qualified experts in cooperation with local scientists, whose institutes were also invited to facilitate further scientific connection between the course participants and the national institute. A large emphasis were put on multidisciplinarity, as trends point to integration, therefore, the courses have been developed for engineers coming from a very different background (electrical-, biomedical-, chemical-, mechanical engineers) and for physicists, <b>medical</b> doctors, <b>chemists,</b> etc. The courses were very successful, participants benefited much from that they have learned: refreshed and widened their knowledge, and might open new opportunities in their studies and careers...|$|R
