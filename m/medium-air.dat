40|$|We {{describe}} a simple experimental approach for delivering self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of octadecylphosphonic acid (OPA) on many oxide surfaces using a nonpolar medium with a dielectric constant around 4 (e. g., trichloroethylene). This approach readily {{results in the}} formation of full-coverage OPA SAMs {{on a wide variety of}} oxide surfaces including cleaved mica, Si wafer, quartz, and aluminum. Especially, the availability of delivering full-coverage OPA SAM on a Si wafer is unique, as no OPA SAMs at all could be formed on a Si wafer when using a polar OPA solution. The reason a nonpolar solvent is superior lies in the very fact that the hydrophilic OPA headgroup tends to escape from the nonpolar solution and is thus enriched at the <b>medium-air</b> interface. It is these OPA headgroups seeking a hydrophilic surface that make possible the well-controlled OPA monolayer on an oxide surface...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFungi {{are well}} known to the casual {{observer}} for producing water-repelling aerial moulds and elaborate fruiting bodies such as mushrooms and polypores. Filamentous fungi colonize moist substrates (such as wood) and have to breach the water–air interface to grow into the air. Animals and plants breach this interface by mechanical force. Here, we show that a filamentous fungus such as Schizophyllum commune first has to reduce the water surface tension before its hyphae can escape the aqueous phase to form aerial structures such as aerial hyphae or fruiting bodies. The large drop in surface tension (from 72 to 24 mJ m− 2) results from self-assembly of a secreted hydrophobin (SC 3) into a stable amphipathic protein film at the water-air interface. Other, but not all, surface-active molecules (that is, other class I hydrophobins and streptofactin from Streptomyces tendae) can substitute for SC 3 in the medium. This demonstrates that hydrophobins not only have a function at the hyphal surface but also at the <b>medium–air</b> interface, which explains why fungi secrete large amounts of hydrophobin into their aqueous surroundings...|$|E
40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The rep 1 gene of the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis encodes a pre-pro-protein that is processed in the secretory pathway into 11 peptides. These so-called repellents form amphipathic amyloid fibrils {{at the surface}} of aerial hyphae. A SG 200 strain in which the rep 1 gene is inactivated (Drep 1 strain) is affected in aerial hyphae formation. We here assessed changes in global gene expression {{as a consequence of}} the inactivation of the rep 1 gene. Microarray analysis revealed that only 31 genes in the Drep 1 SG 200 strain had a fold change in expression of C 2. Twenty-two of these genes were up-regulated and half of them encode small secreted proteins (SSPs) with unknown functions. Seven of the SSP genes and two other genes that are over-expressed in the Drep 1 SG 200 strain encode proteins that can be classified as secreted cysteine-rich proteins (SCRPs). Interestingly, most of the SCRPs are predicted to form amyloids. The SCRP gene um 00792 showed the highest up-regulation in the Drep 1 strain. Using GFP as a reporter, it was shown that this gene is overexpressed in the layer of hyphae at the <b>medium-air</b> interface. Taken together, it is concluded that inactivation of rep 1 hardly affects the expression profil...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Corneal {{epithelium}} {{removed from}} underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) extends numerous cytoplasmic processes (blebs) from the formerly smooth basal surface. If blebbing epithelia are grown on collagen gels or lens capsules in vitro, the basal surface flattens and {{takes on the}} smooth contour typical of epithelium in contact with basal lamina in situ. This study examines the effect of soluble extracellular matrix components on the basal surface. Corneal epithelia from 9 - to 11 -d-old chick embryos were isolated with trypsin-collagenase or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, then placed on Millipore filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.), and cultured at the <b>medium-air</b> interface. Media were prepared with no serum, with 10 % calf serum, or with serum from which plasma fibronectin was removed. Epithelia grown on filters in this medium continue to bleb {{for the duration of}} the experiments (12 - 24 h). If soluble collagen, laminin, or fibronectin is added to the medium, however, blebs are withdrawn and by 2 - 6 h the basal surface is flat. Epithelia grown on filters in the presence of albumin, IgG, or glycosaminoglycans continue to bleb. Epithelia cultured on solid substrata, such as glass, also continue to bleb if ECM is absent from the medium. The basal cell cortex in situ contains a compact cortical mat of filaments that decorate with S- 1 myosin subfragments; some, if no...|$|E
40|$|Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) {{replicate}} only in differentiated squamous epithelia in warts and in epithelial raft cultures {{grown at}} the <b>medium-air</b> interface. Virus-encoded and host transcription factors {{are thought to}} be responsible for repressing the viral enhancer and promoter located within the upstream regulatory region (URR) in the undifferentiated basal and parabasal cells while up-regulating their activities in the differentiated spinous cells. Using recombinant retroviruses, we acutely transduced neonatal foreskin keratinocytes (PHKs) with a lacZ reporter gene driven by the wild-type URR of the low-risk HPV type 11 or by a URR with individual mutations in seven promoter-proximal elements, some of which have not been characterized previously. Beta-galactosidase activities were detected in the submerged, proliferating PHKs and also in the differentiated spinous cells, but not in the steady-state proliferating basal cells, of stratified raft cultures. In particular, mutation of an Oct 1, an Sp 1, or a previously unknown promoter-proximal AP 1 site severely reduced the reporter activity, whereas mutation of either of two NF 1 sites flanking the Oct 1 site had no effect. These results demonstrate changes in cellular transcription factor profiles under different culture conditions and begin to characterize the naturally differentiation-dependent activation of the URR. They provide one molecular explanation for the patterns of HPV expression in warts and help validate epithelial raft cultures as an important experimental system for genetic dissection of HPV regulatory elements...|$|E

40|$|Background: In vitro dynamic culture {{conditions}} play {{a pivotal}} role in developing engineered tissue grafts, where the supply of oxygen and nutrients, and waste removal must be permitted within construct thickness. For tubular scaffolds, mass transfer is enhanced by introducing a convective flow through rotating bioreactors with positive effects on cell proliferation, scaffold colonization and extracellular matrix deposition. We characterized a novel polyurethane-based tubular scaffold and investigated the impact of 3 different culture configurations over cell behavior: dynamic (i) single-phase (medium) rotation and (ii) double-phase exposure (<b>medium-air)</b> rotation; static (iii) single-phase static culture as control. Methods: A new mixture of polyol was tested to create polyurethane foams (PUFs) as 3 D scaffold for tissue engineering. The structure obtained was morphologically and mechanically analyzed tested. Murine fibroblasts were externally seeded on the novel porous PUF scaffold, and cultured under different dynamic conditions. Viability assay, DNA quantification, SEM and histological analyses were performed at different time points. Results: The PUF scaffold presented interesting mechanical properties and morphology adequate to promote cell adhesion, highlighting its potential for tissue engineering purposes. Results showed that constructs under dynamic conditions contain enhanced viability and cell number, exponentially increased for double-phase rotation; under this last configuration, cells uniformly covered both the external surface and the lumen. Conclusions: The developed 3 D structure combined with the alternated exposure to air and medium provided the optimal in vitro biochemical conditioning with adequate nutrient supply for cells. The results highlight a valuable combination of material and dynamic culture for tissue engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEntamoeba histolytica {{is among}} the most deadly parasites {{accounting}} for the second highest mortality rate among parasitic diseases. Nevertheless, contrary to trypanosomatids, this protozoan in hardly studied by parasitology groups. This astonishing discrepancy is largely due to the remarkable intricate conditions required for parasite proliferation in vitro, particularly whenever large cell numbers are required. The present study was undertaken in order to optimize E. histolytica culturing harvest, using mineral oil layers preventing culture <b>medium-air</b> contact to maintain anaerobic conditions in culture plate wells. 2 × 104 trophozoites were plated on each well in 2. 0 mL YI-S- 33 medium, supplemented with bovine serum and 700 μL mineral oil. Parasites were daily quantified by light microscopy counting for up to 96 h and trophozoite motility was also assessed. We notice that E. histolytica cultures in 24 -well plates reached several-fold higher cell densities, particularly whenever the mineral oil layer was placed on top of the medium surface, blocking the air interface. At least 99 % of the parasites were vigorously motile for 72 h in oil-containing wells, whereas only less than 5 % displayed significant motility in oil-devoid wells. In order to determine whether such different growth responses were due at least in part to the oxidative stress, we used the reactive oxidant species fluorescent probe dihydroethidium (DHE). The remarkably higher DHE parasite labeling in oil-devoid cultures indicate that oxidative stress reduction can {{play a significant role in}} elevated growth rates observed in oil supplemented cultures. Propidium iodide and Trypan blue dye-exclusion assays indicate that parasite necrosis resulted from the stressing conditions. The present study indicates that E. histolytica culturing in oil-sealed wells may comprise a valuable tool for bioactivity of antiparasitic compounds...|$|E

The basal cell cortex in situ contains a compact cortical mat of filaments that decorate with S- 1 myosin subfragments; some, if not all, of these filaments point away from the plasmalemma. The actin filaments disperse into the cytoplasmic processes during blebbing and now many appear to point toward the plasmalemma. In isolated epithelia that flatten in response to soluble collagens, laminin, and fibronectin, the actin filaments reform the basal cortical mat typical or epithelial in situ. Thus, extracellular macromolecules influence and organize not only the basal cell surface but also the actin-rich basal cell cortex of epithelial cells...|$|E
