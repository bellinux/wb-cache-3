40|$|Racial {{socialization}} {{has been}} defined as a set of attitudes and behaviors that transmit worldviews about race and ethnicity to children (Hughes, 2003). These attitudes and behaviors are meant to convey messages to children of color that bolster child socioemotional functioning through the promotion of a positive racial identity, as well as the provision of resources geared to help children cope with life stressors—particularly racism. Research has identified the vast majority of African American families participate in racial socialization practices (Caughy, o’Campo, Randolph, & Nickerson, 2002; Hughes, 2003; Hughes & Chen, 1997). For example, Caughy et al. identified that among an inner-city sample of 200 African American parents 89 % gave messages of racial pride, 74 % emphasized messages of spirituality, 66 % emphasized messages of preparation for bias, and 65 % emphasized messages of racial mistrust to racially socialize their children. developmental theorists have begun to examine the role racial socialization may play in relationship to other developmental and family processes, and to child outcomes. For example, Garcia Coll et al. (1996) proposed a complex integrative model for <b>minority</b> <b>child</b> development that may help us better understand how racial socialization relates to <b>minority</b> <b>child</b> outcomes.

He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had <b>minority</b> <b>children</b> {{as long as the}} <b>minority</b> <b>children</b> tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them. Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were comfortable with their presence. He added that very poor black children tended to go to their neighborhood schools outside of District 5. McAdams also stated that White middle class parents did not consider Asians and Asian Americans to be minorities who could make a school less attractive to them. In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, non-English speaking Central American students at some HISD neighborhood schools made them unattractive to White parents.|$|E

25|$|From 2003 to 2009, the United Kingdom has had 37 {{cumulative}} {{cases of}} British nationals being abducted to Japan by a parent, {{none of which}} have been resolved. For a yearly figure, The Guardian newspaper reported that, for 2008 alone, there are 336 cases and estimated 470 children were abducted from the UK and taken abroad illegally, an increase of 20% from 2005 figures. Pakistan (30 cases) top the list followed by the US (23), Ireland (22) and Spain (21). Other abduction hotspots included Australia, France and Egypt. The cases of international parental abduction are not well published in U.K. due to reporting restrictions that apply to any cases involving the welfare of minors. However, the Guardian provided anecdotal evidence. A reporter attended a day in London family court. Eight out of 14 cases heard involved child abduction, which may indicate that the problem is widespread. 40% (134 out of the 336) of international abductions in 2008 involve countries that are not signatories to the Hague Convention. These include Bangladesh, Russia, Iraq and Nigeria. Moreover, the problem is expected to worsen as immigration and international marriage become common. Moreover, The Independent newspaper cites the Reunite International Child Abduction Centre which claims that 43% of parental abductions involve ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>children</b> taken abroad and often forced to marry. Moreover, cultural complicity, collusion and shame mean that many cases go unreported.|$|E

He {{grew up in the}} Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan's East Side, {{in the midst of the}} Great Depression. His father Joseph was a cab driver, who earned extra income by moonlighting. The elder Cousy had served in the German Army during World War I. Shortly after the war, his first wife died of pneumonia, leaving behind a young daughter. He married Julie Corlet, a secretary and French teacher from Dijon. At the time of the 1930 census, the family was renting an apartment in Astoria, Queens, for $50 per month. [...] The younger Cousy spoke French for the first 5 years of his life, and started to speak English only after entering primary school. He spent his early days playing stickball in a multicultural environment, regularly playing with African Americans, Jews and other ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>children.</b> These experiences ingrained him with a strong anti-racist sentiment, an attitude he prominently promoted during his professional career. When he was 12, his family moved to a rented house in St. Albans, Queens. That summer, the elder Cousy put a $500 down payment for a $4,500 house four blocks away.

[...] There have been various other Acts enacted to try and aid impoverished youth with the chance to succeed. One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This Act was meant to increase the accountability of public schools and their teachers by creating standardized testing which would give an overview {{of the success of the}} school's ability to educate their students. Schools which repeatedly performed poorly would have increased attention and assistance from the federal government. One of the intended outcomes of the Act was to narrow the class and racial achievement gap in the United States by instituting common expectations for all students. Test scores have shown to be improving for minority populations, however, they are improving at the same rate for Caucasian children as well. This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and <b>minority</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E

Such mixing of L 1 and L 2 learners of the target language also occurs in minority language immersion programmes. This study presents a qualitative study of L 1 minority language children’s output in such mixed groups by examining their language networks and use of the target language, Irish 1, in Irish-medium preschools or naíonraí where they are interacting with L 2 learners of Irish. Such networks are particularly interesting in the informal setting of preschool, where children have more freedom to move around and choose their interlocutor than in formal classrooms. This exploration of the children’s output and their language choices raises pertinent questions about the needs of <b>minority</b> language <b>children</b> for direct L 1 enrichment. This leads to an examination of aspects of the teachers’ input to these <b>minority</b> language <b>children</b> in light of their linguistic needs and the evidence of contact phenomena in their output...|$|R

Debates on racial integration are juxtaposed with child rights and the private sphere of the family. In Britain, the practices of transracial adoption and 'racial matching' continue to invite fierce debate and discussion. Several factors, including the ongoing disproportionate representation of <b>minority</b> ethnic <b>children</b> in the public care system, the 'unavailability' of suitable minority ethnic adoptive parents, concerns about adoptees' racial/cultural identity and the 'suitability' of white parents to raise racially competent children, form the backdrop for such debates.
