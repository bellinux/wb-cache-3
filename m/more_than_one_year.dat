5|$|A 2006 {{retrospective}} study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> was linked with a 60% {{increased risk of}} osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism {{was thought to be}} a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the {{guidelines}} were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as {{up to two}} categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but {{were not required to}} be repeated by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

He served as a vice-consul in Shanghai between 10 December 1931 and 9 January 1932 and then in Fuzhou until 1 March 1933. The book was released on 10 November 1933 by G. P. Putnam's Sons.|$|E

5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year.</b> Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{after the}} French Fourth Republic began to {{consider}} granting independence {{to most of}} its African colonies, Boganda met with Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared {{the establishment of the}} Central African Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first President of the independent CAR. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the French secret service, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the Central African Republic attained formal independence from France.|$|E
5|$|MTV Unplugged {{was first}} {{released}} in Switzerland and the United States, respectively, in CD/DVD and digital formats, on November 13, 2009. Select songs and interviews from the EP were aired during MTV's morning block, AMTV, three days later. The physical edition {{was released in}} the United States and France on November 17, 2009. The full video recording was released, on 27 November, on the MTV official website, while the television premiere followed at 9 PM of that day, on the high-definition channel Palladia, being reaired at midnight. In Brazil, the set was released in a DVD/CD format, packaged in an keep case. The Japan release, also as a DVD/CD package, only occurred <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> after, on November 24, 2010. The album opened at number 168 on the US Billboard 200, having dropped out from the chart on the following week. As of February 2017, it {{has sold more than}} 62,000 copies in the United States. It debuted at number 192 on the French Albums Chart, and higher on the Swiss Albums Chart, at number 82.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} {{makes no}} mention of a lieutenant governor; if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor. If <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a new election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the Senate President will be the Speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by the state attorney general, the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order of term, that are in residence in the state {{at the time of the}} vacancy.|$|E

5|$|The early {{farmers from}} the Early Basketmaker II Era, {{lived in the}} Petrified Forest from about 1CE to about 800CE. They {{occupied}} pit houses at fewer than 100 sites, at first on mesas or other vantage points and later {{at the base of}} bluffs and in lowlands, where the soil was better. As climatic conditions worsened for farming between 750 and 900CE, the settlements changed with the Pueblo I Era. Rather than below-ground pits, the Pueblo Builders constructed above-ground houses and storerooms that may have been capable of storing food for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year.</b> At the same time, climatic conditions changed again, this time for the better, between 900 and 1275CE. More than 200 pueblo-builder sites have been identified in the park at a wide variety of locations—at the mouths of washes, near seeps, and on moisture-holding sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{countries}} participating each year has grown steadily, from seven in 1956 to over twenty in the late 1980s. A record 43 countries participated in 2008 and 2011. As the number of contestants has risen, preliminary competitions and relegation have been introduced, to ensure that as many countries as possible {{get the chance to}} compete. In 1993, a preliminary show, Kvalifikacija za Millstreet ("Qualification for Millstreet"), was held to select three Eastern European countries to compete {{for the first time at}} the main Contest. After the 1993 Contest, a relegation rule was introduced; the six lowest-placed countries in the contest would not compete the following year. In 1996, a new system was introduced. Audio tapes of all twenty-nine entrants were submitted to national juries. The twenty-two highest-placed songs after the juries voted reached the contest. Norway, as host country, was given a bye to the final. From 1997 to 2001 a system was used whereby the countries with the lowest average scores over the previous five years were relegated. Countries could not be relegated for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
