5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large {{that they can be}} <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E

5|$|The Tjele helmet {{fragment}} is a Viking Age {{fragment of}} iron and bronze, originally comprising the eyebrows and noseguard of a helmet. It was discovered in 1850 with a large assortment of smith's tools in Denmark, and though the find {{was sent to the}} National Museum of Denmark, for 134 years the fragment was <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> saddle mount. In 1984 it was properly identified by an assistant keeper at the museum as the remainder of one of only five known helmets from the Viking era.|$|E

Julian and Wladimir reminisce about his Fatinitza disguise, which eventually leads the soldiers to consider some amateur theatre, {{to relieve the}} boredom. As no women are present, Wladimir resumes his Fatinitza disguise.|$|E
5|$|There are 16 {{accepted}} {{species of}} Hygrophoropsis, found {{in both the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus that causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. The fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, peat, and on woodchips. They are convex to infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and have decurrent, forked brightly colored gills. The spores are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Because H.aurantiaca has orange gills, it has been <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> chanterelle, and hence it has been called a false chanterelle.|$|E

5|$|Uranus {{had been}} {{observed}} {{on many occasions}} before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchos, who in 128 BCE might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's Almagest. The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769, including on four consecutive nights.|$|E

The {{entirety}} of it is recovered later in the book when an officer mentions his name and title.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt and {{his sister}} were sent to {{separate}} boarding schools. He attended Felsted Junior School, where he gained an ambition to become a professional cricketer. For his secondary education, {{he was sent to}} St. Lawrence College in Ramsgate, Kent, where he joined the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and eventually rose to senior under-officer. While at school, he developed a dislike of his first name, Francis, after it was <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> girl's and he was invited to a birthday party at which he was the only boy. He eventually switched to his middle name, Richard, when he was fifteen. By then aspiring to become a barrister, Dannatt applied to study law at Emmanuel College, Cambridge but was turned down after an interview, at which point his ambition switched towards a military career.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Morton {{returned}} to the band. Two years later, the band released its first full-length self-titled album, Burn the Priest, through Legion Records. Mikey Brosnan of Legion Records saved up $2,500 for the recording and then broke them in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania through DIY shows. The album was produced by Today Is the Day guitarist and vocalist Steve Austin. Spear left the band, leaving an open position for a guitarist. Adler's younger brother Willie became the band's second guitarist a year later, and a deal with Prosthetic Records was signed. Contrary to rumour, the band did not change their name to Lamb of God after being banned from venues; these bans occurred afterwards. They changed their name because of the altered line-up, and to avoid being <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> satanic metal band.|$|E

5|$|In the Crimea, Heber {{encountered}} the region's large Muslim community, and observed eastern manners and practices {{for the first}} time. He expressed particular pleasure at being greeted with the oriental salaam. The {{course of the war}} in Europe had meanwhile shifted, so that Heber and Thornton were able, on the final stages of their journey, to pass through Poland, Hungary, Austria and Germany to reach the port of Hamburg. On the way they visited Austerlitz, where they heard accounts of the recent battle from the local population. In the course of his enquiries, which included making sketches of the scene, Heber was briefly <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> French spy by local farmers. At Hamburg the two travellers boarded Lord Morpeth's private yacht and sailed for England, arriving at Great Yarmouth on 14 October 1806.|$|E

However Darren teamed up with Kim to force Dr. S'avage to give him the hospital taxi contract and recruited Tony to work as his receptionist. However they came to blows over the name and design of the company, but resolved their differences with Darren moving into the boarding house, Tony working as a taxi driver and Maxine Minniver (Nikki Sanderson) takes over as receptionist.|$|E
5|$|Other {{lavender}} to violet-colored corals include Clavulina amethystinoides, {{which is}} so multiply branched so as to appear toothed, and Clavulina amethystina, {{which can only be}} reliably distinguished by its two-spored basidia in comparison to the four-spored basidia of Clavaria species. In Alloclavaria purpurea, the branching is reduced and the color usually a duller purple. The Australian coral Clavaria versatilis is also similar in appearance to Clavaria zollinger, but has branch tips that end in two short and blunt processes that are the same color {{as the rest of the}} fruit body. Ramariopsis pulchella—a small, violet-colored coral fungus rarely taller than —could be <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small C.zollingeri. It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3.0–4.5 by 2.5–3.5μm.|$|E
