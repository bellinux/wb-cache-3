40|$|The {{interactive}} {{educational television}} system proposed {{in this paper}} enables the participants in a satellite TV session to view and hear the presenters via a typical satellite broadcast system and interact with the presenters and each other using an Internet computer conferencing system. Thus it consists of two parallel information systems operating side by side, with the added ability to display the Internet conference output on the television broadcast. The base layer consists of a typical satellite TV broadcast system. The second is an Internet multiuser conferencing system, such as a <b>multiuser</b> <b>dimension</b> (<b>MUD).</b> In this paper the current educational delivery services termed ‘interactive television ’ are surveyed, discussed {{and the need for}} interaction using Internet is described. Practical plans for educational system implementation are proposed. It is argued that the proposed system enables an optimal level of interactivity in satellite teaching and learning for topic areas where immediate student questions and discussions are essential for overcoming learning bottlenecks (Tuovinen and Hill, 1994). It is also argued that this system is a particularly cost effective means of distance teaching and learning for Australian school systems, TAFE and university education...|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{isolation}} has {{a variety of}} definitions, dependent upon the circumstances it is investigated in. In one instance the problem of isolation has been defined as social withdrawal, defined as low relative frequencies of peer interaction. Other researchers have defined isolation as low levels of peer acceptance or high levels of peer rejection. Research that considers isolation with regard to the Internet either focuses on how the Internet makes individuals more isolated from society by cutting off their contact from live human beings or how the Internet decreases social isolation of people by allowing them to expand their social networks and giving them more means {{to stay in touch with}} friends and family. Since the development of the Internet, and in particular the World Wide Web, a wide variety of groups have come into existence, including Web and Internet Relay Chat (IRC), newsgroups, <b>multiuser</b> <b>dimensions</b> (<b>MUDs),</b> and, more recently, commercial virtual communities. The theories and hypotheses about how Internet-based groups impact individuals are numerous and wide-ranging. Some researchers view these fast growing virtual chat cliques, online games, or computer-based marketplaces as a new opportunity, particularly for stigmatized people, to take a more active part in social life.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates how <b>multiuser</b> <b>dimensions</b> can {{effectively}} be exploited for target {{degrees of freedom}} (DoF) in interfering broadcast channels (IBC) consisting of K-transmitters and their user groups. First, each transmitter is assumed to have a single antenna and serve a singe user in its user group where each user has receive antennas less than K. In this case, a K-transmitter single-input multiple-output (SIMO) interference channel (IC) is constituted after user selection. Without help of multiuser diversity, K- 1 interfering signals cannot be perfectly removed at each user since the number of receive antennas is smaller {{than or equal to}} the number of interferers. Only with proper user selection, non-zero DoF per transmitter is achievable as the number of users increases. Through geometric interpretation of interfering channels, we show that the <b>multiuser</b> <b>dimensions</b> have to be used first for reducing the DoF loss caused by the interfering signals, and then have to be used for increasing the DoF gain from its own signal. The sufficient number of users for the target DoF is derived. We also discuss how the optimal strategy of exploiting multiuser diversity can be realized by practical user selection schemes. Finally, the single transmit antenna case is extended to the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) IBC where each transmitter with multiple antennas serves multiple users.

In this metaphor, users are allowed to concurrently navigate {{in a set of}} "virtual" rooms. Rooms are interconnected through doors and may contain objects.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that the capacity of a multiple antenna system grows linearly with increasing number of antennas for rich-scattering environments. However, this is not true for wireless channels with small number of independent paths. To overcome this problem, this paper investigates the possibility of exploiting <b>multiuser</b> <b>dimension</b> with and without channel side information at transmitter. First, the single user capacity per antenna is shown to converge to zero with increasing number of antennas for channels with nite number of independent paths. Then multiuser capacity per antenna at limit is shown to be positive. Simulation results are presented for a single user system and a multiuser uplink system. I...|$|R
30|$|Nam et al. (2001 b) {{reported}} the long-term viability and growth performance of induced tetraploid mud loach, Misgurnus mizolepis. Erythrocyte cellular and nuclear <b>dimensions</b> of tetraploid <b>mud</b> loach {{were significantly higher}} than those of diploids, as expected. Chromosomal and flow cytometric analyses revealed the genomic structure of tetraploids as originating from the doubling of 2 n chromosomes, as evidenced by their modal chromosome number and average cellular DNA content, which were double the diploid values (Nam et al. 2001 b). In addition, Nam et al. (2001 b) confirmed that tetraploids showed a significantly depressed growth performance based on body weight loss between tetraploids and diploids.|$|R
40|$|The hot mud {{extrusion}} in Porong, Sidoarjo since May 29, 2006 has impacted {{many aspects}} including social, culture, economy and transportation. Several weeks later, a collaborative team {{was formed to}} investigate the factors controlling the hot mud extrusions. One important aspect is concerning the <b>mud</b> <b>dimensions</b> such as its perimeter, area, volume and discharge. Bakosurtanal was assigned {{to carry out this}} task. Field surveys to acquire the mud heights were conducted twice within one month interval. Geographic Information System (GIS) using 3 dimentional approach was employed to compute the mud dimesions. One of the results show that the mud discharge is about 50. 000 m 3 /day. This value was later commonly used to refer the magnitude of the hot mud...|$|R
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 1964 on 14. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) A muddy-sand {{site in the}} North Sea was studied to identify {{the role of the}} benthic macrofauna in the resuspension of sediment. The macrobenthic community contained species capable of significant bioturbation. In particular, the presence and the temporal occurrence of the brittle star Amphiura filiformis was correlated with seasonal geotechnical and geophysical properties of the seabed. In addition, the extensive burrowing habit of the mud shrimp, Callianassa subterranea (Montagu), make this species potentially the most important contributor to the degree of bioturbation experienced at the site. Mud shrimps were an abundant and stable member of the study site's macrobenthic community [mean= 11. 4 indiv. / 0. 25 m²(1 SD± 2. 1) ]. The sexually dichotomous individuals live between 2 - 3 years, and reproduction and recruitment primarily occurred in the summer (though an additional late winter/early spring period was hypothesised). Resin casting of burrows constructed by C. subterranea in the laboratory revealed a consistent morphological pattern with particular size- and sex-specific details of <b>dimension</b> and design. <b>Mud</b> shrimps, recovered from the site, were returned to the laboratory to investigate the influence of body size and temperature upon the amount of sediment expelled. A clear relationship between these variables and the quantity of expelled sediment was identified, and a well-defined temporal pattern of expulsion activity and inactivity was demonstrated. These experimental data, together with field information on seawater temperatures and mud shrimp population dynamics from the site, allow the construction of an annual sediment turnover budget [11 kg(dry) /m²/yr] with a confidence to date unrealised. Field observations at the North Sea site show that the sediment expelled by the mud shrimp occasionally forms a multitude of unconsolidated volcano-like mounds, which significantly modify seabed surface topography. The dimensions of these surface features were measured from bottom photographs and used to determine values of boundary roughness length (Zo) for the site (eg, September Zo= 0. 79 cm). The mud shrimps' contribution to resuspension was estimated by calculating the derived lateral sediment transport rate of 7 kg/m/month (from values of the site's near-bed current velocity, modified boundary roughness length and predicted sediment turnover rates). The links between sediment resuspension and the fluxes of trace metals, carbon and nutrients established by associated studies, demand that the bioturbatory activities of Callianassa subterranea must be included in any discusssion of the fate of contaminants and the future modelling of associated water quality in the North Sea.
