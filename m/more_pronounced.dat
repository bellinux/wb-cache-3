5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface plication (C.striatus has a <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> plication), the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E
5|$|The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa is {{distinguished}} from the more common variety by the orange color of the upper branches. Variety compactospora tends to show a <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> wine-red, purple, or reddish color in the branch tips, and has smaller spores measuring 9.2–12.8 by 4–5.4µm.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{fixation}} {{of plant}} leaves is a relatively slow process. Penetration of glutaraldehyde or osmic acid may extend over many minutes. In terms of cellular processes, {{this is a very}} long time, resulting in the introduction ofnumerous artifacts, such as undulation of membranes [23, 19].

5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E
5|$|Different {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} an element are called allotropes. Some allotropes, {{particularly those of}} elements located (in periodic table terms) alongside or near the notional dividing line between metals and nonmetals, exhibit <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> metallic, metalloidal or nonmetallic behaviour than others. The existence of such allotropes can complicate the classification of the elements involved.|$|E
5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even <b>more</b> <b>pronounced.</b> Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E

These range from non-profit, non-partisan organizations like the Hoover Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations to media organizations with <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> political affinities, such as the National Empowerment Television network and Irving Kristol's The Public Interest.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale mining {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in surface mining than in underground mining. They include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities.|$|E
5|$|Social {{divisions}} {{did appear}} both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and {{society of the}} north had modernized more slowly {{than those of the}} south, there was a <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> conflict between Christianity and socialism in the north, and farmland had a major social status; ownership of even a small parcel of land created a motivation to fight against the Reds.|$|E

5|$|Stress has {{effects on}} the immune system, {{which may explain why}} some cases {{directly}} correlate with stress. It is often stated that ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> during periods of stress, and hence the mucosa is subjected to more minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{average number}} of lice per host tends to be higher in large-bodied bird species than in small ones. Lice have an {{aggregated}} distribution across bird individuals, i.e. most lice live on a few birds, while most birds are relatively free of lice. This pattern is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in territorial than in colonial—more social—bird species.|$|E
5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> than, vertical similarities.|$|E

30|$|The CNR {{may also}} be {{significantly}} improved using a Gaussian post-filtering with a higher FWHM value to reduce noise in the reconstructed images [26] but {{at the expense of}} a <b>more</b> <b>pronounce</b> correlation between voxels. In this work, we have set the post-filtering strength to that used for routine examinations of 18 [*]F-FDG considering, firstly, the improvement in the reconstructed spatial resolution provided by the PSF modelling, and secondly to reduce the bias in quantitation for the reconstructed volume.|$|R

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced.</b> Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> on satellite imagery. The reorganization {{led to an}} increase in intensity, and at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of the}} circulation.|$|E

5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem is even <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra {{space between the}} top of the cargo and {{the top of the}} hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus {{is one of}} the best-understood genera of the Abelisauridae, {{a family}} of large theropods {{restricted}} to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents. Several notable traits that evolved within this family, including shortening of the skull and arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae, were <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in Carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E
5000|$|A. capra can {{be found}} in the {{tropical}} forests of Cambodia (Mondolkiri) and southern Vietnam (Dong Nai, Khánh Hòa and Lâm Đồng provinces); reports of their presence in Laos are probably inaccurate. [...] They are diurnal and mostly arboreal and {{can be found}} in Cát Tiên National Park, where they can be distinguished from the commonly encountered A. coronata by their considerably <b>more</b> <b>pronounces</b> dorsal spines and nuchal crest. Sexual dimorphism is not pronounced, with males having a slimmer and slightly tapered body than the females, which are broader-bodied.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how changes in fueling strategy in the second cycle of engine operation influence the delivered charge fuel mass and engine out hydrocarbon (EOHC) emissions in that and subsequent cycles. Close attention will be paid to cycle-to-cycle interaction of the fueling strategy. It is our intent to see if residual fuel from each cycle has a predicable influence on subsequent cycle's charge mass and EOHC emissions. The fast flame ionization detector is employed to measure both in-cylinder and engine out hydrocarbon concentrations for various cold start strategies. The manufacturer's original fueling strategy is used as a starting point and is compared to a "in-cylinder fuel air ratio (Phi) [approx. ] 1 " case (a fueling strategy that results in an in-cylinder concentration of approximately stoichiometric for each of the first five cycles) and to a number of cases that are chosen to illustrate cycle-to-cycle mixture preparation dependence on second cycle fueling. Significant cycle-to-cycle dependence is observed with the change in second cycle. A fueling deficit in cycle two has a <b>more</b> <b>pronounce</b> effect on future cycles delivered charge mass than a fueling surplus while a fueling surplus in cycle two has a <b>more</b> <b>pronounce</b> effect on future cycles charge mass than a fueling deficit. by James M.
