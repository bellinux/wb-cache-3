40|$|By {{considering}} the rapid change of standing-wave electric-field and assuming the interface defect distribution, an improved model is developed {{to analyze the}} defect density distribution and assess the damage performance of high-reflective coatings. Two kinds of high-reflective coatings deposited by e-beam evaporation (EBE) and ion beam sputtering (IBS) techniques are analyzed with this method. The lower overall damage threshold is the major feature for the coatings deposited by IBS method according to the defect parameters extracted from the model. Typical damage morphologies of coatings are also measured and analyzed. The assumption of interface defects {{is supported by the}} damage behavior. The damage mechanisms of two high-reflective coatings are attributed to the formation of molten pool and <b>mechanical</b> <b>ejection.</b> The influence of the incident angle on the damage probability is also considered and numerically calculated. The defect analysis model improved here is suitable for high-reflective coatings. (C) 2015 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
40|$|Massive and diffuse haloes of hot gas (coronae) are {{important}} intermediaries between cosmology and galaxy evolution, storing mass and angular momentum acquired from the cosmic web until eventual accretion on to star-forming discs. We introduce {{a method to}} reconstruct the rotation of a galactic corona, based on its angular momentum distribution (AMD). This allows us to investigate in what conditions the angular momentum acquired from tidal torques can be transferred to star forming discs and explain observed galaxy-scale processes, such as inside-out growth and the build-up of abundance gradients. We find that a simple model of an isothermal corona with a temperature slightly smaller than virial and a cosmologically motivated AMD is in good agreement with galaxy evolution requirements, supporting hot-mode accretion as a viable driver {{for the evolution of}} spiral galaxies in a cosmological context. We predict moderately sub-centrifugal rotation close to the disc and slow rotation close to the virial radius. Motivated by the observation that the Milky Way has a relatively hot corona (T ~ 2 x 10 ^ 6 K), we also explore models with a temperature larger than virial. To be able to drive inside-out growth, these models must be significantly affected by feedback, either <b>mechanical</b> (<b>ejection</b> of low angular momentum material) or thermal (heating of the central regions). However, the agreement with galaxy evolution constraints becomes, in these cases, only marginal, suggesting that our first and simpler model may apply to a larger fraction of galaxy evolution history.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Industry often {{requires}} the sorting of one material from another. Although {{the detection of}} desired (or undesired) elements is well advanced, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>ejection</b> or removal of particles is fairly underdeveloped. Agriculture and mining applications have used air jets and water jets to eject particles ranging in weight from a few grams to several hundred. With the current trends in mechanization leading towards higher processing speeds, these traditional methods {{have been found to}} be unsuitable: they have slow turn-on and turn-off response times, leading to a high volume of material being ejected with the target. Higher processing speeds will lead to even greater amounts of waste material being ejected thus producing even lower yield concentrations. Thus the need for a quick response time, repetitive, impulse ejection mechanism in the sorting industry is apparent. A kinematic analysis of the required ejection mechanism blast strength shows that the required force depends on the target mass, the required deflection angle the force application angle and the force duration. Acoustical techniques in air are unsuitable as ejection force mechanisms. A water jet is proposed to meets these requirements. This water jet is caused by an electrical discharge in a liquid cavity. This produces a weak shock wave which is focused by the cavity to a nozzle where a slug of water is emitted. The cavity is an elliptical cavity of height h, with the electrodes mounted end on at the first focus and a reflecting cone and nozzle at the second focus. The propagation of weak shock waves in the elliptical cavity is studied theoretically and numerically - using a finite difference simulation program. The reflected converging wave is shown to depend on the cavity eccentricity and the wall admittance. The resulting converging shock wave has an asymmetrical pressure distribution. This analysis is used in the design of a prototype water jet generator. The electrical discharge circuit used for the production of shock waves in the cavity is analysed and the physical discharge process of electrical to shock energy conversion reviewed. Conditions for the maximisation of this transfer correspond to large water gap resistances, high voltages and low circuit inductances. Experiments on the prototype generator show that the transient water jet slug energy is relatively low. High speed photographic techniques reveal that the jet velocity is of the order of 30 m/s. Published results show much higher jets speeds are possible. The operation of the electrical discharge circuit is found to critically influence the water jet performance - electrical measurements show that the circuit is a sub-optimum, underdamped RLC circuit. The cone / nozzle operation is also shown to have a marked effect on performance. The nozzle in particular requires optimisation. The prototype in its present form is not suitable for use in an ejection system. Although the pulse length, rise time and channel spread of the device are suitable, the blast strength is not sufficient for deflection of the heaviest range of particles. Optimisation of the electrical circuit and increased energies will increase the blast strength...|$|E

They separate items by their colours, detecting the colours of things that pass before them, and using <b>mechanical</b> or pneumatic <b>ejection</b> devices to divert items whose colours do not fall within the acceptable range.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{lubricants}} during compaction {{is crucial}} and nowadays even more important, {{due to the}} increased number of PM parts with higher densities and/or challenging ejection conditions. The development of new lubricants for single compaction requires however an excellent understanding of the lubrication mechanisms and the behaviour of these new compounds. In this paper, {{the effect of the}} lubricant particle size distribution on the compaction and ejection behaviour, but also on the static and dynamic properties of ferrous powder metallurgy parts is studied. Indeed, as parts reach higher densities, the influence of {{the size and shape of}} pores become dominant on the mechanical performance and particularly fatigue resistance of the parts. Water atomized powder mixes containing different particles sizes of ethylene-bis-stearamide (EBS) lubricant were compacted both on a laboratory press and on an industrial mechanical press at higher speed rates. In addition to compressibility curves and static sintered <b>mechanical</b> properties, complete <b>ejection</b> curves and fatigue tests results are presented.

40|$|Charge {{transport}} and separation in mechanically-driven, droplet-based ion sources are investigated using computational analysis and supporting experiments. A first-principles model of electrohydrodynamics (EHD) and charge migration is formulated and implemented using FLUENT CFD software for jet/droplet formation. For validation, classical experiments of electrospraying from a thin capillary are simulated, specifically, the transient EHD cone-jet {{formation of a}} fluid with finite electrical conductivity, and the Taylor cone formation in a perfectly electrically-conducting fluid. The model {{is also used to}} investigate the microscopic physics of droplet charging in mechanically-driven droplet-based ion sources, such as array of micromachined ultrasonic electrospray (AMUSE). Here, AMUSE is subject to DC and AC electric fields of varying amplitude and phase, with respect to a time-varying mechanical force driving the droplet formation. For the DC-charging case, a linear relationship is demonstrated between the charge carried by each droplet and an applied electric field magnitude, in agreement with previously reported experiments. For the AC-charging case, a judiciously-chosen phase-shift in the time-varying <b>mechanical</b> (driving <b>ejection)</b> and electrical (driving charge transport) signals allows for a significantly increased amount of charge, of desired polarity, to be pumped into a droplet upon ejection. Complementary experimental measurements of electrospray electrical current and charge-per-droplet, produced by the AMUSE ion source, are performed and support theoretical predictions for both DC- and AC-charging cases. The theoretical model and simulation tools provide a versatile and general analytical framework for fundamental investigations of coupled electrohydrodynamics and charge transport. The model also allows for the exploration of different configurations and operating modes to optimize charge separation in atmospheric pressure electrohydrodynamic ion sources under static and dynamic electrical and mechanical fields...|$|R
30|$|An {{estimated}} 26 % of ED {{patients will}} have an elevated BP with half of these patients having a BP[*]>[*] 160 / 100 [1, 2]. Distinguishing hypertensive urgency and emergency is challenging as both conditions involve marked {{elevation of blood pressure}} (BP, i.e., systolic BP[*]≥[*] 180 and/or diastolic BP[*]≥[*] 120). Hypertensive emergency is a life-threatening state with evidence of end-organ damage, as opposed to hypertensive urgency, and requires rapid reduction in BP [3, 4]. The heart is the most common organ affected, accounting for 52 % of hypertensive emergencies [3]. Strain echocardiography is a relatively new way to measure left ventricular (LV) mechanical function. Unlike conventional 2 D echocardiography which relies on visual estimation to assess cardiac contractility, strain echocardiography utilizes computerized speckle-tracking to measure actual tissue deformation of the myocardium. Strain can be measured in the longitudinal, radial and circumferential planes of the left ventricle (LV). Peak longitudinal strain (PLS) is a measurement of the overall longitudinal deformation of the left ventricle from diastole to systole. PLS can be measured from clips captured from standard apical views of the heart [5]. Longitudinal strain {{has been shown to be}} more sensitive at identifying hypertensive changes in LV <b>mechanical</b> function than <b>ejection</b> fraction (EF), fractional shortening, mitral E/A ratio, and tissue Doppler mitral annular velocity [5, 6]. Normal strain measurements range from −  15 to −  22 % [7]. We present a case where emergency physician (EP) performed point-of-care PLS analysis is used to monitor improvement in LV mechanical function over time for a patient with hypertensive cardiac emergency.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{pharmaceutical}} tabletting involves {{the application of}} stress onto the powdered drug ingredients contained within a rigid die. This compaction process will cause the powder to densify and form a tablet, which is then ejected from the die cavity. In reality, the tablet will incur some elastic strains during the compaction process and the tablet dimensional changes resulted due to the elastic relaxation of the tablet in the subsequent processing stages undermine the final tablet <b>mechanical</b> integrity. The <b>ejection</b> stage, where the tablet is extruded from the die, has not been studied extensively and is an important stage where any tabletting defects are immediately visible. It is then {{the purpose of this}} Thesis to experimentally elucidate the behaviour of the tablet elastic relaxation and its influence on the tablet mechanical integrity during the ejection, the final stage of the compaction process. The Thesis starts with highlighting the existence of the tablet elastic relaxation during the ejection stage that has been successfully studied on-line by the novel use of accurate laser sensors to record the tablet dimensional changes, with particular emphasis on the interrelationship of the tablet elastic relaxation with the observed ejection force and the tabletting defects of the Paracetamol tablet. The use of a lubricated die has also been shown to reduce the tablet elastic relaxation and the tabletting defects of the Paracetamol tablets. In terms of the time-dependent nature of the elastic relaxation, subtle time-dependent elastic relaxation behaviour has been observed and eludicated for the chosen time-dependent Starch material. A brief, but detailed and comprehensive material comparison consisting Aspirin, microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) and Paracetamol is presented in terms of the elastic relaxation during the ejection stage. The observed tablet elastic relaxation is then interrelated with the tablet strength, which is determined by an indirect tensile test (Brazilian) and a direct tensile test. Finally, the presence of a localized elastic relaxation occurring at the interface of an Avicel bilayered tablet has been shown to undermine the strength of the bilayered tablet, where the extent of the interface weaknesses is clearly dependent upon the behaviour of the localized elastic relaxation. In conclusion, the Thesis has successfully demonstrated and elucidated the tablet elastic relaxation behaviour during the ejection stage and the consequences on the final tablet mechanical integrity.
