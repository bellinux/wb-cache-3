5|$|Prior to May 18, Kehoe had {{loaded the}} back seat of his truck with metal debris capable of {{producing}} shrapnel during an explosion. He also bought a new set of tires for his truck to avoid breaking down when transporting the explosives. He made many trips to Lansing for more explosives, {{as well as to the}} school, town, and his house. A neighbor allegedly saw Kehoe carrying objects into the school building at night numerous times but never thought to <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> anyone.|$|E
25|$|Suzuki {{mentioned}} to So-on {{during this period}} {{that he might be}} interested in going to America to teach Zen Buddhism. So-on was adamantly opposed to the idea. Suzuki realized that his teacher felt very close to him and that he would take such a departure as an insult. He did not <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him again.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{preoccupation with}} the stage, and later with his {{official}} duties, Schubert found time during these years for {{a significant amount of}} composition. He completed the Mass in A-flat major (D. 678) and, in 1822, embarked suddenly on a work which more decisively than almost any other in those years showed his maturing personal vision, the Symphony in B minor Unfinished (D. 759). The reason he left it unfinished—after two movements and sketches some way into a third—remains an enigma, and it is also remarkable that he did not <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> any of his friends, even though, as Brian Newbould notes, he must have felt thrilled by what he was achieving. The event has been debated endlessly without resolution.|$|E

25|$|When visiting {{friends or}} family and staying with them, all foreign {{visitors}} are required to register with the Aliens Department of the local MUP {{in the place of}} the intended stay, within twenty-four hours of entering the country. At the Department, they will fill in a form (a sort of a landing card) made of two parts (both parts should be filled in). The form is processed by the officer in charge and a stamped segment is returned to the applicant. Visitors should always have this certificate on them during the entire stay in the country together with their passport or (for certain nationals) ID card. Foreigners who, at the time of registering with the police, know the date of their departure from Serbia, should <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the officer processing their registration in order to avoid additional visit to the same police department for de-registration. The registration is free of charge. At passport control at the port of exit, the certificate is collected by the immigration officer. Failing to complete the registration may result in fines.|$|E
500|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) {{visits the}} Pawnee {{high school to}} confront Greg Pikitis (Cody Klop), a {{teenager}} who she describes as her [...] "arch-nemesis". Leslie warns Greg she knows he vandalizes the town's statue of Mayor Percy every Halloween, but {{that she will be}} watching him closely and will catch him this year. Greg casually denies having any such plans. At the Pawnee town hall, Ann (Rashida Jones) talks excitedly about her upcoming Halloween party. She asks the others not to <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Tom (Aziz Ansari), but she is disappointed to learn Jerry (Jim O'Heir) has already told him. That night, Leslie watches Greg {{with the help of her}} boyfriend, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.), while Andy (Chris Pratt), who now has a part-time job with the parks department, guards the statue.|$|E
500|$|Robinett {{kept the}} Gray Dot a secret {{for over a}} year, and did not <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> anyone at Atari prior to his departure. He was unsure {{of whether or not}} it would be {{discovered}} by other Atari personnel prior to publishing; the dot was not mentioned in the game's manual, as the manual's author was unaware of the dot's existence. [...] After the game was released, Adam Clayton, a fifteen-year-old from Salt Lake City, discovered the Dot and sent a letter to Atari explaining how to retrieve it. Robinett had already quit the company by this point, so Atari tasked designers with finding the responsible code. The one who found it said that if he were to fix it, he would change the message in the game to say [...] "Fixed by Brad Stewart". Further, the cost of creating a new read-only memory (ROM) mask, or memory chip, was around $10,000 US {{at the time of the}} game's release, making this change a costly endeavor. Steve Wright, the director of software development of the Atari Consumer Division, argued for retaining the message, believing it gave players additional incentive to find it and play their games more, and suggested these were like Easter eggs for players to find. Atari eventually decided to leave the Dot in-game, and dubbed such hidden features Easter eggs, saying they would be adding more such secrets to later games. Wright made it an official policy at Atari that all future games should include Easter eggs, often limited to being the initials of the game developer.|$|E

2500|$|The April 25, 1988, {{issue of}} The New Yorker carried an {{interview}} where Goldwater said he repeatedly asked his friend, General Curtis LeMay, {{if there was}} any truth to the rumors that UFO evidence was stored in a secret room at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and if he (Goldwater) might have access to the room. According to Goldwater, an angry LeMay gave him [...] "holy hell" [...] and said, [...] "Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me again." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July 1966, Darlwyne made several sightseeing trips around Falmouth Harbour during Falmouth's Tall Ships regatta. A passenger {{on one of these}} sorties was Brian Michael Bown, {{a former member of the}} RAF Marine Rescue Section. Although not formally qualified as a ship's master, Bown had experience in small boat sailing, and had skippered boats on seagoing trips to Fowey and the Isles of Scilly. Subsequently, Bown discussed with Barrett a business proposition whereby Darlwyne would be used as a day-trip boat on a commercial basis. [...] Barratt later said that Bown had [...] bought the boat outright, but there is no documentation of this supposed deal, nor did Barratt <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> anyone else.|$|E
2500|$|The 1959 {{contract}} renewal {{also contained}} a clause that illustrates Diệm's increasing sensitivity to criticism: it stated that MSUG staffers' personal records and notes {{would not be}} used [...] "against the security or the interests of Vietnam". This stipulation ran contrary {{to the notion of}} academic freedom, and some professors chose to ignore it. For example, Robert Scigliano, an MSU political scientist who served as assistant project chief during 1957–1959, wrote an article in 1960 concerning the political parties of South Vietnam that called attention to Diệm's suppression of the opposition. Diệm was sufficiently irked by the article that he saw fit to <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> MSU President Hannah when the latter visited Vietnam in early 1961, saying it [...] "was {{not the kind of thing}} he liked to see MSU personnel writing".|$|E

2500|$|Project Sign (Project Grudge in 1949, Project Blue Book in March 1952) was WPAFB's T-2 Intelligence {{investigations}} of unidentified flying objects (UFO) reports {{that began in}} July 1947. In 1951, the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) began analysis of crashed Soviet aircraft from the Korean war. In March 1952, ATIC established an Aerial Phenomena Group to study reported UFO sightings, including those in Washington, DC, in 1952. By 1969 the Foreign Technology Division (FTD) and its predecessor organizations had studied 12,618 reported sightings: 701 remained unexplained when the Air Force closed its UFO investigations, and a 1968 report concluded that [...] "there {{seems to be no}} reason to attribute [...] to an extraterrestrial source without much more convincing evidence." [...] FTD sent all of its case files to the USAF Historical Research Center, which transferred them in 1976 to the National Archives and Records Service in Washington, DC, which became the permanent repository of the Project Sign/Grudge/Blue Book records. In a 1988 interview, Senator Barry Goldwater claimed he had asked Gen. Curtis LeMay for access to a secret UFO room at WPAFB and an angry LeMay said, [...] "Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me again." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{several days}} the water {{authority}} insisted {{the water was}} safe, and should be mixed with orange juice to disguise {{the taste of the}} as yet unknown contaminant. One customer who telephoned the authority the day after the contamination was told [...] "there had been some acidity, but the water was perfectly safe to drink," [...] and was no more harmful than lemon juice. On 14 July 1988 the authority sent a circular letter to all customers [...] "asserting that the water from the treatment works was of the right alkalinity and was safe to use and drink." [...] Within two days, the authority suspected the source of the contamination was the erroneous delivery, which was confirmed on 12 July when the driver was asked to return to the treatment works. However, it was not until ten days later on 22 July that the authority's chairman Keith Court authorised a public notice, containing the first mention of the aluminium sulphate, to be published in the sports section of a local newspaper, the Western Morning News. Stephens stated that after the site meeting where he confirmed he had delivered the chemical to the wrong tank he was told by the authority [...] "not to <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> anyone else". The SWWA district manager, John Lewis, said they had realised within 48 hours that aluminium sulphate was the likely cause of the contamination, but Lewis said he had been instructed by Leslie Nicks, the head of operations, not to tell the public.|$|E
