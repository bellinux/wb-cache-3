500|$|Finline is a {{different}} kind of waveguide technology in which waves in a thin strip of dielectric are constrained by two strips of metallisation. [...] There are a number of possible topological arrangements of the dielectric and metal strips. [...] Finline is a variation of slot-waveguide but in the case of finline the whole structure is enclosed in a metal shield. [...] This has the advantage that, like hollow metal waveguide, no power is lost by radiation. [...] Finline filters can be made by printing a metallisation pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E-plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters. [...] The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide. [...] Resonators are formed by metallising a pattern on to the dielectric sheet. [...] More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of figure 9 are easily achieved because the designer does not have to consider the effect on mechanical support of removing metal. [...] This complexity does not add to the manufacturing costs since the number of processes needed does not change when more elements are added to the design.
