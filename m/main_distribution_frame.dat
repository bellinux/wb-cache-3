25|$|A typical {{central office}} may have tens of {{thousands}} of pairs of wires that appear on terminal blocks called the <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF). A component of the MDF is protection: fuses or other devices that protect the switch from lightning, shorts with electric power lines, or other foreign voltages. In a typical telephone company, a large database tracks information about each subscriber pair and the status of each jumper. Before computerization of Bell System records in the 1980s, this information was handwritten in pencil in accounting ledger books.|$|E

50|$|Forecasters in {{the late}} 1960s underestimated demand, {{resulting}} in a shortage of capacity in Manhattan, NYTel's principal profit area. Customers had to wait weeks for a new line or a repair, and sometimes minutes for dial tone on an existing line. The new 1ESS Stored Program Control exchanges had software bugs that kept them from carrying full load. Deferred maintenance choked <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (MDFs) with dead jumpers. There were not enough cables to office buildings, nor enough underground conduits to install them.

As a result, Automated <b>Main</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames</b> (AMDFs) {{have been developed}} to alleviate the task of maintaining subscriber loops. Commercial AMDFs are currently employed in telephone exchanges {{in some parts of the}} world. However, the most significant factors limiting their widespread adoption are costeffective scalability and reliability. Therefore, an impelling incentive is provided to create a simulation framework in order to explore typical implementations and scenarios. Such a framework will allow the evaluation and optimisation of a design in terms of both internal and external redundancies. One of the approaches to improve system performance, such as system reliability, is to allocate the optimal redundancy to all or some components in a system. Redundancy at the system or component levels can be implemented in one of two schemes: parallel redundancy or standby redundancy. It is also possible to mix these schemes for various components. Moreover, the redundant elements may or may not be of the same type. If all the redundant elements are of different types, the redundancy optimisation model is implemented with component mixing. Conversely, if all the redundant components are identical, the model is implemented without component mixing. The developed framework can be used both to develop new AMDF architectures and to evaluate existing AMDF architectures in terms of expected lifetimes, reliability and service availability. Two simulation models are presented. The first simulation model is concerned with optimising central office equipment within a telephone exchange and entails an environment of clients utilising services. Currently, such a model does not exist. The second model is a mathematical model incorporating stochastic simulation and a hybrid intelligent evolutionary algorithm to solve redundancy allocation problems. For the first model, the optimal partitioning of the model is determined to speed up the simulation run efficiently. For the second model, the hybrid intelligent algorithm is used to solve the redundancy allocation problem under various constraints. Finally, a candidate concept design of an AMDF is presented and evaluated with both simulation models.

The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM.

40|$|Abstract—Today, the {{permutation}} of circuits in the <b>Main</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames</b> (MDF), which {{connect the}} subscriber lines to POTS and to DSLAMs, is still operated manually. However, new market regulations, allowing subscribers to change network operator frequently, {{and the new}} schemes to concentrate active ADSL users into few DSLAMs during off-peak hours, adopted by network operators to reduce the energy consumption in the access network (and the related operational costs), require more advanced, reliable and faster mechanisms than human operations. Indeed, Automated MDFs (AMDF) have recently become available on the market to provide cheap and almost real-time circuit switching. Even if grounded on more than 50 years of research activities on architectures for circuit switching, the considered scenario is quite peculiar and offers new interesting technical challenges, since classical multistage strictly non-blocking networks are too expensive {{for the number of}} required ports (sometimes very large, exceeding 100, 000), and rearrangeable multistage networks can interrupt temporarily active circuits, affecting in a indefinite way the performance of ADSL lines. For these reasons, we propose the design of AMDFs based on recently proposed non-interruptive rearrangeable (NIR) networks and show how to optimize the routing control to minimize the setup time of a circuit. Finally, our findings are relevant both for the theory of multistage interconnection networks, and for those companies producing, engineering and operating large AMDFs.
