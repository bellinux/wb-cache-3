500|$|William Petit {{had been}} able to free himself, escape his confines, and call to a {{neighbor}} for help. The neighbor indicated that he did not recognize him due to the severity of Petit's injuries. In court testimony, William Petit stated that he felt a [...] "jolt of adrenaline" [...] coupled with a need to escape upon hearing one of the perpetrators state: [...] "Don't worry, it's going to be all over in a couple of minutes." [...] Petit then told the jury, [...] "I thought, it's now or never because in my mind at that <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> they were going to shoot all of us." ...|$|E
500|$|The puzzle was {{simplified}} in The Shadow of the Templars 2009 [...] by, {{according to}} Cecil, adding a more logical solution. This {{version of the}} game includes a diary, in which the character takes notes; After completing the goat puzzle, George's diary reads: [...] "So the 'ghost of Lochmarne' {{is no more than}} a fierce Billy goat. For a <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was going to be incredibly awkward to get past, but in the end it was surprisingly simple. Who would have known?", as a reference to the original puzzle's reputation. An easter egg involving a talking goat was included in The Shadow of the Templars sequel, [...] (1997). A goat puzzle was featured in , in the beginning and ending of 2014 second and final episode of the title, as part of the achieved $800,000 Kickstarter [...] "stretch goal".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} {{series of the}} British game show Cluedo, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a [...] "man {{with a degree in}} suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what you did to our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are you talking about, you daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm so sorry. For a <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you were Shirley Williams." ...|$|E
60|$|She did {{not speak}} for a <b>moment,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she was resenting the question.|$|R
6000|$|Madame Merle stared, {{and indeed}} she was justly bewildered. [...] "Ah, a <b>moment</b> ago <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you seemed rather to disparage her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{mean that}} for a <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> only <b>thought</b> {{if we could get}} a {{chaplain}} from somewhere,--I'm willing to ride anywhere,--and give poor Hummil a better chance. That's all.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The papal nuncio, the Most Rev. Giovanni Tonucci, said at Father Kaiser’s {{funeral in}} the Nairobi basilica, [...] "The church, through pitiless violence, has once more been {{deprived}} {{of one of her}} ministers. Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr. Kaiser has been murdered because he was, and in the eternity of God still is, a Catholic priest who preached the Gospel. Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.... Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he asked my blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. At that <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would have been better}} if he, an old and worthy missionary, had blessed me. How much more I am convinced of that now that we look at him as a martyr of the faith?". Also present at the altar was Maurice Cardinal Otunga, Archbishop Emeritus of Nairobi.|$|E
2500|$|Sullivan praised Elvis {{at the end}} of the show, saying [...] "This is a real decent, fine boy. We've {{never had}} a pleasanter {{experience}} on our show with a big name than we've had with you.... You're thoroughly all right"—a remark that could either be interpreted as a [...] "ringing endorsement" [...] that [...] "legitimized the singer with an adult audience" [...] or as [...] "a somewhat hypocritical statement considering what the CBS censors had just done to his performance on that show." [...] Eyewitness Jerry Schilling writes, [...] "The way Elvis looked out at us at that <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I could see a mix of hurt over the attacks he’d been subjected to in the press, and a deep pride in who he was and what he was doing." [...] (According to historian Tim Parrish, Presley's manager, Colonel Parker, [...] "had threatened to remove Elvis from the show if Sullivan did not apologize for telling the press that Elvis's 'gyrations' were immoral.") Reflecting on the event in 1969, Presley claimed that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion off-camera: [...] "So they arranged to put me on television. At that particular time there was a lot of controversy—you didn't see people moving—out in public. They were gettin' it on in the back rooms, but you didn't see it out in public too much. So there was a lot of controversy ... and I went to the Ed Sullivan Show. They photographed me from the waist up. And Sullivan's standing over there saying, 'Sumbitch.' I said, 'Thank you, Ed, thank you.' I didn't know what he was calling me, at the time." ...|$|E
60|$|FALDER. It was {{all done}} in a <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of it afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{on earth}} can it be?" [...] said I, sitting {{down on the}} trunk in question. At the <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> almost <b>thought</b> {{that she had been}} {{instrumental}} in hiding it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have failed}} at the <b>moment</b> when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{the work was}} done," [...] he said to himself, despairingly, and at that instant two men ranged {{themselves}} either side of him.|$|R
60|$|We sat {{in silence}} for some <b>moments,</b> during which <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> intently to little purpose.|$|R
60|$|JUNO. No: I forgot that. Excuse me; {{but for the}} <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I {{was married}} to you.|$|E
60|$|For a <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she wavered. A softer {{expression}} {{came over}} her face, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shouldn't slur {{your words}} so. For a <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you said 'half of one per cent. One {{and a half}} of course you really said.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{think that}} he was despising my love at the very <b>moment</b> that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was melting his cruel heart! I hate him! He spurned me--did this man--he spurned me from him like a dog!" ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not until}} I was fairly seated by the driver, and {{rattling}} through a rocky valley with dwarf olives, that I became aware of my bereavement. I had lost Modestine. Up to that <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> hated her; {{but now she was}} gone, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't {{have fired}} {{the first shot}} in more {{dramatic}} fashion," [...] she declared. [...] "Even Mr. Phipps lost his nerve for a <b>moment,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that Henry was going to collapse altogether. I wonder {{what they are doing}} now." ...|$|R
60|$|Several now ran on deck, and, for the <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was {{all over}} with us; but we finally succeeded in {{restoring}} some degree of quiet.|$|E
6000|$|Jamrach was {{speechless}} for a second. Then he said, like one ashamed [...] "You caught me. I was napping. For a <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{you were in}} earnest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't imagine any," [...] she replied, [...] "and yet--for a <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{that you}} were talking artificially. I {{probably}} did you an injustice. I am sorry." ...|$|E
60|$|He did so, and we {{advanced}} at a shambling gallop, the horsemen gaining on {{us every}} <b>moment.</b> Now <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{that all was}} over, especially when of a sudden from behind the White Rock emerged a second squad of horsemen.|$|R
6000|$|My friend {{laid his}} hand on my knee; he looked at me for some <b>moments,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he was going to say, [...] "You are very young!" [...] But he said presently, [...] "YOU have got used to Europe any way!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In his media {{availability}} {{following his}} runner-up finish, Logano {{said of the}} finish - be it the final lap or the final 15 laps - were [...] "crazy anyway you look at it. Typical Watkins Glen. I mean, it’s just awesome, crazy racing, full contact. Just insane out there. So {{a lot of fun}} from the driver’s seat and I’m sure the fans loved it as well in front of a sold‑out grandstand. It was pretty cool when I pulled over for the red flag in front of the grandstands and I could hear just fans screaming and yelling and loving it. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> Man, this is really cool to be in the driver’s seat right now. Having those <b>moments,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was neat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{carried it}} so gravely that, for the <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he was dipped in this secret traffick too, {{and that there}} was not an honest ironmaster in Sussex.|$|E
60|$|Upon Wilson's {{coming on}} deck to enter his boat, he was beset on all sides; and, for a <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the ship would be seized before his very eyes.|$|E
60|$|John Stumpy {{suddenly}} {{shifted his}} hand from its grasp on the collar to the merchant's throat. For a <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> Mr. Woodward {{was in danger of}} being choked to death.|$|E
60|$|She {{closed her}} eyes for a <b>moment,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she was going to faint. I was a little {{impatient}} with her; I had not suspected that she was so neurotic a woman. Then I heard Stroeve's voice again. It seemed to break oddly on the silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "One <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> {{have always}} <b>thought</b> that my little pupil {{was at least}} clear-headed. You don't know {{everything}} yet, you know. Listen {{to me for a}} moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you {{acknowledge}} {{his connection}} with the British army," [...] said Frances. [...] "I confess there have been <b>moments</b> when <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> differently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not at all, Captain Gills,' {{returned}} Mr Toots. 'I didn't stop a <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{you were}} out. But the person said--by the bye, you don't keep a dog, you, Captain Gills?' ...|$|E
6000|$|For a <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{that his}} bad luck ’ad turned ’is brain. [...] "You’ve got it wrong," [...] I ses, {{as soon as}} I could speak. [...] "She walked out with me." ...|$|E
60|$|That stung him, and he slacked back perceptibly. Midway I {{stumbled}} and fell headlong. A bullet, striking {{directly in front}} of me, filled my eyes with sand. For the <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I was shot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary," [...] he said, quietly, [...] "I {{give you}} my word that nothing which I have said this evening has the least {{connection}} with that afternoon.

6000|$|... "Oh, he did, and mouths too. But {{from the}} beginning, when I was a child, I {{have known that}} he was dangerous, and <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> that he would pass on and forget me after a while.

6000|$|... “Of course, at the <b>moment</b> of dreaming <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was {{witnessing}} a real race, not the portent of one,” said Lola; “otherwise I should have particularly noticed all helpful details.” ...|$|R
