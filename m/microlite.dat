5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, <b>microlite,</b> wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E

40|$|During magma ascent in the {{volcanic}} conduit, the decompression of a silicic melt {{may result in}} the crystallization of morphologically and compositionally specific crystals, designated as <b>microlites.</b> Hence, <b>microlites</b> have been considered as probes of mechanisms and timescales of magma ascent.

40|$|The Soufrière Hills volcano on Montserrat has for {{the past}} 12 years been erupting {{andesite}} with basaltic to basaltic–andesite inclusions. The andesite contains {{a wide variety of}} phenocryst textures and strongly zoned <b>microlites.</b> Analysis of minor elements in both phenocrysts and <b>microlites</b> allows us to put detailed constraints on their origins. Compositions of clinopyroxene, from overgrowth rims on quartz and orthopyroxene and coarse-grained breakdown rims on hornblende, are identical to those from the mafic inclusions, indicating that these rims form during interaction with mafic magma. In contrast, resorbed quartz and reversely zoned orthopyroxenes form during heating. <b>Microlites</b> of plagioclase and orthopyroxene are chemically distinct from the phenocrysts, being enriched in Fe and Mg, and Al and Ca respectively. However, <b>microlites</b> of plagioclase, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene are indistinguishable from the compositions of these phases in the mafic inclusions. We infer that the inclusions disaggregated under conditions of high shear stress during ascent in the conduit, transferring mafic material into the andesite groundmass. The mafic component of the system is therefore greater than previously thought. The presence of mafic-derived <b>microlites</b> in the andesite groundmass also means that care must be taken when using this as a starting material for phase equilibrium experiments. ...|$|R

30|$|Quantitative {{evaluation}} of lava viscosity in drain-back of other volcanoes {{is not available}} from litherature. In basaltic lava, initial temperature of magma is generally over 1050 °C, and only small supercooling is expected by degassing of water during magma ascent. In such case, increase of viscosity of lava is minimal and drain-back of lava may take place if magma chamber and conduit shrinks after the eruption. In the 2004 eruption of Asama volcano, some drain-back of the andesite lava occurred (Urabe et al., 2006). SiO 2 content of the andesite is 58 wt% (Miyake et al., 2005) and the lava temperature {{is estimated to be}} 1000 – 1100 °C by pyroxene thermometry (Tsugane et al., 2006).

40|$|Magmas in {{volcanic}} conduits commonly contain <b>microlites</b> {{in association}} with preexisting phenocrysts, as often indicated by volcanic rock textures. In this study, we present two different experiments that inves- tigate the flow behavior of these bidisperse systems. In the first experiments, rotational rheometric methods are {{used to determine the}} rheology of monodisperse and polydisperse suspensions consisting of smaller, prolate particles (<b>microlites)</b> and larger, equant particles (phenocrysts) in a bubble‐free Newtonian liquid (silicate melt). Our data show that increasing the relative proportion of prolate <b>microlites</b> to equant pheno- crysts in a magma at constant total particle content can increase the relative viscosity by up to three orders of magnitude. Consequently, the rheological effect of particles in magmas cannot be modeled by assuming a monodisperse population of particles. We propose a new model that uses interpolated parameters based on the relative proportions of small and large particles and produces a considerably improved fit to the data than earlier models. In a second series of experiments we investigate the textures produced by shearing bimodal suspensions in gradually solidifying epoxy resin in a concentric cylinder setup. The resulting textures show the prolate particles are aligned with the flow lines and spherical particles are found in well‐organized strings, with sphere‐depleted shear bands in high‐shear regions. These observations may explain the measured variation in the shear thinning and yield stress behavior with increasing solid fraction and particle aspect ratio. The implications for magma flow are discussed, and rheological results and tex- tural observations are compared with observations on natural samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} crystal size of bimodal {{suspensions}} on rheology of magmas at strain rates between 0 and 1 s− 1 is studied. Suspensions consist of silicon oil and two populations of natural crystals with size 63 – 125 and 250 – 500 µm mixed in different proportions; the total solid fraction ϕ of the mixtures is between 0. 25 and 0. 5. At ϕ[*]≤[*] 0. 4, finer, coarser, and bimodal suspensions display comparable viscosities. At ϕ[*]≥[*] 0. 4, the viscosity of the bimodal suspensions {{is larger than}} that of the unimodal ones. The bimodal suspension, made mainly of finer crystals, shows a stronger increase of viscosity with ϕ. The addition of finer crystals to a suspension of coarser ones produces a more pronounced increase of viscosity with respect to suspensions of coarse or fine crystals alone, and of finer crystals with added coarser ones. The bimodal suspensions of coarser crystals develops yield stress at ϕ[*]≥[*] 0. 25, the others at ϕ[*]≥[*] 0. 4. It is modeled the ascent velocity in a 20 m wide dike of magmas with bimodal and unimodal populations of crystals of different size.

40|$|The Spearfish Canyon area, in the Black Hills {{south of}} Spearfish, South Dakota, is intruded {{in several places}} by Tertiary dikes, sills, and laccoliths. These rocks are predominately {{porphyritic}} phonolites and usually consist of a lath-like orthoclase groundmass with euhedral orthoclase and pyroxene phenocrysts. Anhedral feldspathoid crystals and pyroxene <b>microlites</b> (usually <b>microlites)</b> are invariably present in the groundmass. There is a trend for all mafic minerals to be sodic. The sanidine phenocrysts are frequently zoned and sometimes perthitic, and, along with the ground mass orthoclase, are significantly altered to sericite. The feldspathoids nepheline and sodalite comprise up to 35 % of the rock. There is no plagioclase except in rare perthitic phenocrysts. Ilmenite, analcite, calcite, and other accessory minerals are sometimes present, as are microscopic secondary hematite nodules. A difference in specific gravity of specimens collected from different levels within the intrusion suggests magmatic differentiation by gravity settling.

40|$|The Etna 122 BC basaltic {{eruption}} had two Plinian phases, each preceded {{and followed}} by weak phreatic and phreatomagmatic activity. This study infers changing eruption dynamics from density, grain size, and microtextural data from the erupted pyroclasts. The Plinian clasts show no evidence for quenching by external water; instead, all clasts are microvesicular and have high bubble number densities relative to the products of weaker basaltic explosive eruptions, suggesting that the 122 BC magma underwent coupled degassing linked to rapid ascent and decompression. This coupled degassing was probably enhanced by crystallization of abundant <b>microlites,</b> which increased the magma's effective viscosity during conduit ascent. Detailed measurements of vesicles and <b>microlites</b> show wide variations in number densities, size distributions, and shapes among clasts collected over narrow stratigraphic intervals. For such a diversity of clasts to be expelled together, portions of melt with contrasting ascent and degassing histories must have arrived at the fragmentation surface at essentially the same time. We suggest that a parabolic velocity profile across the conduit ensured that magma near the conduit walls ascended more slowly than magma along the axis, leading to a longer residence time and more advanced degrees of outgassing and crystallization in the marginal magma. In our model, accumulation of this outgassed, viscous magma along conduit walls reduced the effective radius of the shallow conduit and led to blockages that ended the Plinian phases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: On Kodiak Island (Alaska), decimeter-thick black fault rocks (BFR) are at {{the core}} of 10 's meters-thick foliated cataclasites. Cataclasites belong to mélanges {{regarded}} as paleo-décollement active at 12 - 14 km depth and 230 - 260 oC. Each black layer is mappable for tens of meters along strike. The BFR feature a complex layering made at microscale by alternation of granular and crystalline microtextures, composed of micron-scale sub-rounded quartz and plagioclase in an ultrafine, phyllosilicate-rich matrix. In the crystalline microlayers, tabular zoned <b>microlites</b> of plagioclase make much of the matrix. No such feldspars are found in the cataclasite. We interpret crystalline microlayers as pseudotachylytes. The granular microlayers show higher grain size variability, crushed <b>microlites</b> and textures typical of fluidization and granular flow deformation. Crosscutting relationships between granular and crystalline microlayers include flow and intrusion structures and mutual brittle truncation. This suggests that each 10 's centimeter-thick composite BFR record multiple pulses of seismic slip. In each pulse, ultracomminuted fluidized material and friction melt formed and deformed together in a ductile fashion. Brittle truncation by another pulse occurred after solidification of the friction melt and the fluidized rock. XRPD and XRF analyses show that BFR have similar mineral composition and chemical content as the cataclasites. The observed systematic chemical differences cannot be explained by bulk or preferential melting of any of the cataclasite components. The presence of an open, fluid-infiltrated system with BFR later alteration is suggested. The geochemical results indicate that these subduction-related pseudotachylytes, differ from those typically described in crystalline rocks and other tectonic settings...|$|R
