40|$|Ductus papillaris {{presents}} the frontline of {{defense of the}} mammary gland against the penetration of microorganisms into the <b>milk</b> <b>cystern</b> and the mammary gland parenchyma. The specific structure of ductus papillaris is in the stratum corneum which lines the ductus papillaris. It is a fine layer similar to wax of various thickness. The thickness of the stratum corneum depends on the age and breed of the animal, {{as well as on}} the number of past lactation periods. The stratum corneum or the keratin layer of the ductus papillaris has a bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect and prevents the ascendent penetration of microorganisms into the mammary gland. Measurements of the thickness of the keratin layer of ductus papillaris of each udder quarter revealed the existence of different thickness of the keratin layer. Histological examinations of parenchyma sections of each udder quarter showed different degrees of leukocytary infiltration. The degree of the leukocytary infiltration indicates the existence of various inflammatory processes in the parenchyma that occurred due to the weak frontline defense of the mammary gland against the penetration of microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|It seems well {{established}} that during normal lactation there passes a slight but well defined quantity of blood protein into the udder. When a specific serum precipitin {{is applied to}} diluted milk the reaction occurs at a relatively uniform level of dilution. This line may well be considered the normal level of blood protein elimination. In the main the serum protein level is the same when mastitis streptococci are present as when they are absent, provided they are not too numerous. On the other hand {{it has been shown}} that when streptococci are present in large numbers the milk while apparently normal reacts at dilutions considerably higher than the normal. In the non-lactating udder, particularly during the latter end of gestation, serum proteins accumulate. Little and Orcutt have shown that certain antibodies tend to become greatly concentrated within the udder. Howe and others have shown that the colostrum of cows is rich in blood proteins. It is to be noted, however, that colostrum while rich in serum proteins usually reacts with serum precipitin to about one-half the titer of the blood serum itself. It may well be that certain proteins of the blood passing into the acini are reabsorbed, leaving a portion of the antigen within the udder. Thus a gradual accumulation of antigen may occur. Shortly after parturition the udder may be drained with a consequent marked fall in serum content. There, however, apparently exists for the next few days considerable permeability of the capillaries for serum proteins. This is borne out by the reaction of the milk to the serum precipitin, since it may react above the normal level for as long as 10 days or 2 weeks after parturition. During the course of inflammation there may occur a considerable outpouring of blood protein. In the severe cases the exudate may give a titer at as great a dilution as the blood serum. In other milder cases where the inflammation may be confined only to the mucosa of the <b>milk</b> <b>cystern,</b> there is usually little that is abnormal in the appearance of the milk. The precipitin test, however, indicates that serum proteins are present in definitely greater concentration than in normal milk. Of practical interest is the effect of heating the milk on the reaction of serum precipitin. Milk heated to a temperature as high as 66 °C. for 20 minutes will react at the same dilutions as the raw milk. Milk pasteurized at 68 – 69 °C. for 20 minutes will no longer react. The precipitin test, then, affords a ready means of detecting milk heated above 68 – 69 °C. It is assumed that the precipitin test may have some further practical application. The evidence presented indicates a well defined serum proportion in the milk which may be increased during inflammation of the udder. The experiments in which mastitis exudate was mixed with varying quantities of market milk indicate that such mixtures can readily be detected with serum precipitin. It seems not improbable that some such procedure might be applied as a presumptive test to the product of small herds or to the mixed milk of a number of cows...|$|E
40|$|Aside {{from the}} streptococci, {{micrococci}} {{have been the}} next most frequent group of organisms isolated from inflamed udders. They produce various types of disease. Some give rise to only a mild catarrh of the larger <b>milk</b> ducts and <b>cystern,</b> while others produce more or less severe parenchymatous inflammation. On the whole, the prognosis is more favorable with micrococcic infection than with that associated with streptococci. Cases of considerable severity have, however, been attributed to staphylococci. Micrococci similar in many respects to those associated with mastitis {{have been found to}} occur in the normal udder. This has led Savage to question their true etiological significance. In many instances micrococci may gain access to the udder and produce slight disturbances that are entirely overlooked. Even more severe changes may follow infection. After recovery the organisms still remain in the milk. This was observed in the case of Cow 60 infected with staphylococci. One frequently observes the elimination of streptococci from the udder even after apparent recovery from an attack of streptococcic mastitis. Doubtless streptococci and micrococci observed in these udders would be classed as belonging to the normal flora. Even though micrococci do occur in supposedly normal udders Evans has shown that many are pathogenic for rabbits. The introduction of these organisms into the udders of non-resistant individuals might well give rise to more or less intense inflammation. The multiplication would doubtless be rapid until resistance had been established. In addition to the micrococci two other groups of rod-shaped organisms have been found associated with udder inflammation. In two instances Bacillus coli has been isolated from cases of mastitis and in another Bacillus lactis aerogenes. In four, tiny motile Gramstaining microorganisms have been obtained in pure culture. Two of these strains (Nos. C. 79 and M. 44) have been identified as Bacillus pyogenes...|$|R
