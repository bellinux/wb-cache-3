25|$|A {{multimeter}} or a multitester, {{also known}} as a VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter), is an electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit. A typical multimeter can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Analog multimeters use a <b>microammeter</b> with a moving pointer to display readings. Digital multimeters (DMM, DVOM) have a numeric display, and may also show a graphical bar representing the measured value. Digital multimeters are now far more common due to their cost and precision, but analog multimeters are still preferable in some cases, for example when monitoring a rapidly varying value.|$|E

50|$|An ammeter (from Ampere Meter) is a {{measuring}} instrument {{used to measure}} the current in a circuit. Electric currents are measured in amperes (A), hence the name. Instruments used to measure smaller currents, in the milliampere or microampere range, are designated as milliammeters or <b>microammeters.</b> Early ammeters were laboratory instruments which relied on the Earth's magnetic field for operation. By the late 19th century, improved instruments were designed which could be mounted in any position and allowed accurate measurements in electric power systems.|$|R
5000|$|Analogue S meters are {{actually}} sensitive <b>microammeters,</b> {{with a full}} scale deflection of 50 to 100 μA. In AM receivers, the S meter can {{be connected to the}} main detector or use a separate detector at the final IF stage. This is the preferred method for CW and SSB receivers. Another approach in the days of electronic tubes (valves) was to connect the S meter to the screen grid circuit of the final IF amplifier tube. A third option is to connect the S meter to the AGC line through a suitable level conversion circuit.|$|R

40|$|This study {{discusses}} the variations of photoelectric current with intensity of light. The photoelectric effect {{is dependent upon}} various factors including frequency of light, intensity of light, nature of material, energy of light and potential difference. However, even if the photoelectric effect is caused, the photoelectric current which is produced {{as a result of}} it may vary if intensity of light is changed, provided that frequency of illumination is greater than threshold frequency. To determine the impact of changing light intensity on photoelectric effect while keeping the other factors constant, an experiment was performed. The impact was seen by changing the distance of light source from photocell and the recording the readings on <b>Microammeter.</b> The correlation and graphical analysis was done to draw the results. The correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship between photoelectric current and intensity of light. The graphical analysis also highlighted a positive linear relationship.

The circuits are easily constructed and simple to operate. Three types of circuits have been tested out and are described. (1) A simple single-tube circuit with a Type R galvanometer has been found satisfactory for measurements of currents as small as 10 ^- 14 amp. (2) A two-tube bridge circuit gives greater stability and will easily measure currents of 10 ^- 16 amp. It has been found capable of detecting currents of 5 × 10 ^- 18 amp.

40|$|This {{instrument}} {{is designed for}} the detection and measurement {{of a group of}} ionizing radiations. Interchangeable ionization chambers have been constructed for the measurement of (1) beta and gamma radiations, (2) surface and hand monitoring of alpha radiations, (3) alpha and beta radiation of dust samples collected in precipitron tubes, and (4) fast neutrons. Moderate to high radiation intensities are measured by direct continuous deflection of a <b>microammeter</b> indicating changes in plate current of a 1 LN 5 tube used as an electrometer tube. Low intensities of radiation are measured by allowing the charge due to the ionization current to collect on one plate of a condenser. The other plate connects to the grid of the electrometer tube and to ground through a high resistance. During the period of charge collection the two condenser plates are electrically shielded from one another by a grounded metal vane inserted between them. On removing this vane the charge on the first plate of the condenser is communicated to the second plate and thus to the tube grid. A transient meter deflection then occurs proportional to the product of ionization current and ion collection time. A two pole, triple throw switch allows the output meter to be connected in test 1 position to measure screen grid current, in test 2 position to set tube voltages to reproducible values, and in "Operate" position to measure changes in plate current.

40|$|The Leakage Current Sentinel (LCS) {{has been}} {{designed}} and implemented {{for the detection of}} hazardous situations caused by dangerous earth leakage current values in intensive care units and operating theaters. The device, designed and manufactured with full compliance of the high risk environment requirements, is able to monitor online the earth leakage current and detect ground wire faults. Operation utilizes a <b>microammeter</b> with an overall sensitivity of 2. 5 x 10 (4) V/A. In order to assure the reliability of the device in providing alarm signals, the simultaneous presence of absorbed power current is monitored by means of another ammeter with decreased sensitivity (3. 0 V/A). The measured root mean square current values are compared with reference values in order to send signals to NAND and OR complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor gates to enable audible and visible alarms according to the possible hazardous cases examined in the article. The final LCS packaging was shaped as a wall socket adapter for common electromedical device power cord plugs, with particular attention to minimizing its dimensions and to provide analog voltage outputs for both measured leakage and power currents, in order to allow automatic data acquisition and computerized hazardous situation management. Finally, a personal computer based automatic measuring system has been configured to simultaneously monitor several LCSs installed in the same intensive care unit room and, as a consequence, to distinguish different hazardous scenarios and provide an adequate alert to the clinical personnel whose final decision is still required. The test results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the LCS in giving an alert in case of leakage current anomalous values, either in case of a ground fault or in case of a dangerous leakage current...|$|E
40|$|A simple microcomputer-basedd ata {{acquisition}} systemi s {{set up to}} obtain the I-V characteristic of the Langmuir probe. The system is ideal for extensive probe data collection {{in the study of}} steadystate plasmas. The Langmuir probe is a simple but effective tool for the diagnostic of fairly large volume, relatively cold and low density plasmas. F rom the I-V. characteristico f the probe, plasmap arameters such ag the electron temperature, electron density, space potential and electron energy distribution can be deduced. For a time-varying plasma, the pulsed Langmuir probera must be used. In the case of a steady-state plasma, it is usually sufficient to use the point-by-point technique, although the pulsed method can also be employed. However, the process of obtaining the Langmuir probe characteristic by the point-by-point method and its analysis is tedious and time-consuming if it is done manually. This is particularly true in casesw here the Langmuir probe is employeda s a basicd iagnostic and extensived ata are required to be collectedc oncurrently with other diagnosticso f the plasma. In this note, a simple microcomputer-basedd {{ata acquisition}} systemf or the Langmuir probe is described. The system employs an Apple-II microcomputer to control the variation of the probe's bias potential as well as to monitor the probe curent automatically. The data acquisition system consists of a 64 k RAM Apple-II micrommputer which is supported by a high-resolution CRT display unit; two mini floppy diskdrives and a dot matrix printer with highresolution graphic capability (Fig. l). Data acquisition is done via a multi-channel A/D + D/A interface card (Mountain Computer Inc.) which can be plugged directly into the expansion slot of the Apple-II. This interface card provides 16 cannelse ach of analog-todigital and digital-to-analogc onverters.
