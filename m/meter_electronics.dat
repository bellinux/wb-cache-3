50|$|Thermal {{mass flow}} meters, {{also known as}} thermal {{dispersion}} or immersible mass flow meters comprise a family of instruments for the measurement of the total mass flow rate of a fluid, primarily gases, flowing through closed conduits. A second type is the capillary-tube type of {{thermal mass flow meter}}. Many mass flow controllers (MFC) which combine a mass flow <b>meter,</b> <b>electronics</b> and a valve are based on this design. Furthermore, a thermal mass flow meter can be built by measuring temperature differential across a silicon-based MEMS chip.|$|E

The cultures were used for Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and culture of micro flora obtained spontaneous shoots. Lactic fermented juice was obtained from cabbage, carrots and beetroot. Working in these variants were determined lactic fermentation parameters {{and some of the}} bioactive compounds from this process: pH, reducing sugars, viable cell counts. Determination of reducing sugars calculated as glucose was conducted using the 3. 5 dinitrosalicilic acid method (DNS method), pH was determined with a pH <b>meter</b> <b>electronics.</b> Chemical parameters listed were determined every two hours during the first 24 hours, then 48 and 72 hours in thermostatic conditions at 37 degrees C and 7 days storage at refrigerator temperature. At the end of the lactic fermentation, the lowest pH 4. 31, which also provide juice conservation was obtained using a pure culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus. Reducing sugar is metabolized significantly when the juice of beetroot, fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus culture, 75. 19 %. The results may be an argument for obtaining juice fermented lactic acid, which are popular functional foods, to obtain a chemical composition and sensory their optimum...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Electro 35 {{was introduced}} in 1966. It has a [...] "cold" [...] accessory shoe and the meter accepted film speeds from 12 to 400 ASA. Light levels are measured using a cadmium sulphide (CdS) photoresistor and powered by a mercury battery. The film speed adjustment is not implemented electronically; instead, a simple twin-bladed diaphragm closes {{in front of the}} light sensor as the film speed is reduced. The light <b>metering</b> <b>electronics</b> works by accumulating the measured light level and only releasing the shutter when it has determined enough light has fallen on the film. This system allows the shutter speed to be completely step-less and to adapt to changing light levels. SLRs would wait many years for a similar capability with off-the-film metering. The metering system can keep the shutter open for up to 30 seconds. Without a battery to power the meter, the shutter defaults to its top speed of 1/500 second.|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of information, communication, and {{fabrication}} technologies is driving the semiconductor industry to unprecedented levels [1 - 2], flooding the market with an extensive array of novel consumer, medical, and industrial electronic devices [3]. Emerging portable micro-power applications like sensors, <b>meters,</b> GPS, implantable <b>electronics,</b> and others continue to push technology to cater to small, long lasting, low cost, and fully integrated solutions, fueling the demand for system-on-chip (SoC) and system-in-package (SiP) integration. The semiconductor industry has responded to this demand by increasing the functional density of integrated circuits (ICs), promising to integrate most of the microelectronics necessary to support a system into a single chip. Some of the most notable SoC and SiP challenges of today still include the integration of power passive and active components (e. g., power inductors, capacitors, and transistors) and radio-frequency (RF), broadband-frequency, and power technologies into a single chip, but nothing compares to the limitations of integrating batteries and power sources into the chip, which, if successful, would reduce weight, shrink size, increase mobility, and hopefully extend operation life. Outside of housekeeping functions, there are three basic functional blocks to a system: power source, energy storage devices, and loading applications. For a cellular phone, for instance, the ac-power outlet is the power source, the battery the energy-storage device, and the transceiver one of its loading applications. Thes...|$|R
40|$|Internationalisation {{has long}} been a focus of {{research}} among international business scholars. However, there is little knowledge about Chinese firms' internationalisation processes. This study is {{based on the premise that}} Chinese firms may have different international behaviours, compared to Western firms, given China's distinctive institutional and cultural environments. To test this argument, this thesis examines Chinese firms' internationalisation rationales, approaches and influential factors. It focuses on small and medium-sized privately-owned enterprises (POEs) that are actively engaged in international operations. Interviews were conducted with decision makers of six POEs from four industries, including the telecommunications networks, <b>electronics,</b> <b>meters,</b> and textiles. These firms were located in Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. The data collected were analysed using within-case and cross-case analysis approaches. Findings were then compared to extant literature, including the Uppsala's internationalisation process model (U-model) and the theory associated with international new ventures (INVs). The findings presented here indicate that the Chinese POEs' internationalisation behaviours are not particularly different from their Western counterparts. Even though neither the U-model nor the INVs framework alone could fully capture the complexities of the Chinese POEs' internationalisation processes, both demonstrate their applicability in different ways. The study develops 15 propositions that should enable researchers to develop a better understanding of Chinese POEs' internationalisation processes. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for theory development and future research, as well as managerial implications. This case study contributes to a wider theoretical understanding of Chinese POEs' internationalisation behaviours...|$|R
