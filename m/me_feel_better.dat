According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>better.</b> It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first.

2500|$|Steele {{stated in}} a 2003 {{interview}} that he was bipolar, and linked his mood swings to the types of songs he wrote. He also suffered from clinical depression {{for which he had}} received occasional psychiatric treatment. During a 2007 interview Steele explained:"I've always been a very depressed person, but that's only one side of me, you know.

She explained, [...] "It {{was something very}} raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> to share my feelings with people who could connect, and I {{think that is what}} happened with many." ...|$|E

2500|$|In affidavits, Fletcher {{wrote that}} she has almost no memory of her {{childhood}} up {{until the age of}} 14. [...] She explained that her writing started out just for her and was cathartic because she had been sexually abused as a child. “At first I would capture a particular feeling of dread and try to weave it into a scenario that explained the feeling", she wrote. [...] Fletcher described what she called her [...] "monsters":"I have always been afraid of monsters. The monsters in my life had always been real; for too long they were always there with unlimited access to me, and I was helpless to do anything about it. In my stories, I have created new monsters.

I think that’s probably true—at least I always did (work in that style). I thought that was a big failing of mine, that I couldn’t emulate that kind of photographic reproduction style. When I read that this seemed to be a characteristic of women cartoonists, it made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> a bit <b>better</b> about it. … Something that always jarred my eyes is to see the kind of heaviness and ugliness about most comic art. There’s not much sweetness to it. It’s the tradition, and I don’t think it {{has anything to do with}} the individual artists. It’s just the tradition…the look. That always troubled me.|$|R

Early to bed! Our wildest sitting up was nine o'clock. Eight o'clock was our regular bed-time. It saved kerosene. We did not eat dinner at Nahala--remember the great table at Kilohana where we did have dinner? But Husband George and I had supper. And then he would sit close to the lamp on one side the table and read old {{borrowed}} magazines for an hour, while I sat {{on the other side}} and darned his socks and underclothing. He always wore such cheap, shoddy stuff. And when he went to bed, I went to bed. No wastage of kerosene with only one to benefit by it. And he went to bed always the same way, winding up his watch, entering the day's weather in his diary, and taking off his shoes, right foot first invariably, left foot second, and placing them just so, side by side, on the floor, at the foot of the bed, on his side.|$|R
