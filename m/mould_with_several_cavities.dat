40|$|Camera Based Document Analysis (CBDA) is an {{emerging}} field in computer vision and pattern recognition. In recent days, cameras are <b>moulded</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> items of additional equipment. Thus, {{they play a}} vital role in the replacement of scanners with hand-held imaging devices (HIDs) like digital cameras, mobile phones and gaming devices. Warping is a common appearance in camera captured document images. It is the primary factor that makes such kind of document images hard to be recognized. Therefore it is necessary to restore warped document images before recognition. This paper presents a novel methodology to dewarp text from camera-captured warped images by co-ordinate transform model. Further, the extracted text from the warped and other document images will be recognized by maintaining a suitable database of all letters and numbers and converted into an editable form such as Notepad or as a MS Word document. The experimental results will be evaluated using a novel method to authenticate the methodology designed. Extensive experiments have been carried out on distinct documents and results are tabulated. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Mobile light scatterers in a high-Q {{optical cavity}} {{transversely}} illuminated by laser light {{close to a}} cavity resonance form ordered patterns, which maximize light scattering into the cavity and induce optical self-trapping. We show that a generalized form of such crystallization dynamics appears in multicolored pump fields <b>with</b> <b>several</b> <b>cavity</b> modes. Here the particles arrange in spatial patterns maximizing total light collection into the resonator. For changing input frequencies and strengths the particles dynamically adapt to the current illumination. Interestingly the system keeps some memory on past configurations, so that a later renewed application of the same pattern exhibits faster adaptation towards optimal collective scattering. In a noisy environment particles explore larger regions of configuration space spending {{most of the time}} close to optimum scattering configurations. This adaptive self-ordering dynamics should be implementable {{in a wide range of}} systems ranging from cold atoms in multimode cavities or nano-fiber traps to molecules or mobile nano-particles within an optical resonator.

40|$|Cavity-nesting birds {{can save}} time and energy by reusing old cavities. We studied cavity reuse and its {{connections}} to nesting success and timing in the three-toed woodpecker Picoides tridactylus in a 170 -km(2) area in southern Finland during 1987 - 2015. The data include 520 nest trees, 645 nest cavities and 833 nestings in 86 territory sites, including 211 cases of cavity reuse. Twenty-five percent of nestings was in previously used cavities. Twenty-eight percent of cavities and 25 % of nest trees were used more than once. Reuse improved nesting success and facilitated early nesting in the year following first nesting. Reuse of nest trees <b>with</b> <b>several</b> <b>cavities</b> was observed in 15 % of nest trees, and 62 % of reused cavities were in those multi-cavity trees. Cavity reuse and multi-cavity trees were most abundant in long-term territories with stable habitats.

40|$|During the hot {{pressing}} of glass (e. g. precision glass molding, hot embossing) form deviations between the tool geometry and the manufactured glass formed part arise. Reasons for it are different thermal expansion {{behavior of the}} materials and technological parameters. The form deviation resulting from these measured variables gains more and more significance with a rising scale of miniaturization. For the hot embossing of flat glass substrates <b>with</b> <b>several</b> <b>cavities</b> (e. g. micro lens arrays, microfluidic components) at the Fraunhofer IWU a method was developed, {{in order to determine}} the total form deviation with the help of uncomplex shaped dies experimentally. The obtained accuracy is sufficient in order to correct ordinary optical geometries, like spherical cavities, or the pitch of V-grooves and channel structures respectively. For different tool materials and inorganic glasses according to this method correction factors were determined to compensate the process-immanent form deviation. In this way complex iteration steps in the manufacturing of the tool molds can be minimized...|$|R

In recent technology camera are <b>moulded</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> equipments {{and are very}} interesting and playing a vital role by replacing scanner with hand held imaging devices(HIDs) like Digital Cameras, Mobile phones and gaming devices. Documents captured through Mobile are often prone to Skew Removal of graphics and Correction of skew for Mobile captured document is a major task and important factor in optical character recognition. The goal {{of the work is}} to remove graphics from the document and correct skew for the documents captured using cellular phone. In this paper we have proposed a novel method for separating or removal of graphics like logos, animations other than the text from the document and finally textual content skew is corrected and characters are recognized using commercial OCR. The basic process of our approach consists of three steps: First, a vertical and Horizontal projection is used to remove graphics from images secondly dilation operation is applied to the binary Images and the dilated Image is thinned; finally, the skew angle is detected using the Hough transform. The proposed approach with high precision can detect skew with large angle (- 90 to + 90) the experimental result reveal that the proposed method is efficient compared to well known existing methods. The experimental results show the efficacy compared to the result of well known existing methods...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic cavity modes in {{photonic}} and plasmonic resonators offer {{rich and}} attractive regimes for tailoring {{the properties of}} light−matter interactions, {{yet there is a}} disturbing lack of a precise definition for what constitutes a cavity mode, and as a result their mathematical properties remain largely unspecified. The lack of a definition is evidenced in part by the diverse nomenclature at use, “resonance”, “leaky mode”, and “quasimode”, to name but a few, suggesting that the dissipative nature of cavity modes somehow makes them different from other modes, but an explicit distinction is rarely made. This Perspective aims to introduce the reader to some of the subtleties and working definitions that can be rigorously applied when describing the modal properties of leaky optical cavities and plasmonic nanoresonators. We describe some recent developments in the field, including calculation methods for quasinormal modes of both photonic and plasmonic resonators and the concept of a generalized effective mode volume, and we illustrate the theory <b>with</b> <b>several</b> representative <b>cavity</b> structures from the fields of photonic crystals and nanoplasmonics...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} are crystalline molecular complexes {{formed from}} mixtures {{of water and}} suitably sized gas molecules. Based on hydrogen bonding, water molecules form unstable lattice structures <b>with</b> <b>several</b> interstitial <b>cavities.</b> The gas molecules can occupy the lattice cavities and, when a minimum number of cavities are occupied, the crystalline structure becomes stable and solid gas hydrates are formed, even at temperatures well above the ice point[ll. The known gas hydrate structures are; structure-I, structure-II, and the recently discovered structure-H[2]. The necessary condition for hydrate formation {{is the presence of}} water or ice, suitably sized non-polar or slightly polar molecules, together with appropriate pressure and temperature conditions. In subsea environments, the sediments are normally saturated with sea water and a combination of the geothermal gradient and the weight of the column of water (which causes a hydrostatic pressure) could provide the right conditions for hydrate formation. Under these conditions, gas released from biogenic activities (or seepage from oil and gas reservoirs) could form gas hydrates. Current estimates show that the amount of energy in the ga...|$|R

40|$|The CLIC {{polarized}} electron {{source is}} based on a DC gun where the photocathode is illuminated by a laser beam. Each micro-bunch has a charge of 6 x 109 e−, a width of 100 ps and a repetition rate of 2 GHz. A peak current of 10 A in the micro-bunch is a challenge for the surface charge limit of the photo-cathode. Two options are feasible to generate the 2 GHz e− bunch train: 100 ps micro-bunches can be extracted from the photo-cathode either by a 2 GHz laser system or by generating a macro-bunch using a ~ 200 ns laser pulse and a subsequent RF bunching system to produce the appropriate micro-bunch structure. Recent results obtained by SLAC, for the latter case, are presented. The polarized positron source {{is based on}} a positron production scheme in which polarized photons are produced by a laser Compton scattering process. The resulting circularly-polarized gamma photons are sent onto a target, producing pairs of longitudinally polarized electrons and positrons. The Compton backscattering process occurs either in a Compton ring, where a 1 GeV electron beam interacts with circularly-polarized photons in an optical resonator or in a 1. 8 GeV Compton Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) or in a 6 GeV Linac <b>with</b> <b>several</b> optical <b>cavities.</b> The undulator scheme is also studied.
