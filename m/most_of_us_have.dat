40|$|In the {{discussion}} board {{portion of a}} website, I recently read a message with a similar subject title by a producer. This question is also one producers in the North Central Region are asking because of the light occurrence of soybean rust this past season. Development of the disease was surprisingly slower than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> anticipated. In this article, I will address the questions raised by producers by reviewing what we learned this past growing season, which was summarized during the National Soybean Rust Symposium held last month...|$|R
40|$|Marxist {{theory has}} by now largely {{abandoned}} the (seriously flawed) {{notion of the}} ‘mode of production’, but doing so has only encouraged a trend to abandon much of what was radical about it and naturalize capitalist categories. This article argues a better conceived notion of a mode of production - one that recognizes the primacy of human production, and hence a more sophisticated notion of materialism - might still have something to show us: notably, that capitalism, or at least industrial capitalism, has far more in common with, and is historically more closely linked with, chattel slavery than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever imagined...|$|R

5000|$|According to novelist, {{short story}} writer and {{columnist}} Intezar Husain, [...] "Mushfiq Khwaja {{has done a}} great job. He has managed to pull out a poetic genius from the oblivion where he had been pushed by his hostile contemporaries. They saw to it that he was personally humiliated as a poet. His uncompromising attitude in respect of his literary opinions and his unorthodox thinking in matters of religion made their task easy. While still alive, he was consigned to the grave along with his poetry. His poetic work remained unpublished. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> heard <b>of</b> him only as a crackpot with no respect for the greats of Urdu poetry." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} {{afterwards}} our long-talked-of excursion to Gunong Sari took place. Our party was increased by {{the captain and}} supercargo of a Hamburg ship loading with rice for China. We were mounted on a very miscellaneous lot of Lombock ponies, which we had some difficulty in supplying with the necessary saddles, etc.; and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> to patch up our girths, bridles, or stirrup-leathers as best we could. We passed through Mataram, where we were joined by our friend Gusti Gadioca, mounted on a handsome black horse, and riding as all the natives do, without saddle or stirrups, using only a handsome saddlecloth and very ornamental bridle.|$|R
60|$|Here they {{attacked}} us again. The great drum on the teocalli beat {{for the last}} time, {{and for the last}} time the wild scream of the Aztec warriors went up to heaven. We fought our best; I killed four men that day with my arrows which Otomie, who was at my side, handed me as I shot. But the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> not the strength of a child, and what could we do? They came among us like seamen among a flock of seals, and slaughtered us by hundreds. They drove us into the canals and trod us to death there, till bridges were made of our bodies. How we escaped I do not know.|$|R
60|$|But {{it is by}} {{no means}} in {{externals}} only that the two religions are alike. If the first glance at them awakens that peculiar sensation which <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> felt at some time or other, a sense of having seen all this before, further scrutiny reveals a deeper agreement than merely in appearances.|$|E

60|$|Doctor Portman, {{glancing over}} the letter, {{thought he knew}} the handwriting, and, of course, was already acquainted with the charge made against poor Pen. Against his own conscience, perhaps (for the worthy Doctor, like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>had</b> a {{considerable}} natural aptitude for receiving any report unfavourable to his neighbours), he strove to console Helen; {{he pointed out that}} the slander came from an anonymous quarter, and therefore must be the work of a rascal; that the charge might not be true--was not true, most likely--at least, that Pen must be heard before he was condemned; that the son of such a mother was not likely to commit such a crime, etc. etc.|$|R

"You {{have not}} spoken of your luck, Mr. Powis," [...] added Mr. Effingham; [...] "I trust you have fared {{as well as}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> though <b>had</b> they visited their enemies {{according}} to the injury received from them, you would be among the heaviest of the sufferers." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the first}} time that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> met the portly, florid aristocrat...we hardly knew what to expect: he hadn't exactly sprung to mind as a front-running {{candidate}} for the job. It was a black-tie affair, of course, and none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> dared get drunk. Eventually, over the port, the Duke rose, cleared his throat and delivered himself of a sentence I shall treasure till the end of my days: [...] "Gentlemen", he said, [...] "I wish this to be an entirely informal tour. You will merely address me as 'Sir'". The grand old duke is dead now, alas, but he loved that tour of Australia more than any other official duty he had ever undertaken in his auspicious public life...I could write a whole volume on the Duke Down Under.:Ian Wooldridge ...|$|R
60|$|Bessie {{took the}} letter, which {{was wrapped in}} a piece of old newspaper, from the cleft of the stick and turned it over and over doubtfully. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> a mistrust of strange-looking letters, and this letter was unusually strange. To begin it, with had no address {{whatever}} on the dirty envelope, which seemed curious. In the second place, that envelope was sealed, apparently with a threepenny bit.|$|E

"Well," [...] said Headingly, {{with his}} slow, {{deliberate}} manner, [...] "I won't {{say that we}} have not our tiffs, and there are some of our people--mostly of Irish stock--who are always mad with England; but the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> a kindly thought for the mother country. You see they may be aggravating folk sometimes, but after all they are our own folk, and we can't wipe that off the slate." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{captain had}} {{committed}} an error of which <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> been guilty in our time. He {{had been too}} exclusively devoted to work that interested him to remember what {{was due to the}} care of his health. The doctor's warnings had been neglected; his over-strained nerves had given way; and the man whose strong constitution had resisted cold and starvation in the Arctic wastes, had broken down under stress of brain-work in London.|$|E
6000|$|... "Once, only, I {{was told}} to hand over any money I had in the house. As, fortunately, I {{had only a few}} pounds I gave it up without making a fight for it.

6000|$|Melville, I think, {{said nothing}} to that. He was distracted from the {{immediate}} topic by the discussion of his own way of living. He was lost in egotistical comparisons.

6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "we {{must choose}} the four who shall carry the message. I said those most sorely wounded, but since four are to go they can care little who are chosen. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> lost those we love, {{but there are}} some whose wives may have been {{elsewhere}} when the attack was made.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "Ormsgill {{is rather}} {{a friend of}} mine, {{and what you have}} been telling me is {{certainly}} the kind of thing one would expect from him.

6000|$|... "Why not, indeed?" [...] Draconmeyer assented heartily. [...] "The <b>most</b> serious <b>of</b> <b>us</b> must <b>have</b> our {{frivolous}} moments. I {{hope that}} you will dine with us to-night? We shall be quite alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know much}} about your Slav and other kin, except that they are good workers and strong; but I {{do know that the}} white man is the {{greatest}} and best breed in the world. Take the Indian, for instance. The white man comes along and beats him at all his games, outworks him, out-roughs him, out-fishes him, out-hunts him. As far back as their myths go, the Alaskan Indians have packed on their backs. But the gold-rushers, as soon as they had learned the tricks of the trade, packed greater loads and packed them farther than did the Indians. Why, last May, the Queen's birthday, we had sports on the river. In the one, two, three, four, and five men canoe races we beat the Indians right and left. Yet they had been born to the paddle, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> never seen a canoe until man-grown." ...|$|R
60|$|Have {{you ever}} had a {{difference}} with a dear friend? How his letters, written in the period of love and confidence, sicken and rebuke you! What a dreary mourning it is to dwell upon those vehement protests of dead affection! What lying epitaphs they make over the corpse of love! What dark, cruel comments upon Life and Vanities! <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> got or written drawers full of them. They are closet-skeletons which we keep and shun. Osborne trembled long before the letter from his dead son.|$|E
60|$|The {{majority}} of us, I apprehend, profess neither pessimism nor optimism. We hold {{that the world}} is neither so good, nor so bad, as it conceivably might be; and, as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> reason, now and again, to discover that it can be. Those who have failed to experience the joys that make life worth living are, probably, in as small a minority as those who have never known the griefs that rob existence of its savour and turn its richest fruits into mere dust and ashes.|$|E
60|$|If {{the time}} given to {{education}} permits, add Latin and German. Latin, {{because it is}} the key to nearly one-half of English and to all the Romance languages; and German, {{because it is the}} key to almost all the remainder of English, and helps you to understand a race from whom <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> sprung, and who have a character and a literature of a fateful force {{in the history of the}} world, such as probably has been allotted to those of no other people, except the Jews, the Greeks, and ourselves.|$|E

But some boys in the book [...] "Two Sides Of Hell/Los Dos Lados Del Infierno" [...] were still very depressed and, in many cases, were getting worse all the time. Of course, we were very fed up with wearing the same clothes for so many days, going without a shower, being so cold, eating badly. It was too many things together, quite apart from our natural fear of the war, the shelling and all that. But I think some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were adapting better than others. There were kids who were very worried; and I tried to buoy them up a bit. Dont worry, I told them. Nothing will happen, were safe here. Dont you see they could never get right up here?

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{with one}} detractor. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] {{and called it}} his [...] "favorite episode of season seven" [...] and that he wished that [...] "it had been the series finale" [...] for The X-Files. VanDerWerff argued that the episode possessed a [...] "warmth and tenderness" [...] that was missing from the following two seasons, after Duchovny left the series as a full-time star. He concluded that [...] "the genius of 'Je Souhaite' lies in how it embraces the inherent weirdness of the world this show is set in." [...] Rob Bricken from Topless Robot named [...] "Je Souhaite" [...] the second most funny X-Files episode, writing, [...] "Best line: When Scully, ever the skeptic, begins trying to rationalize her examination of an invisible body, Mulder replies with an exasperated, 'Oh!' It's what <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> been thinking for years about Scully's refusal to acknowledge all the strange crap she had seen." ...|$|R
