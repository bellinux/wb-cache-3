5|$|Ann <b>Marten</b> {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas <b>Marten</b> then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George <b>Marten</b> revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E

Mark Eyskens became the 45th Prime Minister of Belgium on 6 April 1981, an office his father had held six times. His {{government}} quickly collapsed on 17 December, due to disagreements on the financing of the Walloon steel industry. After the fall of his government he served as Minister for Economical Affairs (1981-1985, <b>Martens</b> V) and Minister of Finance (1985-1988, <b>Martens</b> VI & <b>Martens</b> VII). Although originally {{not a member of}} the <b>Martens</b> VIII cabinet, on 19 June 1989 he re-entered the government when he replaced Leo Tindemans as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1989-1992, <b>Martens</b> VIII & <b>Martens</b> IX). This was the last government office he held. He served as a backbencher 1992-2003 and retired at the 2003 general election.|$|R

5|$|In March 1826, {{when she}} was 24, she formed a {{relationship}} with the 22-year-old William Corder. <b>Marten</b> was an attractive woman and relationships with men from the neighbourhood had already resulted in two children. One died as an infant, the child of William's older brother Thomas, but the other, Thomas Henry, was still alive at the time when Corder met her. Thomas Henry's father, Peter Matthews, did not marry <b>Marten</b> but regularly sent money to provide for the child.|$|E

5|$|Corder {{wished to}} keep his {{relationship}} with <b>Marten</b> a secret, but {{she gave birth to}} their child in 1827 at the age of 25, and she was apparently keen that she and Corder should marry. The child died (later reports suggested that it may have been murdered), but Corder apparently still intended to marry <b>Marten.</b> That summer, in the presence of her stepmother, Ann <b>Marten,</b> he suggested that she meet him at the Red Barn, from where he proposed that they elope to Ipswich. Corder claimed that he had heard rumours that the parish officers were going to prosecute Maria for having bastard children. He initially suggested that they elope on the Wednesday evening, but later decided to delay until the Thursday evening. On Thursday, he was again delayed; his brother falling ill is mentioned as the reason in some sources, although most claim that all his brothers were dead by this time. On Friday, 18 May 1827, he appeared at the Martens' cottage during the day and, according to Ann <b>Marten,</b> he told Maria that they must leave at once, as he had heard that the local constable had obtained a warrant to prosecute her (no warrant had been obtained, but it is not known if Corder was lying or was mistaken). Maria was worried that she could not leave in broad daylight, but Corder told her that she should dress in men's clothing so as to avert suspicion, and he would carry her things to the barn where she could meet him and change before they continued on to Ipswich.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{received}} private tuition {{in constitutional}} history from Henry <b>Marten,</b> Vice-Provost of Eton College, and learned French from {{a succession of}} native-speaking governesses. A Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company, was formed specifically {{so that she could}} socialise with girls her own age. Later, she was enrolled as a Sea Ranger.|$|E
5|$|Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 {{terrestrial}} vertebrate {{species and}} 28 fish species. The most common large animals are mule deer and elk, but other mammals present include moose, black bears, cougar, coyote, yellow-bellied marmot, beaver, porcupine, Canadian lynx, mountain goat, pika, river otter, muskrat, pronghorn, mink, bobcat, <b>marten,</b> and timber wolves.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the animals}} in the spruce-fir forest have ranges that extend into the balsam fir forest higher up. Warblers are abundant; more than ten species exist in this forest type. Other common birds include brown-capped chickadees, spruce grouse, and yellow-capped woodpeckers. Mammals include the red {{squirrel}} and the pine <b>marten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{elevation}} and level of precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines, including ponderosa and lodgepole pines, as well as spruces. Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pine <b>marten,</b> and mountain lions, while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.|$|E
5|$|Further rumours {{circulated}} {{about the}} death of Corder and Marten's child. Both claimed that they had taken their dead child to be buried in Sudbury, but no records of this could be discovered and no trace was found of the child's burial site. In his written confession, Corder admitted that he and <b>Marten</b> had argued {{on the day of the}} murder over the possibility of the burial site being discovered.|$|E

5|$|Meshuggah is a Swedish {{experimental}} {{metal and}} death metal quintet formed in 1987 in Umeå. Meshuggah {{is known for}} its use of extended polymetric passages, complex time signatures, dissonant guitar riffs, and harsh vocals. As of 2008, the band consists of vocalist Jens Kidman, guitarists Fredrik Thordendal and <b>Mårten</b> Hagström, bassist Dick Lövgren and drummer Tomas Haake.|$|E
5|$|Several {{bird species}} prey on grey jays, {{including}} great grey owls (Strix nebulosa), northern hawk-owls (Surnia ulula), and Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida). Grey jay remains {{have been recovered}} from the lairs of fisher (Martes pennanti) and American <b>marten</b> (Martes americana). Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) eat grey jay eggs. Grey jays alert each other to threats by whistling alarm notes, screaming, chattering, or imitating and/or mobbing predators.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech <b>marten.</b> The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine <b>marten</b> and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E

5|$|The area {{shares a}} common brown bear {{population}} with Norway and Russia. Other predators include red fox, stoat, pine <b>marten</b> and the rare wolverine and Eurasian lynx. The gray wolf was common until the 1940s. There {{is also a}} large population of moose. Inari–Pasvik has a shared population of 6,000 reindeer, which are herded to different areas depending on the season. Fences have been installed to hinder reindeer from wandering across the national borders.|$|E
5|$|The {{great spotted cuckoo}} (Clamator glandarius) {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw, depositing its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel. Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, tawny owl, and least weasel (Mustela nivalis) in England, and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Finland. The European pine <b>marten</b> (Martes martes) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests {{are part of a}} colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{was able to}} quickly replace lost birds – {{there is a high}} proportion of non-breeding, non-territorial birds able to fill vacant territories. The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey; gamekeepers' more successful efforts to wipe out the northern goshawk and pine <b>marten</b> – predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk – may have benefited it. The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed, for example during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
