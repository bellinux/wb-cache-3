40|$|This paper {{describes}} development {{trends of}} modern cruise liners and their <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants</b> as well. The growing size of such vessels and growing power of <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants</b> is observed i n the population. Diesel-electric <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants,</b> combined <b>propulsions</b> <b>plants</b> CODAG type (diesel and gas turbines) and COGES type (gas turbines and steam turbines) are mostly used on th is class ships. In this types of propulsion diesel engines, gas turbines and steam turbines drive generators thus cre ating central electric power station to supply electric power to <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> electric motors and t o ship electric network as well. Medium speed diesel gear type <b>main</b> <b>propulsions</b> are used on older cruise liners only. The paper presents {{the method of}} preliminary estimation of ship energetic system parameters i. e. <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> power, onboard electric power station power and auxiliary boilers capacity. The method is based on statistic analysis of cruise liners being in serv ice and under construction. Statistic methods are elabor ated in Department of Marine <b>Propulsion</b> <b>Plants</b> of Gdynia Maritime Uni versity. These methods make possible in simple and quick way to estimat e parameters of ship energeti c system.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to comparatively assess four <b>main</b> alternative <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants</b> based on reciprocating internal combustion engines of a typical ferry or Ro-Ro ship operating in routes that include Emission Control Areas (ECAs). Specifically, the dual fuel (DF) engine <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant</b> is compared with a conventional Diesel engine plant. The cases of the installation of a Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) system are also investigated. The <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants</b> were modelled under steady state conditions, and the simulation results were analysed in order to compare the various configurations. Furthermore, using the simulation results, energy efficiency design index (EEDI) values for each case are calculated and the <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants</b> compliance with the respective IMO regulations is discussed. Then, the annual cost including investment and operational for each alternative <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant</b> is calculated for two ship sailing scenarios; the first considers the ship partly sailing inside Emission Control Areas (ECAs), whereas the other considers the ship sailing entirely within ECAs. The results are used for performing the economical evaluation of the examined <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants.</b> Finally, the annual carbon dioxide emissions are estimated and used for comparing the <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant</b> alternative solutions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the <b>main</b> {{alternative}} <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants</b> {{based on}} reciprocating internal combustion engines of a ferry or RoRo ship operating in routes that include Emission Control Areas (ECAs) are comparatively assessed. Specifically, a {{dual fuel engine}} <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant</b> is compared with a conventional Diesel engine plant. For both cases, the installation of a Waste Heat Recovery system, which covers {{a part of the}} ship electric energy demand, is also considered. The ship main DF engines are assumed to operate using LNG and a small amount of MDO for initiating combustion, whereas low sulphur MDO was regarded as the fuel for the case of the Diesel engine plant. The installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) after-treatment unit for reducing the NOx emissions for the case of Diesel engines plant is also taken into account. The <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants</b> were modelled under steady state conditions, and the simulation results were analysed in order to compare the alternative configurations. Furthermore, the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) values were calculated and the two examined propulsion system cases were compared on EEDI basis.

50|$|After post-deployment standdown, the warship resumed normal {{operations}} out of Charleston. That duty {{continued until}} 27 June {{when she entered}} the Charleston Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability. Over the next five months, she underwent two major modifications. Her <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant</b> was converted to use Navy distillate fuel, and the light airborne multipurpose system (LAMPS) was installed. She completed the restricted availability on 28 November and spent {{the remainder of the}} year preparing for refresher training. On 12 January 1974, Blakely departed Charleston for refresher training in the West Indies. That training—including missile shoots, torpedo launchings, and gunfire support drills—lasted until 7 March at which time she returned to Charleston.|$|E
50|$|Walke {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of 1965 and {{the first five months}} of 1966 engaged in normal west coast operations—mostly ASW exercises. On 9 June 1966, she departed Long Beach for another deployment to the western Pacific. However, while she was passing the outer breakwater, a major fire broke out in her after fireroom. The destroyer's damage control efforts succeeded in putting the blaze out; but, while the ship was being towed back into Long Beach on 10 June, her towline parted, and she ran aground. Later that day, she finally entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for repairs to both her hull and her <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the present}} paper, a {{modelling}} approach for the simulation {{of the overall}} ship <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant</b> is presented. A cycle mean value model with differential equations for the calculation of the engine crankshaft and turbocharger shaft speeds {{is used for the}} modelling of the main engine of the vessel. The ship shafting system is modelled using the power balance and its efficiency. In order to calculate the propeller thrust and torque, the polynomials for the propellers of the Wageningen B type are used. In addition, the ship velocity and the movement along its longitudinal axis are also calculated using the differential equation describing the ship surge dynamics. The mathematical equations of the ship <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant</b> model are implemented and solved using the computational environment MATLAB Simulink®.
