40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} malaria transmission resumption in Morocco, we have studied {{the current level of}} receptivity of the region of the last <b>malaria</b> <b>focus</b> in the country. Anopheles (Anopheles) maculipennis labranchiae and Anopheles (Cellia) sergentii, the major vectors of malaria in Morocco, are still presents but their anthropothic index was low and no parasite positive samples were detected. An. labranchiae was very rare: only 34 females were caught over all the study period. The human biting rate was nil and none of its blood meal was human. An. sergenti was more abundant but its low human aggressiveness and its zoophilic behaviour would not attribute to this species an important vectorial capacity. Thus, the receptivity of Chefchaouen province, the region of the last <b>malaria</b> <b>focus</b> in Morocco, under the current vector control measures undertaken by Public Health services, is low and despite the likely presence of Plasmodium vivax gametocyte carriers, the malariogenic potential appears to be low and the risk of malaria resumption is, at this time, unimportant...|$|E
40|$|Malaria is a {{parasitic}} infection of global importance. Although relatively uncommon in developed countries, where the disease occurs mainly in travellers who have returned from endemic regions, it {{remains one of}} the most prevalent infections of humans worldwide. In endemic regions, malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and creates enormous social and economic burdens. Current efforts to control <b>malaria</b> <b>focus</b> on reducing attributable morbidity and mortality. Targeted chemoprophylaxis and use of insecticide-treated bed nets have been successful in some endemic areas. For travellers to malaria-endemic regions, personal protective measures and appropriate chemoprophylaxis can significantly reduce the risk of infection. Prompt evaluation of the febrile traveller, a high degree of suspicion of malaria, rapid and accurate diagnosis, and appropriate antimalarial therapy are essential in order to optimize clinical outcomes of infected patients. Additional approaches to malaria control, including genetic manipulation of mosquitoes and malaria vaccines, are areas of ongoing research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Iran has {{recently}} initiated a malaria elimination program {{with emphasis on}} vector control strategies which are heavily reliant on indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets. Insecticide resistance seriously threatens the efficacy of vector control strategies. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the insecticide susceptibility of Anopheles stephensi to DDT and current insecticides in Jask county as an active <b>malaria</b> <b>focus</b> in southeastern Iran. Methods In this study, the anopheline larvae were collected from different aquatic habitats in Jask county and transported to insectarium, fed with sugar and then 3 -day-old adults were used for susceptibility tests. WHO insecticide susceptibility tests were performed with DDT (4  %), malathion (5  %), lambda-cyhalothrin (0. 05  %), deltamethrin (0. 05  %) and permethrin (0. 75  %). Results The field strain of An. stephensi was found resistant to DDT and lambda-cyhalothrin. The LT 50 values for DDT and lambda-cyhalothrin in this species were 130. 25, and 37. 71  min, respectively. Moreover, An. stephensi was completely susceptible to malathion and permethrin and tolerant to deltamethrin. Conclusion The present study results confirm the resistance of the major malaria vector, An. stephensi, to DDT and lambda-cyhalothrin, and tolerance to deltamethrin, which could gradually increase and spread into other malaria endemic areas. Thus, {{there is a need for}} regular monitoring of insecticide resistance in order to select suitable insecticides for vector control interventions towards malaria elimination...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{stratified}} {{the risk}} of malaria transmission (Plasmodium vivax) in 35 villages along a coastal range in northeastern Venezuela (51 km 2) where the main vector is the mosquito Anopheles aquasalis. After 20 years without local malaria transmission, reinfection of the entire area occurred from May to December 1985 by local (continuous) and jump (discontinuous) dispersal. Epidemiologic, environmental, and vector variables were investigated {{with the aid of}} a Geographic Information System. Risk factors for malaria transmission were human population density, proximity to pre-adult mosquito habitats (, 500 m), and the number of pre-adult habitats nearby. Most inhabitants, immature mosquito habitats, and malaria cases were located at low elevations and on gentle slopes. High prevalence of malaria during the dry seasons was associated with the presence of permanent bodies of water containing An. aquasalis. Occurrence of a La Niña event in 1988 (wet and cool phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation) triggered malaria transmission to unusually high levels, consolidating infection in the area, and rendering traditional control efforts useless. We recommend tracking malaria persistence per village and associated risk factors as methods to reduce the cost of malaria control programs.

Most of the area is known to be moderately malaria endemic, but the exact malaria epidemiology has not been elucidated. At least 30 deaths per year are thought to be caused by falciparum malaria in Lombok alone, judging from the hospital data. According to the Gebrak Malaria Team in West Lombok, the annual incidence in the district of West Lombok from 1996 to 1999 was consistently over 40 ‰. In the present report, we describe the small <b>malaria</b> endemic <b>foci</b> in the West Lombok and Sumbawa districts. Falciparum malaria is predominant over vivax malaria and other types of malaria. There are 11 species of Anopheles vector, but three of these species, An. subpictus, An. maculates and An. barbirostris, are of primary importance in malaria transmission and An. sundaicus and An. aconitus are of secondary importance. Our data from Sekotong, West Lombok, and Sumbawa supported the importance of An. subpictus in coastal areas but suggested the existence of different transmission peaks according to environmental conditions. The usual transmission peak comes in the dry season but is affected by climatic and geographical conditions.

The only dry season breeding was in a stream 3 km from the focus. The effective flight range in forest of An. dims was deduced to be about 1. 5 kin. Immatures were found to be peculiarly adapted to, and possibly dependent on, small, temporary pools. Eggs were deposited above the water line where they embryonated and where they could remain viable for 2 weeks. Heavy rain produced a synchronous hatch that completed immature development in 5 - 6 days and could eventually produce waves of parous females biting man. Larvae were observed to leave a draining pool before it completedly emptied and to crawl overland as far as 53 cm, sometimes to another pool. Larvae stranded by receding water often escaped predation that eliminated cohabiting species. They could be recovered alive from drained pool bottoms u...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{resistance}} of some species of Anopheles to chemical insecticides is spreading quickly {{throughout the world}} and has hindered the actions of prevention and control of malaria.

The objective of this review is to contribute with information on the more applied insecticides for the control of the main vectors of malaria, its effects, and the different mechanisms of resistance. Currently it is necessary to look for others alternatives, e. g. biological control and products derived from plants and fungi, by using other organisms as a possible regulator of the populations of malaria vectors in critical outbreaks...|$|R

The results of their investigations, which ranged from laboratory and clinical studies of tolerance to the drug, through small-scale trials of its parasiticidal activity, to large-scale studies on the effectiveness of its mass administration are very encouraging. Both for anti-relapse treatment and for pre-epidemic prophylaxis, a short (10 - or 14 -day) course of quinocide proved as effective as a lengthy course of acriquine with plasmocide.

40|$|Abstract Background Malaria {{continues}} to be a global public health challenge, particularly in developing countries. Delivery of prompt and effective diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases, detection of malaria epidemics within one week of onset and control them in less than a month, regular disease monitoring and operational classification of malaria are among the major responsibilities of the national malaria programme. The study was conducted to determine these indicators at the different level of primary health care facilities in malaria-affected provinces of Iran Methods In this survey, data was collected from 223 health facilities including health centres, malaria posts, health houses and hospitals as well as the profile of all 5, 836 recorded malaria cases in these facilities during the year preceding the survey. Descriptive statistics (i. e. frequencies, percentages) were used to summarize the results and Chi square test was used to analyse data. Results All but one percent of uncomplicated cases took appropriate and correctly-dosed of anti-malarial drugs in accordance to the national treatment guideline. A larger proportion of patients [85. 8 %; 95 % CI: 84. 8 - 86. 8] were also given complete treatment including anti-relapse course, in line with national guidelines. About one third [35. 0 %; 95 % CI: 33. 6 - 36. 4] of uncomplicated malaria cases were treated more than 48 hours after first symptoms onset. Correspondingly, half of severe malaria cases took recommended anti-malarial drugs for severe or complicated disease more than 48 hours of onset of first symptoms. The latter cases had given regular anti-malarial drugs promptly. The majority of malaria epidemics [97 %; 95 % CI: 90. 6 - 100] in study areas were detected within one week of onset, but only half of epidemics were controlled within four weeks of detection. Just half of target districts had at least one health facility/emergency site with adequate supply and equipment stocks. Nevertheless, only one-third of them [33 % (95 % CI: 0. 00 - 67. 8) ] had updated inventory of <b>malaria</b> <b>foci</b> on quarterly basis. Conclusion To sum up, malaria case management still constitutes a public health problem in Iran. Additionally, data suggest scarcity in management and evaluation of <b>malaria</b> <b>foci,</b> detection and control of malaria epidemics as well as assignment of emergency sites across different regions of the country. Consequently, massive and substantial investments need to be made at the Ministry of Health to coordinate national malaria control programmes towards achieving determined goals and targets. </p...|$|R

Therefore, data from historical archives with a Geographic Information System (GIS), using the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method, was analyzed with the aim of identifying regional differences in the distribution of malaria in Spain.

Another approach taken by Yaffe was research. Yaffe left for Europe and learned novel theories about malaria. Among these studies was one that suggested that mosquitoes from the genus Anopheles, which were prevalent in swamps, were carriers of the disease. He began to plead with farmers to hang canopies around the beds, nets around the windows, and to clean every pool of standing water. Likewise, Yaffe convinced Baron Rothschild to send men to kill the mosquitoes. Afterward the incidence of malaria decreased, and efforts to dry the swamps continued with greater force.

40|$|Historical {{importance}} of wetlands in malaria transmission in southwest of Spain Malaria is a parasitic disease {{that is currently}} affecting {{a good number of}} countries with approximately one million deaths per year. Traditionally, this pathology has been related to wetlands and other unhealthy water bodies. It disappeared from most of Western Europe after the Second World War; however, its eradication from Spain took place later. In fact, the WHO didn’t ofcially declare malaria in Spain eradicated until 1964, after a gradual controlled process of the illness, through the improvement of health and hygienic conditions in the country, and the ght against the vectors, the parasite, and its reservoirs. In 1913, the Spanish regions with the largest number of municipalities with autochthonous malaria were, precisely, those con-taining larger areas covered by unhealthy water bodies (except for Extremadura). Among them, Western Andalusia outstood as the main region with the largest area of unhealthy <b>malaria</b> <b>focuses</b> and with high mortality and morbidity rates.

In fact, the WHO didn’t of cially declare malaria in Spain eradicated until 1964, after a gradual controlled process of the illness, through the improvement of health and hygienic conditions in the country, and the ght against the vectors, the parasite, and its reservoirs. In 1913, the Spanish regions with the largest number of municipalities with autochthonous malaria were, precisely, those containing larger areas covered by unhealthy water bodies (except for Extremadura). Among them, Western Andalusia outstood as the main region with the largest area of unhealthy <b>malaria</b> <b>focuses</b> and with high mortality and morbidity rates. Within Western Andalusia, Huelva —and especially its coastal areas— has been, for centuries, one of the provinces with greater endemicity. After the Spanish Civil War a process of reforestation with fast-growing species took place in the Coastal Aeolian Sheet of the Province of Huelva, which led to an 88 % reduction of the surface covered by ponds in this territory. These lagoons had started a natural regression process {{by the end of the}} XIXth Century related to the post-Little Ice Age warming in Andalusia. The parallel evolution of malaria patients and the regression process experienced by these wetlands for the above mentioned reasons have had a determinant in uence in the eradication of the disease. All of this leads us to consider the relevant role of wetlands when studying the future risk of malaria reemergence in SW Spain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background With renewed {{interest}} in malaria elimination, island environments present unique opportunities to achieve this goal. However, as transmission decreases, monitoring and evaluation programmes need increasingly sensitive tools to assess Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax exposure. In 2009, to assess the role of serological markers in evaluating malaria transmission, a cross-sectional seroprevalence study {{was carried out in}} Tanna and Aneityum, two of the southernmost islands of the Vanuatu archipelago, areas where malaria transmission has been variably reduced over the past few decades. Methods Malaria transmission was assessed using serological markers for exposure to P. falciparum and P. vivax. Filter blood spot papers were collected from 1, 249 people from Tanna, and 517 people from Aneityum to assess the prevalence of antibodies to two P. falciparum antigens (MSP- 1 19 and AMA- 1) and two P. vivax antigens (MSP- 1 19 and AMA- 1). Age-specific prevalence was modelled using a simple catalytic conversion model based on maximum likelihood to generate a community seroconversion rate (SCR). Results Overall seropositivity in Tanna was 9. 4 %, 12. 4 % and 16. 6 % to P. falciparum MSP- 1 19, AMA- 1 and Schizont Extract respectively and 12. 6 % and 15. 0 % to P. vivax MSP- 1 19 and AMA- 1 respectively. Serological results distinguished between areas of differential dominance of either P. vivax or P. falciparum and analysis of age-stratified results showed a step in seroprevalence occurring approximately 30 years ago on both islands, indicative of a change in transmission intensity at this time. Results from Aneityum suggest that several children may have been exposed to malaria since the 2002 P. vivax epidemic. Conclusion Seroepidemiology can provide key information on malaria transmission for control programmes, when parasite rates are low. As Vanuatu moves closer to malaria elimination, monitoring changes in transmission intensity and identification of residual <b>malaria</b> <b>foci</b> is paramount in order to concentrate intervention efforts. </p...|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} broad global {{initiative}} to fight malaria, Seattle BioMed developed its malaria program in 2000, with an initial grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. With a three-pronged approach, Seattle BioMed's <b>malaria</b> program is <b>focused</b> on vaccine discovery for pregnancy malaria, severe malaria in children, and liver-stage malaria. In 2005, Seattle BioMed received two Grand Challenges in Global Health grants to accelerate its malaria research. And in 2011, Seattle BioMed was granted another $9 million from the Foundation to support malaria vaccine efforts.|$|R
