However, the impact from port service quality is more significant than that of port security quality. Accordingly, this study suggests that Kaohsiung Port should concentrate on improving its service quality in order to enhance customer satisfaction and customer loyalty...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the significance of innovation driven online entrepreneurship as well as the impact of innovation on brand trust, customer satisfaction and brand loyalty in the extent of service innovations. Global online entrepreneurship was explored on a theoretical basis and correlation and regression analyses were used in order to evaluate the impact of the innovations of Google on brand trust, customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. Furthermore correlation and regression analyses were used in order to find out the relationship between brand loyalty and brand trust and the relationship between brand loyalty and customer relationship in the extent of service industry. The results show a <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> relationship between innovation and brand loyalty, a <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> relationship between innovation and brand trust <b>and</b> a <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> relationship between innovation and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, according to the research findings brand trust and customer satisfaction have a <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> relationship with brand loyalty. This research is limited to Google users since it is the most popular search engine worldwide. In this article the impact of innovation on brand trust, customer satisfaction and brand loyalty was evaluated. For future research the impact of innovation on other variables of brand loyalty can be studied. The findings of this study inform the readers about the impact of brand trust, customer satisfaction and brand loyalty on innovation in the extent of service innovations driven by global online entrepreneurship.  </p...|$|R
