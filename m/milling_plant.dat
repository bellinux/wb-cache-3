Much of the waste rock was dumped just northeast of the shaft near a small wetland.|$|E

2500|$|Amongst {{the various}} {{contemporary}} agricultural practices {{mentioned in the}} Nong Shu, Wang listed and described the use of ploughing, sowing, irrigation, cultivation of mulberries, etc. It listed and described many of the various foodstuffs and products of the many regions of China. The book outlined the use of not only agricultural tools, but food-processing, irrigation equipment, different types of fields, ceremonial vessels, various types of grain storage, carts, boats, mechanical devices, and textile machinery used in many applications. [...] For example, {{one of the many}} devices described and illustrated in drawing is a large mechanical <b>milling</b> <b>plant</b> operated by the motive power of oxen, with an enormous rotating geared wheel engaging the toothed gears of eight different mills surrounding it. Of great interest to sinologist historians, Wang also outlined the difference between the agricultural technology of Northern China and that of Southern China. The main characteristic of agricultural technology of the north was technical applications fit for predominantly dryland cultivation, while intensified irrigation cultivation was more suitable for southern China. Furthermore, Wang used his treatise as a means to spread knowledge in support of certain agricultural practices or technologies found exclusively in either South or North that could benefit the other, if only they were more widely known, such as the southern hand-harrow used for weeding in the south, yet virtually unknown in the north.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Workers working {{close to}} salt <b>milling</b> <b>plants</b> may inhale salt {{particles}} {{floating in the}} air, leading to a rise in plasma sodium, which, in turn, may increase the blood pressure {{and the risk of}} hypertension. Methods To test the above hypothesis, occupational health check-up camps were organized near salt manufacturing units and all workers were invited for a free health examination. The workers who worked with dry salt in the vicinity of salt <b>milling</b> <b>plants</b> were defined as "non-brine workers," while those working in brine pans located far away from <b>milling</b> <b>plants</b> were defined as "brine workers. " Blood pressure (BP) was measured during each clinical examination. In all, 474 non-brine workers and 284 brine workers were studied. Results Mean systolic blood pressure of non-brine workers (122. 1 ± 13. 3 mm Hg) was significantly higher than that of brine workers (118. 8 ± 12. 8 mm Hg, p 3 air. Conclusion Inhalation of salt particles in non-brine workers may be an occupational cause of increased blood pressure. </p...|$|R
