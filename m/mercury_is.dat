5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} that {{the main source of}} the <b>mercury</b> <b>is</b> likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16 percent of the mercury comes in from rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a non-toxic, inorganic form. The non-toxic <b>mercury</b> <b>is</b> converted into toxic methyl mercury by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is the largest, at 318 Earth masses, whereas <b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> the smallest, at 0.055 Earth masses.|$|E
40|$|Inorganic {{and organic}} <b>mercury</b> <b>were</b> {{determined}} by helium-microwave induced plasma-atomic emission spectrometry following cold vapor generation. Whereas only inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>was</b> reduced by stannous ion in an acidic medium, both inorganic and organic <b>mercury</b> (total <b>mercury)</b> <b>were</b> reduced by stannous ion {{in the presence}} of cupric ion in a basic medium. Organic <b>mercury</b> <b>was</b> determined as the difference between total and inorganic mercury. Detection limits for inorganic and organic <b>mercury</b> <b>were</b> 11 and 10 pg, respectively, The accuracy of the proposed method was verified through the determination of inorganic, total and organic mercury in two marine biological standard reference materials, DORM- 1 and TORT- 1.

50|$|Both {{versions}} of the <b>Mercury</b> <b>are</b> based at the KM Group's Deal office. Previously the Dover <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> based at the Dover office before this was closed by the Group.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>mercury</b> <b>was</b> {{not simply}} {{detected}} in steady increments; in some areas, there <b>was</b> <b>mercury</b> scavenging of unfiltered total mercury. Dissolved mercury also underwent abiotic atmospheric evasion as gaseous <b>mercury</b> <b>was</b> {{released into the}} atmosphere. Both processes accounted {{for the loss of}} measured mercury concentrations downstream.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> a heavy, silvery-white liquid metal. Compared {{to other}} metals, it {{is a poor}} {{conductor}} of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> {{extracted}} by heating cinnabar in {{a current}} {{of air and}} condensing the vapor.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} metals, iron does not form {{amalgams}} with mercury. As a result, <b>mercury</b> <b>is</b> traded in standardized 76 pound flasks (34kg) made of iron.|$|E
50|$|According to de Lecerda and Salomons (1997) <b>mercury</b> <b>was</b> {{first in}} use for {{extraction}} at about 1000 BC, according to Meech and others (1998), <b>mercury</b> <b>was</b> used in obtaining gold until the latter {{period of the}} first millennia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> a British {{cipher machine}} {{used by the}} Air Ministry from 1950 until at least the early 1960s. <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> an online rotor machine descended from Typex, but {{modified}} to achieve a longer cycle length using a so-called double-drum basket system.|$|R
50|$|The Cincinnati <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} to fall as rail service contracted, ending in 1956. It was {{replaced}} by the light-weight Xplorer in a brief experiment. The Chicago <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> combined with the Wolverine in 1958. The Cleveland <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> discontinued on July 11, 1958. The Riley was retained, although it was no longer a streamliner. In 1971, Amtrak combined the Riley with the George Washington. The combined service was renamed the Cardinal in 1977, which is still running to this day.|$|R
5|$|When <b>mercury</b> <b>is</b> {{analyzed}} using atomic absorption spectroscopy, a cold vapor method must be used, and tin (II) chloride is typically {{used as the}} reductant.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers have {{discovered}} nearly 500 planetary systems with multiple planets. Regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several {{times greater than}} Earth's (super-Earths), orbiting closer to their star than <b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> to the Sun, and sometimes also Jupiter-mass gas giants close to their star.|$|E
5|$|Terrestrials: Planets {{that are}} similar to Earth, with bodies largely {{composed}} of rock: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. At 0.055 Earth masses, <b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> the smallest terrestrial planet (and smallest planet) in the Solar System. Earth is the largest terrestrial planet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mercury</b> can <b>be</b> absorbed {{through the}} skin and mucous {{membranes}} and <b>mercury</b> vapors can <b>be</b> inhaled, so containers of <b>mercury</b> <b>are</b> securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation. Heating of mercury, or of compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated, should be carried out with adequate ventilation {{in order to minimize}} exposure to mercury vapor. The most toxic forms of <b>mercury</b> <b>are</b> its organic compounds, such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury. Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> a {{brand of}} diecast toy cars {{manufactured}} in Italy from about 1945 through the 1970s. Along with Dinky Toys in England, <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> a pioneer in 1:43 scale diecast toys made in Europe. Today, <b>Mercury</b> models <b>are</b> rather rare and not easy to find. The company logo <b>was</b> the word <b>Mercury</b> within a rectangle with a round toothed gear behind the company name.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (<b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|Fraud and forgery are {{described}} in detail; in particular coin counterfeiting by mixing copper with silver, or even admixture with iron. Tests had been developed for counterfeit coins and proved very popular with the victims, mostly ordinary people. He deals with the liquid metal mercury, also found in silver mines. He records that it is toxic, and amalgamates with gold, so is used for refining and extracting that metal. He says <b>mercury</b> <b>is</b> used for gilding copper, while antimony is found in silver mines and is used as an eyebrow cosmetic.|$|E
5|$|Gold {{and silver}} mining. Historically, mercury was used {{extensively}} in hydraulic gold mining {{in order to}} help the gold to sink through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates. Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, <b>mercury</b> <b>is</b> still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 metric tons of mercury used in California for placer mining have not been recovered. Mercury was also used in silver mining.|$|E
50|$|The East Kent <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} 1865.|$|R
50|$|It {{was thought}} {{for some time}} that <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> in {{synchronous}} rotation with the Sun. This <b>was</b> because whenever <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> best placed for observation, the same side faced inward. Radar observations in 1965 demonstrated instead that Mercury has a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun, which results in the same positioning at those observation points. Modeling has demonstrated that <b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> captured into the 3:2 spin-orbit state very early in its history, within 20 (and more likely even 10) million years after its formation.|$|R

5|$|In the 5-planet {{solution}} for the 55 Cancri system, the orbit of 55 Cancri c is mildly eccentric: at apoastron the planet is about 19% further from the star than it is at periastron. It is located closer to 55 Cancri A than <b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> to our sun, though it has a longer orbital period than the hot Jupiters. The planet is located close to a 3:1 resonance with the inner planet 55 Cancri b; however, simulations indicate that the two planets are not actually in this resonance.|$|E
5|$|Liquid <b>mercury</b> <b>is</b> a part {{of popular}} {{secondary}} reference electrode (called the calomel electrode) in electrochemistry {{as an alternative to}} the standard hydrogen electrode. The calomel electrode is used to work out the electrode potential of half cells. Last, but not least, the triple point of mercury, −38.8344°C, is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale (ITS-90).|$|E
5|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> an {{ingredient}} in dental amalgams. Thiomersal (called Thimerosal in the United States) is an organic compound {{used as a}} preservative in vaccines, though this use is in decline. Thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link. Nevertheless, thiomersal has been removed from, or reduced to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 {{years of age and}} under, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>was</b> {{once used}} as a gun barrel bore cleaner.|$|R

5|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> used {{primarily}} for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps, {{while most of the}} other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy.|$|E
5|$|Mercury readily {{combines}} with aluminium {{to form a}} mercury-aluminium amalgam {{when the}} two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, <b>mercury</b> <b>is</b> not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances {{because of the risk}} of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The three group 12 {{elements}} that occur naturally are zinc, cadmium and mercury. They are all {{widely used in}} electric and electronic applications, {{as well as in}} various alloys. The first two members of the group share similar properties as they are solid metals under standard conditions. <b>Mercury</b> <b>is</b> the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature. While zinc is very important in the biochemistry of living organisms, cadmium and mercury are both highly toxic. As copernicium does not occur in nature, it has to be synthesized in the laboratory.|$|E
