25|$|Absolute {{pitch is}} {{considerably}} {{more common among}} those whose early childhood was spent in East Asia. This <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a genetic difference; however, people of East Asian ancestry who are reared in North America are {{significantly less likely to}} develop absolute pitch than those raised in East Asia, so the difference is more probably explained by experience. The language that is spoken may be an important factor; many East Asians speak tonal languages such as Mandarin and Cantonese, while others (such as those in Japan and certain provinces of Korea) speak pitch-accent languages, and the prevalence of absolute pitch may be partly explained by exposure to pitches together with meaningful musical labels very early in life.|$|E
25|$|Japan and South Korea tend {{to favor}} large {{infrastructure}} projects, so this project <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fairly obvious politically, but this project has {{been the target of}} far right/nationalist political groups in both countries. Many South Koreans have advised caution in proceeding with the project due to worries of firms in the much larger Japanese economy becoming more dominant in South Korea due to the lower logistical expenses the tunnel would provide; this increased economic power would further expand the political power of Japan in the region. Similarly, many Japanese firms worry it may expand the increasing dominance of Korean firms in sectors such as consumer electronics. China’s increasing dominance in the region may, eventually, minimize these concerns making the project politically viable, but this is not yet the case.|$|E

500|$|In the past, Hilbert spaces {{were often}} {{required}} to be separable {{as part of the}} definition. Most spaces used in physics are separable, and since these are all isomorphic to each other, one often refers to any infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space as [...] "the Hilbert space" [...] or just [...] "Hilbert space".. The convention still persists in most rigorous treatments of quantum mechanics; see for instance [...] Even in quantum field theory, most of the Hilbert spaces are in fact separable, as stipulated by the Wightman axioms. However, it is sometimes argued that non-separable Hilbert spaces are also important in quantum field theory, roughly because the systems in the theory possess an infinite number of degrees of freedom and any infinite Hilbert tensor product (of spaces of dimension greater than one) is non-separable. For instance, a bosonic field can be naturally thought of as an element of a tensor product whose factors represent harmonic oscillators at each point of space. From this perspective, the natural state space of a boson <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a non-separable space. However, it is only a small separable subspace of the full tensor product that can contain physically meaningful fields (on which the observables can be defined). Another non-separable Hilbert space models the state of an infinite collection of particles in an unbounded region of space. An orthonormal basis of the space is indexed by the density of the particles, a continuous parameter, and since the set of possible densities is uncountable, the basis is not countable.|$|E

Since the Academy of the Hebrew Language ascertains that א in initial position is not transliterated, the symbol for the glottal stop ʾ is omitted from the transliteration, and only the subsequent vowels are transliterated (whether or not their corresponding vowel diacritics appeared in the text being transliterated), resulting in [...] "im", [...] "em" [...] and [...] "om", respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Problematic point(s): certain vowel {{couples are}} {{sometimes}} pronounced as diphthongs, e.g. augusztus ‘August’ is often pronounced in three syllables like au-gusz-tus, but the syllable-counting rule (above) should {{consider it as}} a word of four syllables. Another problematic point is that some words <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compounds although they are not (e.g. jobbágy ‘serf’ > job-bágy, although jobb ‘better’ and ágy ‘bed’ are existing words). A third possible problem is that although hyphenation strictly follows pronunciation, long consonants pronounced as short are treated {{as if they were}} pronounced long (e.g. milliméter is pronounced [...] so hyphenation could be mi-lli-mé-ter but it follows the written form and will be mil-li-mé-ter, or Kossuth is hyphenated as Kos-suth, although the ss is pronounced short.) A further problem is that dz is not considered as a genuine diphthong by current Hungarian phonology, but it is treated as a digraph, and both of its letters should be moved together (e.g. ma-dzag ‘string’) and the trigraph dzs is also treated as a single letter, even when it is pronounced long (e.g. me-ne-dzser ‘impresario’).

Current clone management techniques concentrate on providing editing tools that allow developers to easily inspect clone instances, track their evolution, and check change consistency. In this position paper, we argue that better clone management can be achieved by responding to the fundamental needs of industry practitioners. And the possible research directions include a software problem-oriented taxonomy of clones, and a better structured clone detection report.
