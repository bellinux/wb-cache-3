40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effects of Qichu Fujin Recipe (QCFJR), a {{compound}} traditional Chinese medicine, in repairing sciatic nerve injury in rats. Methods: A total of 60 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control group, untreated group, <b>mecobalamin</b> group and QCFJR group. Except the normal control group, sciatic nerve injury was induced by crushing of left sciatic nerve. Rats in the <b>mecobalamin</b> group were intragastrically administered with <b>mecobalamin</b> solutions 150 μg/(kg·d), and rats in the QCFJR group were intragastrically administered with QCFJR 35. 2 g/(kg·d), while rats in the untreated group were intragastrically administered with normal saline (0. 5 mL/d), once a day for 4 weeks respectively. Sciatic function index (SFI) was determined by walking tract analysis 1 week and 2 and 4 weeks after crushing. Five rats in each group were sacrificed for histological observation at the different time points. The remnant rate of gastrocnemius wet weight and the diameter of gastrocnemius cells were calculated. Expression of S- 100 protein in the distal stump of injured nerve was observed by using immunohistochemical method. Distal injured sciatic nerves were determined with toluidine blue staining and observed under a light microscope 1 week and 2 and 4 weeks after operation. Diameter of axon and depth of myelin sheath were calculated by an image analysis system. Ultrastructure of nerve fibers was determined with uranyl acetate and lead citrate staining and observed under an electron microscope. Results: Compared with the normal control group, SFI, remnant rate of gastrocnemius wet weight, diameter of gastrocnemius cells, expression of S- 100, diameter of axon and depth of myelin sheath in the <b>mecobalamin</b> group and the QCFJR group were significantly decreased at different time points (P 0. 05). Conclusion: QCFJR can stimulate the regeneration and repair of nerve fiber and delay the skeletal muscle atrophy after sciatic nerve injury in rats...|$|E

40|$|Nerve {{crush injury}} is a {{well-established}} axonotmetic model in experimental regeneration studies {{to investigate the}} impact of various pharmacological treatments. Hericium erinaceus is a temperate mushroom but is now being cultivated in tropical Malaysia. In this study, we investigated the activity of aqueous extract of H. erinaceus fresh fruiting bodies in promoting functional recovery following an axonotmetic peroneal nerve injury in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats by daily oral administration. The aim {{was to investigate the}} possible use of this mushroom in the treatment of injured nerve. Functional recovery was assessed in behavioral experiment by walking track analysis. Peroneal functional index (PFI) was determined before surgery and after surgery as rats showed signs of recovery. Histological examinations were performed on peroneal nerve by immunofluorescence staining and neuromuscular junction by combined silver-cholinesterase stain. Analysis of PFI indicated that return of hind limb function occurred earlier in rats of aqueous extract or <b>mecobalamin</b> (positive control) group compared to negative control group. Regeneration of axons and reinnervation of motor endplates in extensor digitorum longus muscle in rats of aqueous extract or <b>mecobalamin</b> group developed better than in negative control group.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of <b>Mecobalamin</b> on the visual field and retinal nerve fiber layer(RNFL) thickness in patients with advanced glaucoma after trabeculectomy. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational case series. We chosed 57 cases(57 eyes) operated, whose high intraocular pressure had been relieved after trabeculectomy. Patients were randomly selected and divided into treatment group 28 cases(28 eyes), and control group 29 cases(29 eyes) (conventional treatment group). The treatment group received both conventional therapy and <b>Mecobalamin</b> 500 μg, 3 times a day for 6 months. The mean defect(MD) and pattern standard deviation(PSD) were strictly measured by Humphrey 750 i and the total and regional mean RNFL thickness were measured using a Stratus OCT- 3 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) at the time of discharge from hospital and at 6 months. Independent-samples t test was used to compare the results obtained from these two groups. RESULTS: At 6 months, MD: treatment group(- 13. 30 ± 4. 03) dB, control group(- 18. 51 ± 4. 33) dB, PSD: treatment group(5. 64 ± 0. 48) dB, control group(8. 21 ± 2. 47) dB. There were statistically significant differences(t =- 2. 112, P = 0. 049; t =- 2. 436, P = 0. 025) in MD and PSD between the two groups. And the RNFL thickness overall: treatment group(75. 828 ± 7. 260) μm,control group(65. 037 ± 13. 074) μm,RNFL thickness of the nasal quadrant: treatment group(59. 077 ± 11. 055) μm, control group(48. 122 ± 7. 385) μm, RNFL thickness of the temporal quadrant: treatment group(61. 098 ± 14. 832) μm, control group(48. 133 ± 17. 174) μm, RNFL thickness of the superior quadrant: treatment group(96. 263 ± 22. 537) μm, control group(85. 596 ± 20. 472) μm, RNFL thickness of the inferior quadrant: treatment group(94. 821 ± 19. 693) μm, control group(85. 072 ± 23. 384) μm.

40|$|Cardiac {{sympathetic}} denervation {{is found}} in various cardiac pathologies; however, its relationship with myocardial injury has not been thoroughly investigated. Twenty-four rats {{were assigned to the}} normal control group (NC), sympathectomy control group (SC), and a sympathectomy plus <b>mecobalamin</b> group (SM). Sympathectomy was induced by injection of 6 -OHDA, after which, the destruction and distribution of sympathetic and vagal nerve in the left ventricle (LV) myocardial tissue were determined by immunofluorescence and ELISA. Heart rate variability (HRV), ECG and echocardiography, and assays for myocardial enzymes in serum before and after sympathectomy were examined. Morphologic changes in the LV by HE staining and transmission electron microscope were used to estimate levels of myocardial injury and concentrations of inflammatory cytokines were used to reflect the inflammatory reaction. Injection of 6 -OHDA decreased NE (933. 1 ± 179 ng/L for SC vs. 3418. 1 ± 443. 6 ng/L for NC, P < 0. 01) and increased NGF (479. 4 ± 56. 5 ng/mL for SC vs. 315. 85 ± 28. 6 ng/mL for NC, P < 0. 01) concentrations. TH expression was reduced, while ChAT expression showed no change. Sympathectomy caused decreased HRV and abnormal ECG and echocardiography results, and histopathologic examinations showed myocardial injury and increased collagen deposition as well as inflammatory cell infiltration in the cardiac tissue of rats in the SC and SM groups. However, all pathologic changes in the SM group were less severe compared to those in the SC group.

40|$|Sciatic nerve {{injury is}} {{commonly}} seen in clinical practice predominantly associated with trauma or sports injuries. Recent studies indicated that ginsenoside Rg 1 (Gs Rg 1), extracted from Chinese herbs, {{was found to}} promote regeneration of injured rat sciatic nerve and that nerve growth factor (NGF) {{may be involved in}} this process. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the role that NGF may play in ginsenoside Rg 1 -induced regeneration of rat sciatic nerve following injury. Animals following surgical right sciatic nerve injury were subsequently administered intraperitoneally either saline (sham control) or different doses of 2, 4, 8, or 12 mg/kg daily GsRg 1 for 2 to 8 wk. In addition, 100 μg/kg <b>mecobalamin,</b> a drug utilized to treat nerve injuries, was employed as a positive control. After 2, 4, or 8 wk, sciatic functional index (SFI) and mean nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), markers of sciatic nerve function, were assessed to determine whether recovery of injured sciatic nerve occurred. In addition, immunohistochemistry and Western blot methods were used to examine NGF protein expression changes. Results showed that all doses of GsRg 1 significantly increased SFI and MNCV in injured sciatic-nerve-damaged rats in a manner similar to that noted with <b>mecobalamin.</b> It is of interest that the intermediate 4 - and 8 -mg/kg doses were more effective in restoring nerve functions. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot results also demonstrated a similar pattern with enhanced NGF protein expression at all doses, but greater effects were noted at 4 and 8 mg/kg GsRg 1. Data suggest that GsRg 1 promotes recovery of injured sciatic nerve functions within a specific dose range and that NGF may be involved in this physiological process...|$|E
