40|$|AbstractAn {{approach}} for correcting the eccentricity in slight clearance punching of ultra-high strength steel sheets having low ductility {{was developed to}} improve the quality of sheared edges of punched holes. In this process, a <b>moving</b> <b>die</b> was employed in order to correct the eccentricity between the punch and die and to ease the setting of tools. The gap between the die and holder allowed the eccentric die to move, and thus the die became concentric after several strikes. For the <b>moving</b> <b>die,</b> the depth of the shiny burnished surface on the sheared edge increased and that of the rough fracture surface decreased. It was found that the application of <b>moving</b> <b>die</b> in slight clearance is indispensable for high quality punching of ultra-high strength steel sheets...|$|R

40|$|In this research, a {{study of}} the effect of a <b>die</b> <b>half</b> angle on the {{extrusion}} process has been performed. The experiments were conducted at room temperature around 27 °C. Two types of taper die with different <b>die</b> <b>half</b> angles (45 ° and 60 °) were prepared. The test lubricants used were paraffinic mineral oil VG 460 and Refined, Bleached and Deodorized (RBD) Palm stearin. The material of the workpiece (billet) was annealed with A 1100 aluminium. The experimental results were focused on the extrusion load, tool and workpiece surface roughness and plastic deformation of the workpiece. The resultant relative velocity was calculated using a visioplasticity method. The results shows that a taper angle of 60 ° recorded higher resultant relative velocity with a lower extrusion load and surface roughness compare to the taper angle of 45 °. The comparison study between Paraffinic Mineral Oil and RBD Palm Stearin shows no significant effect in both taper angles tested...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are four}} main types of thread rolling, {{named after the}} {{configuration}} of the dies: flat dies, two-die cylindrical, three-die cylindrical, and planetary dies. The flat die system has two flat dies. The bottom one is held stationary and the other slides. The blank is placed {{on one end of the}} stationary die and then the <b>moving</b> <b>die</b> slides over the blank, which causes the blank to roll between the two dies forming the threads. Before the <b>moving</b> <b>die</b> reaches the end of its stroke the blank rolls off the stationary die in a finished form. The two-die cylindrical process is used to produce threads up to [...] in diameter and [...] in length. There are two types of three-die processes; the first has the three dies move radially out from the center to let the blank enter the dies and then closes and rotates to roll the threads. This type of process is commonly employed on turret lathes and screw machines. The second type takes the form of a self-opening die head. This type is more common than the former, but is limited by not being able form the last 1.5 to 2 threads against shoulders. Planetary dies are used to mass-produce threads up to [...] in diameter.|$|R
