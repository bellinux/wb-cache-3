500|$|On September 2, 2008, {{a record}} store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic {{nearly two weeks}} before its {{scheduled}} worldwide release date, {{which resulted in the}} album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich [...] responded to the leak by saying, [...] "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me", and, [...] "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength {{to come back here}} – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said three or four <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E

One of our assistants brought it to my {{attention}} a few <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that,</b> sometimes, when I play chords, my thumb is on the fretted side of the neck. I {{have no idea why}} or how I do it, but I do." [...] "I remember a time early on when Ace and I would play," [...] added Paul Stanley, [...] "and I would do vibrato with my hand, and Ace would get vibrato by shaking his whole arm against the neck of the guitar [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1989 Lange {{announced}} {{in a brief}} press statement on 10 November that he was separating from his wife of 21 years. On 12 November Naomi Lange named his speech-writer, Margaret Pope as the other woman in a Sunday Times article, {{and said that she}} had been told by David five or six <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> he planned to leave the marriage. Lange's mother Phoebe also publicly criticised him, but they later reconciled. He had three children, Roy, Emily, and Byron ( [...] in their 30s) with his first wife (Naomi) and one daughter, Edith, with his second wife (Margaret). He married Margaret in Glasgow on 12 January 1992 while holidaying in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{possibility}} of Indiana Jones 5 {{continued to be}} discussed through 2009 and 2010. Reports speculated in June 2009 that the next installment would start filming in 2011 with a plot involving the Bermuda Triangle, although these rumors were later described as [...] "completely false" [...] by Frank Marshall on his Twitter page. Speaking to BBC journalist Lizo Mzimba in June 2009, LaBeouf confirmed that [...] "Steven [...] just said that he cracked the story on it , I think they're gearing that up." [...] Lucas stated {{he was working on}} the film as of December 2009. In November 2010, Ford said that he and Spielberg were waiting for Lucas to present an idea to them. In March 2011, the Deadbolt website interviewed Karen Allen and asked her about the fifth film's status. [...] "What I know is that there's a story that they like", said Allen, [...] "which is a huge step forward. I heard this about six <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>that</b> they have a story that they like and they're working on it." [...] In July 2012, Frank Marshall indicated that the film was unlikely to be announced in the near future, saying: [...] "I don't know if it's definitely not happening, but it's not up and running... It's not on until there is a writer on the project. There is no writer on Indy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yep," [...] said Flannagan, [...] "I see; but I ain't tryin' to crab your game. I ain't {{down here}} after you this trip. Where you been, anyway, that you don't know the war's over?

6000|$|... “Yes. But {{your idea}} of assurances over there,” said the great man, with a contemptuous {{wave of his hand}} towards a window giving on the broad thoroughfare, “seems to consist mainly in making the Secretary of State look a fool.
