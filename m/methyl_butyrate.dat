40|$|We {{have used}} the effects of self- and cross-adaptation on the unitary {{responses}} of olfactory receptors of the tiger salamander to odor stimulation to investigate the stimulus-specific components of these responses and {{to provide information about}} the cross-cell variations in the numbers and numbers of types of constitutent receptive sites. An olfactometer delivered sequential odorous pulses, either juxtaposed or separated by a variable time delay. We used four pairs of odorants judged to be similar within a given pair. The unitary response to the test stimulation relative to that of the conditioning stimulation varied from being unchanged to being completely eliminated. We sometimes observed substantial poststimulus increases in the firing rate following stimulation with juxtaposed odorous pulse. Except in the case of one odorant pair, cross-adaptation occurred both with juxtaposed pulses and with pulses separated in time. With the <b>methyl</b> butyrate/ethyl <b>butyrate</b> odorant pair, however, statistically significant cross-adaptation appeared only with juxtaposed pulses. We propose a simple model to aid in explaining these phenomena.

Although not considered a major dental pathogen on its own, this anaerobe facilitates the aggregation and establishment of several other species including the dental pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus. The F. nucleatum strain ATCC 25586 genome was assembled from shotgun sequences and analyzed using the ERGO bioinformatics suite ([URL] The genome contains 2. 17 Mb encoding 2, 067 open reading frames, organized on a single circular chromosome with 27 % GC content. Despite its taxonomic position among the gram-negative bacteria, several features of its core metabolism are {{similar to that of}} gram-positive Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., and Lactococcus spp. The genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid, amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. Nine very-high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence, none of which has been reported in the literature. More than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides, sugars, metal ions, and cofactors have been identified. Biosynthetic pathways exist for only three amino acids: glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine. The remaining amino acids are imported as such or as di- or oligopeptides that are subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm. A principal source of energy appears to be the fermentation of glutamate to butyrate. Additionally, desulfuration of cysteine and methionine yields ammonia, H 2 S, <b>methyl</b> mercaptan, and <b>butyrate,</b> which are capable of arresting fibroblast growth, thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the gingival epithelium.

40|$|Carboxylesterase [EC 3. 1. 1. 1] was {{purified}} from rabbit liver lysosomes {{by means}} of detergent solubilization, and by hydroxyapatite, phenyl-Sepharose and chromato-focusing column chromatographies. The purified enzyme appeared to be homo-geneous on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and its molecular weight {{was estimated to be}} 58, 000. This enzyme was eluted at an isoelectric point of approxi-mately 5. 8 by chromatofocusing, and exhibited a broad pH optimum of between 6. 0 and 9. 0. The enzyme hydrolyzed 4 -methylumbelliferyl esters of saturated fatty acids (Cj-Cu), and it also hydrolyzed p-nitrophenylacetate, <b>methyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> and tributyrin, but not acetanilide. Its activity was completely inhibited by diisopropyl-fluorophosphate (DFP) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at 10 - 4 M, but was not affected by eserine, or by a- or 0 -naphthyl acetate at 10 ~s M.

40|$|The lack {{of ideal}} photosensitizers limits the {{clinical}} application of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Here we report the PDT efficiency of dicyanomethylene substituted benzothiazole squaraine derivatives. This class of squaraine derivatives possess strong absorption and long excitation and emission wavelengths (ex/em, 685 / 720  nm). They show negligible dark toxicity, but can generate singlet oxygen under irradiation {{resulting in the}} apoptosis and necrosis of cells (phototoxicity). Changing the side chains of these compounds greatly influences their albumin-binding rate, cellular uptake and their phototoxicity. One of the squaraine derivatives with two <b>methyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> side chains shows high PDT efficiency in a mouse subcutaneous xenograft model under the irradiation of a 690  nm laser. These results show the great potential of dicyanomethylene substituted benzothiazole squaraines to be the leading compound of near-infrared photosensitizers in PDT...|$|E
40|$|Four pyrrolidium (PY) -based ILs were {{synthesized}} from TFSI ions and PY ions functionalized by butyl, butyronitrile, pentenyl, and <b>methyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> as an electrolyte for Li ion batteries. The ILs {{with a lower}} Tm had a {{much higher}} viscosity and lower conductivity because of the biased electron distribution in their quaternary ammonium cations. The potential windows of the ILs demonstrated stability above 5. 0 V {{and all of the}} synthesized ILs showed evidence of forming a SEI layer on the graphite electrode. The peak currents for reduction on the graphite electrode and for oxidation on the LiCoO 2 electrode were 100 times stronger in PY(butyl) TFSI and PY(pentenyl) TFSI than in PY(butyronitrile) TFSI and PY(methyl butyrate) TFSI. This difference resulted from the electrolyte conductivity which is deeply related to the solvation strength between Li ions and the functional groups of the ILs...|$|E
40|$|To {{maintain}} {{high conductivity}} in low temperatures, electrolyte co-solvents {{have been designed}} to have a high dielectric constant, low viscosity, adequate coordination behavior, and appropriate liquid ranges and salt solubilities. Electrolytes that contain ester-based co-solvents in large proportion (greater than 50 percent) and ethylene carbonate (EC) in small proportion (less than 20 percent) improve low-temperature performance in MCMB carbon-LiNiCoO 2 lithium-ion cells. These co-solvents have been demonstrated to enhance performance, especially at temperatures down to 70 C. Low-viscosity, ester-based co-solvents were incorporated into multi-component electrolytes of the following composition: 1. 0 M LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) + ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) + X (1 : 1 : 8 volume percent) [where X = <b>methyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (MB), ethyl butyrate EB, methyl propionate (MP), or ethyl valerate (EV) ]. These electrolyte formulations result in improved low-temperature performance of lithium-ion cells, with dramatic results at temperatures below 40 C...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatiles}} of the kawista fruit (wood apple) {{were analyzed}} by gas chromatography (GC) and a combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Character impact odorants of the fruits were systematically characterized by aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) with GC-Olfactometry (GC-O). A total of 75 compounds were identified, including 28 esters, 11 alcohols, 10 aldehydes, 1 acetal, 10 ketones, 4 lactones, 1 heterocyclic, 4 aliphatic hydrocarbons, 1 furan and 5 acids. However, only 44 volatiles were detected by GC-O. Among these, compounds with the most impact were ethyl butyrate (fruity, sweet, banan-like) and <b>methyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (fruit, sour) with a flavor dilution factor of 256 and 64, respectively. Based on AEDA results, butyric acid, 3 -mathyl valeric acid, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, pentyl isobutyrate, 2 -ethyl hexanoic acid, ethyl octanoate, gamma-decalactone, 2, 3 -pentanedione, 3 -octanone, 5 -methyl- 3 -heptanone, 9 -methyl- 5 -undecene and (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate seem to contribute to kawista fruit flavo...|$|E
40|$|Lipase of Mucor pusillus NRRL 2543 was {{recovered}} with ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration on Sephadex G- 75, and anion-exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A- 50. Maximal glycerol ester hydrolase (lipase) activity {{was observed at}} pH 5. 0 to 5. 5 and 50 C when trioctanoin and olive oil were used as substrates. The enzyme also showed esterase activity; it hydrolyzed, {{with the exception of}} <b>methyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> all methyl esters tested. A minimum chain length of six carbons appeared to be a requirement for esterase activity, which was maximal at about pH 5. 5 with methyl dodecanoate (C 12) as the substrate. Neither the glycerol ester hydrolase (lipase) nor the esterase activity of the enzyme appeared to be affected by thiol group inhibitors, chelating agents, and reducing compounds. On the other hand, hydrolysis of triolein and methyl dodecanoate was arrested to the same extent in the presence of diisopropyl fluorophosphate, which suggested the involvement of serine in the active center of the enzyme. The enzyme remained stable during a 30 -day storage at - 10 C...|$|E
