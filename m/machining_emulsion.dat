40|$|There are {{hundreds}} of small parts material handling problems facing the thousands of companies whose combined efforts provide the almost endless flow {{of goods and services}} to an ever-unique, ever-demanding, ever-growing, worldwide consumer market. The majority of these small parts-material handling problems involve small parts such as nuts, bolts, electronic circuit components, valves, cutting tools and oil seals. An ever-increasing number of these small parts material handling problems involve small parts of a non-traditional nature such as <b>machine</b> tool fixtures, <b>emulsion</b> chemicals, yarns, castings, rubber hose curing assemblies and tire tread casings. With this in mind, each and every individual responsible for solving their company’s day to day small parts material handling problems involving materials storage and transportation, mus...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{metal cutting}} {{industry}} {{has evolved over}} the last century to the point where an increasing range and complexity of tool holding systems and cutting fluids are available for metal machining in the market. Most of the companies report their cutting fluid cost to be between 7 - 17 % of the manufacturing cost. This is more than the tooling cost. The cutting fluids still have been used because of their better cutting performance. The proper selection of a cutting fluid and tool holding system is a factor that is sometime neglected in the machining practice. This has highlighted a need to provide an intelligent, user-friendly system of selection and recommendation that can also provide performance data for engineers and end-users. This can be achieved by testing in metal cutting operations. This work involves the performance testing of different type of cutting fluids and a findings regarding new type of hydrostatic tool-holding system. For cutting fluids testing, drilling and tapping tests were performed into aluminium alloy (AlSi 9 Cu 3) and alloy steel (SAE 52100), which are the materials extensively used in automotive industry. The objective of the experiments is to determine the function of cutting fluid in these machining operations. Tap forming (deformation of metal) operations were performed on aluminium alloy and tap cutting drilling was performed on both types of material. To investigate the role of cutting fluids seven different fluids were used. The results reveal that type and concentration of cutting fluids have effect on the torque, thrust force, tool life and surface quality. Face turning test was also performed for Build up Edge (BUE) formation and it has been seen that concentration has also an effect on BUE formation. For chip analysis, tests were performed on alloy steel with assistance of emulsion, MQL (minimum quantity lubrication) and compressed air. The results were compared to dry machining in terms of chip colour, microstructure, white-etching band formation and contact area. It was observed that both chip upper free side and chip back side had a heat- and deformation-affected zone with a thickness that varied between 10 - 20 μm. The microstructure in the white-etching band (chip back side) had a grain size varying between 50 and 400 nm for the chips that were produced by <b>machining</b> with <b>emulsion.</b> This grain size range for the emulsion-assisted cutting was smaller compared to those when machining with MQL, compressed air and dry machining. The reason is supposed to be faster cooling of the chip surfaces in contact with the cutting media. Tool-holder performance tests were done for two types of tool-holding systems in boring, hydrostatic and bolt type. It was observed that better machining stability can be achieved by hydrostatic clamping of boring bar. Such kind of solution improves quality of machining and it can contribute to increasing the productivity and reliability of the boring process. Tool life can be increased by using the hydrostatic tool-holding system for same machining parameters as compared to bolt type system...|$|R
30|$|The {{preservation}} of the wellbore stability has fundamental importance during oil and gas well drilling. About 75  % of the side walls {{of oil and gas}} wellbores consist of shale and mud rocks, which are responsible for 90  % of the wellbore instability problems (Corrêa and Nascimento 2005; Jiang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Huang et al. 2007). Several types of shales with a significant amount of clay minerals are very reactive once they come into contact with water, and they can cause serious wellbore instability during drilling, like hole shrinkage and hole sloughing and caving (Hisham 2006; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Zhang et al. 2013 a, b). Wellbore stability has been studied for a long time using mainly two quite different approaches. Some authors consider the problem exclusively {{from the point of view}} of rock mechanics and others from the point of view of chemical interactions between shales and fluids (Wu et al. 1993; Corrêa and Nascimento 2005). Based on the second approach, a variety of water-based drilling fluids and non-aqueous fluids have been applied; meanwhile, many types of wellbore stabilizers have been developed. These wellbore stabilizers have been classified into several groups, including inorganic salts, formate, polymers with special shale affinity, asphalts, sugars and sugar derivatives, glycerol, polyalcohol, and silicates (Van Oort 2003; Guo et al. 2006; Khodja et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2011; Zhong et al. 2011). Among of them, asphalts as one type of cheap and effective stabilizer can improve wellbore stabilization mainly through plugging or sealing, and they have been divided into four varieties according to modification methods: natural asphalt (no modification, mined from deposit), oxidized asphalt (oxidation by air blown to heighten softening point), sulfonated bitumen (changed into asphalt sulfonate partly to enhance water solubility), and emulsified asphalt (oil in water emulsion to improve dispersion in the drilling fluid and adsorption on the rock surface) (Sharma and Wunderlich 1987; Wang et al. 2005). All types of emulsified asphalts are mostly produced by shearing and thinning a mixture of asphalt, water, and emulsifier using an <b>emulsion</b> <b>machine</b> or a colloid mill. Ionic surfactants are often used as emulsifier, so the emulsified asphalt droplets are mostly charged and possess an electric double layer structure, according to the Stern model (Xie et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2014). Cationic emulsified asphalts have taken the place of anionic ones in drilling fluids to promote inhibition and adsorption (Shi et al. 2003; Wang and Xia 2006). In this paper, a novel cationic emulsified asphalt was investigated to overcome serious instability problems during drilling hydratable shale formations. It had good colloidal stability, particle size distribution, compatibility, sealing property, and flexible adaptability.|$|R
