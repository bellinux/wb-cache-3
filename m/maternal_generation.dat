The yellow passion fruit is an outcrossing species with self-incompatible flowers. However, the reproductive system of the sweet passion fruit (Passiflora alata) has not been well elucidated. The objective of this work was to characterize aspects of the mating system in the sweet passion fruit using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers, particularly the rate of outcrossing in P. alata progenies. A multilocus outcrossing rate of t(m) = 0. 994 was determined from RAPD and t(m) = 0. 940 from microsatellites, supporting P. alata as an outcrossing species. The fixation indices of the <b>maternal</b> <b>generation</b> (F(m)) were - 0. 200 and 0. 071 with RAPD and microsatellite loci, respectively, indicating the absence of inbreeding in the <b>maternal</b> <b>generation.</b> The paternity correlation (r(p)) varied from - 0. 008 with RAPD markers to 0. 208 with microsatellite markers, suggesting a low probability of finding full sibs within the progenies. The results demonstrated that all progenies assessed {{in this study were}} derived from outcrossing. FAPESP Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paul...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity has been increasing across the globe at an unprecedented rate, and obesity {{is associated with a}} number of diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and certain types of cancer. In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that obesity can also cause cognitive impairment, and research is increasingly aimed at elucidating both the nature of, and the mechanisms behind, these impairments in the brain. Because the hippocampus {{has been shown to be}} particularly vulnerable to these effects, both of the studies presented in this thesis aimed to investigate the effects of high-fat diet-induced obesity on hippocampal synaptic plasticity. In study 1, female rats were placed on either a high-fat diet (HFD; 45 % saturated fat) or a control diet (CD; 10 % fat) for 16 weeks, after which a subset of females were sacrificed, with the remainder being bred to investigate the transgenerational effects of HFD exposure. Body weights, food weights, and oral glucose tolerance were measured throughout the feeding period. All offspring were weaned onto a CD, and were sacrificed at PND 56. In both the maternal and offspring generations, various organ weights were collected at sacrifice, and long-term potentiation (LTP) was measured in the CA 1 dendritic field of acutely prepared hippocampal slices. Results showed impaired blood glucose tolerance as early as one month on the HFD in the <b>maternal</b> <b>generation,</b> as well as significantly heavier retroperitoneal fat pads, with no differences in body weight. LTP was also significantly impaired in HFD animals in the <b>maternal</b> <b>generation.</b> HFD offspring were trending towards increased body weight, with no differences in retroperitoneal fat pad weight or oral glucose tolerance. There were also no diet-induced differences in LTP in the offspring. Study 2 had a similar design, although the animals began feeding in adolescence (PND 28), as opposed to young adulthood (PND 56, as in study 1), to investigate the effects of critical periods of exposure. The feeding period was also shortened to 10 weeks, and the CD was changed so as to eliminate its refined sugar content. Finally, because of the longitudinal nature of the transgenerational portion of study 2, the timing was such that only data from the <b>maternal</b> <b>generation</b> is presented here. In study 2, the HFD group was significantly heavier after only one week on the diet, and had increased adiposity at sacrifice. Differences in oral glucose tolerance, however, were not apparent until after 2 months on the diet, and there were no diet-induced differences in LTP. This lack of significant electrophysiological findings is consistent with the lack of differences seen by another student in the Morris Water Maze, and suggests that the shortened feeding period in study 2 may not have allowed sufficient time for the HFD to impair synaptic function...|$|E

This is the first report from Eskimos on two key parameters in population genetics, namely, generation time (T) and effective population size (N_e). The average mother-daughter and father-son intervals were 27 and 32 years, respectively, roughly similar to the previously published generation times obtained from recent agricultural societies across the world. To gain an insight for the generation time in our distant ancestors, we calculated <b>maternal</b> <b>generation</b> time for two wild chimpanzee populations. We also provide the first comparison among three distinct approaches (genealogy, variance and life table methods) for calculating N_e, which resulted in slightly differing values for the Eskimos.

25|$|Human mtDNA {{can also}} be used to help {{identify}} individuals. Forensic laboratories occasionally use mtDNA comparison to identify human remains, and especially to identify older unidentified skeletal remains. Although unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA is not specific to one individual, it can be used in combination with other evidence (anthropological evidence, circumstantial evidence, and the like) to establish identification. mtDNA is also used to exclude possible matches between missing persons and unidentified remains. Many researchers believe that mtDNA is better suited to identification of older skeletal remains than nuclear DNA because the greater number of copies of mtDNA per cell increases the chance of obtaining a useful sample, and because a match with a living relative is possible even if numerous <b>maternal</b> <b>generations</b> separate the two. American outlaw Jesse James's remains were identified using a comparison between mtDNA extracted from his remains and the mtDNA of the son of the female-line great-granddaughter of his sister.

40|$|Through {{maternal}} effects, {{information about}} environmental conditions {{experienced in the}} <b>maternal</b> <b>generation</b> can be transmitted to subsequent generations. Although maternal effects have been described and quantified in many mammalian species, the underlying causal links are often under-studied. The close association between mother and neonate during the extended period of lactation in mammals provides a unique opportunity for mothers to influence offspring phenotype through nutrient provisioning of milk. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine sources of inter-individual variation in milk composition and impacts on offspring phenotype and survival. Variation in fat content, protein content, and energy density of mother’s milk was associated with timing of reproduction. Mothers with intermediate birthdates produced milk that was higher in fat and energy density, but lower in protein than females with early or late birthdates. In turn, the pattern of change in milk composition affected juvenile overwinter survival. The protein content of Columbian ground squirrel milk typically increases to peak lactation and then declines before weaning. Pups consuming milk that was lower in protein in early lactation but then relatively high in protein at peak and late lactation had a higher probability of survival overwinter.

40|$|Corn (Zea mays L.) is {{cultivated}} in large areas and {{considered one of}} the world's major cereal crops. There are several arthropod pests that can reduce its production such as the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lep. : Noctuidae), which is considered to be the main pest for corn. Fall armyworm is primarily controlled by insecticides. The use of biological control agents to manage this pest is growing with an emphasis on the egg parasitoid Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hym. : Trichogrammatidae). Thus, the aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of the following insecticides (g ai L- 1) beta-cypermethrin (0. 03), chlorfenapyr (0. 60), chlorpyrifos (0. 96), spinosad (0. 16), etofenprox (0. 10), triflumuron (0. 08), alfa-cypermethrin/teflubenzuron (0. 0425 / 0. 0425), and lambda-cyhalothrin/thiamethoxam (0. 11 / 0. 083) on survival, sex ratio, reproduction, and T. pretiosum offspring.

A SNP in the gene encoding integrin β 3 causes a clinically important maternal-paternal antigenic difference; Leu 33 generates the human platelet antigen 1 a (HPA- 1 a), whereas Pro 33 generates HPA- 1 b. As a potential treatment to prevent fetal intracranial hemorrhage in HPA- 1 a alloimmunized pregnancies, we generated an antibody that blocks the binding of maternal HPA- 1 a–specific antibodies to fetal HPA- 1 a 1 b platelets by combining a high-affinity human HPA- 1 a–specific scFv (B 2) with an IgG 1 constant region modified to minimize Fcγ receptor–dependent platelet destruction (G 1 Δnab). B 2 G 1 Δnab saturated HPA- 1 a+ platelets and substantially inhibited binding of clinical HPA- 1 a–specific sera to HPA- 1 a+ platelets. The response of monocytes to B 2 G 1 Δnab-sensitized platelets was substantially less than their response to unmodified B 2 G 1, as measured by chemiluminescence. In addition, B 2 G 1 Δnab inhibited chemiluminescence induced by B 2 G 1 and HPA- 1 a–specific sera. In a chimeric mouse model, B 2 G 1 and polyclonal Ig preparations from clinical HPA- 1 a–specific sera reduced circulating HPA- 1 a+ platelets, concomitant with transient thrombocytopenia. As the Δnab constant region is uninformative in mice, F(ab′) 2 B 2 G 1 was used as a proof of principle blocking antibody and prevented the in vivo platelet destruction seen with B 2 G 1 and polyclonal HPA- 1 a–specific antibodies.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of genetic variability {{from the interior}} towards the periphery of a species' range is {{of great interest to}} evolutionary biologists. Although it has been long presumed that population genetic variation should decrease as a species' range is approached, results of empirical investigations still remain ambiguous. Knowledge regarding patterns of genetic variability as well as affected factors is particularly not conclusive in plants. To determine genetic divergence in peripheral populations of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon Griff. from China, genetic diversity and population structure were studied in five northern & northeastern peripheral and 16 central populations using six microsatellite loci. We found that populations resided at peripheries of the species possessed markedly decreased microsatellite diversity than those located in its center. Population size was observed to be positively correlated with microsatellite diversity. Moreover, there are significantly positive correlations between levels of microsatellite diversity and distances from the northern and northeastern periphery of this species. To investigate genetic structure and heterozygosity variation between generations of O. rufipogon, a total of 2382 progeny seeds from 186 maternal families were further assayed from three peripheral and central populations, respectively. Peripheral populations exhibited significantly lower levels of heterozygosities than central populations for both seed and <b>maternal</b> <b>generations.</b> In comparisons with maternal samples, significantly low observed heterozygosity (HO) and high heterozygote deficit within populations (FIS) values were detected in seed samples from both peripheral and central populations. Significantly lower observed heterozygosity (HO) and higher FIS values were further observed in peripheral populations than those in central populations for seed samples. The results indicate an excess of homozygotes and thus high inbreeding depression in peripheral populations. Our results together suggest that historical contraction of geographical range, demographic changes, and environmental conditions near the northern and northeastern margins of O. rufipogon favor inbreeding and possibly selfing, leading to the rapidly decreased effective population size. Genetic drift, reduced gene flow, and possible local selection, consequently lead to lowered gene diversity, accelerated genetic divergence and increased inbreeding depression found in peripheral populations of O. rufipogon. Given these characteristics observed, northern and northeastern peripheral populations deserve relatively different conservation strategies for either germplasm sampling of ex situ conservation or setting in situ reserves for the adaptation to possible environmental changes and the future germplasm utilization of wild rice...|$|R
40|$|The Daphnia galeata {{population}} in Lake Biwa (Japan) had almost ceased producing resting eggs by the 1980 s. To examine whether D. galeata {{had lost the}} ability to produce resting eggs, or if chemical contamination was inhibiting resting egg production, individuals collected in fall (November) and late winter (March), were reared in the laboratory. More than 50 % of these D. galeata individuals produced resting eggs irrespective of the month of collection, when reared with food supplied at a level lower than that available during the <b>maternal</b> <b>generation.</b> The results reflect that D. galeata in Lake Biwa have a high ability to produce resting eggs when appropriate stimuli are provided. As chemical substances, such as endocrine disrupters, are known to inhibit resting egg production in Daphnia and these accumulate in lake sediments, we tested whether Daphnia individuals produce resting eggs when reared in sediment-conditioned lake water. In sediment-conditioned lake water, only a few Daphnia that were collected in March produced resting eggs, while 50 % of the individuals collected in November produced resting eggs. Thus, D. galeata collected from Lake Biwa are able to produce resting eggs, but genetic variation likely leads to variation in resting egg production in the presence of chemical contaminants. These results suggest that the recent decrease in the resting egg production of Daphnia populations in lake Biwa is mainly due to a decrease in the strength of the environmental queue that stimulates resting egg production rather than a genetic shift to strains that have a lower ability to produce resting eggs; yet, we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} a chemical contamination plays a role in the decrease of resting egg production...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Polyandry is {{widespread}} throughout the animal kingdom. In {{the absence of}} direct benefits of mating with different males, the underlying basis for polyandry is enigmatic because it can carry considerable costs such as elevated exposure to sexual diseases, physical injury or other direct fitness costs. Such costs may be balanced by indirect genetic benefits to the offspring of polyandrous females. We investigated polyandry and patterns of parentage in the spider Stegodyphus lineatus. This species experiences relatively high levels of inbreeding {{as a result of}} its spatial population structure, philopatry and limited male mating dispersal. Polyandry may provide an opportunity for post mating inbreeding avoidance that reduces the risk of genetic incompatibilities arising from incestuous matings. However, multiple mating carries direct fitness costs to females suggesting that genetic benefits must be substantial to counter direct costs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genetic parentage analyses in two populations from Israel and a Greek island, showed mixed-brood parentage in approximately 50 % of the broods. The number of fathers ranged from 1 - 2 indicating low levels of multiple parentage and there was no evidence for paternity bias in mixed-broods from both populations. Microsatellite loci variation suggested limited genetic variation within populations, especially in the Greek island population. Relatedness estimates among females in the <b>maternal</b> <b>generation</b> and potentially interacting individuals were substantial indicating full-sib and half-sib relationships. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Three lines of evidence indicate limited potential to obtain substantial genetic benefits in the form of reduced inbreeding. The relatively low frequency of multiple parentage together with low genetic variation among potential mates and the elevated risk of mating among related individuals as corroborated by our genetic data suggest that there are limited actual outbreeding opportunities for polyandrous females. Polyandry in S. lineatus is thus unlikely to be maintained through adaptive female choice...|$|E
40|$|Species {{that depend}} on ephemeral habitat often evolve {{distinct}} dispersal strategies in which the propensity to disperse is closely integrated with a suite of morphological, behavioural and physiological traits that influence colonizing ability. These strategies are maintained by natural selection resulting from spatial and temporal variation in resource abundance and are particularly evident during range expansion. Yet the mechanisms that maintain close alignment of such strategies with resource availability, integrate suites of dispersal traits and generate variability in dispersal propensity are rarely known. Breeding females can influence offspring phenotype in response to changes in current environmental conditions, making maternal effects uniquely suited to bridge fluctuations in resource abundance in the <b>maternal</b> <b>generation</b> and variation in offspring dispersal ability. Western bluebirds' (Sialia mexicana) dependence on nest cavities—an ephemeral resource—has led {{to the evolution of}} two distinct dispersal phenotypes: aggressive males that disperse and non-aggressive males that remain philopatric and cooperate with their relatives. Over the last 40 years, western bluebirds rapidly expanded their geographical range, providing us with an opportunity to test, in newly established populations, the importance of maternal effects for generating variability in dispersal propensity. Here, I show that, under variable resource conditions, breeding females group offspring of different competitive ability in different positions in the egg-laying order and, consequently, produce aggressive males that are more likely to disperse when resources are low and non-aggressive philopatric males when resources are abundant. I then show experimentally that the association between resource availability and sex-specific birth order is robust across populations. Thus, this maternal effect enables close tracking of resource availability and may explain how variation in dispersal is generated in newly colonized populations. More generally, these results suggest that, as a key source of variation in colonizing phenotypes, maternal effects are of crucial importance for understanding the dynamics of range expansion...|$|E

During pregnancy, the autoantibodies cross the placenta and affect the fetus {{in which a}} potentially lethal atrioventricular (AV) block may develop. This thesis is aimed at identifying clinically useful maternal serologic markers predictive of risk for CHB, and to define genes linked to susceptibility in the child. Ro 52 -p 200 antibodies, binding amino acid 200 - 239 of the Ro 52 protein, was recently suggested by our group as a marker for high risk pregnancies. Performing a multinational study we now show that p 200 antibodies are highly relevant as a second step analysis in Ro 52 -positive pregnancies, and increase the positive predictive value for fetal cardiac involvement. The incidence of CHB in Ro/La positive women is 1 - 2 %. This risk is only increased to 20 % in subsequent pregnancies despite persisting antibodies, indicating {{that there are other}} factors involved in disease susceptibility than antibody specificity alone. Ro/La antibody levels and Ro 52 subclass profiles were investigated longitudinally through pregnancies and revealed no significant differences between affected and healthy pregnancy outcomes. There were no significant decreases or peaks in antibody levels corresponding to or preceding the time point when CHB is usually detected. We therefore investigated differences in fetal susceptibility to CHB. Fetal genetic factors in susceptibility to CHB have been suggested, but not previously investigated experimentally, To investigate MHC and non-MHC associations of the disease, an immunization model of CHB was established in rat. Analysis of MHC and non-MHC genetic influences using congenic rat strains and an F 2 cross revealed significant associations with MHC encoded genes. <b>Maternal</b> <b>generation</b> of pathogenic antibody specificity was linked to a specific MHC haplotype, whereas fetal susceptibility to development of CHB was linked to a separate MHC haplotype in the fetus. Patterns of inheritance also indicated a possible epigenetic influence in susceptibility to CHB. Our data suggest complex genetic prerequisites for susceptibility, and explain why simple associations with MHC genes have not been observed in human studies of CHB. The cellular function of the Ro 52 autoantigen was also investigated. We show that Ro 52 is an E 3 ubiquitin ligase and using a panel of Ro 52 monoclonal antibodies which was generated, we show that R 52 locates predominantly to the cytoplasm. Stimulation of cells with the systemic autoimmune-related cytokine IFN-alpha induced translocation of Ro 52 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which preceded apoptosis of the cells. In summary, we identify Ro 52 -p 200 antibodies as a clinically useful marker for risk of CHB and show that fetal susceptibility to these pathogenic autoantibodies depend on fetal MHC-encoded genes. We also demonstrate that Ro 52 is an E 3 ligase, and that cytokines involved in systemic autoimmunity regulate the cellular localization of the Ro 52 autoantigen...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{exponential}} increase in the emerging literature on the neuropeptide oxytocin {{in the development of}} both childhood and adult mental health problems in recent years. One line of research stems from the observation that maternal depression following childbirth may have long-term negative consequences for infant development, through dysfunctional parenting as well as genetic transmission (1). The oxytocin system in the infant brain is exquisitely influenced in early life by parenting behavior through an extragenomic feedback loop that can occur across <b>generations.</b> <b>Maternal</b> oxytocin promotes socially synchronous parenting behaviors, which in turn shape the infant’s oxytocin system. Thus, maternal depression may disrupt oxytocin and social synchrony in the mother and subsequently in the infant (2). Further, genetic variations of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) influence prosocial behaviors and risk for disorders characterized by disruptions in social synchrony and functioning; the A allele confers resilience to early mothering deprivation, whereas the G allele confers risk for depressive and autism spectrum disorders as well as an avoidant attachmen...|$|R
40|$|Cross-fostering {{studies in}} the rat have {{illustrated}} {{the importance of the}} postnatal environment in mediating the transmission of maternal licking/grooming (LG) from mother to offspring. The authors addressed the question of how postweaning social conditions can alter the patterns of maternal behavior. Juvenile female offspring of high LG and low LG mothers were placed in either standard, enriched, or impoverished postweaning environments for 50 consecutive days and then mated and observed with their own litters. Analysis of LG behavior indicated that the effect of postweaning environment was dependent on the level of postnatal mother–infant interaction. Postweaning isolation reduced exploratory behavior, maternal LG, and oxytocin receptor binding in the offspring of high LG mothers, whereas social enrichment enhanced exploration, LG behavior, and oxytocin receptor binding of low LG offspring. These effects were also transmitted to the next generation of offspring. Thus, maternal LG and the neural mechanisms that regulate this behavior exhibited a high degree of plasticity in response to changes in environment both within and beyond the postnatal period, with implications for the transmission of behavioral response to novelty and <b>maternal</b> care across <b>generations...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity {{and related}} conditions, notably subfertility, are {{increasingly}} prevalent. Paternal influences {{are known to}} influence offspring health outcome, but the impact of paternal obesity and subfertility on the reproductive health of subsequent generations has been overlooked. METHODS: A high-fat diet (HFD) was used to induce obesity but not diabetes in male C 57 Bl 6 mice, which were subsequently mated to normal-weight females. First-generation offspring were raised on a control diet and their gametes were investigated for signs of subfertility. Second-generation offspring were generated from both first generation sexes and their gametes were similarly assessed. RESULTS: We demonstrate a HFD-induced paternal initiation of subfertility in {{both male and female}} offspring of two generations of mice. Furthermore, we have shown that diminished reproductive and gamete functions are transmitted through the first generation paternal line to both sexes of the second generation and via the first <b>generation</b> <b>maternal</b> line to second-generation males. Our previous findings that founder male obesity alters the epigenome of sperm, could provide a basis for the developmental programming of subfertility in subsequent generations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first observation of paternal transmission of diminished reproductive health to future generations and could have significant implications for the transgenerational amplification of subfertility observed worldwide in humans.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Intergenerational 'mismatch' and/or growth {{conditions}} may {{be relevant to}} the epidemic of diabetes in developing populations. In a rapidly developing southern Chinese population, we tested whether maternal environment, proxied by maternal literacy, or family socio-economic position (SEP), proxied by paternal literacy, were associated with fasting glucose and diabetes. To assess if intergenerational mismatch contributed, we tested whether the associations varied by life course SEP. METHODS: In 19, 818 older (>/= 50 years) adults from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (phases 2 and 3), we used censored and logistic regression to assess the associations of maternal and paternal literacy with fasting glucose, elevated fasting glucose and diabetes and whether these associations varied by sex, age or life course SEP. RESULTS: Maternal, but not paternal, literacy was negatively associated with fasting plasma glucose (beta-coefficient - 0. 06 mmol/l, 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 11 to - 0. 01) and elevated fasting glucose (odds ratio (OR) 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 86 - 0. 99) adjusted for age, sex, study phase, life course SEP, childhood growth, adiposity, number of offspring, and birth order. Associations of maternal and paternal literacy with fasting glucose, elevated fasting glucose and diabetes did not vary by sex, age or life course SEP. CONCLUSION: Offspring of literate mothers had lower risk for impaired glucose tolerance than offspring of illiterate mothers. Being raised by literate mothers may {{increase the likelihood of}} children with higher SEP and lower long-term disease risk, or better <b>maternal</b> conditions over <b>generations</b> may be associated with lower fasting glucose. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial {{oxidative}} phosphorylation (OXPHOS) {{plays an important}} role in energy homeostasis by controlling electron transfer and ATP <b>generation.</b> <b>Maternal</b> malnutrition during pregnancy affects mitochondrial (mt) DNA-encoded OXPHOS activity in offspring, yet it is unknown whether epigenetic mechanism is involved in the transcriptional regulation of mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS genes. In this study, 14 primiparous purebred Meishan sows were fed either standard- (SP, 12 % crude protein) or low-protein (LP; 6 % crude protein) diets throughout gestation, and the hepatic expression and transcriptional regulation of mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS genes were analyzed in newborn piglets. Maternal low protein diet decreased hepatic mtDNA copy number in males, but not in females. LP male piglets had significantly higher hepatic AMP concentration and low energy charge, which was accompanied by enhanced mRNA expression of NADH dehydrogenase subunits 6, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, 2, 3 and cytochrome b, as well as increased cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity. In contrast, LP female piglets showed significantly lower hepatic AMP concentrations and higher energy charge with no alterations in OXPHOS gene expression. Moreover, LP males demonstrated higher glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding to the mtDNA promoter compared with SP males, which was accompanied by lower cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation on mtDNA promoter. Interestingly, opposite changes were seen in females, which showed diminished GR binding and enriched cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation on mtDNA promoter. These results suggest that maternal low protein diet during pregnancy causes sex-dependent epigenetic alterations in mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS gene expression, possibly GR is involved in mtDNA transcription regulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} fetal origins of adult disease was first {{proposed}} in 1989 {{and in the}} decades since, {{a wide range of}} other diseases from obesity to asthma have been found to originate in early development. As mammalian oocyte development begins in fetal life {{it has been suggested that}} environmental and lifestyle factors of the mother could directly impact the fertility of subsequent generations. Cigarette smoke is a known ovotoxicant in active smokers, yet disturbingly 13 % of Australian and 12 % of US women continue to smoke throughout pregnancy. The focus of our investigation was to characterize the adverse effects of smoking on ovary and oocyte quality in female offspring exposed in utero. Pregnant mice were nasally exposed to cigarette smoke for 12 wk throughout pregnancy/lactation and ovary and oocyte quality of the F 1 (<b>maternal</b> smoke exposed) <b>generation</b> was examined. Neonatal ovaries displayed abnormal somatic cell proliferation and increased apoptosis leading to a reduction in follicle numbers. Further investigation found that altered somatic cell proliferation and reduced follicle number continued into adulthood, however, apoptosis did not. This reduction in follicles resulted in decreased oocyte numbers, with these oocytes found to have elevated levels of oxidative stress, altered metaphase II spindle and reduced sperm-egg interaction. These ovarian and oocyte changes ultimately lead to subfertility with maternal smoke exposed animals having smaller litters whilst taking longer to conceive. In conclusion our results demonstrate that in utero and lactational exposure to cigarette smoke can have long lasting effects on the fertility of the next generation of females...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{origin of}} complex adaptations {{is one of}} the most {{controversial}} questions in biology. Environmental induction of novel phenotypes, where phenotypic retention of adaptive developmental variation is enabled by organismal complexity and homeostasis, can be a starting point in the evolution of some adaptations, but empirical examples are rare. Comparisons of populations that differ in historical recurrence of environmental induction can offer insight into its evolutionary significance, and recent colonization of North America by the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) provides such an opportunity. Results In both native (southern Arizona) and newly established (northern Montana, 18 generations) populations, breeding female finches exhibit the same complex adaptation – a sex-bias in ovulation sequence – in response to population-specific environmental stimulus of differing recurrence. We document that, in the new population, the adaptation is induced by a novel environment during females' first breeding and is subsequently retained across breeding attempts. In the native population, first-breeding females expressed a precise adaptive response to a recurrent environmental stimulus without environmental induction. We document strong selection on environmental cue recognition in both populations and find that rearrangement of the same proximate mechanism – clustering of oocytes that become males and females – can enable an adaptive response to distinct environmental stimuli. Conclusion The results show that developmental plasticity induced by novel environmental conditions confers significant fitness advantages to both <b>maternal</b> and offspring <b>generations</b> and might play an important role not only in the successful establishment of this invasive species across the widest ecological range of extant birds, but also can link environmental induction and genetic inheritance in the evolution of novel adaptations. </p...|$|R

Some maternal health services indicator such as Antenatal Care (ANC) and delivery assistant, while pregnancy/delivery complications and Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMRatio) are the key indicators that reflect maternal health condition. The objections of this article are discussing the achievement of maternal health status such as ANC, birth attendant, place delivery, pregnancy/delivery complications and cause of maternal death. Analyze of trend of coverage maternal health service programme and maternalmorbidity used the Indonesia Demography Health Survey (IDHS) 1991 - 2007 data. The analyzed of MMRatio used 2002 - 03 and 2007 IDHS data which are calculated with Proportion of Maternal of Death Female (PMDF) approach. The analysis of maternal cause of death used mortality data from Household Health Survey in 2001 and Baseline Health Survey data in 2007. The result in 16 years, showed that the antenatal care of pregnant women in first trimester has been increased twice. Delivery in home decreased from 79 % to 53 %. The most pregnancy complication is haemorrage and the most delivery complication is long labor. The MMRatio with PMDF calculation in 2003 is 413 per 100. 000 live birth and in 2007 is 270 per 100. 000 live birth.
