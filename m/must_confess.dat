Charlie discourages her, warning that she will lose her job, and they begin to fight over {{financial}} issues. Kate lashes back {{that she would never}} depend on Charlie's parents' money and that she has struggled her whole life. Kate decides to tell Mrs. Barnes the truth and is fired. In a bar, she relapses. Jenny and Dave drive her home, where she starts an altercation with Charlie.|$|E
5|$|I <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> that, {{like many}} others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|When {{a patient}} {{unexpectedly}} dies in his care, Oliver breaks down. He confesses to Penny that he cheated {{in medical school}} by swapping one of their exam papers, so he passed on her merit while {{she was forced to}} repeat a year. Furious, Penny tells Oliver that he <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry). He writes a letter of resignation, but deletes it after a positive day working alongside Frieda, who encourages him to repeat his F2 year. After giving Oliver a final chance to confess, Penny is called away to the site of a train crash. Oliver is left alone on AAU, where he successfully performs a difficult procedure. Hopeful that Penny will forgive him, Oliver is devastated to learn that she has been killed in an accident at the crash site. Unable to cope in the aftermath of her death, Oliver turns to drugs and alcohol. He sends Hanssen a letter of resignation, which includes a full confession. His father Tony (Simon Shepherd) offers him money to choose a new career, and claims that Oliver always had more potential than Penny. This angers Oliver, who endangers his own life to save a patient and feels reinvigorated. Hanssen is impressed by Oliver's patient treatment, and overlooks his cheating to allow him a fresh start.|$|E

25|$|Delivering a eulogy for a {{close friend}} and for someone who was so much admired is never a happy occasion. Though I <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> I would be quite happy to deliver a eulogy for a certain media {{personality}} who's tried the second Kennedy assassination of our time... and failed.|$|E
25|$|In 1215, the Fourth Council of the Lateran canon 21 {{required}} that every Christian who {{has reached the}} age of discretion <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> all their sins {{at least once a year}} to their own priest. Canon 21 confirmed earlier legislation and custom, but has been misattributed as the first time sacramental confession was required. The specification to a person's own parish priest was later dropped.|$|E
25|$|The War whoop of anarchy, the Marseillais Hymn, is to my ear, I <b>must</b> <b>confess,</b> {{independently}} of all moral association, a most dismal, flat, and unpleasing ditty: and to any ear {{it is at}} any rate a long winded and complicated one. In the instance of a melody so mischievous in its application, it is a fortunate incident, if, in itself, it should be doomed neither in point of universality, nor permanence, to gain equal hold on the affections of the people.|$|E

25|$|The ritual book on {{pastoral}} {{care of the}} sick provides three rites: anointing outside Mass, anointing within Mass, and anointing in a hospital or institution. The rite of anointing outside Mass begins with a greeting by the priest, followed by sprinkling of all present with holy water, if deemed desirable, and a short instruction. There follows a penitential act, as {{at the beginning of}} Mass. If the sick person wishes to receive the sacrament of penance, it is preferable that the priest make himself available for this during a previous visit; but if the sick person <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> during the celebration of the sacrament of anointing, this confession replaces the penitential rite A passage of Scripture is read, and the priest may give a brief explanation of the reading, a short litany is said, and the priest lays his hands on the head of the sick person and then says a prayer of thanksgiving over the already blessed oil or, if necessary, blesses the oil himself.|$|E
25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – <b>must</b> <b>confess.</b> They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{said his}} wife has had a {{stabilizing}} effect on his life, and attributes his 1986 decision to give up alcohol to her influence. While Governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, [...] "I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and {{willing to put up}} with my rough edges, and I <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> has smoothed them off over time." ...|$|E

500|$|The boy was baptised at the Church of St Nicolas, Guildford, and {{was named}} after his godfather, Pelham von Donop. Wodehouse wrote in 1957, [...] "If you ask {{me to tell you}} frankly if I like the name Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, I <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> that I do not.... I was named after a godfather, and not a thing to show for it but a small silver mug which I lost in 1897." [...] The first name was rapidly elided to [...] "Plum", the name by which Wodehouse became known to family and friends.|$|E
500|$|Henneberger gave Weird Tales the {{subtitle}} [...] "The Unique Magazine" [...] {{from the first}} issue. [...] Henneberger had been hoping for submissions of [...] "off-trail", or unusual, material. [...] He later recalled talking to three well-known Chicago writers, Hamlin Garland, Emerson Hough, and Ben Hecht, each of whom had said they avoided writing stories of [...] "fantasy, the bizarre, and the outré" [...] because of the likelihood of rejection by existing markets. He added [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> that the main motive in establishing Weird Tales was to give the writer free rein to express his innermost feelings in a manner befitting great literature".|$|E
500|$|Lost critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine {{noted that}} like the season premiere, the episode [...] "mostly serves to add uncomfortable {{wrinkles}} {{to one of}} the show's saints, {{going so far as to}} make the consistently sympathetic Sun quite unlikable." [...] He added [...] "While I... question the need for the flashbacks, I <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> to finding this particular episode more wonderfully twisted than usual." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "Last week's Jin/Sun episode was something of a disappointment, not because it was a bad episode of Lost, per se (I would give it a solid B), but because it wasn't as good as the exhilarating season premiere (which I would give an A+)." ...|$|E

500|$|Lang's career {{ambition}} {{from early}} in life was to practise law, enter politics and then take office in some future Conservative administration. [...] In 1887 he began his studies for the English Bar, working in the London chambers of W.S. Robson, a future Attorney-General, whose [...] "vehement radicalism was an admirable stimulus and corrective to [...] liberal Conservatism". During these years Lang was largely aloof from religion, but continued churchgoing out of what he termed [...] "hereditary respect". He attended services at the nonconformist City Temple church and sometimes went to St Paul's Cathedral. Of his life at that time he said: [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> that I played sometimes with those external temptations that our Christian London flaunts {{in the face of}} its young men." ...|$|E
500|$|A month later, Einstein's {{works were}} among those {{targeted}} by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, [...] "Jewish intellectualism is dead." [...] One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, [...] "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, [...] "...I <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> {{that the degree of}} their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise." [...] After moving to the U.S., he described the book burnings as a [...] "spontaneous emotional outburst" [...] by those who [...] "shun popular enlightenment," [...] and [...] "more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence." ...|$|E
500|$|Modern-day {{historians have}} {{continued}} to characterize the battle as a wholesale massacre. Mark Grimsley, {{a history professor at}} Ohio State University, concluded in 2005, based on other modern accounts, that the Battle of Bad Axe would be better termed a massacre. Kerry A. Trask's 2007 work, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, points to the writings of Wakefield as evidence that delusional beliefs about doing brave deeds and magnifying manliness spurred the U.S. forces to revel in and pursue massacring and exterminating the Sauk and Fox. Trask concluded that Wakefield's statement [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>confess,</b> that it filled my heart with gratitude and joy, to think that I had been instrumental, with many others, in delivering my country of those merciless savages, and restoring those people again to their peaceful homes and firesides," [...] was a viewpoint held by nearly all militia members.|$|E

500|$|Both {{the public}} and critics were unnerved {{by the sight of}} the work. Russell {{describes}} being shocked by [...] "images so unrelievedly awful that the mind shut with a snap at the sight of them. Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space. They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least of them were sightless." [...] Writing for Apollo magazine, Herbert Furst recalled, [...] "I, I <b>must</b> <b>confess,</b> was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that I was glad to escape from this exhibition. Perhaps it was the red [...] background that made me think of entrails, of an anatomy or a vivisection and feel squeamish. [...] The triptych caused a sensation, and overnight turned Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country.|$|E
500|$|The most {{well-documented}} early European {{team was}} founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, [...] "I founded the association late last year , with the fixed resolve of proving {{to the world that}} women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I <b>must</b> <b>confess,</b> my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." [...] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.|$|E
500|$|Historian George Herring {{argues that}} Adams {{was the most}} independent-minded of the founders. Though he aligned with the Federalists, he was {{somewhat}} a party unto himself, disagreeing with the Federalists {{as much as he}} did the Democratic-Republicans. He was often described as [...] "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: [...] " [...] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I <b>must</b> <b>confess</b> to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." [...] Adams' resolve to advance peace with France, rather than to continue hostilities, especially reduced his popularity. This {{played an important role in}} his reelection defeat, however he was so pleased with the outcome that he had it engraved on his tombstone. Adams spent much of his term at home in Massachusetts, ignoring the details of political patronage nursed by other office holders.|$|E
