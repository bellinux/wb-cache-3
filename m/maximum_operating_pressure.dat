40|$|SUMMARY: PHMSA is {{amending}} the pipeline safety regulations to prescribe safety {{requirements for the}} operation of certain gas transmission pipelines at pressures based on higher operating stress levels. The result is an increase of <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> (MAOP) over that currently allowed in the regulations. Improvements in pipeline technology assessment methodology, maintenance practices, and management processes over the past twenty-five years have significantly reduced the risk of failure in pipelines and necessitate updating the standards that govern the MAOP. This rule will generate significant public benefits by reducing the number and consequences of potential incidents and boosting the potential capacity and efficiency of pipeline infrastructure, while promoting rigorous life-cycle maintenance and investment in improved pipe technology...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{certifies}} {{several types}} of radioactive waste packages and verifies that the package designers have shown {{that there will be}} no significant chemical, galvanic, or other reactions among the package components and contents, in accordance with Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 71. 43 (d). For a transportation package containing substances that could generate hydrogen gas, the package designer should calculate the gas generation rate and ensure that it is limited to a molar quantity of no more than 5 percent by volume in the package over a 60 -day shipping period under standard temperature and pressure conditions. In addition, the <b>maximum</b> normal <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> (MNOP) of the containment vessel should be designed below the design pressure. Therefore, the MNOP calculations should include the hydrogen gas generated in the payload and released into the inner cavity. Package designers have used various approaches to estimate hydrogen gas generation and demonstrate compliance with the regulatory limits. Because it may be difficult to directly measure the hydrogen gas concentrations during transportation operations, it is important that designers use consistent and reliable methods to evaluate hydrogen gas generation. This paper presents a generic evaluation approach for estimating hydrogen generation from radiolysis and thermal decomposition in generic transportation packages. It also presents the calculation of associated MNOP induced by the potential combined effects of radiolysis, thermal decomposition, thermal expansion, and water vapor. In addition, this paper discusses a generic inerting process commonly used to control combustible gases during the normal conditions of transport.
