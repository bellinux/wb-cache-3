5|$|In Røyken {{municipal}} council, {{three of}} five representatives left the party, and a fourth, former MP Steinar <b>Maribo,</b> considered doing the same. As did Odd Magnar Brubæk, and former deputy MP Paal Bjørnestad. Terje Nyberget {{withdrew from the}} central committee in early May. The leader in the chapters in Finnmark and Nordkapp, Bjørn Magne Solvik, withdrew on 13 May. He cited a lack of liberalism, especially with regards to gay rights and immigration, as the reason. He was the only Progress Party member of a municipal council in Finnmark. <b>Maribo</b> withdrew some time in May. In late May, party secretary Hans Andreas Limi had counted 270 withdrawals, but also 76 new members. Municipal and county council member Liv Skrede left after the youth wing's national convention in July, so did Tor Mikkel Wara, Ellen Wibe, Jan Erik Fåne and Petter Bjørheim. Hordaland county council member Lene C. Møgster Løtvedt left and joined the Conservative Party in October.|$|E

50|$|In 1596 <b>Maribo's</b> parish church burned down, and {{the abbey}} church became also the parish church for the town. The abbey was closed down in 1621, and its {{buildings}} and estates given to Sorø Academy as an income property.

25|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century there was a large {{consolidation}} in the Danish brewing industry, where the larger city breweries typically bought the smaller countryside breweries. Albani was part of this development, buying smaller breweries in Odense and around the island of Funen. Later, when Albani had a near monopoly on beer distribution on Funen, Albani started acquiring breweries in other parts of the country; Sønderborg Bryghus, Bryggeriet Slotsmøllen, Baldur, and <b>Maribo</b> Bryghus, in each case, Albani taking control of the other company. Albani Breweries A/S merged with the Royal Unibrew group in 2000.|$|E
500|$|The {{issue of}} libertarianism became more {{pressing}} {{in the campaign}} for the Norwegian parliamentary election, 1993, when Carl I. Hagen said to Verdens Gang {{that he did not}} support cutting the income tax. This was not in line with official party policy, and Hagen did not confer with the party, stating that [...] "I had to take an independent initiative". Ellen Wibe openly criticized the statement, so did former MP and tax spokesperson Steinar <b>Maribo.</b> The tax statement was later seen as the most important factor contributing to the growing Hagen—liberalist schism. In the election the Progress Party won ten seats, down from 22 in the 1989 election.|$|E
2500|$|By August 1908 Weaver had {{organised}} a syndicate of ten men who {{had committed}} to paying £100 each to charter a vessel to go to Malaita Island in the Solomons, partly for treasure and partly to look for minerals that Captain Weaver said he knew to exist. [...] The Wheatsheaf was charted and Weaver represented himself as head chief or king of the island. Upon reaching the Solomons the vessel went to Aola, [...] then to Tulagi, the seat of government, and Woodford plantation. They went from there to Maululu, <b>Maribo,</b> and Sao. Here Weaver had some trouble with the natives. Weaver indicated to his investors {{that there had been}} a great earthquake which had altered the face of the island, and that his great friend the previous chief had been dead for two years.|$|E
2500|$|Queen Dowager Sophie Amalie died in February 1685. On {{the morning}} of 19 May 1685 Leonora Christina was {{informed}} that a royal order had been issued by Chancellor Frederick von Ahlfeldt (he who had reluctantly escorted her into the Tower) for her release.

For them Leonora Christina had already entered into legend [...] a royal adventuress who had been first regaled then held captive by the kings of England, Sweden and Denmark. She was sixty-three years old, and had spent twenty-one years, nine months and eleven days in the Tower.

The area then developed with warehouses and storage facilities for goods to be sent to <b>Maribo</b> and Rødby. At that time it was known as Bandholm Toldsted (Bandholm Customs Point). Initially, in view of the shallow depth of the inlet, goods had to be taken out to the sailing ships by barge but in 1834 a small jetty was built to facilitate mooring. In the early 1840s, the channel was deepened to , allowing larger ships to enter the port which was soon equipped with quays.
