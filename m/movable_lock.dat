5000|$|Dado blade: A special type of {{circular}} saw blade used for making wide-grooved cuts in wood so that the edge of another piece of wood will fit into the groove to make a joint. Some dado blades can be adjusted to make different-width grooves. A [...] "stacked" [...] dado blade, consisting of chipper blades between two dado blades, can make different-width grooves by adding or removing chipper blades. An [...] "adjustable" [...] dado blade has a <b>movable</b> <b>locking</b> cam mechanism to adjust {{the degree to which}} the blade wobbles sideways, allowing continuously variable groove widths from the lower to upper design limits of the dado.|$|R
5000|$|These gliding {{bearings}} {{consisted of}} multiple gliding blocks {{fixed on the}} windmill tower structure. These blocks maintained sliding contact with a gliding ring on the nacelle. The gliding blocks were wooden cube-like pieces with [...] gliding surface covered with animal fat, or even lined with copper (or brass) sheet as a friction reduction means. These wooden blocks were fixed in wooden slots, carved in the wooden bearing substructure, by means of nails or wedges and were carefully leveled to create a flat surface where the nacelle gliding ring could glide. The gliding blocks, despite the lubrication would wear quite often {{and would have to}} be exchanged. This operation was relatively simple due to the wedge-based connection between substructure and gliding blocks. The gliding blocks were further <b>locked</b> via <b>movable</b> <b>locking</b> devices which, in a different form, remain as a technical solution in modern gliding yaw bearings. [...] The gliding ring of the windmill nacelle was made from multiple wooden parts and, despite the old construction techniques, was usually quite level, allowing the nacelle to rotate smoothly around the tower axis.|$|R

5000|$|The HK21 is a {{selective}} fire roller-delayed blowback-operated firearm with a semi-rigid locking mechanism designed to retard the rearward {{movement of the}} bolt. This delay was achieved by artificially increasing the inertia of the bolt by using an angular, interposed transmission system, installed symmetrically to the bore axis, with two cylindrical rollers acting as transmission elements against a <b>movable</b> <b>locking</b> piece which drives the heavy bolt carrier. The two-piece bolt assembly consists of a bolt head, which contains the aforementioned rollers, and a supporting locking piece and bolt carrier. During the [...] "unlocking" [...] sequence, the bolt head receives the recoil impulse from the ignited cartridge and exerts rearward pressure against the rollers, seated in recesses in the barrel extension. The rollers are driven inward against angled ramps of the barrel extension and interact with the wedge-shaped locking piece, projecting it backwards. Thus a 4:1 transmission ratio is maintained (as long as the rollers move on the inclined surfaces of the barrel extension and locking piece) of the bolt carrier and locking piece relative to the bolt head; the bolt carrier travels backwards four {{times faster than the}} bolt head, ensuring a safe drop of pressure within the barrel prior to extraction. Since extraction is carried-out under relatively high pressure, the barrelâ€™s chamber received a series of flutes designed to help free the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber walls.|$|R
40|$|The {{space station}} {{configuration}} currently studied utilizes structures which require struts to be hinged {{in the middle}} in the stowed mode and locked into place in the deployed mode. Since {{there are hundreds of}} hinges involved, it is necessary that they have simple, positive locking features with a minimum of joint looseness or slack. This invention comprises two similar housings hinged together with a spring loaded locking member which assists in making as well as breaking the lock. This invention comprises a bracket hinge and bracket members with a spring biased and <b>movable</b> <b>locking</b> member. The locking or latch member has ear parts received in locking openings where wedging surfaces on the ear parts cooperate with complimentary surfaces on the bracket members for bringing the bracket members into a tight end-to-end alignment when the bracket members are in an extended position. When the locking member is moved to an unlocking position, pivoting of the hinge about a pivot pin automatically places the locking member to retain the locking member in an unlocked position. In pivoting the hinge from an extended position to a folded position, longitudinal spring members are placed under tension over annular rollers so that the spring tension in a folded position assists in return of the hinge from a folded to an extended position. Novelty lies {{in the creation of a}} locking hinge which allows compact storage and easy assembly of structural members having a minimal number of parts...|$|R
5000|$|Letterpress {{printing}} is {{a technique}} of relief printing using a printing press, a process by which many copies are produced by repeated direct impression of an inked, raised surface against sheets or a continuous roll of paper.

50|$|Boxes called secret boxes or puzzle {{boxes with}} secret opening {{mechanisms}} extremely popular in Japan, {{are included in}} this category. These caskets contain more or less complex, usually invisible opening mechanisms which reveal a small hollow space on opening. There is a vast variety of opening mechanisms, such as hardly visible panels which need to be shifted, inclination mechanisms, magnetic <b>locks,</b> <b>movable</b> pins which need to be rotated into a certain position up and even time locks in which an object has {{to be held in}} a given position until a liquid has filled up a certain container.|$|R
40|$|A {{remote control}} {{security}} apparatus includes a <b>lock</b> element <b>movable</b> between <b>locked</b> and unlocked positions by an electrically actuated power device. The operator {{is provided with}} a portable transmitter adapted to generate light which is interrupted at a predetermined frequency so as to produce an encoded light signal. This signal is detected by a light transceiver which generates an independent signal at the same predetermined frequency and which compares the frequencies of the detected signal and independent signal. If these frequencies are substantially the same, the transceiver actuates the power means to move the lock element to its unlocked position. The security apparatus may be advantageously installed as a door lock, in which case a lock element receiving member is secured to the door. The signal detector is positioned at the exterior {{side of the door}} for receiving encoded signals from the transmitter and an override switch may be positioned at an interior side of the door for opening the lock without a transmitter. A contact switch is disclosed which maintains the lock element in the unlocked position whenever the door is open...|$|R
25|$|When {{large-scale}} excavations of Pompeii were {{undertaken in}} the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the Romans came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the Roman Empire. They {{did not know what}} to do with the frank depictions of sexuality, and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The <b>movable</b> objects were <b>locked</b> away in the Secret Museum in Naples, and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off so as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children and the working class. England's (and the world's) first laws criminalising pornography were enacted with the passage of the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Despite their occasional repression, depictions of erotic themes have been common for millennia.|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{the purpose}} of {{describing}} the meaning and applications of deployable structures (making emphasis in the scissor-hinged and sliding mechanisms.) {{and the development of}} new geometries, details, and mechanisms that make these systems buildable and useful for architectural applications. A deployable structure is one that can be transformed, with the addition of an energy input, from a closed stage or compact configuration to a predetermined, stable expanded form. Deployable structures are suitable in response to the following needs: a- A situation {{in which there is a}} need to create enclosed or protected space for a short period of time and then move that space to another location for erection or storage. b- Difficult access places, and/or lack of labor. c- Special applications equipment and shelters for special equipment which can not be transported in full open size and needs to be erected in a very quick way. d- Need to enclose space due to variable weather conditions. e- Situations of high risk with elevated labor costs, hostile environments, costly transportation. f- Construction aid. g- As a construction method There are many mechanisms which fall into the category of deployable structures, but we can group them into two general categories: A) Struts Structures : scissor-hinged, tensile, and sliding mechanisms, etc. B) Surface Structures : folded, inflatable, telescopic, etc. The general characteristic of group A is that these structures are made out of struts which commonly work as compression, tension or bending components connected by joints or hinges. In Group B stresses are carried by surfaces. In some, cases a continuous surface carries only tension forces like, in pressurized or inflatable construction; other structures are made out of small surfaces or planes joined together by some usually flexible means of forming a continuous structure. Deployability implies an extra cost over an assembly structure due to more sophisticated, expensive, <b>movable</b> connections, <b>locking</b> mechanisms, and deployment mechanisms. This extra cost has to be balanced by the structure's greater potential for adaptability, mobility, and labor saving construction. by Carlos Henrique HernÃ¡ndez Merchan. Thesis (M. S.)

5000|$|The {{process is}} also {{commonly}} used when duplication of an element which cannot be physically duplicated is required; motion control {{is the primary}} method of featuring multiple instances of the same actor in a shot that involves camera movement. For this technique, the camera typically films exactly the same motion {{in exactly the same}} location while the actor performs different parts. A blank take (with no actor in the shot) is sometimes also taken to give compositors a reference of what parts of the shot are different in each take. This, in common film-making language, is also known as shooting a [...] "plate". In today's film, the reference take is also useful for digital manipulation of the shots, or for adding digital elements. A simple duplication shot confines each [...] "copy" [...] of an element to one part of the screen. It is far more difficult to composite the shots when the duplicate elements cross paths, though digital technology has made this easier to achieve. Several basic camera tricks are sometimes utilized with this technique, such as having the hand of a body double enter a shot to interact with the actor while the duplicate's arm is to be off-screen. For the sake of compositing, the background elements of the scene must remain identical between takes, requiring anything <b>movable</b> to be <b>locked</b> down; the blank reference take can aid in resolving any discrepancies between the other shots.|$|R
