Monáe completed the album in Atlanta at the Wondaland Studios and the famous asylum The Palace of the Dogs. Monáe has stated that the album signifies [...] "breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types". She has said of recording the album, [...] "Overall, this music came from various corners of the world—from Turkey to Prague to Atlanta—places we were on tour. While recording, we’d experiment with different sounds. Once we became engulfed in the sound, we all had an emotional connection to the album. It has definitely transformed <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> the way that I approach the stage and overall, my life".|$|E
500|$|In 1954, a young filmmaker named Roger Corman {{received}} his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists' Highway Dragnet. Corman soon independently produced his first movie, Monster from the Ocean Floor, on a $12,000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule. Among the six films {{he worked on}} in 1955, Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release, Apache Woman, and Day the World Ended, half of Arkoff and Nicholson's first twin-bill package. Corman {{would go on to}} direct over fifty feature films through 1990. As of 2007, he remained active as a producer, with more than 350 movies to his credit. Often referred to as the [...] "King of the Bs", Corman has said that [...] "to <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> I never made a 'B' movie in my life", as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures. He prefers to describe his metier as [...] "low-budget exploitation films". In later years Corman, both with AIP and as head of his own companies, would help launch the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Robert Towne, and Robert De Niro, among many others.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{many others}} in the black metal scene, Euronymous {{originally}} believed that black metal should stay underground. However, he later {{changed his mind and}} said the idea should be got rid of. He believed that the idea of staying underground came from hardcore punk and said [...] "Those who scream most about being in 'underground' is also often those who make so bad music that they don't {{have a chance to get}} big themselves". He added: [...] "I wouldn't mind making DSP big and earn a million, as long as I don't change <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and being ... If there were one million black metal fans in the world, most of them would be jerks, but there would be really many true and brutal people as well.

2500|$|Hunt {{became the}} first person elected to two {{consecutive}} four-year terms as governor, serving from 1943 to 1949. He faced hostile majorities {{in both houses of}} the legislature throughout his years as governor. The principal legislative accomplishment of his first term was the enactment of a retirement system for teachers. He repeatedly proposed a retirement system for state workers in his second term without success. During his first term, Republican U.S. Senator Edward V. Robertson charged that the Japanese citizens interned at Heart Mountain, Wyoming, were leading pampered lives and hoarding supplies. The Denver Post wrote an expose backing his complaints. Hunt dismissed that as a [...] "political story" [...] and said that [...] "food stuffs cannot be brought into a city to feed 13,500 people in a wheel barrow and it would not be good business to bring it in every day." [...] He toured the camp and said the internees' [...] "living standard was, to <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> rather disgraceful." [...] At {{the end of the war}} he wrote to the War Relocation Authority that [...] "We do not want a single one of these evacuees to remain in Wyoming." ...|$|E

I have to confess that it gratified me not a little to find the negatives for the most part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> The positives, on the other hand, declared the gifted young author to have found a manner of treatment of social life entirely new.

40|$|We {{seek the}} {{emergence}} of an encompassing vision which seemingly now lies beyond us, and I am fully persuaded that it will transcend everything which is now manifest as either dialectical or di'polar understanding.

At this stage we must seek clarity as to the actual difference between our respective quests and more particularly seek to unveil the fundamental relation between our respective categories. Cobb'ls method is more open theologically to particular and individual centers of consciousness than is my own, and this makes possible for him a prag' matic engagement and concern which is foreign to <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> theological <b>thinking.</b> But from my own point of view this closes his method to either the possibility or the actuality of a total mode of vision and experience and therefore confines bis theological homon to what I must judge to be an inverted and falle...|$|R

50|$|Cheng Yong {{considers}} himself of great enthusiasm towards realist oil painting {{as well as}} addiction and persistence. He unfolds his world with realist oil paintings, while his solid realistic skills bring his artworks more convincing. He says in his autobiography, “For the past few years, I have been trying hard to combine the modern cultural phenomenon with local traditional culture into a whole disposition, which is common in my artworks because I consider it an essence beyond the paintings and sympathetic to the audiences. In this way, I take the oil painting from a western art form into expression <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and feeling.” It is the“essence beyond the paintings” that makes his paintings touching. After many years of study, what is amazing in his painting is not the superior technique, but the aesthetics and spirits extracted from it. There is a touching power in his art present with his vivid expression, amazing and catching, which highlights the unique advantages of art. The seemingly simple expression is actually punching us {{with the sense of}} loneliness, anxiety and hesitation.|$|R
40|$|In this exegesis I have {{attempted}} to formulate a primary toolset for dramatic writing that I can apply to create dramatic structure in plays, the chief example being my play Albatross (included herein). This toolset is contingent upon Aristotle's basic tenet of drama, that "tragedy is an imitation of an action" (2002 : 10). This exegesis theorises {{that the work of}} modern writers on drama such as Spencer, Packard, Catron, Lamott, See, Hicks and many others, fundamentally accords with Aristotle on this point, such that the tools they espouse can collectively be considered a standard set for dramatic writing. Beyond this, my research has led me to {{believe that there is a}} primary subset of tools specific to creating dramatic structure. These tools, formulated from dramatic theory, best capture <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about <b>my</b> writing practice. I divide them into two types: the first, tools of creation, comprise Theme and Values; Character and their Values; Characters and Action; Character Orchestration and Obstacles; and Event and Significant Change. The second, tools of evaluation, are Passivity; Stakes; and Premise. Together these eight tools have been responsible for creating dramatic structure in the play, Albatross...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{editors of}} these CoSMoS Workshop Proceedings have {{invited us to}} {{describe}} {{the two sides of}} our joint approach to computer simulation of biological systems: the biological side and the computer science side. Irun Cohen, an immunologist, will voice the biological side; David Harel, a computer scientist, will voice the computer science side. 1 Cohen I was led to David Harel and to the tools and <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> computer science by a combination of factors emerging from my research into autoimmune diseases and the regulation of the immune system. Some of these factors are common to biology research generally and some are linked specifically to immunology and to <b>my</b> particular <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> I shall list the factors that appear to have been the most influential for me, beginning with the general and proceeding to the particular. 1. 1 The mass of experimental information staggers the imagination. A biologist who zooms out for a comprehensive view of his or her field of study is frustrated; the mass of data defies memory and intuitive understanding. It appeared clear to me that only a computer could remember all the details and might help the biologist sort them out. 1. 2 Pleiotropism and redundancy thwart understanding. Human understanding is most comfortable with one-to-one, linear causality; for example, intuition early on posited that each DNA gene sequence is expresse...|$|R
