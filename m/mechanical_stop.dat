50|$|The <b>mechanical</b> train <b>stops</b> {{have been}} found to be {{relatively}} safe with their historic models from the 19th century to be still in use in the 21st century.

50|$|On 9 June 1955, the CH-1 {{received}} CAA type-certificate 3H10. Originally {{certified as}} a two-place helicopter, stability problems at higher gross weights required additional engineering solutions. A larger, free-floating horizontal stabilizer was introduced. During forward flight, the stabilizer pivoted to a variable <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop,</b> which {{was linked to}} the fore and aft cyclic control, thereby altering the stabilizer angle of incidence during flight.

50|$|The present organ {{was created}} in 2004 and 2005 by the organ builder Goll (Lucerne / Switzerland), {{historical}} re-using existing structures. The instrument has 45 stops and three transmissions on three manuals and pedal. The disposition was created based on the Franco-baroque sound of Glis-organs. The Spieltrakturen are mechanical. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop</b> actions are equipped with electromagnets. Manual on the second chorus, the organ is playable, which is located behind the high altar. This instrument was built with 20 registers of the organ builder GF Steinmeyer & Co. (Oettingen) in 1919.|$|E
50|$|Other {{variations}} {{and improvements}} on the electromagnetic locks have been developed. The most remarkable is the shear lock, where the armature {{does not directly}} pull off the face, but the load is instead in shear, like a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop.</b> The shear magnetic lock allows a door to swing in both directions, {{as opposed to the}} original (and now ubiquitous) direct pull type, which normally works either in an in-swing or out-swing configuration. In order to provide the shear magnetic lock with the appropriate holding force, then two pins lock the armature onto the magnet itself, and ensure that the magnet locks into place.|$|E

40|$|A new {{flip-chip}} solder {{technology has}} been developed for the precision self-alignment of an optoelectronic module without using <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops.</b> A main feature of the technology is the controlled self-alignment sequence: laser is aligned to a polymer waveguide in the lateral and vertical directions, then it slowly makes a contact with the waveguide in the axial direction. The elimination {{of the use of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> significantly simplifies the process. The axial distance between the laser and the waveguide is very small; it is determined by the contacting edges and a tilt angle of 12 o. The lateral alignment accuracy is less than 2 m. Introduction Solder self-alignment is important in the area of optoelectronics. In addition to providing electrical connections, solder {{is also one of the}} enabling technologies for passive precision alignments. Between 1990 and 1995, there were at least 60 papers and 8 U.

40|$|Development of the Body Flap Actuation Subsystem for Space Shuttles {{included}} alterations {{from the}} original design to <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops,</b> planet gears, control valves, and solenoid valves. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> were redesigned to absorb stall load and rotating inertia of the hydraulic motors instead of only stall load. The institution of a quill shaft (torsion spring) was a successful solution. The planet gears in the geared rotary actuators developed cracks during testing. This failure was alleviated via modification to the gears. A motor pressurization - brake release timing technique was developed thru analysis and testing. This resulted in a control valve configuration which would not permit freewheeling of the body flap surface. Finally, several solenoid valve configurations were tested to obtain the desired performance. Conceptual redesigns and modifications were weighted against each other to optimize a solution. Tradeoffs were usually made between life, performance, failure tolerance, and reliability versus weight, envelope, and maintainability...|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, DW {{introduced}} the Models 14 (fixed sights) and 15 (adjustable sights) in [...]357 Magnum caliber.

As a result, barrel change tools for the Models 12 and 15 are non-interchangeable. [...] Another new feature was {{the introduction of a}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop</b> to prevent trigger overtravel, which reduces the effect of trigger movement on the gun itself while reducing trigger return time, thus increasing accuracy.

50|$|It {{was built}} in 1975 by the Voigt Company from Bad Liebenwerda. The modern {{prospectus}} with the crystal form of the organ case was fitted into the neo-Gothic church. It has 1587 organ pipes and 22 stops, which are distributed over two manuals and pedal. At the general overhaul in 1995, the existing pneumatic stop control (with two combinations) was upgraded. Now the organ features a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop</b> action connected to an electronic translator that has 512 combinations, divided into eight levels with eight main groups in eight combinations each and four Presets.

[...] It is equipped with three manuals, 31 stops, 30 ranks, slider chests, mechanical key action, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop</b> action. The drawknobs are arraigned in horizontal rows on terraced/stepped jambs. The balanced swell shoes/pedals are not in standard AGO position. The combination action is a fixed mechanical system and there is a flat straight pedalboard. The historic pipe organ was restored in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common failure {{involved}} the drive's read-write head mechanism losing its alignment. Due to lack of hardware support for detecting track zero position, Commodore DOS formatting routines and many complex software copy-protection schemes (which used data stored on nonstandard tracks on floppies) {{had to rely on}} moving the head specified number of steps in order {{to make sure that the}} desired head position for formatting or reading the data was reached. Since after physically reaching track zero, further movement attempts caused the head drive mechanism to slam (producing the infamous, loud, telltale knocking sound) into a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop,</b> the repetitive strain often drove the head mechanism out of precise alignment, resulting in read errors and necessitating repairs. As a side note: some demos exploited the sound generated by the head moving stepper motor to force the disk drive to play crude tunes ("Bicycle Built For Two" [...] was one) by varying the frequency of step requests sent to the motor.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} also home to one of the few working pipe organs in Singapore, and is the only Methodist Church in Singapore to have one. The organ was the gift of the Ladies Aid Society. It was built by Walker & Taylor, Lincoln, England, in 1936 and {{installed}} 1937. The façade bears strong resemblance to the organ in the chapel at Orchard Road Presbyterian Church. The organ originally had tracker action and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop</b> and coupler controls. In 1987, when the Education Block was constructed and sanctuary renovated, the organ was completely dismantled and stored in a warehouse. At the end of the renovation, it was rebuilt and raised to its present height. A new console replaced the original, and the swell box removed to accommodate more ranks. The action was also electrified to accommodate the enlargements to the organ. However the organ's original slider windchests were retained. In 1995, platforms were added {{on both sides of the}} organ to allow for more pipes to be added.|$|E
50|$|Maximum normal {{power would}} be limited by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stop,</b> for {{instance}} a wire across the throttle lever slot, but a more forceful push would break the wire, allowing extra power. In normal service, the P-51H Mustang was rated at 1,380 hp, but WEP would deliver up to 2,218 hp. An increase of 62%. In the P-51D Mustang, the model most produced and used during World War II, the WEP increased the HP from 1490 to 1720. The Vought F4U Corsair, not originally equipped for WEP, later boasted a power increase of up to 410 hp (17%) when WEP was engaged. Several methods were used to boost engine power by manufacturers, including water injection and methanol-water injection. Some earlier engines simply allowed the throttle to open wider than normal, allowing more air to flow through the intake. All WEP methods result in greater-than-usual stresses on the engine, and correspond to a reduced engine lifetime. For some airplanes, such as the P-51D, use of WEP required that the engine be inspected for damage {{before returning to the}} air. 5 hours use of WEP on the P-51D required a complete tear down inspection.|$|E

A flip chip assembly approach is presented using the self-alignment mechanism in combination with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops.</b> Besides eutectic AuSn 20 solder (80 wt. -% Au, Tm = 280 °C) which is widely used in optoelectronics the eutectic SnAg 3. 5 solder (96. 5 wt. -% Sn, Tm = 221 °C) was tested as an alternative which is compatible to organic substrates. Both types of solder bumps were deposited using electroplating and were reflowed prior to flip chip assembly. The phase transformations taking place during the reflow of Au/Sn solder bumps are described. Furthermore, flip chip reflow soldering experiments of test vehicles using AuSn 20 and SnAg 3. 5 solder proved {{that it is possible}} to achieve self-alignment in three directions.
