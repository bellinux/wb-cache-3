40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the head losses in several <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> body disc <b>filters</b> manufactured by domestic companies. In order to meet the objective, three different filter designs (L, LT and Y type), each at four different inlet and outlet pipe diameters, were used to measure the head losses at different flow rates in the laboratory. A total of sixteen filters manufactured by three domestic companies (A, B and C) and two different disc elements (linear and curly) were taken into consideration in this study. A comparison of the different filter designs in terms of measured the head losses indicated that in all cases while the L <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> gave the highest head loss, the other two designs provided less head losses at the same flow rate. Furthermore, the head losses in C−LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> with curly groove shape discs were less than B−LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> with linear groove shape discs in comparing with the LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> produced by two different manufacturers even though the design and the size of the filter body were similar. The differences in the head loss can be clarified with the help of the results obtained from the structural characteristic of filtering elements. As a result, in drip irrigation systems, the use of Y and LT <b>type</b> disc <b>filters</b> with curly groove shaped discs are recommended in order to obtain less head losses and low energy requirements when compared with filters used in this study. Key words: Drip irrigation, disc filter, filtration, head los...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Öz In this study, a square-root-domain (SRD) electronically-tunable second-order trans-admittance <b>type</b> <b>filter</b> is {{proposed}}. The proposed filter has one {{voltage input}} and two current outputs and can simultaneously realize low-pass (LP) and band-pass (BP) responses without {{any changes in}} the circuit topology. Additionally, trans-admittance <b>type</b> second-order universal <b>filter</b> that has low-pass, band-pass, high-pass (HP), all-pass (AP) and notch (N) outputs is realized by adding a circuitry. The transfer admittance parameter g 0, natural frequency f 0 and quality factor Q of the trans-admittance <b>type</b> <b>filter</b> can be electronically tuned by changing DC control current sources. Some time and frequency domain simulations are performed using PSPICE program for the proposed trans-admittance <b>type</b> <b>filters.</b> Bu çakışmada, kare-kök-ortamlı, elektronik olarak ayarlanabilen, girişi gerilim çıkışı akım olan ikinci dereceden bir geçiş-iletkenliği tür...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFor 2 D {{data with}} Poisson noise we give {{explicit}} formulas for the optimal space-invariant Wiener <b>type</b> <b>filter</b> with some a priori geometric {{restrictions on the}} window function. We show that, under some natural geometric condition, this restrictedly optimal Wiener <b>type</b> <b>filter</b> admits a very efficient approximation by an approximately optimal filter with unknown object power spectrum. Generalizations {{to the case of}} some more general noise model are also given. Proceeding from these results we (a) explain, in particular, an efficiency of some well-known " 1 D" approximately optimal space-invariant Wiener <b>type</b> <b>filtering</b> scheme with unknown object power spectrum in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging based on the classical FBP algorithm or its iterative use and (b) propose also an efficient 2 D approximately optimal space-invariant Wiener <b>type</b> <b>filter</b> with unknown object power spectrum for SPECT imaging based on the generalized FBP algorithm (implementing the explicit formula for the nonuniform attenuation correction) and/or the classical FBP algorithm (used iteratively). An efficient space-variant version of the latter 2 D filter is also announced. Numerical examples illustrating the aforementioned results in the framework of simulated SPECT imaging are given...|$|R
