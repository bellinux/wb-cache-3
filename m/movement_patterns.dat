5|$|Electric Music for the Mind and Body was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all facets of the members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music for the Mind and Body {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E

Each enemy type {{is dressed in a}} unique colour, allowing the player to recognise their <b>movement</b> <b>patterns.</b> Some enemies remain static or rotate on a single node, while others will patrol the board along a specific route. Later stages may require the player to collect keys located on the board and unlock doors that block access to the level objective. Trapdoors connect one location on the board to another and allow the player to move between them during a turn. Some nodes contain potted plants, the player will not be detected while occupying these nodes. Coloured disguises can be found and equipped to let the player walk past an enemy type of that colour without being detected. There are throwable objects that are used to disrupt and change enemy behaviour patterns. Firearms can also be found on certain levels, they are used to shoot targets or obstacles from a distance.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a novel representation of trajectories, called <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings, which convert the trajectories into symbolic representations. <b>Movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings encode both the movement direction and the movement distance information of the trajectories. The distances that are computed in a symbolic space are lower bounds of the distances of original trajectory data, which guarantees that no false dismissals will be introduced using <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings to retrieve trajectories. In order to improve the retrieval efficiency, we define a modified frequency distance for frequency vectors that are obtained from <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings to reduce the dimensionality and the computation cost. The experimental results show that using <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings is almost as effective as using raw trajectories. In addition, the cost of retrieving similar trajectories can greatly be reduced when the modified frequency distance is used as a filter...|$|R

Levels can also include hazards, such as water or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Unlike the previous game, Keen can not shoot enemies with a raygun; instead he collects small pellets throughout the levels called flower power to throw at enemies. If an enemy is hit, they transform into a passive, intangible flower for a limited time, while pellets that do not hit an enemy can be retrieved by the player. The player can also find food items {{in the form of}} sweets throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded if the player earns enough points, as well as figures of Keen that grant an extra life. Placed throughout the levels are collectible bombs, which the player must use at least twelve of in order to defeat the final boss of the game.|$|E

A larger western population of 100–200 appears to be surviving in the Sea of Okhotsk, but very {{little is known about}} this population. Thus, the two northern right whale species are the most endangered of all large whales and two of the most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of 50°N. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk and in the eastern Bering Sea.

40|$|Alcohol {{intoxication}} is {{the cause}} of many falls requiring emergency care. The control of upright standing balance is complex and comprises contributions from several partly independent mechanisms like coordination, feedback and feedforward control and adaptation. Analysis of the segmental body movement coordination offers one option to detect the severity of balance problems. The study aims were (1) to investigate whether alcohol intoxication at 0. 06 and 0. 10 % blood alcohol concentration (BAC) affected the segmental <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> under unperturbed and perturbed standing; (2) whether alcohol affected the ability for <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> adaptation; (3) whether one's own subjective feeling of drunkenness correlated to the <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> used. Twenty-five participants (13 women and 12 men, mean age 25. 1 years) performed tests involving alcohol intoxication. Body movements were recorded at five locations (ankle, knee, hip, shoulder and head) during quiet standing and pseudorandom pulses of calf muscle vibration for 200 s with eyes closed or open. There was no significant effect of alcohol on the general <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> in unperturbed stance or on adaptation. However, when balance was repeatedly perturbed, knee movements became significantly less correlated to other body movements over time at 0. 10 % BAC and when visual information was unavailable, suggesting that the normal <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> could not be maintained {{for a longer period of}} time while under 0. 10 % BAC intoxication. Subjective feelings of drunkenness correlated often with a changed upper body <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> but less so with changed knee movements. Thus, an inability to relate drunkenness with changed knee movements may be a contributing factor to falls in addition to the direct effect of alcohol intoxication...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the external validity of the optimization program by examining whether the knowledge of the optimal <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> facilitates performance of the free throw in wheelchair basketball. In a pilot study, four able-bodied players from the Saskatchewan Wheelchair Basketball Men’s Team were invited to participate on one occasion. These participants were videotaped shooting free throws to provide knowledge of an expert wheelchair free throw <b>movement</b> <b>pattern.</b> Using video analysis, it was found that the release conditions used by this group were very similar to those predicted to be optimal. This lent support to the predicted optimal <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> being an actual optimal <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> for the free throw in wheelchair basketball. In the primary study, thirty-three able-bodied male participants were randomly assigned to three groups: a no-feedback group; a video-feedback group; and an optimal pattern feedback group. The participants performed wheelchair basketball free throw training for three days over one week. The no-feedback group simply shot free throws from a wheelchair, whereas the video-feedback group viewed video of their previous free throws, and the optimal pattern group viewed video of their previous free throws with an optimal free throw pattern superimposed. The participants also completed a pretest one week before and a retention test one week after the training period. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for significant differences between the three training groups in free throw success in wheelchair basketball over each testing occasion. The statistical analyses indicated that there were no differences in free throw success between the group that had knowledge of their personalized optimal <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> when compared to the groups that received either no-feedback or video-feedback (...|$|R

25|$|The player, {{who sits}} in an office, is {{given access to}} a network of {{security}} cameras throughout the facility to track {{the movement of the}} animatronics. Each character roams the restaurant and has distinct <b>movement</b> <b>patterns,</b> and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are dimly lit and distorted, one of the rooms only contains an audio feed, and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics. Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out. Once these things happen, the Toreador March will play, the screen will go pitch black, and the player will be jumpscared by Freddy, provided they do not reach {{the end of the night}} in the meantime.

Our {{findings suggest that the}} adaptive process to enhance stability involves both alteration of the multi-segmented <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> and alteration of body posture. The magnitude of the vibratory stimulation intensity had a prominent influence on the evoked multi-segmented <b>movement</b> <b>pattern.</b> The trial conditions also influenced whether the posture were altered and if these posture adjustments were done directly at stimulation onset or gradually over a longer period. Moreover, the correlation values showed that the subjects, primarily during trials with vibratory stimulation alone, significantly increased the body movement coordination at stimulation onset and maintained this <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> throughout the stimulation period. Furthermore, when exposed to balance perturbations the test subjects synchronized significantly the head and torso movements in anteroposterior direction during all trial conditions...|$|R

25|$|For speech production, the ACT model {{starts with}} the {{activation}} of a phonemic representation of a speech item (phonemic map). In {{the case of a}} frequent syllable, a co-activation occurs {{at the level of the}} phonetic map, leading to a further co-activation of the intended sensory state at the level of the sensory state maps and to a co-activation of a motor plan state at the level of the motor plan map. In the case of an infrequent syllable, an attempt for a motor plan is generated by the motor planning module for that speech item by activating motor plans for phonetic similar speech items via the phonetic map (see Kröger et al. 2011). The motor plan or vocal tract action score comprises temporally overlapping vocal tract actions, which are programmed and subsequently executed by the motor programming, execution, and control module. This module gets real-time somatosensory feedback information for controlling the correct execution of the (intended) motor plan. Motor programing leads to activation pattern at the level lof the primary motor map and subsequently activates neuromuscular processing. Motoneuron activation patterns generate muscle forces and subsequently <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis). The Birkholz 3D articulatory synthesizer is used in order to generate the acoustic speech signal.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain is}} an ever-changing, plastic, model of {{information}} sharing and processing. In order for the brain to incorporate new experiences into a refined schema it has to undergo specific modifications to consolidate and assimilate all new information. Synaptic plasticity {{can be described as}} the changing in strength between two related neurons. Neuroplasticity is most clearly seen in the instances of REM sleep deprivation during brain maturation. Regional brain measurements in neo-natal REM sleep deprived rats displayed a significant size reduction in areas such as the cerebral cortex and the brain stem. The rats were deprived during critical periods after birth and thus anatomical size reduction is observed. Using a pursuit task (used to test visuomotor capabilities) in combination with an fMRI, Maquet et al., 2003, found that increases in activation were seen in the supplementary eye field and right dentate nucleus of subjects who were allowed to sleep as compared to sleep deprived individuals. The right superior temporal sulcus was also noticed to have higher activation levels. When functional connectivity was analyzed {{it was found that the}} dentate nucleus was more closely involved with the functions of the superior temporal sulcus. The results suggest that performance on the pursuit task relies on the subject's ability to comprehend appropriate <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> in order for recreation of the optimal movements. Sleep deprivation was found to interrupt the slow processes that lead to learning of this procedural skill and alter connectivity changes that would have normally been seen after a night of rest. Neuroplasticity has been thoroughly researched over the past few decades and results have shown that significant changes that occur in our cortical processing areas have the power to modulate neuronal firing to both new and previously experienced stimuli.|$|E

40|$|Similarity-based {{retrieval}} of moving object trajectory {{is useful to}} many applications- GPS systems, sport and surveillance video analysis. However, due to sensor failures, errors in detection techniques, or different sampling rates, noises, local shifts and scales may appear in the trajectory records. Hence, {{it is difficult to}} design a robust and fast similarity measure for similarity-based retrieval in a large database. In this paper, normalized edit distance (NED) is proposed to measure the similarity between two trajectories. We evaluate the efficacy of NED and compare it with those of Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and Longest Common Subsequences (LCSS), showing that NED is more robust and accurate for trajectories that contain noise and local time shifting. Furthermore, in order to improve the retrieval efficiency, we propose a novel representation of trajectories, called <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings, which convert the trajectories into a symbolic representation. <b>Movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings encode both the movement direction and the movement distance information of the trajectories. The distances that are computed in a symbolic space are lower bounds of the distances of original trajectory data, which guarantees that no false dismissals will be introduced using <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings to retrieve trajectories. Finally, we define a modified frequency distance for frequency vectors that are obtained from <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings to reduce the dimensionality of <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings and computation cost of NED.

500|$|To {{make the}} Eastern Spirit roll realistically in the storm, the {{developers}} {{had to write}} a completely new program. They found that making the ship move was easy, but getting it to respond to storm conditions was much more complex. As such, they created a complete roll editor, called the Darkwave editor, which allowed them to control the pitch (when the ship moves on the horizontal axis) and the roll (when it moves on the vertical axis) separately. The combination of moving the ship on both axes allowed the developers to create realistic ship movements. This in turn allowed them to time the exact movement of the ship to coincide with {{what was happening in}} the game without having to use a cutscene. However, creating such a realistic movement system led to camera problems. According to programmer, Claude Levastre, early in development, [...] "the camera was constantly going through the walls because of the roll movement.

Objective: To investigate whether the body movement coordination strategy to calf or neck vibration was affected by aging. Methods: Body movement measurements were taken at five locations (ankle, knee, hip, shoulder and head) from 18 younger (mean age 29. 1 years) and 16 older (mean age 71. 5 years) adult subjects using a 3 D movement measuring system while subjected to 50 s of pseudo-random calf or neck vibratory stimulation pulses with eyes open or closed. The positions from the knee, hip, shoulder and head markers were correlated against one another to give an indication of the body coordination.
