40|$|The {{literature}} on testing {{for the presence}} of cyclical asymmetry in UK consumers' expenditure is extended via the application of nonparametric tests to data subject to a higher degree of disaggregation than considered in previous studies. The results obtained at an intermediate level of disaggregation depict a positive relationship between the durability of goods and the degree of asymmetry they exhibit. At high levels of disaggregation to specific expenditure categories, it is found that the aggregate and intermediate evidence of deepness asymmetry is driven by {{a relatively small number of}} expenditures, with almost no evidence of deepness asymmetry in non-durable categories of expenditure. Prominent among the durable and semi-durable good expenditure categories exhibiting significant positive deepness asymmetry are expenditures relating to <b>housing</b> <b>fittings</b> and communication, consistent with a degree of 'lumpiness' in expenditure which may be associated with the impact of credit rationing or threshold effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{literature}} on testing {{for the presence}} of cyclical asymmetry in consumers’ expenditure is extended via the application of tests for time irreversibility to UK data subject to a higher degree of disaggregation than considered in previous studies. The empirical findings reported provide support for a positive relationship between the durability of goods and the asymmetric, and specifically time irreversible, behaviour they exhibit at a fine level of disaggregation. Further investigation of the underlying causes of such time irreversibility exhibit pronounced difference according to the degree of durability, in that nonlinearity in the underlying data generating process is a prevalent feature of highly disaggregated durable good expenditures, but is a less marked feature of semi‐durable and non‐durable expenditures. Prominent among the durable and semi‐durable good expenditure categories exhibiting such nonlinearities are expenditures relating to <b>housing</b> <b>fittings</b> and communication equipment. These findings are consistent with threshold effects in inventory control as well as the effects of credit rationing, such that these expenditures {{are more likely to be}} made at times when those constraints are eased by income windfalls or by the easing of credit availability, possibly associated with mortgage (re‐) financing.

60|$|The {{search was}} an {{exhaustive}} one. There was no appearance of an underground cellar, but {{on some of}} the boards of the shop being taken up, it was found that there was a large one extending over the whole house. This contained an immense variety of goods. In one corner was a pile of copper bolts that Captain Dave and John were able to claim at once, as they bore the brand of the maker from whom they obtained their stock. There were boxes of copper and brass ship and <b>house</b> <b>fittings,</b> and a very large quantity of rope, principally of the sizes in which the stock had been found deficient; but to these Captain Dave was unable to swear. In addition to these articles the cellar contained a number of chests, all of which were found to be filled with miscellaneous articles of wearing apparel--rolls of silk, velvet, cloth, and other materials--curtains, watches, clocks, ornaments of all kinds, and a considerable amount of plate. As among these were many articles which answered to the descriptions given of goods that had been stolen from country houses, the whole were impounded by the Chief Constable, and carried away in carts. The upper part of the house was carefully searched, the walls tapped, wainscotting pulled down, and the floors carefully examined. Several hiding-places were found, but nothing of any importance discovered in them.|$|R

50|$|In the 2006 season, Spacey {{suffered}} a major setback with {{a production of}} Arthur Miller's Resurrection Blues, directed by Robert Altman. Despite an all-star cast (including Matthew <b>Modine</b> and future <b>House</b> of Cards co-star Neve Campbell) and the pedigree of Miller's script, Spacey's decision to lure Altman to the stage proved disastrous: after a fraught rehearsal period, the play opened to a critical panning, and closed {{after only a few}} weeks. Later in the year, Spacey starred in Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten, along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best. The play received excellent reviews for Spacey and Best, and was transferred to Broadway in 2007.

Berwind hired Horace Trumbauer to build a much larger <b>house,</b> better <b>fitting</b> his status. Like many of the grandest summer residents of Newport, Edward Berwind was [...] "new money" [...] (his parents were middle-class German immigrants); by 1900 his friends included Theodore Roosevelt and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany as well as many high-ranking government leaders from Europe and America.

50|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the theatre and parts of the city of Mannheim in September 1943, ten years were to pass before an architectural competition for a new theatre was proposed. The original design, while still considered a classic of modern theatre architecture, was not used. Instead, between 1955 and 1957 a new theatre building was constructed at Goethe Place (not in the same location as the original National Theatre) utilizing the designs of the architect Gerhard Weber. The new National Theatre building was inaugurated in 1957 with simultaneous productions of Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz in the Opera <b>House</b> and (<b>fitting</b> for its reflection of the theatre's early history) Schiller's The Robbers in the Schauspielhaus. In 1979, the Youth and Children's Theatre ensemble (Schnawwl) was set up with its main theatre space being the converted from an old fire station on the Mannheimer Neckarstadt.|$|R
