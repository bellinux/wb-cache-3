After {{analyzing}} these timing issues, he proposes organizing the {{delay line memory}} into 256 delay line [...] "organs" [...] (DLAs) each storing 1024 bits, or 32 minor cycles, called a major cycle. A memory access first selects the DLA (8 bits) and then the <b>minor</b> <b>cycle</b> within the DLA (5 bits), for a total of 13 address bits.|$|E

For multiplication and division, he proposes placing the binary point after sign bit, which means all numbers are treated as being between -1 and 1 and therefore computation problems must be scaled accordingly.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{standard}} does not specify any particular timing for any particular transfer — that's {{up to the}} system designers. Generally (the way it is done on most military aircraft), the Bus Controller has a schedule of transfers that covers the majority of transfers, often organized into a major frame or major cycle, which is often subdivided into minor cycles. In such a cyclic executive schedule structure, transfers that occur in every <b>minor</b> <b>cycle</b> (rate group 1) happen at the highest rate, typically 50 Hz, transfers that occur in every other <b>minor</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{of which there are}} two groups (rate group 2.1 and 2.2) happen at the next highest rate, e.g. 25 Hz. Similarly, there are four groups (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4) at, e.g., 12.5 Hz and so on. Hence, where this scheduling structure is used, the transfers are all at harmonically related frequencies, e.g. 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, and 1.5625 Hz (for a major frame comprising 32 minor cycles at 50 Hz).Whilst RTs cannot start a transfer directly on their own, {{the standard}} does include a method for when an RT needs to transmit data that is not automatically scheduled by the Bus Controller. These transfers are often called acyclic transfers as they are outside the structure used by the cyclic executive. In this sequence, an RT requests transmission through a bit in the status word, the Service Request bit. Generally, this causes the Bus Controller to transmit a Transmit Vector Word Mode Code command. However, where an RT only has one possible acyclic transfer, the Bus Controller can skip this part. The vector word is transmitted by the RT as a single 16-bit data word. The format of this vector word is not defined in the standard, so the system designers must specify what values from what RTs mean what action the Bus Controller is to take. This may be to schedule an acyclic transfer either immediately or {{at the end of the}} current <b>minor</b> <b>cycle.</b> This means that the Bus Controller has to poll all the Remote Terminals connected to the data bus, generally at least once in a major cycle. RTs with higher-priority functions (for example, those operating the aircraft control surfaces) are polled more frequently. Lower-priority functions are polled less frequently.|$|E
