50|$|The Civil Department is {{the oldest}} {{department}} on Pulchok Campus, and is the largest department by number of students and faculty members. The Labs {{have been used to}} test civil engineering materials of projects and companies in Nepal. The Civil Engineering is a four-year, eight semester program. Civil engineering is a professional discipline that deals with the planning, design, construction and maintenance of physical and natural environments. It involves construction and maintenance works of physical infrastructures, bridges, roads, canals, dams, buildings, urban planning etc. Civil Engineering is constantly evolving with the advent of technology and new materials. It has led to significant improvements in the understanding of how structures behave and economy varies in construction. Civil engineering is the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. It is traditionally broken into several sub-disciplines including architectural engineering, environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, control engineering, structural engineering, earthquake engineering, transportation <b>engineering,</b> forensic <b>engineering,</b> <b>municipal</b> or urban <b>engineering,</b> water resources engineering, materials engineering, offshore engineering, aerospace engineering, quantity surveying, coastal engineering, construction surveying, and construction engineering. Civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies.|$|R
40|$|In {{the transit}} field, both rail and bus, {{maintenance}} is nearly always an in-house function with little coordination with other like properties. Sharing maintenance information {{appears to be}} a route to explore, especially since the advent of the internet and large computer networks and communication systems. Benefits could be, for example, cost savings in joint purchases; a greatly expanded spare parts base, shared safety issues and others. This paper will describe a theoretical information sharing network. The plan is to start with a regional model and after it has proven itself to move to state model and eventually to a USA model. A worldwide inter- connecting information system is certainly a possibility. 1.

The diversified use of these metaphors in different application domains of digital ecosystems varies between computing areas and shapes their interventions. This paper reviews these application interventions of various computing areas as a qualitative approach to outline a roadmap of digital ecosystems from a metaphor towards a mature scientific paradigm. This roadmap is illustrated through five propositions to current practice. The proposed roadmap envisions digital ecosystems as a collaborative coordination environment and platform for computing interventions.

The result was strong support for building research universities and schools of business and <b>engineering,</b> <b>municipal</b> research agencies, as well as reform of hospitals and medical schools, and the practice of farming. Perhaps the best known leaders were engineers Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856-1915), who used a stopwatch to identify the smallest inefficiencies, and Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr. (1868-1924) who proclaimed there was always [...] "one best way" [...] to fix a problem.|$|R

The self-adjusting heat supply system from the individual heating points with the heat-accumulating units and coil heat exchangers for independent heating and water supply systems has been examined. Coil heat exchangers are used in municipal heating for heat transfer (e. g. geothermal waters) for the independent mains of the heating and hot water supply systems. The heat engineering calculation of the heating and accumulating unit with the coil heat exchanger for independent heat supply systems from individual heater was performed and experimental data were received at the experimental industrial unit under the laboratory conditions. The peculiarities of the flows in the intertubular space, their influence on the heat exchange and temperatures of the first and intermediate mains have been shown. It is important to know the processes running inside the apparatus to be able to improve the technical characteristics of the three-loop coil heat exchanger. The task solution will make it possible to save the materials consumption for the three-loop coil heat exchangers in the futur...|$|R
