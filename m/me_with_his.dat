500|$|Smart's {{behaviour}} {{was probably}} influenced by St Paul's command in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians to [...] "Pray without ceasing" [...] and William Law's The Spirit of Prayer, which {{argues that a}} constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God. Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends' activities and call them into the street to pray with him. These calls for public prayer continued until an incident that Smart later described in Jubilate Agno: [...] "For I blessed God in St James's Park till I routed all the company... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me, and the watchman smites <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> staff" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 90–91).|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} of Train's [...] "Hey, Soul Sister" [...] by the Dalton Academy Warblers received even more praise than [...] "Don't Cry For Me Argentina". Benigno called it flawless, {{and gave it}} an [...] "A++", and Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it gave it her [...] "top prize" [...] of the night. Berk gave it four stars out of five, Burns said [...] "the Warblers sounded fantastic and fun", and Harper said she loved it, and that, like the audience on the show, she [...] "would have given it" [...] a [...] "standing ovation". Stack said he [...] "sorta" [...] hated the song [...] "from sheer overexposure", but [...] "Darren Criss sold it for <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> choreography and acting", {{and gave it a}} [...] "B+". Pat Monahan, the lead singer of Train, said: [...] "Loved it! I thought they did an amazing job." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{publication}} of Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson's nonfiction book Lone Survivor (2007), producer Barry Spikings met Luttrell's attorney, Alan Schwartz, who {{was interested in}} adapting the book to film. Schwartz suggested that Spikings's son-in-law, Akiva Goldsman, write the screenplay. Goldsman however did not believe he was the right screenwriter for the project; he suggested that Peter Berg write and direct the film. Spikings and Goldsman passed the book on to Berg's producing partner Sarah Aubrey. [...] Berg first learned of Lone Survivor while filming Hancock, and after Aubrey had read the book herself. After Berg had read the book, he and Aubrey arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss a film adaptation. Luttrell also viewed a rough cut of Berg's then-upcoming 2007 film The Kingdom, and was impressed by Berg's direction. [...] " [...] caught <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> attention to detail", he said, [...] "and how he portrayed the enemy in the film." ...|$|E

500|$|Lawless {{is able to}} play as a {{right or}} left midfielder, a central midfielder and a right-back. While being equally {{comfortable}} playing at any of these positions, he prefers {{to play in a}} midfield role. He has also played in the hole and has given a composed performance as a second striker. His play as a right midfielder is [...] "skilful" [...] and he has been described as being [...] "comfortable on the ball, a good passer, mobile and with an eye for goal". Stevenage Borough manager Graham Westley described him as a player [...] "who impresses <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> consistency". After signing for York, manager Martin Foyle said [...] "He is a great all rounder, a technically good footballer and has a very professional attitude towards the game." [...] His partnership with Neil Barrett in the central midfield for York drew praise from teammate Richard Brodie, who said [...] "The midfield two worked really well together and picked up the second balls. Alex Lawless was flawless and he should be playing in the Football League".|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters {{as part of a}} pattern of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever {{figure out how to get}} us out of here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E

[...] "I couldn’t find an actor to play Freddy Krueger with the sense of ferocity I was seeking," [...] Craven recalled on the film's 30th anniversary. [...] "Everyone was too quiet, too compassionate towards children. Then Robert Englund auditioned. [...] wasn’t as tall I’d hoped, and he had baby fat on his face, but he impressed <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> willingness to go to the dark places in his mind. Robert understood Freddy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman {{to persuade}} Taylor {{to return to}} the Giants. [...] Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was {{pitching}} and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fingers.

His whole theory is simply based on the universal application {{of the right of}} self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...' ...|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Suárez {{played down}} the {{incident}}, saying [...] "These are just {{things that happen}} out on the pitch. It was {{just the two of}} us inside the area and he bumped into <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> shoulder", while Chiellini was adamant the incident cost Italy the game, and thought the lack of a red card was part of a conspiracy to keep the best players in the tournament. Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) announced they would be investigating the incident. The Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) attempted to claim that the images of bitemarks on Chiellini's shoulder had been manipulated to appear worse than reality, while Suárez's lawyer Alejandro Balbi claimed that there was a conspiracy between England, Italy and Brazil for Suárez and Uruguay to be severely punished, a sentiment Uruguay manager Óscar Tabárez agreed with, saying [...] "If the referee did not see anything, there is nothing to see. But Suárez is the target of some British press anyway". It was compared to Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Marco Materazzi at the 2006 World Cup, however Zidane was shown a red card while Suárez did not go into the book.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} made a shock unannounced return {{during a}} live segment which aired on 19 February 2015 during EastEnders Live Week commemorating the 30th anniversary. Speaking of her return, Gillian Taylforth said: [...] "When Dominic [...] approached <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> plan, I was so shocked I got {{into my car}} and burst into tears! 'Kathy' has always been so close to my heart and it's absolutely wonderful returning to the show and reprising the role." [...] It was then confirmed that Taylforth would reprise her role indefinitely. While Taylforth was initially only contracted to the series for six months, she said that she'd love {{to stay on the}} series for good. Of the return, Treadwell-Collins said [...] "Six months ago, we set ourselves that challenge of bringing Kathy back to the Square in a credible way. And I believe we have succeeded." [...] Taylforth revealed that she was initially hesitant about the storyline. [...] "I couldn't understand how they could work around the fact that she could do that to her children" [...] the actress explained. Taylforth said [...] "it had to be right." [...] In September 2015, Treadwell-Collins revealed to the Daily Mirror that the story was inspired by the real life John Darwin disappearance where John—also known as the Canoe man—with the help of his wife Anne faked his death in a canoe accident in March 2002 in order to claim the insurance. Kathy's husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) had convinced her to fake her death to keep her children safe.|$|E
