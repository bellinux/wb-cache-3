500|$|Tom Chambers was {{approached}} about assuming {{the role of}} Sam by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow Holby City newcomers Rakie Ayola as Kyla Tyson and Luke Roberts as Joseph Byrne. Chambers has revealed that he sent a video of himself performing a Fred Astaire tap dance routine to over 800 stage and television directors and producers in the [...] UK, explaining: [...] "Julie Harkin in casting at Holby saw it and gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> because {{they thought it was}} unusual. Originally I went up for a small role as an American doctor, but after the audition they said come back next week to audition for a bigger part and that was it!" [...] Upon assuming the role of Sam, Chambers revealed that he had once been an avid viewer of Holby City's sister show, Casualty, recalling watching it as far back as 1991.|$|E

60|$|Burton's {{opportunity}} seemed {{better than}} {{that of any other}} youth, for he could visit his aunt as often as he wished without arousing comment, whereas for <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> would have been equivalent to an offer of marriage.

I answered the call, and I talked to him like a man. I frankly told him the situation. It looked as if I might win out at writing. The chance was good, but not certain.

60|$|Meanwhile {{the seeds}} began to {{germinate}} in our garden, when we found, to our chagrin, that, between John Bull and Paddy, there had occurred sundry confusions in the several departments.

My good old uncle, who, somewhat to my confusion, made <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> at this time, was greatly distressed and scandalized by the appearance of our garden. But by a deal of fussing, transplanting, and replanting, it was got into some shape and order. My uncle was rather troublesome, as careful old people are apt to be--annoying us by perpetual inquiries of what we gave for this and that, and running up provoking calculations on the final cost of matters; and we began to wish that his visits might be as short as would be convenient.|$|E

There ain't anything equal to it but trading rats for di'monds in time of famine. Well, don't you see, when there's an epidemic, people don't wait to embam.
