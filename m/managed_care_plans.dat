5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the end of}} the legislative session, Beshear called for a special legislative session to consider a way to meet the state's Medicaid obligations and whether or not to raise the minimum dropout age. In the special session, legislators also approved raising the minimum dropout age to 18 during the special session. Following the session, the National Education Association honored Beshear with its America's Greatest Education Governor Award for 2011, citing his advocacy for raising the minimum dropout age and his consistent refusal to cut education funding. Both houses also approved a plan that allowed Beshear to move the funds from the second year of the budget, but triggered automatic spending cuts if the <b>managed</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> did not generate sufficient savings. The bill also called for the hiring of an independent accounting firm to assess the savings achieved by the <b>managed</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> Beshear then used his line-item veto to strike the spending cuts and the savings assessment provisions, per a previous arrangement with Democratic lawmakers. By eliminating these provisions, the version of the bill signed by Beshear was essentially the plan he had proposed during the regular session. The House adjourned the session March 24, but the Senate remained in session until April 6, voting to override Beshear's vetoes, but without concurrence from the House, the override votes were ineffective.|$|E
25|$|<b>Managed</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> {{are widely}} {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing {{the health care industry}} to become more efficient and competitive. <b>Managed</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{controversy}} over who exactly should {{take responsibility for}} coordinating {{the care of the}} dual eligibles. There have been some proposals to transfer dual eligibles into existing Medicaid <b>managed</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans,</b> which are controlled by individual states. But many states facing severe budget shortfalls might have some incentive to stint on necessary care or otherwise shift costs to enrollees and their families to capture some Medicaid savings. Medicare has more experience managing the care of older adults, and is already expanding coordinated care programs under the ACA, though there are some questions about private Medicare plans’ capacity to manage care and achieve meaningful cost savings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{backlash}} included vocal critics, including disgruntled {{patients and}} consumer-advocacy groups, {{who argued that}} <b>managed</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> were controlling costs by denying medically necessary services to patients, even in life-threatening situations, or by providing low-quality care. The volume of criticism led many states to pass laws mandating managed-care standards. Meanwhile, insurers responded to public demands and political pressure by beginning to offer other plan options with more comprehensive care networks—according to one analysis, between the years 1970 and 2005 the share of personal health expenditures paid directly out-of-pocket by U.S. consumers fell from about 40 percent to 15 percent. So although consumers faced rising health insurance premiums over the period, lower out-of-pocket costs likely [...] encouraged consumers to use more health care.

2500|$|Beginning in the 1980s, {{many states}} {{received}} waivers {{from the federal}} government to create Medicaid managed care programs. Under managed care, Medicaid recipients are enrolled in a private health plan, which receives a fixed monthly premium from the state. The health plan is then responsible for providing for all or most of the recipient's healthcare needs. Today, all but a few states use managed care to provide coverage to a significant proportion of Medicaid enrollees. As of 2014, 26 states have contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs) to deliver long-term care for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The states pay a monthly capitated rate per member to the MCOs that provide comprehensive care and accept the risk of managing total costs.

2500|$|Also {{effective}} in 2006, the Connector Board set premium levels and copayments {{for the state}} subsidized Commonwealth Care plans. Premiums will vary from $18 per month, for individuals with incomes 100%–150% of the poverty line, to $106 per month for individuals with incomes 250%–300% of poverty. The Connector approved two copayment schemes for plans for people 200%–300% of poverty. One plan will have higher premiums and lower copayments, while a second choice will have lower premiums and higher copayments. Four <b>managed</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> began offering Commonwealth Care on November 1, 2006. Coverage for people above 100% of poverty up to 300% of poverty began on February 1, 2007. As of December 1, 2007, around 158,000 people had been enrolled in Commonwealth Care plans. Initial bids received by the Connector showed a likely cost for the minimum insurance plan of about $380 per month. The Connector rejected those bids, and asked insurers to propose less expensive plans. New bids were announced on March 3, 2007. The Governor announced that [...] "the average uninsured Massachusetts resident {{will be able to}} purchase health insurance for $175 per month." [...] But plan costs will vary greatly depending on the plan selected, age and geographic location, ranging from just over $100 per month for plans for young adults with high copayments and deductibles to nearly $900 per month for comprehensive plans for older adults with low deductibles and copayments. Copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket contributions may vary among plans. The proposed minimum creditable coverage plan would have a deductible no higher than $2,000 per individual, $4,000 per family, and would limit out-of-pocket expenses to a $5,000 maximum for an individual and $7,500 for a family. Before the deductible applies, the proposed plan includes preventive office visits with higher copayments, but would not include emergency room visits if the person was not admitted.|$|E
