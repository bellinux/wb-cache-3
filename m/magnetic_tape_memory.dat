5000|$|For {{mass storage}} {{there was a}} drum memory {{available}} {{as well as a}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>memory.</b> The magnetic drum had a storage capacity of 17664 Z25 words. The transmission speed was 6900 words per second. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>memory</b> had a capacity of 1 million Z25 words and a transmission speed of approximately 33000 Z25 words per second. In- and output was through punched tape and punched cards; it was also possible to print to a teleprinter.|$|E
50|$|Non-volatile {{data storage}} can be {{categorized}} into electrically addressed systems (read-only memory) and mechanically addressed systems (hard disks, optical disc, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape,</b> holographic <b>memory,</b> and such). Electrically addressed systems are expensive, but fast, whereas mechanically addressed systems have a low price per bit, but are slow.|$|R
50|$|The {{system used}} both a 512-word mercury delay line and <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> for <b>memory,</b> and for data input, {{the system was}} {{equipped}} to process Flexowriter paper tape (at a rate of 1 word/second), magnetic wire (40 words/second), Raytheon <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> (250 words/second), and paper tape (150 characters/second). The system could output to Flexowriter paper tape (at a rate of 1 word/second), magnetic wire (20 words/second), or paper tape (180 characters/second).|$|R
50|$|WEIZAC was an {{asynchronous}} computer operating on 40-bit words. Instructions consisted of twenty bits: an eight-bit instruction code and twelve bits for addressing. Punched paper tape {{was used for}} I/O, and later, in 1958, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape.</b> The <b>memory</b> was initially a magnetic drum containing 1,024 words, and was later replaced with a faster 4,096 word memory. In 1961 the memory was further expanded with two additional 4,096 word modules.|$|R
50|$|The main {{units of}} the system were: keyboard, controlling-reading unit, input punched tape, output punched tape, printer, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>memory,</b> ferrite memory, ALU (arithmetical logical unit), CPU (central {{processing}} unit), and power supply.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 10 - 12, 1972 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaFor {{intermediate}} {{data storage}} in scientific satellites a ferrite core buffer memory with {{a capacity of}} 0. 5.. 2 Mbit was developed as a replacement of the hitherto used <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>memories.</b> For this memory a 3 D-organization with a pulse program especially adapted for buffer use was applied. For {{the realization of the}} access-circuitry multichip semiconductors in hermetically sealed flatpacks were combined with tantalum thin film resistor networks. A new small volume rugged memory stack was used. The cores used had an outer diameter of 0. 5 mm. For this system a new flexible equipment practice is used which leads to a high component density. Furthermore, a 0. 5 Mbit random access ferrite core memory was developed for the Helios satellite. This satellite will go into orbit in June 1974. The prototype model has a mass of 4. 5 kg, overall dimensions of 194 x 210 x 207 mm, a volume of 7. 08 W. (432 cu. inch) and has a power consumption of 2 Watts in stand-by and of 4. 8 Watts at a bit rate of 16 kbit/s. It works satisfactorily within a temperature range of - 45 to + 75 ° C...|$|R
40|$|Optical and {{magnetic}} variants {{in the design}} of trillion-bit read/write memories are compared and tabulated. Components and materials suitable for a random access read/write nonmoving memory system are examined, with preference given to holography and photoplastic materials. Advantages and deficiencies of photoplastics are reviewed. Holographic page composer design, essential features of an optical memory with no moving parts, fiche-oriented random access memory design, and materials suitable for an efficient photoplastic fiche are considered. The optical variants offer advantages in lower volume and weight at data transfer rates near 1 Mbit/sec, but power drain is of the same order as for the <b>magnetic</b> variants (<b>tape</b> <b>memory,</b> disk memory). The mechanical properties of photoplastic film materials still leave much to be desired...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} the backup-system using peer-to-peer network system. In general, {{as a way}} to backup the data, we use <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape,</b> hard-disk, flash <b>memory,</b> file server, and online storage, etc. However, these devices have some problems on redundancy, dispersiveness, or security. We propose fault tolerant data backup system with peer-to-peer network. To improve the level of redundancy and dispersiveness, our system employs the number of peer-to-peer network's nodes and redundant encrypting backup data. We attempt to reduce the nodes' load by halving backup data and sending it to separate nodes...|$|R
50|$|Cracovians {{adopted a}} column-row {{convention}} for designating individual elements {{as opposed to}} the standard row-column convention of matrix analysis. This made manual multiplication easier, as one needed to follow two parallel columns (instead of a vertical column and a horizontal row in the matrix notation.) It also sped up computer calculations, because both factors' elements were used in a similar order, which was more compatible with the sequential access memory in computers of those times — mostly <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>memory</b> and drum memory. Use of Cracovians in astronomy faded as computers with bigger random access memory came into general use. Any modern reference to them is in connection with their non-associative multiplication.|$|E

5000|$|When the National Security Agency (NSA) {{was formed}} in 1952, Rowlett became chief of cryptanalysis. The primary problem facing {{research}} and development in the post-war period was development of high-speed processing equipment. Kullback supervised a staff of about 60, including such innovative thinkers in automated data processing development as Leo Rosen and Sam Snyder. His staff pioneered new forms of input and <b>memory,</b> such as <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> and drum <b>memory,</b> and compilers to make machines truly [...] "multi-purpose."

5000|$|Random-access memory (RAM [...] ) {{is a form}} of {{computer}} data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost {{the same amount of time}} irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older <b>magnetic</b> <b>tapes</b> and drum <b>memory,</b> the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.|$|R
40|$|A {{buffer memory}} data {{handling}} technique {{for use with}} multispectral aircraft scanners is presented which allows digital data generated at high data rates to be recorded on <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape.</b> A digital <b>memory</b> is used to temporarily store the data for subsequent recording at slower rates during the passive time of the scan line, thereby increasing the maximum data rate recording capability over real-time recording. Three possible implementations are described and the maximum data rate capability is {{defined in terms of}} the speed capability of the key hardware components. The maximum data rates can be used to define the maximum ground resolution achievable by a multispectral aircraft scanner using conventional data handling techniques...|$|R

A second piece of splicing tape is placed on the backing side of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> then the resulting tape stack is trimmed to the original width of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape.</b> After the first piece of splicing tape is carefully removed from the oxide side of the damaged <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape,</b> the resulting <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> is then ready to be placed into a recorder for playback...|$|R
