5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{theories}} proposed regarding the development of modern human behavior, but in recent years the mosaic approach has been the <b>most</b> <b>favored</b> perspective in regards to the MSA, especially when taken in consideration with the archaeological evidence. Some scholars including Klein have argued for discontinuity, while others including McBrearty and Brooks have argued that cognitive advances can be detected in the MSA and that the origin of our species is linked with the appearance of Middle Stone Age technology at 250–300 ka.|$|E
5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the <b>most</b> <b>favored</b> explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, Congress {{had passed}} {{legislation}} to deny financial aid grants to Yugoslavia, {{to withdraw the}} sale of spare parts for Yugoslav warplanes, and to revoke the country's <b>most</b> <b>favored</b> nation status. Kennan strongly protested the legislation, arguing that it would only result in a straining of relations between Yugoslavia and the U.S. Kennan came to Washington {{during the summer of}} 1962 to lobby against the legislation but was unable to elicit a change from Congress. President Kennedy endorsed Kennan privately but remained noncommittal publicly, as {{he did not want to}} jeopardize his slim majority support in Congress on a potentially contentious issue. With U.S.–Yugoslav relations getting progressively worse, Kennan tendered his resignation as ambassador during late July 1963.|$|E

5|$|In Altranstädt, Marlborough {{reportedly}} approached Carl Piper, the <b>most</b> <b>favored</b> of the King's advisers of the time. Allegedly, {{he offered}} Piper a pension {{in exchange for}} advising Charles XII to invade Russia, as this would distract Charles from interfering in the War of the Spanish Succession. Carl Piper was openly accused of having accepted Marlborough's bribe, persuaded Charles to the Swedish invasion of Russia, which consequently lead to the disastrous Battle of Poltava. Carl Piper denied having accepted Marlborough's offer, but he did admit that he had accepted that Marlborough provided his wife Christina Piper {{with a pair of}} valuable earrings, which she admitted, and as it was the habit of Carl Piper to personally refuse bribes but allow his wife to accept them and then follow her recommendation, the accusation of Marlborough's bribe is not unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are <b>most</b> <b>favored</b> by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines <b>most</b> <b>favored</b> by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E

5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was <b>most</b> <b>favored</b> by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's <b>most</b> <b>favored</b> nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E
