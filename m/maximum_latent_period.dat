40|$|Rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV) is a newly {{discovered}} species of cytorhabdovirus infecting rice plants that is transmitted by the leafhopper Recilia dorsalis. In this study, the transmission characteristics of RSMV by R. dorsalis were investigated. Under suitable growth conditions for R. dorsalis, the RSMV acquisition rate reached 71. 9 % in the second-generation population raised on RSMV-infected rice plants. The minimum acquisition and inoculation access periods of R. dorsalis were 3 and 30 min, respectively. The minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>latent</b> transmission <b>periods</b> of RSMV in R. dorsalis were 6 and 18 d, respectively, and some R. dorsalis intermittently transmitted RSMV at 2 – 6 d intervals. Our findings {{revealed that the}} virus can replicate in the leafhopper body, but is likely not transovarially transmitted to offspring. These transmission characteristics will help guide the formulation of RSMV prevention and control strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{bacteriophage}} (phage), {{rapid and}} efficient intracellular prog-eny production is of obvious benefit. A short <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> is not. All else being equal, a longer <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> utilizes host cell resources more com-pletely. Using established parameters ofphage growth, a simulation of three successive phage lysis cycles is presented. I {{have found that}} high, but not low, host cell densities can select for short phage <b>latent</b> <b>periods.</b> This results from phage with short <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> more rapidly establishing multiple parallel infections at high host cell concentrations, whereas phage with long <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> are restricted to growth within a single cell over the same period. This implies that phage with short <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> habitually grow in environments hat are rich in host cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Slow rusting is {{considered}} a crucial component of durable resistance to wheat leaf rust caused by Puc-cinia triticina and is often expressed {{in the form of}} a prolonged <b>latent</b> <b>period.</b> Selection for a longer <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> {{is considered}} an effective approach to developing wheat cultivars with improved durable resistance to leaf rust. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population de-rived from CI 13227 (long <b>latent</b> <b>period)</b> · Suwon 92 (short <b>latent</b> <b>period)</b> was phenotyped for <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> in two greenhouse experiments in separate years, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were analyzed in the same population. Among the RILs, the frequency distribution for <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> was continuous, and <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> was highly correlated between years (r= 0. 94, P< 0. 0001). A quantitative trait locus (QTL) prolonging the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> of P. triticina, designated as QLrlp. osu- 2 DS, explained 42. 8 % and 54. 5 % of the phenotypic and genetic variance in the two experiments, respectively. QLrlp. osu- 2 DS was mapped on the distal region of chromosome 2 DS. Two other QTLs for <b>latent</b> <b>period,</b> QLrlp. osu- 2 B and QLrlp. osu- 7 BL, were localized on chromosome 2 B and the long arm of chromosome 7 B, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that these three QTLs collectively explained 58. 0 % and 73. 8 % of the phenotypic and genetic variance over two experiments, respectively. Fourteen RILs that carried all three alleles for long <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> at three AFLP loci flanking QLrlp. osu- 2 DS, QLrlp. osu- 2 B, and QLrlp. osu- 7 BL had a mean <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> of 12. 5 days, whereas 13 RILs without any long-latent-period alleles at the cor-responding loci had a mean <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> of 7. 4 days.

40|$|Auto-infection (infection {{arising from}} {{inoculum}} produced {{on the same}} host unit) is common in polycyclic plant pathogens, but often neglected in experimental and theoretical studies, which focus instead on infection of new hosts (allo-infection). Here we test the hypothesis that high auto-infection, as observed for leaf infecting fungal pathogens, could select for short <b>latent</b> <b>periods.</b> An individual-based simulation model keeps track of lesions, resulting from the spread of spores, between and within individual leaves. Linked to a trade-off between <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> and spore production capacity, as observed for Puccinia triticina on wheat, the adaptation of the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> is analysed for different levels of auto-infection using the methods of pairwise invasibility plots. Results suggest that increased auto-infection selects for reduced <b>latent</b> <b>periods.</b> A reduction in leaf longevity also selects for reduced <b>latent</b> <b>periods,</b> which is most obvious for a relatively low ratio of auto- to allo-infection. This study {{is the first to}} consider the effect of auto-infection on the evolution of pathogen life history traits. The fact that auto-infection could drastically reduce pathogen <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> highlights the need for more research in this area...|$|R
40|$|Rotation of an {{inclined}} {{surface on}} which Helix is creeping straight upward, {{such that the}} axis of the animal is turned at a right angle to its previous position, {{but in the same}} plane, leads to negatively geotropic orientation after a measurable <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> or reaction time. The duration of the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> {{is a function of the}} slope of the surface. The magnitude of the standard deviation of the mean <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> is directly proportional to the mean <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> itself, so that the relative variability of response is constant. The dependence of reaction time upon extent of displacement from symmetrical orientation in the gravitational field is found also by tilting the supporting surface, without rotation in the animal's own plane. On slopes up to 55 °, the relation between <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> and the sine of the slope is hyperbolic; above this inclination, the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> sharply declines. This change in the curve is not affected by the attachment of moderate loads to the snail's shell (up to 1 / 3 of its own mass), and is probably a consequence of loss of passive stable equilibrium when rotated. When added loads do not too greatly extend the snail's anterior musculature, the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> for the geotropic reaction is decreased, and, proportionately, its σ. These facts are discussed from the standpoint that geotropic excitation in these gasteropods is due to impressed muscle-tensions...|$|R

30|$|The {{classical}} experiment of {{one step}} growth curve {{was carried out}} to differentiate phages {{on the basis of}} burst size. It was found that both phages HNΦ and 3 S are high titre phages which have <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> of 30  min and burst size for HNΦ was 110 but for 3 S it was 42. It can be speculated on the basis of <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> that both phages may belong to T-even series because 30  min duration of <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> is usually found for T-even E. coli phages, as calculated from Fig.  1. According to Shao and Wang (2008), phages that are characterized as Short <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> phages (SLPs) have high adsorption rate, shorter <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> and they are able to infect multiple host in the environment, but they have reduced burst size. These findings of one step growth curve support the idea that HNΦ and 3 S may be taken as SLPS on the basis of <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> and burst size. The host range of phages was checked on heterologus host i.e. Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Shigella and different species of Salmonella and it was found that these phages were non lytic to any of these bacteria. But absence of plaques cannot rule out the possibility of lysogenic state of this phage into any of the host. However, screening of inducing factor was not done in present study. Previous research showed that T phages whose <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> is about 30  min have burst size in the range of 200 – 300 PFU/infection centre but for HNΦ burst size is 110 PFU/infection centre and for 3 S is 42 PFU/infection centre therefore only on the basis of short <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> and small burst size it is concluded that these phages are SLPs. However, {{further research is needed to}} determine adsorption rate and its activity against multiple hosts to confirm them as SLPs.|$|R

40|$|During normal operation, {{there are}} {{periods of time}} in which units in a digital system (adders, {{multipliers}} etc.) are inactive, i. e. are not processing any useful data.

40|$|Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} is {{the most}} common seizure disorder in humans. The disorder results from an injury to an apparently normal brain and thus is an acquired form of epilepsy. A <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> during which no seizures can be observed follows this initial neural injury. The end of the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> and the beginning of temporal lobe epilepsy is marked by the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures. During the <b>latent</b> <b>period,</b> the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus undergo significant changes at the level of synaptic organization and transcriptional regulation. In the normal brain, strong inhibition allows the denate gyrus to act as a gate to hippocampal activity. Inhibition in the dentate gyrus is diminished during the <b>latent</b> <b>period,</b> significantly altering the excitability of the hippocampus. Accordingly, much of the work in the field focuses on hippocampal pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells, the principal neurons in these structures. Understanding how these cells are altered during the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> will provide insight into the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. ^ The focus of this thesis is on the changes to the dentate granule cells during the <b>latent</b> <b>period.</b> Specifically, the focus is on a disruption of intracellular chloride regulation in dentate granule cells and the resultant change to granule cell and hippocampal excitability during the <b>latent</b> <b>period.</b> The regulation of intracellular chloride and thus transmembrane chloride gradients is of central importance in the GABAergic inhibition of neurons. GABA is the dominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in these cells and the function of the primary GABA receptors is dependant on transmembrane chloride gradients. I first show that chloride regulation is altered in dentate granule cells following an epileptogenic injury. Next I show that these changes are restricted to a time frame consistent with the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> and are activity dependant. Finally, I show that these changes alter dentate granule cell and hippocampal excitability. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of acquired temporal lobe epilepsy. ...|$|R

40|$|Septoria blight of celery (Apium graveolens) {{caused by}} Septoria apiicola {{is a common}} disease. This work dealt with the {{development}} of a simple forecast model to time fungicide application to manage the blight. Two studies were conducted to examine the effect of relative humidity (65, 88, 92, 96 %, and wet) temperature (15, 20, 25, and 28 C) and exposure period (6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr) on spore production. Spores were produced at all levels of relative humidity and temperature tested. Overall spore production increased with increasing relative humidity. The greatest and the least were produced after a 48 hr wet period at 20 and 28 C, respectively. Two regression models were developed to predict spore production as functions of relative humidity and temperature. In order to validate the infection function model a field experiment was conducted in 1989 to quantify <b>latent</b> <b>period.</b> A mean <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> beginning of 12 days, a mean <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> 50 % of 14 days, and a mean <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> ending of 19 days were established.

Responses to selection and selection differentials were calculated, and broad-sense, realized heritabilities for <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> were estimated for wild-type fungal populations on CI 13227 and on Sw 72469 - 6. Selected populations had fitness characteristics, not limited to <b>latent</b> <b>period,</b> that could provide greater fitness in nature. Generally, more cycles of selection had greater effects on fitness. In particular cases, selected populations on a partially resistant cultivar had values for <b>latent</b> <b>period,</b> uredinium area, and sporulation no different from those of a susceptible host–pathogen combination.

At 20 degrees C, however, light leaf spot severity and production of conidia were less and the incubation and <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> were longer than at 15 degrees C. There were differences between P. brassicae isolates and oilseed rape cultivars in the severity of light leaf spot, the production of conidia and the length of the incubation period but not in the length of the <b>latent</b> <b>period.</b> The responses to temperature for lesion severity and incubation and <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> appeared to be approximately linear over the temperature range 5 - 15 degrees C and could be quantified using linear regression analysis...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for liberating and estimating intracellular bacteriophage at any stage during the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> by arresting phage growth and inducing premature lysis of the infected cells. This is {{brought about by}} placing the infected bacteria into the growth medium supplemented with 0. 01 M cyanide and with a high titer T 6 lysate. It was found {{in some of the}} later experiments that the T 6 lysate is essential only {{during the first half of}} the <b>latent</b> <b>period.</b> Cyanide alone will induce lysis during the latter part of the <b>latent</b> <b>period.</b> Using this method on T 4 -infected bacteria it is found that during the first half of the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> no phage particles, not even those originally infecting the bacteria, are recovered. This result is in agreement with the gradually emerging concept that a profound alteration of the infecting phage particle takes place before reproduction ensues. During the second half of the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> mature phage is found to accumulate within the bacteria at a rate which is parallel to the approximately linear increase of intracellular DNA in this system. However, the phage production lags several minutes behind DNA production. When 5 -methyltryptophan replaced cyanide as the metabolic inhibitor, similar results were obtained. The curves were, however, displaced several minutes to the left on the time axis. The results are compared with Latarjet's (16) data on x-radiation of infected bacteria and with Foster's data (18) concerning the effect of proflavine on infected bacteria. Essential agreement with both is apparent...|$|R
