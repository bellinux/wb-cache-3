5|$|Roguelike {{games were}} {{initially}} developed for computing environments with limited memory, including shared mainframe systems and early home computers; this limitation prevented developers from retaining {{all but a}} few dungeon levels in memory while the game was running, leading to procedural generation to avoid the <b>memory</b> <b>storage</b> issue. Roguelikes were also often written in languages like BASIC, which are not as efficient in memory and data management compared to modern languages, further limiting the scope the game could cover.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{development}} in 1987, it was conceived by designer and writer Shouzou Kaga: {{he wanted to}} combine the strategic elements of Famicom Wars with the characters and story of a role-playing video game. Keisuke Terasaki acted as director and Gunpei Yokoi produced, while the music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko. The scale of the game meant that the team needed to find ways around <b>memory</b> <b>storage</b> problems, and make compromises with the graphics and storyline. While initial sales and critical reception were lackluster, it later became popular, launching the Fire Emblem series. The game would later be credited with popularizing the tactical role-playing genre in general.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{supports}} downloadable tracks for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions; several free and for-cost downloadable songs and song packs {{are available on}} both the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store. In July 2008, Activision {{announced that it would}} release downloadable content for the Wii {{in the first quarter of}} 2008, but eventually was unable to do so because of limitations with the Wii's internal <b>memory</b> <b>storage,</b> an issue that was overcome in the sequel, Guitar Hero World Tour. When rock band Metallica released their album Death Magnetic on September 12, 2008, it was also made available as a downloadable song pack for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, Guitar Hero World Tour and the 2009 spin-off Guitar Hero Metallica. In addition, the compact disc soundtrack for the game offers a code used to redeem three exclusive playable tracks on the Xbox Live Marketplace.|$|E

5|$|The main {{creative}} {{force behind}} the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While {{this was not a}} new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large <b>memory</b> <b>storage</b> gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed {{to figure out how to}} shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.|$|E

40|$|When {{a set of}} {{patterns}} is stored in a distributed <b>memory,</b> any given <b>storage</b> location participates in the storage of many patterns.

25|$|In eyeblink {{conditioning}} in rabbits, nonsynaptic changes occurred {{throughout the}} dorsal hippocampus. This indicates that although excitability changes alone {{are not enough}} to explain <b>memory</b> <b>storage</b> processes, nonsynaptic plasticity might be a storage mechanism for phases of memory limited by time. Nonsynaptic changes influence other types of plasticity involved with memory. For example, a nonsynaptic change such as depolarization of the resting membrane potential resulting from conditional learning could cause synaptic plasticity in future learning.|$|E
25|$|The storage {{capacity}} of synaptic-based <b>memory</b> <b>storage</b> systems is very large, {{making it an}} attractive mechanism to study. There are approximately 104 synapses per neuron and 1011 neurons in the human brain. Nonsynaptic plasticity is often overlooked simply because its {{storage capacity}} is not as high. Regulating the density of ion channels in the axon and soma of a neuron would change the throughput and affect all of the synapses. Therefore, its storage capacity would be significantly {{less than that of}} synaptic plasticity.|$|E
