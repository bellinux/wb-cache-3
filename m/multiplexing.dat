5|$|George A. Campbell and Zobel {{worked on}} this problem of extracting a single {{sideband}} from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in <b>multiplexing</b> telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal {{at the far end}} of the transmission.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using <b>multiplexing</b> often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as having two major {{advantages}} over analogue radio broadcasting in that using MPEG-1 Audio Layer II lossy audio compression technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as <b>multiplexing</b> technology, allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E

25|$|By late 2009, <b>multiplexes</b> 2 and A used 64-QAM {{and were}} {{consequently}} {{more prone to}} poor reception, while the other <b>multiplexes</b> used 16-QAM. At switchover the transmission mode was changed from 16-QAM to 64-QAM on <b>Multiplex</b> 1 (PSB1), increasing the effective bandwidth of the <b>multiplex.</b> The switch to 64-QAM mode also provided extra bandwidth on <b>Multiplexes</b> C (COM5) and D (COM6).|$|R
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and <b>multiplexing</b> of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E
5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in telecommunications, lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division <b>multiplexing,</b> the technology that {{enables the use of}} multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E
5|$|Image filters. Image filter theory {{grew out}} of {{transmission}} line theory and the design proceeded {{in a similar manner}} to transmission line analysis. For the first time filters could be produced that had precisely controllable passbands and other parameters. These developments took place in the 1920s and filters produced to these designs were still in widespread use in the 1980s, only declining as the use of analogue telecommunications has declined. Their immediate application was the economically important development of frequency division <b>multiplexing</b> for use on intercity and international telephony lines.|$|E

50|$|As part of Emap's {{takeover}} of Scottish Radio Holdings, the firm {{gained control of}} Score Digital, the DAB <b>multiplex</b> operator owned by SRH. Competition guidelines required the merged firm to divest {{of one of the}} <b>multiplexes</b> obtained in this deal, and so the Ayr <b>multiplex</b> formerly run by Score was sold on to Arqiva. The remaining Score <b>multiplexes</b> have since been relabelled as Bauer <b>multiplexes.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division <b>multiplexing</b> (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division <b>multiplexing.</b> Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication is the {{transmission}} of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, images and sounds or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology. It is transmitted either electrically over physical media, such as cables, or via electromagnetic radiation. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of <b>multiplexing.</b> Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange, the term, telecommunications, is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.|$|E

40|$|We study {{localization}} {{properties of}} principal eigenvector (PEV) of <b>multiplex</b> networks. Starting with a <b>multiplex</b> network corresponding to a delocalized PEV, we rewire the network edges using an optimization technique {{such that the}} PEV of the rewired <b>multiplex</b> network becomes more localized. The framework allows us to scrutinize structural and spectral properties of the networks at various localization points during the rewiring process. We show that by rewiring only one layer of the <b>multiplex</b> network, we can achieve the PEV localization of the entire system. Our investigations reveal {{the sensitivity of the}} PEV to a single edge rewiring in the optimized <b>multiplex</b> network structure corresponding to the most localized PEV providing the deeper insight into the localization behavior of the <b>multiplex</b> networks. Furthermore, by constructing <b>multiplex</b> network using real-world social and biological data, we show that our simulation results for model <b>multiplex</b> network are in good agreement with the properties of these real-world <b>multiplex</b> network. The study is relevant to applications that require understanding of how perturbation propagates in <b>multiplex</b> networks. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
5|$|The {{satellite}} {{was also}} {{equipped with a}} data collection system (DCS) to collect information from remote, individually equipped ground stations and to relay the data to central acquisition stations. Due to the orbit of the satellite, data could be obtained at a minimum of every 12 hours. No data processing or signal <b>multiplexing</b> occurred on the satellite. The design of the DCS came from the Nimbus-3 platform, then known as the interrogation, recording, and location system (IRLS).|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of <b>multiplexing</b> uneconomic.|$|E
5|$|The BBC {{and other}} DAB {{broadcasters}} have been encouraging DAB take up by promoting {{a number of}} features which are either new or improve upon former technology in their sales literature. The benefit of DAB is that due {{to the use of}} <b>multiplexing</b> technology and encoding technology, broadcasters including the BBC and EMAP have been able to launch exclusive digital radio stations alongside their existing analogue radio stations. Broadcasters also state that DAB offers better reception, without the problems of interference that are more noticeable through analogue radio. DAB radios also come with features such as station lists, so listeners do not need to retune their receivers, as well as scrolling text, providing information such as breaking news, travel information or the latest track information.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} to create patterns in which two or more balls are caught in and/or thrown from one hand. These patterns are generally called <b>multiplex</b> patterns. <b>Multiplex</b> throws are given different names depending {{on the number of}} balls used, for example a two-ball throw would be called a duplex and a three-ball throw, a triplex, and so on. <b>Multiplex</b> throws are generally grouped into two categories, stacked <b>multiplex</b> and split <b>multiplex.</b>|$|R
25|$|In telecommunications, lambda {{indicates}} the wavelength in a wavelength-division <b>multiplexing</b> optical communications system. This {{is actually a}} form of the long-established concept of frequency-division <b>multiplexing.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} {{fundamental}} tradeoff between transmit diversity and spatial <b>multiplexing</b> gains in a MIMO system (Zheng and Tse, 2003). In particular, achieving high spatial <b>multiplexing</b> gains is of profound importance in modern wireless systems.|$|E
25|$|Spatial <b>multiplexing</b> {{requires}} MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial <b>multiplexing,</b> a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial <b>multiplexing</b> {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial <b>multiplexing</b> can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial <b>multiplexing</b> can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E
